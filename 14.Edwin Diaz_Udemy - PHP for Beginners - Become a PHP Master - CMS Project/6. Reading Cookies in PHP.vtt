00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.320
Hi welcome back on the last video we learn how to set a cookie for a user on this video.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.040
I want to show you how to read the cookie and how to do things based on that information.

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.840
So let's go ahead and open our co-editor.

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.220
All right.

5
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.720
And last time we had this file here and we said the name for the cookie the value some expiration date

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.560
that we need to set.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.490
We use a time function to do that in with this one which application we seconds here.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.510
This is a week if you wanted to do more times in advance you multiply this week.

9
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.010
All right.

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.370
Because we already had the week here.

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.890
So you can multiply times.

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.780
Let's say you won.

13
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.540
You want this to be in four weeks in a month from now.

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.650
Then you multiply this week times four.

15
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.310
And that would be seven times 428.

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.770
Right.

17
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.850
Or I don't know 365.

18
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.790
OK.

19
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.230
So I mean whatever number you want if you want two weeks you put two if you want four weeks.

20
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.680
Then you put four.

21
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.440
OK.

22
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.710
So I just wanted to show you that because last time I didn't go into details about that but it was it's

23
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.570
really easy to do.

24
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.990
But anyway I'm got to leave it like this and we're going to send it to fruition for one week that's

25
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.610
fine.

26
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.380
Now let's go ahead down here and read the data and it's do something depending on that data.

27
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.160
So we set a cookie to check for.

28
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.060
I don't know whatever visit or Right now it just says name right.

29
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.250
So what we want to do is we want to get this value and I told you that when we get this value this value

30
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.210
saved automatically in a super global call called Cookie.

31
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.270
So we're got to use that to get this information out.

32
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.070
OK.

33
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.500
Remember that cookie.

34
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.980
This one this super global here is going to be an associate is going to have the information in a associative

35
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.540
array.

36
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.170
All right.

37
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.470
So what we want to do is we want to find out first if this cookie was set if the user came to our Web

38
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.260
site and we found a cookie.

39
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.250
That's the first thing that we do so we do a check and we do that with an if statement.

40
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.830
And we are going to be doing that with another function called is set this function is going to find

41
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.740
out if this super global set is available we will set.

42
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.370
So we're going to say on this score.

43
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.180
And then cookie.

44
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.090
Right.

45
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.790
Right there.

46
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.800
Now remember what we want to check is that we don't want to just check to see any cookies available.

47
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.070
We want to check for specific cookie when to check for value.

48
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.970
You know this is an associate of a race so we need to check that associate of a rate value.

49
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.230
So the value of this associative array is some name.

50
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.950
So what we need to do is check for this value here because this is the value that we're setting the

51
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.160
name for the cookie.

52
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.100
So we want to make sure we want to find out if this cookie name is set if dispersement cons back and

53
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.230
we see this value here wow why are we going to do with application right.

54
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.430
So we're going to put brackets here and in single quotes or double quotes.

55
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.810
It's up to you basically as a matter of Akuzawa causes are a little better I like and better we can

56
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.340
do more things with APHC But anyway so we checking if if we said if this Cookie's said called so name

57
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.630
it.

58
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.250
This person comes back.

59
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.820
What are we going to do.

60
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.300
Well first things.

61
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.270
This is the way you do that you need to grab this value out of it.

62
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.400
All right so let's let's say let's call this one.

63
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.340
All right.

64
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.960
And we are going to get is Valuator assigning a variable.

65
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:39.460
Why not.

66
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.350
Right.

67
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.360
So that's the first thing that we got to do.

68
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.990
So that way we can work with it a little better instead of using this whole thing when we can use this

69
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.380
book.

70
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.700
Why.

71
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.320
Why would we want to use that.

72
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.210
It's too long.

73
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.520
Right let's set it to a small variable and then we can play around with that value.

74
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.750
So so now if this is set right then come back and we're going to set we're going to set them the value

75
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.960
of soan one of the cookie name to someone right here.

76
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.960
OK.

77
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:19.260
So if if it's not set then just so our page doesn't keep looking for a variable.

78
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.050
Right.

79
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.480
We're going to set this variable to nothing because it might blow up on us.

80
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.110
We don't want this to be an error.

81
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.790
Right.

82
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.910
So let's find out.

83
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:40.100
Now we said this and it's just like we're on on the screen just so you could see it someone.

84
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.970
So if I go back to

85
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.340
cookies I should be able to see something.

86
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.520
Let's go because it's going to detect these us so we're going to do something.

87
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.400
Let's go.

88
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.180
There we go.

89
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.530
Hundred So he's explained the value here.

90
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.100
All right.

91
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.850
So he's getting the value of the cookie and explain it to us right here.

92
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.830
All right.

93
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.370
So if for some reason we have another value for that we're we would do something else.

94
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.890
But right now so we are checking for the value we find the person we find the cookie that we set in

95
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.480
the personal computer right.

96
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.610
And then we apply that value the name we took the name of that cookie.

97
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.320
Right.

98
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.950
We took the name and then we are echoing the value of it with the name right.

99
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.080
Because it's not going to echo the name of the cookie is going to equal the value of the cookie because

100
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.450
their value is what counts is the value is what we going to be using to do other things with our application.

101
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.680
Now this is a very straightforward application of cookie.

102
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.610
Boy you get the general idea here.

103
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.510
We are detecting a user and doing something with that data that we receive and what we do most of the

104
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.290
time is personalize the user.

105
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.910
And now personally the user experience.

106
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.460
Now keep in mind that you are limited to the cookies or you can set all right you can.

107
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.950
You can now only this is only one cookie we can set multiple cookies.

108
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.980
All right every time you come back to our site we can have a different cookie onto your browser and

109
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.760
then we can do things depending on that value.

110
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.020
But anyways I want to thank you for you know looking at this lecture and hopefully you were able to

111
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.330
get some valuable information from this and know that this is very powerful information that you can

112
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.400
apply to your applications as you become a programmer.

113
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.980
You're going to you're going to encounter this type of functionality is out there and you've got to

114
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.790
be able to work with him just with this example here if you practice and you can get better and better

115
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.760
you can make up allocations that are very user friendly.

116
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.800
I want to thank you again and I see you on the next lecture
