00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,610
Look back back my students in this lecture here we are going to be having some fun with the box.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,800
Well that's the name of the section here.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,260
But anyway so let's have some fun with the bugs right now.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,940
One of the books that we have on the CMAs is if we have let's say for example we have a whole bunch

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:27,670
of pools like this and they are all in draft and apply them all in draft.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:36,360
When we go back we see that we have this pagination year we should have any pagination if we have some

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,220
we don't have any post right.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,790
So let's go and fetch this real quick.

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,450
All right so let's go to that step.

10
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,550
BHB that's a front page an array here where select all from pose.

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,000
We're going to actually write another statement here.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,010
We're going to add something.

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:06,610
So we're going to select all from polls where poll status equals what published.

14
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,470
We only one polls or publish we go save it.

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,630
Let's go back to it.

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,510
We refresh.

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,150
Now we don't have that navigation there.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,230
That's one problem.

19
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,840
All right.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,780
Another thing that we should actually have is some type of indication here that we don't have any posts

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,890
right.

22
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,550
So let's actually do that right now.

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,740
All right.

24
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:46,260
So right now this is all selecting if we have one polls let's go and see where or polls are showing

25
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,970
this Querrey right here.

26
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,850
And then we are displaying everything down here.

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,280
All right.

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,940
He's saying right now for status is publish Gray we will show everything else.

29
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,370
Let's put a statement right here

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,740
and let me just make sure that that's where it goes.

31
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,370
All right.

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,690
That's where they all stem and goes.

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:24,590
Let's just say no polls let's just put this for now and let's see what happens.

34
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,790
All right refresh of hoops we have a lot of them there.

35
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,900
All right that's because it's inside a loop.

36
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,610
So in order for us to fix this we're going to do have to do it a little differently.

37
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,650
So I'm going to commend zeed to all that.

38
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,630
Let me fix this a little bit.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,930
And what are we going to do is we've got the count right here.

40
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,490
So if the count is less than one we don't want to do anything.

41
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,100
That's the way we are going to be doing it right now.

42
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,690
So I'm just going to put a statement right here and we're going to say if count is less than one

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,770
we don't want to do anything we want to say ekal no polls

44
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,730
right here or else.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,820
Then we show everything else.

46
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,910
All right.

47
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,700
And

48
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,880
we don't even need this guy right here to be honest with you.

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,300
We don't need that.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,700
We don't need him anymore.

51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,610
We do need the window right here because this one closes

52
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,920
the else for this.

53
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:56,660
This is that right now looks like we're good to go.

54
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,900
Let's check it out safe.

55
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,740
Come back here.

56
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,540
There we go.

57
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,500
No pulse.

58
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,240
Let's go back to add me real quick and make sure that that works.

59
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,660
I'm going to make sure that they will publish come back to the home saying everything works perfect.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,740
All right so that work better than what we had last time.

61
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,960
All right we need to keep doing this to the other pages on this section having fun with the bugs.

62
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,470
We're going to keep fixing a making our see a mess a lot better than the way it is now.

63
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,400
But let's actually make sure that there's no polls here.

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:47,190
Looks a little better so let's do some H-1 And let's just say no polls vailable in this close and let's

65
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,980
put classing here.

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,390
And when I say tets center there we go.

67
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,630
Let's see how that looks.

68
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,980
Now refresh is called back here.

69
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,550
Let's do a draft.

70
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,070
There we go.

71
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,300
No polls available.

72
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,210
That looks a lot better right.

73
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,870
All right perfect.

74
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,530
So on this section having fun with the box.

75
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,860
I'll see you in the next lecture.

76
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,370
Take care
