1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,690
All right so we are displaying content based on condition here we send it I get requests here and there

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,730
you are for example like source

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,740
34 we get a different content right.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,260
We are on different content on the page.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,310
We know that already and we did it before.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,480
Now we are using a switch statement to do that.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,310
What I really want to do is create another page and include it based on that condition under your age.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,570
But let's go ahead and do that right now.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,190
Let's go to the admin folder images.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,850
That's fine.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,730
Let's go to let's make this a little smaller here so that we can control a little easier.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,770
This form actually is kind of big right here.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,890
All right.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,820
So let's go to the folder and this site includes going to right click and create a new file called add

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,670
pools that BHP the HB enter.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,080
All right.

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,640
And I'm just going to say hello here.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,500
So that way I know if this is working.

19
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:14,160
So let's go to the post-up BHB and the condition here would be post and we were going to include the

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,800
file.

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,210
Depending on the condition let's go into the exchange.

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,720
The path here and the filename Well the filename at postop BHB.

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,130
Let's go back here

24
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,540
to the first page.

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,990
Right.

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,740
And let's go ahead and type and get requests here that you are ill.

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,210
So we're going to say a source and they're all going to be source because that's the variable we got

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,400
in this site right.

29
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:58,360
The key source source and value would be ad post and you can see that we get different content right.

30
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,710
Pretty cool right.

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,160
So now we get we need a form to add the posts.

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,870
That's why we are and we intend to do.

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,750
Right.

34
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,280
So let's go to pause and lets out the form and I already have the form made and I'm just going to explain

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,810
every little detail about it.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,600
I don't want to take 20 minutes of your time writing doing this right for a simple form that you should

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,380
be able to make already.

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,780
All right.

39
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:31,530
So this is just a simple form here with some fields and going to save it and show you what it is.

40
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,080
We got a post-Idol feel plus category that later on we're going to be doing this dynamically from the

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,990
database for status.

42
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,070
We're going to bring all this information dynamically when we are added in this form.

43
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:51,210
But just know that some of this information is going to be dynamic is going to be coming in also.

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,070
So we also have input for file bloating in this case is going to be an image right.

45
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,390
Paul Staggs and Khant and we've got all of that now.

46
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,810
Let me show you the difference here.

47
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,790
This form is a little different than the rest of the form.

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,880
The rest all the forms that we have made and the difference is that we have a picture that we're going

49
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,900
to be uploading.

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,330
So for that we need a review called and type.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,870
Right.

52
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,020
And is that your view is going to be in charge of sending different form data.

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,080
And that's what is multipart for Shlash form and data is.

54
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,150
So make sure that you have this actually there and you can look it up if you want more information.

55
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,140
It should be on the BE THAT net and here are very simple what I what I what I got here is a diff inclosing

56
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,030
all the inputs with a label and all the inputs have a name actually you that we're going to be sending

57
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,720
to catch widow post-Super global.

58
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:47,820
Right.

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,980
They all have a different one.

60
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,450
Those are that is going to catch them in the form and send it in as we've done before.

61
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,450
This was going to have a different Super of code files and I'm going to show it to you right now as

62
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:00,950
a matter of fact.

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,050
Let's go ahead and catch that data up here make sure that is sent first.

64
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,080
So we're going to use this statement now.

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,880
Post a video if you want to copy this down.

66
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,830
All right take your time and do it is it.

67
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,070
Believe me and you're going to scroll down a little bit more so that way you can pause it whenever you

68
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,900
want and copy it down.

69
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:30,130
So if it's set well we need a tag first.

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,650
So let's do that.

71
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,630
Let's close it right here.

72
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:45,820
So if it's set to post and I'm using a different name here instead of submit I'm using create post.

73
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,650
Why.

74
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,090
Because I wanted to I really wanted to use

75
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,550
preference I think it's it's more descriptive.

76
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,490
So if it's set we create a pools right.

77
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,270
Well let's find out we get some data first right.

78
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,950
Let's echo something else first and let's just echo that title actually right here.

79
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,480
Let's go this out and see if we can get a going.

80
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,990
So it should be good let's say let's see it is refresh here and let's just put something in the title

81
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,780
hey it's admit it and then we get Polish post.

82
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,220
Actually I'm not submitting the term summit in December.

83
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,650
But you saw that is working.

84
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:50,020
All right I hear a Polish say that it is working.

85
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,770
All right.

86
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,840
So that's working now I'm going to copy and paste some values here.

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,580
Actually it's going to be something that you already know.

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,860
So you don't have to worry about it not knowing it.

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,160
And I'm going to explain it right now in case you forgot.

90
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,300
But should be able to be very familiar with this.

91
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,470
We are getting all the pull the values from the form right here on the right side and we are assigning

92
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,660
it to variables in the left.

93
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,640
And we've done this before.

94
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,070
All right.

95
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,880
So these values are going to be right here on the name attribute.

96
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,470
We're going to pick it up a signing here.

97
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,660
Now you might not see two things here.

98
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,450
First the files super global and the date.

99
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,620
So I'm going to explain them right now for the polls for this.

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,850
For the images.

101
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,090
All right.

102
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,230
We need the super global files.

103
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:46,030
And this is just going to have the name of image which is going to be in the input right here.

104
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,170
And then we have a name right here.

105
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,960
And for this we also have a temporary location.

106
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,340
I'm going to show you right now what a temporary location is.

107
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:04,020
Basically if you click here and you put it there this saves it in a temporary location in the server.

108
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,410
So when we submit the form we need to send it from this temporary location somewhere else.

109
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,190
Right so we need to tell it where to send it.

110
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,770
Right now it's not going to send anywhere unless we tell it to.

111
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,320
It's just going to give us the reference of the image.

112
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,660
Basically the name of the image and we don't want that name I want it to be somewhere in the in the

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,040
server.

114
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,150
Right so we're going to do that.

115
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,490
Also we're going to send it somewhere else with another function that I'm going to show you right now.

116
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:34,300
But before I do that I also want to show you that I'm sending the date in I did with a function so I'm

117
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,610
assigning a function to this variable here I'm sending that in in this form is going to have the day

118
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,860
the month in the year.

119
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,670
That's what these formant means to date.

120
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,170
All right the date function has this format and you can look it up on the net but this is the format

121
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,820
that we are signing it.

122
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,830
There are different forms that you can use.

123
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,550
Again you can look it up and find out what form is best for you.

124
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,560
And here in the post common count that we're going to be using it we're going to be used.

125
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,680
We're going to use this dynamically later on.

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,810
But right now I'm in court I'm hard coding this and getting it from the forum so I'm just assigning

127
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,210
this field of value in our database table.

128
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,870
As you can see we have a common count here and I'm just I don't want it to be empty so I'm putting it

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,020
in there for now.

130
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,270
OK.

131
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,130
Because I don't have it in the form right now.

132
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,620
We're going to be submitting that later.

133
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,170
We're going to be using that field later on.

134
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:32,800
All right.

135
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,920
So this coming count.

136
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,430
All right so everything here is good.

137
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,740
Let's do the function for the images.

138
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:49,580
So let's go ahead and do the functions call bloated file move or loader file.

139
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,910
See if I get it right and get it right I if we get a.

140
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,400
Yeah that's it.

141
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,860
And we're going to move it from our temp location

142
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,720
to.

143
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,960
And that's the second parameter and it's going to take two parameters.

144
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,370
So the location that we want and this is going to be outside of admin in the root directory in a folder

145
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,520
called images and that's where these two dots mean it's going to take me out of here and put it in and

146
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,890
in the images in the root directory.

147
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,050
I want it to be there because these are these are going to be false.

148
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,380
All right.

149
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,130
So that's what this is going to do.

150
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:27,740
All right.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,540
So first tell me this like this is just going to take that.

152
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,060
So right now we can test this real quick and let's go ahead and do that.

153
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,070
Let's test it see if it works.

154
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:46,610
If it doesn't get a problem we're going to put some dummy data here dummy data dummy data dummy data.

155
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,130
Now this is not going to go into our database.

156
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,270
Remember that we have not done that.

157
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:58,030
When I put this image there and we are going to click publish this check check it out let me go to my

158
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,550
Finder which you in this.

159
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:07,220
In your case it might be a what you call it desktop.

160
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,350
In your case maybe documents or something like that.

161
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,670
We are in the CMOS and we are in the images as you can see here we've got some images there.

162
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,180
All right.

163
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,940
So this image is this is the image that I use.

164
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:28,120
We put it in there and we can see adding action again if you want right here going to put that image

165
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,930
I just took it off.

166
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,660
I'm going to put another image there.

167
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,430
And that's where I am going to put it right here so you can see it.

168
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:46,840
And it may actually make a little smaller so you can see this in action real quick and I click it and

169
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,040
you see the image just transfer right there.

170
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,690
All right.

171
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,890
So that's why he does.

172
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,020
Now if this gives you a narrow no doubt you need to come here.

173
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,960
If you get a narrow here on the left side saying that the move overloaded function did not work.

174
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:07,110
The reason is because you need permission on this folder right here so right click on it and Windows

175
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:13,270
and Mac and you get to get in for here and you checked if you clicked double click here and you put

176
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,960
it reading right.

177
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,140
That's fine with Mac users for Windows you right click and you get properties and things have properties

178
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,270
you go to security and then change the permissions.

179
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,690
Right.

180
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,080
So for some reason if I'm wrong with windows look it up online but you should be able to change Owego

181
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,140
go to properties.

182
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,730
And then on properties you should go to security and then they are you should be able to edit that permission

183
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,020
and set it at 2 7 5 5 or 7 7 7.

184
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,260
That way these four there has full permission for the HP to put stuff in there right.

185
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,150
So no that.

186
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,750
All right.

187
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,400
Perfect.

188
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,080
Also know that you need to have at least double quoting here.

189
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,990
All right.

190
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,770
Anyway thank you so much for this.

191
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,590
We're watching this and we're going to continue this lecture on the next one is getting kind of long.

192
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,550
And take care
