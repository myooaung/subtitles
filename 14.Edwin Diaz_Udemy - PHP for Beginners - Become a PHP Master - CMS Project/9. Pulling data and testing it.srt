00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,700
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:09,470
So it's not for us to start pulling information out of our database so that way we can make sure and

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:15,010
verify that what we getting the information we're getting from the link in the email is the right information.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,820
But most of the right user.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,640
So let's start by creating a prepared statement.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,970
Real quick we know that we need an if statement OK just like we did in the last lectures and we are

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,810
going to create a variable here right away.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,610
Make sure that we put this there first connection parameter is a connection.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,060
Second would be a query.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,990
So let's make the query here you've got to learn about making a select query with prepared statements.

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,030
So let's pull out the user name.

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,820
Let's do the user email and let's do this.

13
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:09,410
From users where remember that we are going to get this value from day you are on top gain we using

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,760
question mark remember that.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,190
So let's create a couple more functions.

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,600
My rescue you lie as a.p and when I'm buying the parameters

17
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,510
we are going to get a string on that you are.

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,680
And of course you know what let's create a variable because we're not going to be dealing with getting

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,580
this and the you are out now.

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,080
So let's create a variable without value so that way we can test it out.

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,420
Let's go to the database and get that code that we have there.

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,500
For that specific user

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,170
space here

24
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,640
okay.

25
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,690
So that's where we got combined bind.

26
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,450
Remember that we are going to be buying

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,530
to this here to this question mark Okay.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,550
So the next thing to do would be to execute this code

29
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:35,840
than we want to fetch it.

30
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:43,890
Maybe we want to close this close statement when we are done with it.

31
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,370
Okay.

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,980
So fetch.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,040
Let's just close that a quick

34
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:03,540
So here this fetch function this function is going to actually you know what

35
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,470
we need another function here.

36
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:21,360
I almost forgot we need a we need to bind the results by bind results like this so that way we can pull

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,690
out the information from there and we're going to do it in order.

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,190
We got this column here so we want to put it down dollar value in a very cool user name.

39
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,820
We want to do the same thing with email and incenting with the code.

40
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,440
There we go.

41
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,480
This is make sure that we're well we're not sure if it works yet.

42
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,450
So we're going to call something from the database.

43
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,310
We know we're getting the username from the database right.

44
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,520
So let's check this out to see if it works.

45
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:04,180
It's so fingers OK preset BHP and it looks like it works.

46
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:15,970
So we're pulling that value of that column that it has a talking to that you're pulling out the is any

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,750
good.

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,880
It's working great.

49
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,150
OK.

50
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,380
So that's the first part.

51
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:44,150
Dan what I want to do is if let's compare some of this if let's say the get request from you or I'll.

52
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,890
It's not equal to the one we get from the database or

53
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,580
get email

54
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,260
is not equal to the one we get from the database.

55
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,540
Then we want to redirect to something we can actually fix this and make it better later.

56
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,650
I mean I'm pretty sure you can come up with some really good logic for it.

57
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,000
OK.

58
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,810
You can make a small bowl for them.

59
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,940
You have to have to pass bowlful it's going to have to pass for this to work OK.

60
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,010
Right now making it so.

61
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,660
Any color here does not match well.

62
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,800
The one we got from the database or the e-mails that match we redirect right away.

63
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,330
OK.

64
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,250
And I'm going to actually comment that out for now.

65
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,300
And we have to work on

66
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,450
the form fields.

67
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,440
We're going to have some form values here down when we click on it.

68
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,490
OK.

69
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,460
We need to make sure that in this form here has passwords.

70
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,310
OK.

71
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,870
So we need to make sure this passwords match just two values here match.

72
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:23,530
Before we do anything else and we also have to hash out the password because what we do what we are

73
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:31,150
going to be doing here is we are going to be hashing the password from this form so we can insert it

74
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,760
or update the field in a database.

75
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,470
OK.

76
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,420
Because we are going to be updating this field here.

77
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,520
OK.

78
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,070
That's what we're doing.

79
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,260
Well we got a hashed out first.

80
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,660
OK.

81
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,840
So we're going to start doing that the next lecture.

82
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,270
Guys thank you so much.
