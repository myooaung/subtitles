1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.260
All right so we got a table done here but we need to bring in some data to show it here to explain it

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.160
from our database from our table inside our database right.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:18.690
So let's go to had two brackets here and where we want to put what we've got to do is make Querrey of

4
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.700
course to bring that data there and we're going to be doing the Querrey right here.

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.860
As a matter of fact.

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.370
All right.

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.120
So we need to bring a couple more things actually in there.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.430
I believe we have all these fields.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.240
Let's check it out right here.

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.840
All right.

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610
So this is the data we've got to bring in.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
Let's go ahead and start making that Querrey for us and then we worry about what we've got to bring

13
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.180
in.

14
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.780
All right.

15
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.720
So first in that I'm going to take this TR out of here we are going to be doing this and Querrey.

16
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:59.440
But let's open a Ph.D. tag all right and bring it all the way down here.

17
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.610
That's fine.

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.450
Make a little bigger so you can see what I'm doing.

19
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.910
All right.

20
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:12.270
So let's go ahead and do a Querrey as a matter of fact we already have one.

21
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.560
Let's go ahead and pick one from.

22
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.290
While we.

23
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.590
Some of the files that we have been working with and it's the one from category's Let's take go actually

24
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.840
functions that's where we put everything there.

25
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.120
So let's take this.

26
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.280
Here they Querrey categories.

27
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.580
Take this out go back to post this Peyster right here.

28
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.790
That looks good.

29
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.500
So we're going to select all from where.

30
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.300
Let's make sure that we close that loop before we forget.

31
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.920
OK.

32
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:53.550
So select all from post-ride that's the name of our table inside a database right there.

33
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.080
All right.

34
00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.620
So we select everything and change the name of this like pose and this also Cheniere right here in the

35
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.250
loop.

36
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.950
It fits in.

37
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.020
We're going to bring some values here and they're going to be called something different.

38
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.930
False ID that's going to be the post ID.

39
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.390
I'm going to try to get some of it but when I'm not sure and you're going to look at it.

40
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.710
Right.

41
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.030
And the next is the post after

42
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.080
I think right here.

43
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.000
Yeah.

44
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.200
Make sure you change your eye when others would copy and pasting since this could take a long time.

45
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.630
Well not that long but it does take a little bit of time to type all this if you want to post it and

46
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.630
try to do it yourself.

47
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.590
You can post-Idol.

48
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.090
And I'm just going to do some copying and pasting now.

49
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.600
Actually we said this was going to be the post alter.

50
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.960
Sorry about that later.

51
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.010
All right.

52
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.640
So let's just copy and paste you real quick.

53
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.490
We've got two values there so we need is a couple more.

54
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.220
One two three four five six seven eight nine.

55
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.700
All right.

56
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.720
And let's bring this here.

57
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.700
That's fine.

58
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.890
All right so Post author the next one is title and I'm just going to change this first and then I'm

59
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:32.220
going to go to the the one category I the it's a column inside the database the table it's inside the

60
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.070
database too.

61
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.190
But this is called on the table because our database is going to get huge right.

62
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.950
And then the image false image.

63
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.330
Here we are bring in the tags.

64
00:03:48.330 --> 00:04:00.140
Here we are bringing in and Paul's comment count I believe and post date.

65
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.010
All right.

66
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.120
Choose me.

67
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.560
So let's go ahead and copy some of this.

68
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.450
I like to copy the whole thing right there.

69
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.110
Title post category.

70
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.920
Actually there are studies

71
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:31.520
I don't have to name are the same but I do it anyway because all we're doing is than thou value right.

72
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.660
And I got a little extra court right there there's.

73
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.520
All right old date.

74
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.910
All right perfect.

75
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:44.610
I think we're good.

76
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.620
Let's echo something out.

77
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.620
Let's check it out.

78
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.110
I see what we get.

79
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.160
All right let's see if this works.

80
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.700
And we have our thing right here let's go back and refresh and we're seeing the dates right there for

81
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.410
two post that we got in our database.

82
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.130
All right.

83
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:14.840
So the next thing is to because we are inside a T body there we need to echo there's all this in a row

84
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.620
and each of those rows are going to have right now we've got two posters that's going to be two rows

85
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.220
right.

86
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.830
So we're going to call a roll every time we have all these fields.

87
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.130
So that way because all this is included in one post.

88
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.990
So this would be all of this would be one row.

89
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:42.280
All of this would be one row two rows and we want our loop to keep reproducing the rule.

90
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.570
Every time he has all these data in sight.

91
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.970
All right.

92
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.980
So we're getting close.

93
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.190
All that data inside a row.

94
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.050
Every time he looks around is going to loop everything at the same time including the rolls.

95
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.440
So every time he goes around he creates one row with all this information in there and I keep that clear

96
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.420
and let's call some CDs this close in.

97
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.110
All right.

98
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.630
And let's just do a couple copy and paste there

99
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:27.030
one two three four five six seven two more I think it's the magic number.

100
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.850
Let's move this a little bit and let's get it done with this.

101
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.250
We also forgot to do this but I'll leave you to it.

102
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.270
So you can do that on your own.

103
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.450
All right.

104
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.470
Put brackets around their curly brackets right.

105
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.950
So they'll forget.

106
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:56.380
That's really good to distinguish a cold from the rest of the mouth and say they're post-Idol category

107
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.430
ID.

108
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.160
That is

109
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.860
for image.

110
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.960
We've got to do something with the image later on but let's get all these data here first because remember

111
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.510
what we are actually displaying right now is for the image as a reference.

112
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.100
We need to display that EMG here.

113
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:32.510
So we got the Palm post comment and let's call the post day or so.

114
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.550
All right.

115
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.680
So I think we're done with this right.

116
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.250
Whoops.

117
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.820
I call on expect the echo in line 64

118
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.930
right.

119
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.600
Why is it doing this.

120
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.430
Check it out.

121
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.750
We forgot to close all this with a semi-colon.

122
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.120
That was part of the copy and paste.

123
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.310
Hey you.

124
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.600
Let's do that.

125
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.570
Perfit we get some data from our table.

126
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.820
All right let's try to fix the image here and try to get it to this play.

127
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.520
Right now the image is being displayed from all the way up here.

128
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.320
Includes actually images.

129
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.260
It's in the root of the file.

130
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.510
All right so we get it we need to go twice.

131
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.510
Right.

132
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:36.860
We are in Asmund pools and we need to go back to the root and then the images.

133
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.370
So let's do that right here.

134
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:46.920
Let's create and I am geotag here I am g s r c.

135
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:57.590
That's the source and it's going to be images and the name of that image.

136
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.600
Well this is going to be the reference for the image right here.

137
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.850
So it's going to be Paul's name

138
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.310
and we need to close the image right there.

139
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.600
I think will do the trick.

140
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.720
You could put a note right here if you want

141
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.400
to see something image

142
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.430
right.

143
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.420
So right now we do it like this.

144
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.920
We just get a little image right here right.

145
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.600
All right.

146
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:46.970
Let's try to get it to work I think is two that's too big right.

147
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.590
We need to make it it's working but he's breaking everything there.

148
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.110
Let's see if we can use a class here to help this hour.

149
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.130
Let's see if this class will help.

150
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.720
It is a class called class.

151
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.040
I am very responsive I don't know if it's going to help this.

152
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.100
I am g responsive minor help.

153
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.030
Let's just use it and see if it works for us.

154
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.760
Let me just make sure that

155
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.310
let's take this out of here.

156
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.200
This is breaking all my code right here

157
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.270
almost making it this more I want you to see it.

158
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.230
So that's why I am

159
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.440
pulling this all the way down.

160
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:44.290
All right so with the I am right here.

161
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.490
See if it faces anything.

162
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:54.130
If something is making it smaller but we need to actually make a lot smaller than that we don't want

163
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.510
to play all this.

164
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.370
Dare I ask a lot of code.

165
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:06.700
Just making responses or when we are right now is just making it when you see that right now you can

166
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.670
take all that space.

167
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.660
But I don't want it to take all that space.

168
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:23.670
So I just kind of said it all with and just take it off and just do a with on the image of a hundred.

169
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.250
I think that with Will fits.

170
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.850
Let's see that.

171
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.390
I think that's a lot better than having nothing there right.

172
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.180
So we're going to be fixing this lead on.

We have another image here that we will be updating when we finish this crud.

174
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:45.040
But anyway we were able to get some data from that database here for our table inside our database and

175
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.190
we got this image actually playing nice with us now.

176
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:49.720
All right.

177
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:56.190
So anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture to continue doing the post page.

178
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.580
Take care
