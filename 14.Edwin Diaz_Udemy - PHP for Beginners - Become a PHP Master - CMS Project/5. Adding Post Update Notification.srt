1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,580
All righty then I hope you're having a great day.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm having an awesome day today and we're going to be a really cool feature to our posts edit page.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,290
So let's go to the to any polls that you have available at school click on it.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,910
And here we notice that every time we click Update we don't have anything that says that our post has

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,570
been updated.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,130
So what I want to do is right here a ball.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,720
I want to add something that says you know your post as being a day that you want to see a click here

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,930
and he will direct me to that.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,940
Add to that post or he will direct me to view other polls to read it.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,670
All right.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,680
So basically some tetes with some links here.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,530
All right.

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,600
So let's go ahead and do that.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,310
So the first thing that I want to do is to do that we've got to go to the ad admin for Slash includes

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,540
end it on the score post postop BHB.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,700
Just go to your edit post that page be page right now below the update quavery right here.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,320
All right.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:12,090
You see that we got all this out of the polls and then right below that of the Querrey after they confirm

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,030
function we're going to be adding that link is going to be something like this post of.

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,640
And I'm going to show you right now it is going to be a little more advance of course but I want to

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,830
show you the basic functionalities of it.

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,060
If I click update you can see that we have a test right here.

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,290
This post updated.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,910
Of course I misspelled that a little bit.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,440
But all right it's going to be really nice.

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,850
And then we want some callers here to actually let us know that gives a little more warning right.

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,200
That has been updated.

28
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,290
So let's go ahead and do that.

29
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:51,460
So let's create a paragraph right here and let's pool this stuff in there.

30
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,110
All right.

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:00,510
So this part of graph is going to say pull update it and put a dot there and then we're going to put

32
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,220
a link.

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,960
So let's put an H ref tag here an anchor tag.

34
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,730
And this one is going to say View polls

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,300
force polls updated view post.

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,380
All right so let's check that out.

37
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,280
See how that looks.

38
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,340
Update it and we can see that it says post updated.

39
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,350
And then if you want to see the polls we will see it.

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,990
But right now we click on it.

41
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,270
It just refreshes the page.

42
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,620
All right.

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,380
So we need to put that link there.

44
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,990
All right.

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:48,520
So the function idea that we need to do it here is a first thing is we need to take the user to post

46
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,370
BHB but we need to get out of here because Get out of this directory twice because we are includes all

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,910
we need to go to the root.

48
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,440
And that's how you go back.

49
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,250
And then we need to pass it in the ID because we want to go to this specific posts not to every polls.

50
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,950
Right.

51
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:15,270
So the idea would be so let's pass the parameter questionmark and then P underscore Id remember that

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:24,390
arrived and then it's going to be equal to what the polls ID and the polls ID that is going to be equal

53
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,240
to is this one right here.

54
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,890
That's the one in there you are.

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,840
All right.

56
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,400
So let's put some brackets right here and paste it and that's it.

57
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,210
That should be good to go in there.

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
Let's check it out.

59
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,840
All right.

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,070
And of the post now we got that and we click on it and we'll go to that specific post.

61
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,030
Perfect.

62
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,410
So it's working.

63
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,750
Let's go back to it.

64
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,880
All right.

65
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,210
Now I want to add some other something else because right now if I'm looking at all this it looks the

66
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:06,330
same like anybody could miss this right so I want to put like some colors are wrong here.

67
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,310
Big green or red color saying you know what.

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,100
Calling Attention So let's do that.

69
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,220
And I want to be using a class building class with this framework.

70
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,990
And one of the helper classes actually in this class is going to be called and there are many of them

71
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,940
but going to be just going to use this one B.G. hyphen said sess.

72
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,290
All right.

73
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,650
That's going to give me that nice green color.

74
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,280
And if I click up of the poster you can see now that we have this nice green color.

75
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,310
They're telling us that the post is being updated if you want to view it.

76
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,560
You can view it right here.

77
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,330
All right.

78
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,350
Perfect.

79
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,190
Let's go back to it.

80
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,210
All right.

81
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,850
Now I want to add something else I want to add another link.

82
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,350
Sane or do other polls or edit more polls.

83
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:13,650
All right so let's add the link in there and it's going to be right here in Khattak.

84
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,580
Ref is closing.

85
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,890
Let's just say View

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,310
other reports or edit.

87
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,860
Actually

88
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,300
just another link there polls.

89
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:33,670
All right.

90
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,690
Let's close in.

91
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:47,280
And we should put this one here before this before this one here right here.

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,710
All right.

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,430
So five of data right here we can see.

94
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,200
All right.

95
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,810
They said or all right let's just put something in between there.

96
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:06,900
So that way we can for you here.

97
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,800
All right.

98
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,870
Space and that's part of the link there.

99
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,420
I don't I don't want to make it part of the link.

100
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,520
I don't want these links to be met.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,940
You see the one that would be part of the link so I'm going to take that.

102
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,640
We're out of there.

103
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,020
All right.

104
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:35,340
So in closing that it's going to put it right here in the middle of the anchor tags of date.

105
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,160
And as you can see they are always right there.

106
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,560
All right.

107
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,750
We can pull more spaces if you want but I think it's clear on what I want to do.

108
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,850
So I want this to take me to this page right here to all the pool speech.

109
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,440
All right so that HSF is going to be easy right.

110
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,710
So polls that PH BE

111
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:06,510
RIGHT THING WITH ME REALLY good improvement there if you can see that we go.

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,380
All right.

113
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,470
So click on edit of the post post of data.

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,270
Let's see if this one works and more posts and we can see more polls here.

115
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,220
Let's go back of the polls view polls.

116
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,130
Perfect.

117
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,620
So we had some really cool functionality here to see amassing.

118
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,010
I think he's going to save us a lot of time when we are.

119
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,910
We want to see this instead of us going going crazy.

120
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:34,650
Right.

121
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,020
We say we all did this.

122
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,410
Let's go back to it.

123
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:48,350
Now he just took out the slogan again two or three.

124
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:48,960
All right.

125
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:58,600
So if I click here of date imagine if I have this link here I will have to go to this site myself.

126
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,420
Go there and then click on that specific post to go so he's saving us a lot of time right.

127
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,250
Perfect.

128
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,300
So I'm glad I was able to teach you this.

129
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,610
Keep going you're doing great.

130
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,440
Be grateful all the time.

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,790
All right.

132
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,850
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture
