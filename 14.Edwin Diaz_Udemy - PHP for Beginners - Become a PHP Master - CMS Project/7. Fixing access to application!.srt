00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,910
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,690
So I told you that we need to fix a couple of things and we are going to do that.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,570
First thing is that we need to fix is the access to our application.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,570
Right now if we go to our home site and we click on Nathman you know we are actually getting through.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,460
So that's not good.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,960
We need to fix this.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,390
All right.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,510
So let's go to a file manager.

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,440
Back back to a file manager.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm going to go to our folder of course or if you don't have a folder go to your admin.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,160
Then we go to our includes And then we go to go to our header because that's what we have the code to

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,200
control the access to admin.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,460
All right here's where we have this cold here and this is now working.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,100
All right.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,490
The reason is because we got these Olby start right here.

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,460
We need to put it right in the beginning here of everything.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,470
All right this is doubtful Bufferin we're going to turn that on manually.

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:01,290
So we're going to save it and if we go back to our site and refresh and try to go in there we can't

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:01,740
anymore.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,720
So we are this is working now.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,830
Now we need to take this off.

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,200
This is not very nice right.

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,650
And let me see if I remember where we're putting that we are putting out in the D-B.

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,590
So let's go back to the front.

25
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,830
I think it was in say includes.

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:29,120
I was in the middle to front a CMOS includes in the root directory NDB.

27
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,660
I think that's where we have that connected that we don't need anymore.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:42,560
So we going to just come here multiline comment close on here.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,310
We are a good saver refresh and we're good to go there.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,230
All right so now let's Logan a Logan with the same password user that I have in the beginning and we

31
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,110
have a problem.

32
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,060
They says call to identify function password verify.

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,690
And I'll tell you what that is.

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:12,780
This is because this hosting provider by default gave me a older version of BHB 5 and that's because

35
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,340
you need to go a lot of data so that timing any hosting provider you're going to have that problem.

36
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,890
So we're going to go to see panel because this is super cool.

37
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:30,600
All right on panel and we're going to go all the way down the way down to our software place our software

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,180
tab and we're going to go to select BHB version right here.

39
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,120
And as you can see I got 5.4 right.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,950
We need to make it five point five ladies.

41
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:49,410
All right we're not going to be playing around with this but just in case you need to have some more

42
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,440
options selected like PDL or anything like that you come here and select it.

43
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:54,830
All right.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,100
So basically you can turn on some of the features that you need in BHB find just going to leave it that

45
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,390
way it is because all I see is that password that function.

46
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,600
So we're going to save it and then we're going to come back here go back and refresh.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,940
And now we go to Rico one two and three enter he gives us that problem again.

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,770
All right let's go back pass or verify.

49
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,050
Should not give as a problem anymore.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:37,920
Beco 1 2 and 3 enter this password verify

51
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,590
this go to our here because this is actually password underscore verify and that's what I got here says

52
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,890
sent thing.

53
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,070
And this came after HP five point five.

54
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,640
All right.

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,380
So we still need the HP five point five to make this work.

56
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,160
For some reason he's now working maybe take some time to work.

57
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,430
So.

58
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,660
All right.

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm going to be actually looking into this a little more.

60
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,720
On the next lecture I'm going to tell you the solution because I don't want you to wait 20 minutes for

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,230
me to find out here.

62
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,210
So anyway.

63
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,090
It's probably one of these options here.

64
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,670
Right.

65
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,380
But if anything I'll let you know in a minute and I'll see you in the next lecture.

66
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,970
All right.

67
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,880
Take care.

68
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,600
Bye bye.
