1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,840
Or I saw in the last video we were able to echo some values from the user space.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,170
Right.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,090
So we came here and we click on edit.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,570
We send up for ometer via they you are able to get requests and we were able to catch it in a way right

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,530
here.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,470
Now the next step is to instead of echoing this we already know that that works.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,850
We are receiving the parameter we need to Eckl the field try here.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,280
We need to echo the first name last name user name and all these fields here.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,200
And then after that we need to update it.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,810
So the first thing is to pull this information out.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,230
So how are we going to do that.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,740
All right so lets think for a minute.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,430
If we click the end user then we get all this functionality here.

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,380
Well I don't want all these functionality right now and not going to user right now.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,870
I mean I wan it but Im not going to use it and we are not going to be using this either because this

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,660
is a copy from the add user page.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,040
This is inserting something into the database we don't want to insert We want an update.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:11,320
So right now what we need to do right here is instead of echoing this we need to turn this into a ID.

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,920
Right.

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,940
So were going to say the user ID or something like that.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,310
Right.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,640
So we would turn that on and we need to do a query here.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,520
So we need to go back to maybe another file that we have that a query like that for users and that would

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,080
be be all users have that file that we need that cold.

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,000
So cold right here.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,850
So let's grab some of this.

27
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:47,960
Let's go back to the end user page and it's going to go and use this one here as a user.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,600
All right.

29
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,140
I am going to copy all of that code right here.

30
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,260
Perfect.

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,500
We're going to modify this a little bit.

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,570
Make sure you close this while Stay blue right here.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,650
All right.

34
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,160
All right so if we get this if we get to any user We're going to be doing all this we're going to convert

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,990
the a user parameter into the user id variable.

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:18,420
And then we're going to say select from what users where user ID that's a column in the database equals

37
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,860
what the user id right here.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,900
Right.

39
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,490
Perfect.

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,660
All right we don't need to pull cords or anything around that since this is an integer.

41
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,450
Remember that.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,000
So select users query letters call it where used to name a little different from our user page and let's

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,740
put that here also.

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,470
All right.

45
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,900
And we're going to be pulling all these data out.

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,770
So now let's check all these data right.

47
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,140
Let's echo this and let's just echo the user name.

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,530
Let's see how that goes.

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,900
All right let's go here let's go to the view users and let's click here and then we see that we got

50
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,610
Rico there.

51
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,520
Perfect.

52
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,120
So it is working.

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,870
So now let's go ahead and echo this somewhere else.

54
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,460
Right.

55
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:17,410
Let's go to the fields where we have the first name and all that the form the form right here.

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,900
So what we need to do is actually fill in the value attribute here that this has by default is empty

57
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,520
by the full what we will going to fill it up with some BHB Reisen dynamic data.

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,110
So it's use value.

59
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,160
And if I can get this right that would be nice.

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,140
So this would be the first name.

61
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,040
So let's say first name that's a variable we have on top right remember that.

62
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,530
So let's go ahead and see if that works.

63
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:53,060
Let's go to view users again and it and we have all the fine variable first name.

64
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,810
All right.

65
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,280
Let's make sure we have the right.

66
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,890
Oh there we go.

67
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,320
We are misspelling there right.

68
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,660
So let's go to this and replace all that.

69
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,840
There we go.

70
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,600
Let's refresh.

71
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,640
And now we got Rico perfit.

72
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,110
All right.

73
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,930
So this is working.

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,220
We just got to remember how we name the variables on top.

75
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,810
All right.

76
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,180
So we're going to do something very similar for all of them for the last name.

77
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,810
I'm going to do this just copy the whole value thing to you and put it right here.

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:44,190
And you just made this a little smaller for me so I'm going to echo the last name here the last name.

79
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,740
Make sure you do the same.

80
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,250
All right.

81
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,830
I'm going to do this later.

82
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,770
Right now I want to worry about other things the value.

83
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,240
Let's go ahead and do that actually.

84
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,900
I is something else right here.

85
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,190
All right.

86
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,870
It's looking good.

87
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,390
Make sure that this is user name I think this one doesn't have a prefix issues user name.

88
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,650
That's it.

89
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,740
And the e-mail sort of user e-mail

90
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,730
and the password that's fine let's just call that password but we're going to be queen

91
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,920
just little dots because we have that type I you right here.

92
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,350
Right.

93
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:36,840
What else.

94
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,870
Let's let's check it out.

95
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,470
Let's check it out let's see what's going on.

96
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,450
All right so we got everything here.

97
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,870
Recall the e-mail even the password.

98
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,400
Perfect.

99
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,130
Right.

100
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,390
So now we need to work on this.

101
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,410
We need to ekal right.

102
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,050
If this user is a subscriber or admin then then we need to change.

103
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,920
Right we're going to do that in the next one since it requires a little bit of cold and I'm going to

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,850
show you how to do that right.

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,790
So perfect.

106
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,490
So we've done this and we come very far a few are here with me doing this lecture here.

107
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,930
Congratulations.

108
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,940
You are one of the few that actually finish what they start.

109
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,710
So again I see in the next lecture and thank you so much.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,370
Rabbi
