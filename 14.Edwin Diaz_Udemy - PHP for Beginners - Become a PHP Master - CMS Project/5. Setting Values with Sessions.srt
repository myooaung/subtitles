1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,200
All right so we have cover a lot of ground.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:10,080
We were able to validate so many information coming from the form putting inside where we are.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,910
Clean it up.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,820
I mean we did a lot of things right.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:21,110
If we go back to our CMOS year we are able to log in now type of the password he takes us to the admin.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,750
Now this is not good if when they come here we can tell who the user is.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,530
We need to be able to tell when we send when the user tries to log in we need to validate it using we

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,550
find it.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,480
But we need to send some information to admin and let let admin know what type of user is coming in.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,760
So if that means he's a user that is not a user that is active he were redirected back to a day in that

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,820
space for example or until they use it to register again or something like that.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,120
So we're going to be dealing with this information with sessions and if you remember session just very

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,370
similar to cookies.

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,700
But we keep that information on our server.

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,100
And if you don't remember what sessions are.

16
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:14,160
Go back to the sessions lecture and in the course before the CMS section here and learn how it works.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,590
All right.

18
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,900
I'm not going to go into detail since you already supposed to know that.

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,740
So what we want to do is tell you right now we're going to recap all this at the end.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,410
Don't worry when I finish this session is that if the users are able to log in and this is the else

21
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,590
statement here we're going to give the user to set the user set some sessions.

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,000
So before we we set sessions we need to turn it on first.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,410
All right.

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,290
So that's something that needs to be turned on before we use it.

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,280
So let's open it right here and we're going to use this BHB tags here.

26
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,380
Clean that up and use a function session start.

27
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,240
All right.

28
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,890
That's going to turn on the sessions.

29
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:06,510
We're going to tell our server to prepare that session for us get it ready so we can set it.

30
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,210
So let's set some values to that session.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,890
Now everything is going to be created for us with this session start but we need to set some values.

32
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,950
So when the user is able to log in and that's what he's saying right here in the else statement right

33
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,850
we find the user is the same.

34
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,900
What do we want to do.

35
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,690
Right now we are redirecting.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,730
I use it to admin while we want to do is we want to send it to admin but we also wanted to set some

37
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,660
sessions so that when we set sessions like this this is how we set them.

38
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,310
And I explained all that in the intersession lecture Right.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,050
So we're going to say we're going to set a session called user name

40
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,980
for this user name right here.

41
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,390
So basically this user name that we're bringing from the database we can assign it to a session called

42
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,300
the username.

43
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,290
So every time we want to access this username in the database we're going to have this value wherever

44
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,730
we pull it out from.

45
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:16,490
So if we say Eckl somewhere else and we have our sessions turned on we get to be able to get this value.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,460
All right.

47
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,360
So that's what we doing we are signing these variables value to this Session right here.

48
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,980
Remember that we have signed from the right to left.

49
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,700
So now we're going to do this a couple of times actually and we're going to actually try to get as much

50
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,410
data as possible to add me because we don't know the features that we're going to be having admin but

51
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,030
we want to be able to validate some of these information once we get to admen too.

52
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,610
All right.

53
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,770
So we wanted the user name.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,440
Why not get the first name too.

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,140
That way we can personalize admin and it will be right.

56
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,720
We can get the last name of the user

57
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,880
and if we can spell it right that would be nice.

58
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:06,230
And what else we have the user role there and getting all this from here.

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

60
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,350
And of course if I named and named a little bit different there.

61
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,300
All right.

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,530
So I think I got it right.

63
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,310
First Name Last Name.

64
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,890
Perfect.

65
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,320
All right.

66
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,050
And this just changed right here.

67
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,810
For this I'm not going to go crazy and type the same as this.

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,460
I'm just going to clean it up a little bit and call the last name first name and this one is going to

69
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,330
say user.

70
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,840
All right.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,420
So we're going to Sandal's this information to these sessions so we can pull it somewhere else.

72
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,920
All right.

73
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,050
So what we get to at once we get to add.

74
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,850
We're going to have all of this information there but we first need to turn it on.

75
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,460
All right.

76
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:02,910
So it has got to admin right now and I want to turn it on any wearing admen.

77
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,180
So I would do that by going to the admin Hetter because admin header is what has everything inside the

78
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,640
admin right.

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,500
We are we have admin Hetter all over right here so if you haven't done that already did that before.

80
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,090
Let's go ahead and let's start right here.

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,250
You're going to have this like this.

82
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,860
All right.

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,720
Make sure that you have the session start like this.

84
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,000
All right.

85
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,020
Started up like this.

86
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,870
And then then you can go ahead and use that value.

87
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,790
So now we go to admin right here.

88
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,230
There is nothing here.

89
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,350
If you want to bring some values here now that you have the session start now do you have a turn on.

90
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,600
Let's go to navigation.

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:56,570
I think a navigation we can set some values to actually go to the index of admin which is inside that

92
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,500
admin folder and it's echoes so stuff out here.

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:07,050
Let's say Welcome and let's just say let's open a BHB tag here.

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,060
Right.

95
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,250
And what we want to do is we want to echo that session.

96
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:24,270
All right so we're going to say session sessions here like this and use the user name.

97
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,720
All right.

98
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,340
Very simple as simple as this.

99
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,210
Look at this.

100
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,520
That's all we're doing.

101
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,900
So let's just grab this and just put it inside here instead of all there we're going to put it right

102
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,070
there.

103
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,200
And let's see how that looks.

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:45,510
Now let's go here let's go to the home site let's just say Rico.

105
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,740
One two three and submit as you can see here it already personalized it for me sending the Session right

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,950
here.

107
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,190
All right and this is how we're going to personalize this site here and how we are going to be checking

108
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,180
if the user is active or the user always admin or subscriber or anything like that.

109
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,850
This is how we're going to be doing all those things.

110
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,390
Right.

111
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,140
And adding some extra features of course later on.

112
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:17,330
But right now as you can see this is how we can set sessions and receivers somewhere else and personalize

113
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,670
our admin search area.

114
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,430
All right.

115
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,610
So anyway hopefully this lecture here show you a lot.

116
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,280
And if you are doing this Congratulations you're doing a really good job and you're learning really

117
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,910
good information that's going to help you personally and professionally.

118
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,720
Good job.

119
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,920
I see you in the next lecture.

120
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,460
You're doing really good.
