00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.840
All right welcome back guys.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.480
I'm here in the mph the version that I told you about I was going to find out what the problem was.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.970
And basically the problem was that we never set this BHB version of current all we did was save it here.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.110
And Weeting actually click on this so we need to click it.

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.620
Right now we are at the Korean version so now it should work.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.240
All right.

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:33.080
So again I never had to do that because I use my own servers and most of my projects I use when I have

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.040
small Prodgers to show you guys and and clients and things like that.

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.520
I use godaddy boards for my own stuff I use my own servers with virtual virtual servers we Almazan Web

10
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.020
services just to let you know.

11
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.510
Right.

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.450
But anyway let's go and test this out now.

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.950
I haven't tested it out yet.

14
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.890
It just came to my mind that that was the problem so 1 1 2 and 3 enter.

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.600
And as you can see we are now in the site of it.

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.910
So now let's log out and log out is working beautifully.

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.880
We try to go to admin not thing admin right.

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.400
Beautiful.

19
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.720
So let's go ahead and try some other things to see if we have any issues with anything else.

20
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.560
This is getting annoying right here let me just put this in the.

21
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.610
All right.

22
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.770
So we king adiposity walking out of pools here I'm going to add something and I take that off in a minute

23
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.020
or about that ad Tezz pools or something like that.

24
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.510
Rico Pollstar is publish javascript.

25
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.520
Let's see if we can get an image in there too.

26
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.380
And to run

27
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.980
them just good.

28
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.940
You know what my face covering there to see if it works.

29
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.860
It has a differing image.

30
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.100
So as I have mostly all the same images published Post says the post was created.

31
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.450
Let's go you will post and in fact it is created in let's go view it haha hole guys.

32
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.590
This is working beautifully.

33
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.360
All right.

34
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.050
So one of the best things that I'm going to actually create this course right here and I don't know

35
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.750
if I'm going to do it on the next lecture is actually create the ability the ability for e-mailing.

36
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.250
All right.

37
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.100
So you know why as a matter of fact besides fixing all the issues.

38
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.460
All right.

39
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.300
Because we may we might encounter some of the issues but that's fine.

40
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.400
Besides do kind of fixing all the issues.

41
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.630
We even got Azmin working.

42
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.700
Beautiful right.

43
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.240
But anyway besides fixing all the issues let's actually build a contact page right.

44
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.580
So you know what to do in the next lectures.

45
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.800
See you in the next one.

46
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.730
And keep it tight.

47
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.710
This is fun.

48
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.180
Let's get it done.
