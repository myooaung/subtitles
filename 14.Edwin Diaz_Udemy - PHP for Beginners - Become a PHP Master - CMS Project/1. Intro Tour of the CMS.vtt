00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.500
All right so this is the front of our CMS system the system that we will be build in by the way.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:06.840
Right.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.370
There is a lot of functionality here so I'm going to try to go as fast as I can without forgetting anything.

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.420
All right so I don't want to wish you time but this is you're going to enjoy this tour right here.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.290
I'm going to give a little tour and you won't enjoy.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.210
I'm pretty sure right here we'll build in some dynamic.

7
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.260
We will bring you some dynamic data on our database right here.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:33.210
These are categories and we have a registration page for the users when they want to log in go back

9
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.880
to it.

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.180
We have our admin there but I'm not going there right now because I want to leave that for Surprise

11
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.120
surprise for you.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.620
OK.

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.810
I think you don't like the administration area but here you can see that we have content.

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.770
Now they all look the same just because I don't want to you know spend all that time writing individual

15
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.250
polls for demonstration we're going to be doing that anyways.

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.750
So if I click on this is going to take me to a specific page and this page is different.

17
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.400
We see that we have more content here and we can actually write a comment.

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.910
Right.

19
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.130
So we can say hello from the computer.

20
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:28.300
Actually that would be this and this would be the computer guy and we can put this as e-mail.

21
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.300
This is just demonstration purposes only.

22
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.840
Right.

23
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.890
We can see that the message has been submitted and awaiting approval we have to approve it.

24
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.450
In the back.

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.000
Right.

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.980
And that message is going to be applied to this specific post right here.

27
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.610
Right let's go back to it.

28
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.070
So we see that.

29
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.850
And then another thing another cool feature is that every time you see that these polls right here they

30
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.590
all change.

31
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.890
Right.

32
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.630
So if I go back to the home page right here keep clicking on and they keep changing randomly.

33
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.400
That's a cool feature that I had in there.

34
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.550
I will show you how to do that.

35
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.380
If you want to do that but if you want to just keep your post in here in the front that we can do that

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.010
also.

37
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.410
All right.

38
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.720
So no that we have the title we have the name of the person that wrote this.

39
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.180
In this case was Guru.

40
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.730
Which is me.

41
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.550
The date the image song at surp contents meaning that we don't have the whole content here since it

42
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.940
would take too much space.

43
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.300
So we are truncating this.

44
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.420
And if you click read more and we take it to that page let's go back to it.

45
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.930
So we have all of them like this explain.

46
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.890
All right on the right hand side we have a search bar.

47
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.430
This is a search engine and I show you right now how it works.

48
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.600
Well you should know that since you use Google probably right click search and going to find all the

49
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.060
polls that are related.

50
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.680
These are clones by the way that's why they all have the same title there.

51
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.180
So he was able to find.

52
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.730
I don't think.

53
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.270
Let me see if I can find another one says javascript or something.

54
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.550
All right.

55
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.230
So he phones and Javascript pulls.

56
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.590
All right.

57
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.450
A lot of them as we have a lot of unknowns.

58
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.350
And then we have some we have the log in here.

59
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.620
I'm going to show you how that works in a minute.

60
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.040
But we can log in once we log out we can't log in again with I mean we can go in the administration

61
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.500
without logging in once we log out.

62
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.910
I'll show you that in a minute.

63
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.590
We have some categories that are being displayed dynamically for our database and you can see them.

64
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.430
You can see some of them here some more right here.

65
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.740
Recent polls of course we can limit how many recent polls we can put in here right now I have no limitations

66
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.030
so this is going to keep going all the way to the end if I don't put limitations here.

67
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.590
If I click on the title we're going to take me to that specific post again and I can write a comment

68
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.460
on it.

69
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.130
All right.

70
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.330
We have a restriction to show you that.

71
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.050
One other thing I want to show you if I click on right now you'll see right here it's going to.

72
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.890
We're going to have a link appear.

73
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.840
Click on it.

74
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.060
You see this edit that's to edit this specific post in the administration area and this is only for

75
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.200
logged in.

76
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.180
I mean history I mean is Schrader's.

77
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.260
This will not be displayed for regular users.

78
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.030
So let's go to the administration area.

79
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.060
As you can see here we have a really cool and really cool graph right.

80
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.430
So right here it says we have 16 polls one comment new users and five categories.

81
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.540
I want you to keep a very close attention to this numbers years here because we will change them.

82
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.290
We have some more details right here.

83
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.380
We have the same thing as polls right here 16 but we have seen giraffes meaning postings that are not

84
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.900
published yet to the public.

85
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.750
We have some pending users.

86
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.650
They're not granted access to our CMOS.

87
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.930
We have some pending comments and comments that need your approval.

88
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.530
All right.

89
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.200
So no that.

90
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.100
Now here we have him on the left side we have an obligation where we can navigate our ministry area.

91
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:10.440
Here we have just a button here that would take us to log out and the profile right and the profile

92
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.580
for this specific user and we show you that in a minute here this inbox is just a placeholder there.

93
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.170
All right so let's go to all polls.

94
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:30.680
All right so here we see this just delete some of this since these are all right let's just leave this

95
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.230
one to

96
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.800
that you can see how that works.

97
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.620
All right.

98
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.950
So here we can go ahead and clone this if we wanted to.

99
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.980
We also saw that we could believe that we can clone them make more content this clone this tool right

100
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.190
here.

101
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.540
So that way you can see

102
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.280
those cloning those specific Once you see that.

103
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.920
Right.

104
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.550
Right now we have it sending up to the newest polls.

105
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:15.690
Up first right here we can also view it view them like that we can edit them right here.

106
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:24.540
Now page and page again and right here we can go ahead and choose a different category publisher or

107
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:35.440
keeper and draft change or put some more keyword sports tags or numbers to change the image.

108
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.260
Let's put a different image on it and update it.

109
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:48.220
You can see the image change and we can view it or we can go back to it to added more polls.

110
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.620
Right.

111
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.470
We can also lead them right here individually.

112
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.860
All right.

113
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.210
We can delete the purple one.

114
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.790
We wanted to see that.

115
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.690
All right.

116
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.380
So now we're done with polls here and you could see that we can do everything in bulk we can add and

117
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.490
you one here would take us to adding a new post.

118
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.370
All right.

119
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:15.220
We can put the title here Polish category on the tax picture.

120
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:25.440
That's just through Joe's script to are we are already out of the picture and some content and then

121
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.920
we just click publish now and tell him the field is empty we also also want to show you how to

122
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.090
validate some of this.

123
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.910
All right so.

124
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.670
But anyway you get the idea.

125
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:44.300
All right so we were able to to still submit it but he was just telling us that that fuel was empty.

126
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:44.720
Right.

127
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.530
So let's just go ahead and overload a match to that.

128
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.600
Let's not leave in light of the polls.

129
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.990
There we go go back to it.

130
00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.490
Now we have a picture there right now of course this can be extended to a lot more features.

131
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.280
This is just scratching the surface.

132
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.350
That way you can actually learned how to build a really powerful CMA system in no time.

133
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.800
So we will check polls let's check categories.

134
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.910
You see we can build different categories here and just for demonstration purposes category.

135
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.570
Two hundred and we can see right here.

136
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.440
We can edit it.

137
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.320
We can click on it and you can see it right pop up right here and we can just edit it like it's done

138
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.240
for.

139
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.820
And you can see it and you're right there.

140
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.630
You can also delete it.

141
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.160
All right.

142
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.150
And you can delete Imbolc right here.

143
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.340
Pretty cool right.

144
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.200
Comments.

145
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.590
We have some comments here we can do a lot of things with comments.

146
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.520
We can delete them won't approve or approve them in bulk.

147
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.880
We can approve them automatically individually right here on approve or delete them.

148
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.890
We can go to that specific pose that this comment was made to.

149
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:04.650
So this is on a pool right now let's approve it and let's go to the polls to see it in action.

150
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.030
So let's click on it.

151
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.020
That's going to take us to the polls where I come in is and that's you can see that coming is right

152
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.450
here right below that common form.

153
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.600
All right we have more polls more comments that will be down here also.

154
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:20.650
All right.

155
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.550
So let's go to the men.

156
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:30.510
As you can see the number that we are to pay attention to change from 16 to 18 now and we have two draft

157
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.410
polls.

158
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.420
I'm going to go right now and see that draw polls draft right here.

159
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:42.720
I'm going to change it to publish.

160
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.050
Let's go to a dash war and we don't have no draft boards right here anymore.

161
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.550
All right.

162
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.350
So these data here and we have imposed these data changes dynamically.

163
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:59.160
Everything we do on our CMS system I think is pretty cool and we can go here and click on it and we

164
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.740
can go directly to that section there.

165
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.740
You can go to all the polls right here.

166
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.460
All right.

167
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.820
We can build it we can build this to infinity.

168
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.890
I mean it's just the amount of time that you're willing to spend with it.

169
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.340
Right.

170
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.980
But know that you will know how to do this.

171
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.120
Now this is actually personalizing this administration area to that specific use.

172
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.660
As you can see personalizing to me to Guru and right here also.

173
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.570
So this is all dynamic data.

174
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.060
This is not data that I put in here.

175
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:36.660
We actually know this is data that is being dynamic inputted from the database.

176
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.300
He already knows my user name.

177
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.380
I logged in here so he already knows who I am and he's dynamically explained some of this.

178
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.980
All right.

179
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.410
So we already saw categories we already saw comments that we can go to specific post.

180
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.950
There's going check on users.

181
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.970
Here we have a lot of options that we can use for users.

182
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:04.240
We even have an option of cloning some of the users if we wanted to clone them and we can make some

183
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.230
more users you see that.

184
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.820
Right.

185
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.240
And that feature I actually made it for myself so that way I don't have to keep writing content.

186
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.060
Right but I'm going to show you how to build that too.

187
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.720
We can delete some of this too.

188
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.940
So I can delete some of these guys here.

189
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.880
I don't want to delete any guru since I'm one of them.

190
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:23.820
By the way.

191
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.170
But anyway that just leads to and click on it.

192
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.150
They delete it.

193
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.070
You see that working actually.

194
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:38.720
Some of these are proof I pulled them here or in this pooled or whatever we want to do with them.

195
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.490
All right.

196
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.510
It's just a matter of preference.

197
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.640
They already approved so there's not going to go anywhere.

198
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:48.780
But if you deny them you can see that change right there change.

199
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.820
All right.

200
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.940
And we can edit them would click on it and you can edit them and you can change whatever information

201
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.440
you want.

202
00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.810
In this case I got this guy here.

203
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.020
But we know that as me.

204
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:09.060
So I'm just going to update that and update it and you can see that picture changed to my picture and

205
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.030
your users.

206
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.160
All right.

207
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:18.690
So we can add any user right here so we can overload another picture here

208
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.650
and we can say this.

209
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.860
I can.

210
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.330
Oh I had another one.

211
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.810
That doesn't make it the third actually.

212
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.950
Let's see Ruthven's

213
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.750
right here at CES.

214
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.640
Granted.

215
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.300
And let's just call this guy Robby No.

216
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:43.900
I don't know where I get them.

217
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.690
That last name from.

218
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.680
But it's we're right.

219
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.970
All right.

220
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:56.250
And it's just this and this random password submit this view the user and we can see that we have there

221
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.770
will be here with a picture of that first name.

222
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.040
All of that great stuff in here.

223
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:01.970
All right.

224
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:02.610
Perfect.

225
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:09.300
And we go to a dashboard we can see that we have more users now seven users.

226
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:09.660
All right.

227
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.920
So what else.

228
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.930
Profile.

229
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.760
Now this profile when you click on it you know automatically the text a user.

230
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.420
So the text in this is me actually this is the user that I'm going to be using to log in.

231
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:27.690
So I'm going to actually overload a new picture to the user which is me by the way I'm going to submit

232
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.830
it and you can see that it changed.

233
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.090
You can style this however you want if you are a web designer and know your stuff.

234
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.230
You can design this.

235
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.180
Keep in mind that this is responsive.

236
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:47.370
It's pretty cool because people from mobile devices can can serve this application.

237
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.470
All right.

238
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.030
All right.

239
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.570
So I think we are done with this.

240
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:57.060
Now the last thing to show you I believe is the last thing I might be missing a couple of features there

241
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.410
and I'm not going into details with all the features in the back since I'm going to I'm going to be

242
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.530
teaching you that in the lectures.

243
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.080
But you just know that there is a lot of things going on in the back.

244
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.680
OK.

245
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.200
So I'm just going to logo.

246
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.460
Going to take me to the home page.

247
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:15.310
And now if I click on that man you'll see that I can't log in anymore.

248
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:24.170
I mean I can access admin so I'm going to log in actually and say go through this my password for that's

249
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.930
my user name.

250
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.860
And then when I click submit and that's going to log me into that ministration area.

251
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.020
All right.

252
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:43.530
So if I make another user for example let's just go and let's just Bovino and then I'm just going to

253
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:52.420
give a password three digits will be no and this logo can log in again.

254
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.960
This is the registration area for new users if they want to register when they register they are going

255
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.130
to be approved or denied.

256
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.460
And we have to approve them manually by the way.

257
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.660
So I'm going to go to admin but I can't right now so I'm going to log in where there will be no user

258
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.470
will be no.

259
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.120
And then this more powers were submit.

260
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:16.280
And as you can see here this is personalized to me to that specific user.

261
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:22.060
Now we can personalize a lot more and give these user just a pause that he has read thing or the comments

262
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.010
that he has written sends this user right now his administration rights.

263
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.850
He's able to see everything that's going on on the sea a mess.

264
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:30.770
All right.

265
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.210
So anyway that's we can go you know for months designing this stuff here.

266
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:40.530
But I want to show you the most important information source possible so we're not going to go be going

267
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:46.690
into details about that in this one in this section here right now but we will be covering everything

268
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.080
that you see here and probably more.

269
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.900
All right.

270
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.660
So I'm just going to go because I don't like the Rubino user.

271
00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:01.090
But anyway I think you've seen enough with the CMOS system and I'm pretty sure that you are excited

272
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.630
and hopefully you are able to.

273
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:14.040
You know I know this is now very easy for newcomers but I mean if you take in and if you are here you've

274
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.770
probably taken some of lectures free before and you know that I make it really easy for you guys to

275
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:20.130
follow.

276
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:24.370
So if you need any help I'm here 24/7 to help you out.

277
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:30.800
So anyway thank you so much for watching this and allowing me to teach you this course.
