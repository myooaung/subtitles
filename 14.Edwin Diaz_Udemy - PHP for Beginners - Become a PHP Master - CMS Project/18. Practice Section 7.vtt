00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.150
I welcome back on this video.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.550
Here we are going to be practicing section number seven.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.290
All right.

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.110
So I'm glad you made it congratulations again.

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.720
You are really ready to war.

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.180
Right.

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.570
So here we're going to be in the practical lab 7. ph.

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.640
Now this section here is asking us to create a database.

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.380
Can you believe it.

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.730
We are actually going to create a database.

11
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.930
Now once we create a database we need to create a table right like the one from the lecture and we're

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.430
going to put some data and we need to connect to the database and read the data of course.

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.020
Ooh let's go ahead and see how we can do that actually.

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.340
Go ahead and you do it yourself first and then I'll walk you right through it right.

15
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.200
Don't be scared.

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.990
You can do it just watch the lecture or just create a very simple database with a very simple table.

17
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.620
And that's very simple put some data and let's just read it all right.

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.800
So go ahead and don't try to do it even if it takes you a day or two and then come back to this video

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.150
and see if our code matches.

20
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.020
Hopefully you were able to post the video.

21
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.740
All right if I just pause right now though unshy.

22
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.050
All right anyways so hopefully you pause the video and did it.

23
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.460
And if you have any issues don't worry everything's going to be clear now.

24
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.170
So let's go to our local whole speech be my ADD ME HOW ABOUT THAT Lokos BHP my admin.

25
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.610
And here we're going to create a little simple database databases create.

26
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.650
And well I want to call this my list.

27
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.810
Wow that's a crazy database name right create.

28
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.190
It's going to be right here.

29
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.190
I'm going to click on it.

30
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.150
Now we're going to create a table we're going to hold.

31
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.070
It's going to be called the reports.

32
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.040
That's a strange name to write on my list.

33
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.600
And reports is going to have three fields of fine go.

34
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.050
We're going to put the idea here and the first one and we're going to set it to 11 and make sure it's

35
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.920
autoincrement.

36
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.740
Make sure the primary is there.

37
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.190
All right.

38
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:21.660
We're done here right seconds going to be days of the week.

39
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.470
Shoot me and.

40
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.210
This one is going to be I don't know days.

41
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.390
This is going to be months.

42
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.760
Let's just make it simple let's just make it simple.

43
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:47.440
Let's not go and months and let's just make it simple why make your heart right.

44
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.190
So the week is fine.

45
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.150
I was fine with.

46
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.640
I don't know why I deleted it right there and months.

47
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.480
I don't know.

48
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.650
I just wanted to name something different and Varadkar let's just put here I don't know.

49
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.140
Thirty two characters is five months after it was fine.

50
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.060
I was just going to create something very simple and fast.

51
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.430
That way you can get some re-inforce information on it.

52
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.870
Let's just save it.

53
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.990
We are done now.

54
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.120
So let's go ahead and now that we're done with a database this person data into to insert and for the

55
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.220
ID going to live with the way it is since it's going to increment automatically for the days of the

56
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.050
week here.

57
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.840
I'm just going to put Monday.

58
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.730
Monday and months is going to be in January

59
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.090
and I'm just going in check this is going in certain data into here.

60
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:58.120
And these are the we're going to put Tuesday here and months February for robbery.

61
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.210
All right.

62
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.890
So take good here and just going to click go all right when it started to roll into the database.

63
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.550
Now let's go ahead and build that connect to the database so that way we can pull some data out of here.

64
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.230
Let's go ahead and put this I can could connect to the database right here if I wanted to.

65
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.060
All right so let's just go ahead and do that but I like to do it on top all the time so I'm not going

66
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.350
to break the cycle.

67
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.470
So let's go ahead and do that here.

68
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.120
And we've got functions make sure functions in header.

69
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.020
They're going to do in between here that's fine.

70
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.440
All right.

71
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.530
So when do is open it ph be tag creation space so how do we connect to the data.

72
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:55.410
What do you remember when we use we use a function called my Eskew ally underscore connect and we also

73
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.100
assign that to a variable but let's just do it this way so that where you can see my ass.

74
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.860
Q q ally on the score connect is going to give you that connection.

75
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.180
Now we need to pass it a couple of parameters right.

76
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.550
First we need to pass the server.

77
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.280
Right we are in the local hall.

78
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.060
So that's the location right here locals right there where we need to know let him know exactly where

79
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.850
he's getting all that information right.

80
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.120
Well we have a user name but actually rule.

81
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.790
We don't have a really custom made user name yet.

82
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.220
Then we don't have any password.

83
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:43.330
And the last parameter is the name of the database and the name of the database is my list my list I

84
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.000
think is right here my list.

85
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.500
All right let's check the connections here.

86
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.240
This is the most crucial part right here once you connect then things could be a lot easier.

87
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.570
So let's do an if statement in say here if all you're a matter of fact let's just let's use our scientists

88
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.430
to a variable called connection that where we can check the connection a lot better than just putting

89
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.630
all this in Dave's statement.

90
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.400
You know it's a lot better to handle that.

91
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.400
Let's just say if not connection

92
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.600
we do something right.

93
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.850
And we just got a call actually we're going to make everything stop executing and we're going to display

94
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:38.360
a message saying something like database connection failed and we are going to concatenate something.

95
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.130
This function my S Q L.

96
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:49.520
Ever since we gave a lot more information with it and we're going to pass it in the connection so that

97
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.230
way it says is that it says is it to see if it falls or if it's true.

98
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.220
And depending on that would give us an error and let us know a lot more information that just does die

99
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:16.160
here with his tests and else we're going to say great great we are connected we are connected and if

100
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.530
I'm going fast Remember this is just a reinforcement.

101
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.630
You should know this.

102
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.410
And if you don't just positive it can go back to your lecture and find find out how to do this but you

103
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:33.470
can watch meaning and you should be able to remember the stuff that we went over.

104
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.460
I know this is new information it could be a little hard but.

105
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.180
All right.

106
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.220
So let's open this in the browser.

107
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:46.210
Let's go back to our application let's just click and says we are connected.

108
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.170
So we are good to go with that.

109
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.410
All right.

110
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.710
Perfect.

111
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.210
So now I don't want to display that we are connected thing there.

112
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.250
I'm just going to take it off.

113
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.780
I just wanted to see that we are connected right.

114
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.470
I really want to have Dizzle there.

115
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.380
So now that we are connected Let's go ahead and make the Querrey and I'm just going to make the query

116
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.010
down here now really kind of make it up here that's fine.

117
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.960
Make it up here.

118
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.480
So the first thing that we need to make the query is the query.

119
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.320
Let's just make a query.

120
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.970
Remember that we need to make the query it's going to be all strings but we need to save it somewhere.

121
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:28.490
So I'd like to save it in a variable called query.

122
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:39.130
So let's do a s ul statement here is called select all which That's what this actually means.

123
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.780
All from where.

124
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:47.470
Why is it that we're selecting everything from the reports because we already connected to the database.

125
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.430
We don't need to do anything else with this.

126
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:55.390
So we want to see everything here because we are using that database and how we are connected to these

127
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.330
databases right here.

128
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.390
So we are using it.

129
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:04.020
So let's go ahead and see everything from reports.

130
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.710
All right.

131
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.150
So we're done with that.

132
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:16.560
And now let's go ahead and send this query to the database with my rescue command the code that just

133
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.280
let me just do this for us.

134
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:23.540
It's called my SU ally Querrey I believe.

135
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.440
Yes there we go.

136
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.610
Perfect.

137
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.900
And we're going to send it in with a connection because he needs to know how to connect.

138
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.900
And then the parameter is the query that we are sending.

139
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.510
And remember that we are assigning it.

140
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.420
We need to sign something else so that we can check on that connection.

141
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.410
Right.

142
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.410
Just like we would with this.

143
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.020
We can check.

144
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.330
Let's check on that Querrey.

145
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:52.820
And we are signing something like with salt and let's check the Querrey and see if we went through if

146
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.190
not resold then we went to see something

147
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.900
we can say something like die.

148
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.680
But in this case I want to actually find out use die.

149
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:11.310
That's fine.

150
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.030
It's the right way to do it.

151
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.110
Querrey failed him big right there.

152
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.380
All right so let's check it out.

153
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.290
Let's see if we made it.

154
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.900
Refresh Ooh.

155
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.510
Undefined cost and we saw dog.

156
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.860
Hey I forgot this.

157
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.940
Here we go.

158
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.230
This is refresh.

159
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.460
And we have no messages.

160
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.690
At that.

161
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.960
So we are good to go.

162
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.300
We are.

163
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.990
Good yeah.

164
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.130
So we connected.

165
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.090
Perfect.

166
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.660
All right.

167
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.150
So now that we have that we have this where are we sending this and we have this resort already here

168
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.220
because we are selecting everything from that table.

169
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.690
Let's go ahead and find a way to display right here on the content side.

170
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.550
All right.

171
00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.410
And how we are going to do that by using a while loop remember that.

172
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:10.690
So let's go ahead and open our BHB dogs and let's use a while loop right here and let's just say Wow.

173
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.260
OK.

174
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.330
So while something is true why is why is it going to be cool.

175
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.440
We're going and we need to use a function call my as well.

176
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:30.440
Everything is my ask you alive fetch and store source to bring the associative array instead of a regular

177
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:30.700
one.

178
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.030
I don't know if you remember that.

179
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.500
And we're going to pass it in the resoled from and where he is.

180
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.360
So true.

181
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:46.220
By the way we know that resaw is true and we need to use something like I don't know records record

182
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.900
year records.

183
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.710
We need to use a variable to handle this result here.

184
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:53.710
All right.

185
00:11:54.140 --> 00:12:03.700
So we are going to loop around all of the resource here with what we get back is an associate of Ray.

186
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:09.770
But we need to look through it and we're going to use this while loop to loop through it using this

187
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.350
function right here also.

188
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:19.210
So we're going to call these records or record that's fine record.

189
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.880
All right.

190
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.500
So how we are going to be doing this first.

191
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.630
Remember when we used to print our So we use a print are here and let's just check it out.

192
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.910
She can check it out.

193
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.360
The check check out.

194
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.880
They are social every check looks very refresh.

195
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.490
There we go.

196
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.780
That's how it looks.

197
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:48.890
So we've got an array here as an idea of one day of the week and then we have Monday months in January.

198
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.780
All right so the days of the week key has a value of money.

199
00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:01.820
As you can see right there and key months has a value of Gen3.

200
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.360
All right.

201
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:09.570
So and the other one has the value of February and the value of today.

202
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:16.550
So how can we just print out some of this stuff out instead of everything.

203
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.900
Have you thought about that.

204
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.850
I mean we right now we're just printing using print are of print all this.

205
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.770
We want to print out the months right the days in.

206
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:25.830
So how can we do that.

207
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.480
We used the key want to print out this we need to use the key to print out the value right.

208
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.130
If we want to equities we will use the key.

209
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.660
So let's just use this key right here right here.

210
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.870
It's used that way.

211
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:48.530
So record I'm just going to say that let's just echo this right here.

212
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:56.470
We're going to use Recker and the key that should give us what we need right.

213
00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.140
Let's make sure we push on because there is a stream value coming back.

214
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:08.690
Let's come back here refresh because we are echoing Monday and Tuesday.

215
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.640
Right because those are the days of the week that column has those values.

216
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.840
So we are this plane that you see that perfect.

217
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.910
So we are displaying all that information there.

218
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:23.470
Great.

219
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:30.620
So as you can see here we were able to create a connection to the database.

220
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.000
Right.

221
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.380
Very simple.

222
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.620
We even checked to hear if their connection was right and we even checked.

223
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.390
We did a query right here.

224
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.360
We send it in through the dysfunction.

225
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.590
You lie on the score Querrey we check back where we are right because that's the right way of doing

226
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:50.020
you wanted to make sure that you are connecting and you don't have any mistakes.

227
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.260
They hear we're using a while loop to look through those results.

228
00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:01.040
So hopefully the section here will reinforce what you learned in the chapter in the section and I see

229
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.270
you're the next one take here
