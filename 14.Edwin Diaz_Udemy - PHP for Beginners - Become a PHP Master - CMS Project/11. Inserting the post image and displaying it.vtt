00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.880
Or write so I think this is actually taking form.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:04.590
All right.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:13.500
So we already are displaying some content here dynamically titled alter the date we need to actually

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.680
display the image here.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.580
That's one of the things I told you we were going to do.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.150
And then after that we were going to be messing around with a sidebar.

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.310
But right now let's go ahead and go to our code somewhere here and the go to the end it's.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.790
Let's open this up a little bit.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.500
And let's go to actually working files right here and it's right here.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.030
All right.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.970
So we are in you as a matter of fact.

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.170
So what do we want to do here the way we insert images there right now we won't be able to insert images

13
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.160
on less.

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.440
Because think about it like this when the data comes into our polls you just refreshes.

15
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.230
All right.

16
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.620
Let's go to the structure.

17
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.820
See this is a software that organizes that database is just basically a software that organizes data.

18
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.690
All right.

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.390
So this is now actually taken in the image inside the database is actually providing a reference to

20
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.470
where the image is located.

21
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.700
We need another file to get the image in there to get that reference.

22
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.280
All right.

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.090
So I'm going to show you real quick how we do that.

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.610
All right so what we do what we need to do have in our database is a reference to where the image will

25
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.530
be located or the name of the image.

26
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.430
In this case.

27
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.260
So let's have the reference of the image.

28
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.900
So we have an image just for the day what we need to put an image there so that we can see it right

29
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:54.810
later on we will be doing that and the would be messing around with that in the in the admin section

30
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.070
right.

31
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.550
So let's just go ahead and let's go to my pictures.

32
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.670
Sigh Here are some pictures that I got here and this just copy one of these images here and I copy it

33
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.380
with my keyboard.

34
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:23.460
And that I'm just going to paste it in there in let's go to where we have our blog re opened this up

35
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:36.060
so to the images folder and here on the page the image and right get the name of the image copy into

36
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.050
my keyboard memory there and a computer memory with my keyboard.

37
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.080
And while we going to do here is we need to look for the image.

38
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.940
We are in the end it's up we would need to look for the image section.

39
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.320
Right so the image.

40
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.490
So let's go ahead and we are actually getting the image out of here right here.

41
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.810
This is going to be the reference that data is what we need to put the name of that this we need to

42
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.350
put the name of the image inside the data of the database.

43
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.150
So right now the image is being displayed here somewhere right here.

44
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.600
All right.

45
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.310
And we need to actually tell it to display it.

46
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.450
We are going in.

47
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.910
It's right here and we have all for the cool images.

48
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.840
So we have to do is actually put images and then the name of the image.

49
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.670
And this case is going to be

50
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.290
variable right here pulls image right.

51
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.910
So we're going to do some ph being here.

52
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.450
Always think that this area is going into that we're going to have to find a plug in for that but right

53
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:53.110
now we just concerned about writing this post image this very thing here.

54
00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.950
So we have the polls much we close the speech tag perfect make this monitor where you can see what where

55
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.500
what I just did what we did is put some ph By be tax between the images for Shlash.

56
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.620
You see that that's the name that would be the name of the file that is right here.

57
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.030
But we need to put the name of the file somewhere else.

58
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.370
All right.

59
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.400
So let's go back to it.

60
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.490
That's pretty neat right.

61
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.860
That's why I like this Ed..

62
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.390
I know.

63
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.070
So let's go to our database and let's pull that reference database right here.

64
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.710
Let's go to.

65
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.660
One of the fields actually one of the roles this is playing in the first one and here you see a mess.

66
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.590
And this has added in the post image of value.

67
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.180
There is a tets field which actually changes to something else.

68
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.300
But anyway name with image.

69
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.530
JP G.

70
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.050
Click.

71
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.490
Go.

72
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.770
And we should be able to see that refresh as you can see there.

73
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.290
Here is the image right there being display from our database.

74
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.310
Right of course we're not going to be doing this manually for every other project here.

75
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.050
And of course we're going to be able to do this from the administration area.

76
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.400
All right.

77
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.070
So anyways I want to show you how to do this video here.

78
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.480
Remember that we are you know just doing everything on the front end right now.

79
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.530
Later on we will be jumping into the admin area where we could do this from there which will be awesome.

80
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.270
But anyways thank you so much for watching this lecture here and I'll see you in the next one.

81
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.960
Take care.
