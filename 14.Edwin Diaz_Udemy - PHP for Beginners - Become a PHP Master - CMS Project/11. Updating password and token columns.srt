1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,680
Book on Welcome back my students so did you finish what I asked for you to do.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,990
Well I hope you did.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,270
If not it's OK.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,990
Let's see if they match.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,670
They don't match.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,440
Of course she is going to refresh.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,800
Let's just say one two three one two and three.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,520
Answer.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,810
And they match as you can see here.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,090
So we got a little validation there.

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,310
You can make it better by copying some of the registration page code that we have and plug in it right

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,880
here.

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,770
That's OK.

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,300
OK we can always include some more validation in the future.

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,960
But it's very important that you do.

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,110
So this is what I did and I asked for you to do this.

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,520
We are making sure that this both fields are equal from the form.

18
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,660
So what are we going to do here.

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,800
Well first of all we are going to be pulling out of this guy from the

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,050
form.

21
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,710
Right.

22
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,310
So let's create a variable and let's assign it to that.

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,140
And like actually let's go ahead and hash it.

24
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,030
We're going to be using the same function we have been using.

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,560
Let's pass the first parameter is the Bassel we want to hash and this constant here.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,040
And what else.

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,090
Let's pass a array of options and we're going to be passing in the cost.

28
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,450
And because the value would be 12 it's good.

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,090
OK.

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,870
Just going to take a little more time than for any hacker.

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,460
Remember that the higher the number is the more this function takes to hash it.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,320
So when you have an automatic software checking checking checking checking is going to take a lifetime

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,200
to try to hack into your code.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,970
OK.

35
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,200
So let's see

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,290
let's create an if statement here.

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,080
What variable was T and T and skew.

38
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,600
Actually this is a prepared statement about the connection and the query what are we going to do.

39
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:21,610
Well we are going to be updating the users table and we going to set the column talking to empty.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,680
OK.

41
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,530
Because remember that we don't want anything there.

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,120
We are updating the because where we don't.

43
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,610
Once we are done using that talking we don't want it anymore.

44
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,510
OK.

45
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,870
So we're going to be using it here.

46
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,180
OK when we come from when the user comes from the e-mail and that say now is no use to us and we are

47
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:03,170
just going to you know what I don't know why I'm using now using the

48
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,130
double quotes.

49
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,110
So so we're going to get the user password.

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,010
We're going to obey the field.

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,160
We're going to make sure

52
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,800
that our password is a hash password and we need to get this value here hash password

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,350
OK.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,690
Well there we go

55
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:59,850
where our e-mail user email was questionmark come back here.

56
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,450
And now we need to finish this let's make sure this is right of the users.

57
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:13,650
Set that column to empty them pulao the user then get the user password column and in clue this hash

58
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,650
password that we are getting here we are encrypting where user email equals that.

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,150
So we're getting that e-mail.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,650
Well great.

61
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,420
Remember that we're getting the e-mail OK right here.

62
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,280
When I get requests.

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:42,080
So right now we don't have that e-mail so we need to create that variable just to test things out.

64
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,160
And courting come

65
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,200
sounds about right.

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,850
She has me.

67
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,860
Now what are we going to do here.

68
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,750
You remember the function that we need to use.

69
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,310
What are you doing is it buying resold or buying program.

70
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,120
You got it.

71
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,600
If you said this one and then the second parameter What is it.

72
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,170
Well this is the question mark remember.

73
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,570
Is it going to be on into your a string What is it.

74
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,170
Right here

75
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,080
it's going to be a string.

76
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,770
Remember that.

77
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,640
Now of course we're going to get the e-mail.

78
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,140
We're going to be using that very well that we got upstairs.

79
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:49,930
The not offices up there she says I'm in a apartment building right now and that's what I say upstairs

80
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,450
because they make it a lot of noise upstairs and they're not letting me record because I've got to focus.

81
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,320
OK.

82
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,170
Let's execute this.

83
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:11,450
And if we're able to do something let's just use dysfunction my obscure lie as A.P. affect the role

84
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,070
should be somewhere here.

85
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,590
Let's pass this statement

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,940
and

87
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,930
Echo.

88
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:32,120
We need to compare this actually greater or equal than one or equal than one usually when it makes a

89
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,030
change is either 1 or 0.

90
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,390
So

91
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,330
I just tell you the way it is.

92
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,190
That's OK.

93
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,770
Bat Querrey

94
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,070
OK.

95
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,220
So what we should see is this being empty this column in the database being empty.

96
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,090
OK.

97
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,010
Right here which is not empty right now.

98
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,970
This is as you can see that there and this should be changed as well.

99
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,400
So be careful where we put in there because we won't be able to log in again if we don't put the right

100
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,760
password right.

101
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,830
So let's try this ongoing.

102
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,620
We had a pass where I think mine was one to three or something like that.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,340
So let's just say that is secret just plain secret reset.

104
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:58,310
He was affected so pay attention to that to see if it changes Amedee as the first three here.

105
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,810
And we got as you can see this is an MVS anymore so something was changed there for sure.

106
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,250
And we don't have that column here anymore so that is empty.
