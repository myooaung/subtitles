00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,840
Are right my dear students in this lecture here I'm going to show you how to prove this a little more.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,520
All right.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,610
So we're going to tell you on the last lecture that we were going to improve this part right here every

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,380
time we all day the changes to the full value of subscriber and that's because we have it set to the

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,820
fault.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,680
All right.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,830
So for example if I go to view all users and I click Edit and I select admin and all they use or it

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,910
does everything fine.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,680
But what if I do it again it goes back to subscribe.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:38,490
That's because we have a default value on the form and I'll show you right now that's a simple very

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,310
simple fix.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,130
But I want you to be aware of that just in case you see it somewhere else and you can fix it you see

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,740
right here we have a value of subscriber.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,900
This is a default value.

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:55,710
So you have to do is just copy this and paste it right here and right now what we are doing is that

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,440
we are actually setting the full value of the current user role.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,250
All right.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,210
So make sure that you do that safe and that's a simple fix again if you see this anywhere in the form

19
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,070
in the CMOS.

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,140
You can fix it you just want to show you a quick way you already know how to do that by the way.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,580
All right so I'm going to go back to all users at it.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:25,090
I'm going to change it to admin of the user of the user again of the user again of the user again we

23
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,300
are good to go.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,980
All right.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,450
Just wanted to show you how to do that let's try it again right here.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,510
Make this guy admen.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,470
There we go.

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,470
We don't have that problem anymore.

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,060
All right.

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,630
All right.

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,960
So we're good to go right.

32
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,950
Perfect.

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,610
So we can change subscribers right here to remember.

34
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,980
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture guys.

35
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,690
And I see you in the next one.

36
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,640
Take care.
