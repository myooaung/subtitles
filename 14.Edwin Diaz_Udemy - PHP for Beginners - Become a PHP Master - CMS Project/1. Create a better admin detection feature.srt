00:00:00,090  -->  00:00:05,520
What come back to the students in this lecture here we are going to be improving our CMAs even more

2

00:00:05,830  -->  00:00:10,500
what we're going to do is we're going to build a feature a handy function that is going to prevent certain

3

00:00:10,500  -->  00:00:16,680
users from accessing our users page or whatever other page we are having or application that is not

4

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:22,610
good for subscriber there is not Desta scratches was not supposed to be in there.

5

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:30,390
For example in their view all users page this page here should not be accessed by a subscriber like

6

00:00:30,390  -->  00:00:35,760
Santa see Santa or her name Maria or whatever her name is.

7

00:00:35,850  -->  00:00:36,960
She is a subscriber.

8

00:00:36,960  -->  00:00:40,920
She should not being here so we're going to build a really handy function is going to help you even

9

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:44,290
be more functional because it's going to show you how he's done.

10

00:00:44,340  -->  00:00:45,420
All right.

11

00:00:45,420  -->  00:00:49,770
All right so we're going to we're going to improve this as a lot more than what it is right now.

12

00:00:49,770  -->  00:00:55,680
I also want to build a feature where we are going to be checking to see the database if he has a duplicate

13

00:00:55,680  -->  00:01:00,630
of CRN username or you know or our name or something like that right.

14

00:01:00,670  -->  00:01:06,720
So because in real systems out there right we we can really have to user names with it.

15

00:01:06,740  -->  00:01:11,770
We can really have to user names with the same username so users with the same user name.

16

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:12,300
Right.

17

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:14,990
So we're going to build that feature in a later course.

18

00:01:14,990  -->  00:01:16,490
We're in the later lecture.

19

00:01:16,500  -->  00:01:17,060
All right.

20

00:01:17,280  -->  00:01:23,950
So let's go ahead and let's go to our editor real quick and here we do.

21

00:01:24,000  -->  00:01:26,880
We are using session.

22

00:01:27,120  -->  00:01:28,090
Let me show you right here.

23

00:01:28,090  -->  00:01:29,580
Log in this is where we do this.

24

00:01:29,580  -->  00:01:33,920
We are pulling out the value in a database.

25

00:01:33,930  -->  00:01:35,430
Let me show you real quick.

26

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:38,830
We're pulling this guy right here.

27

00:01:39,180  -->  00:01:43,920
They use a roll we put in this put in this value here in putting that value into a session this is how

28

00:01:43,920  -->  00:01:49,350
we do in our checking for admin kind of functionality but that's not a very good one.

29

00:01:49,380  -->  00:01:55,970
I think if we build a handy function that will allow us to check for it for the users and admin it would

30

00:01:55,970  -->  00:01:58,820
be better and more secure and just quicker.

31

00:01:58,930  -->  00:02:02,690
OK so let's do that now let's go to functions that BHP.

32

00:02:02,730  -->  00:02:03,360
All right.

33

00:02:03,570  -->  00:02:07,070
What we have are some of our functions when we're going to build a lot more functions.

34

00:02:07,080  -->  00:02:11,550
But this is a start of a new section of improving our CMOS.

35

00:02:11,550  -->  00:02:12,260
All right.

36

00:02:12,750  -->  00:02:17,780
So the first thing is let's create the function call is admin.

37

00:02:17,790  -->  00:02:19,550
I think this is a good name for it.

38

00:02:19,770  -->  00:02:26,580
What about if we can have a parameter here like let's say for example if we take the user name I think

39

00:02:26,590  -->  00:02:33,110
the user name the user is going to log in right here you see this value here.

40

00:02:33,110  -->  00:02:36,430
These sessions are available through our whole application right.

41

00:02:36,450  -->  00:02:42,160
So my associates use this value here to try to figure out the users and admin right.

42

00:02:42,450  -->  00:02:48,090
And later on we're going to build it now you might be wondering OK what if they use it if we have another

43

00:02:48,090  -->  00:02:51,600
user name basis a striver with the same name right.

44

00:02:51,600  -->  00:02:53,850
Well we're going to begin to fix that in the later lecture here.

45

00:02:53,850  -->  00:02:54,760
Like I told you.

46

00:02:54,810  -->  00:02:55,520
All right.

47

00:02:55,650  -->  00:03:02,210
So let's go here and let's just say we're going to take an argument using name argument here.

48

00:03:02,220  -->  00:03:05,210
Let's set this empty string as a default.

49

00:03:05,220  -->  00:03:06,450
Right.

50

00:03:06,530  -->  00:03:08,090
All right.

51

00:03:09,180  -->  00:03:13,190
So the first thing is we need to have a connection right.

52

00:03:13,200  -->  00:03:19,840
So we've got to pull that in from the global space and let's create a quavery real quick here.

53

00:03:20,250  -->  00:03:28,620
You're right so we're going to say I want you I want to select the user roll call them.

54

00:03:28,620  -->  00:03:32,850
All right we're going to we're not going to be querying the whole table we're just going to query this

55

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:36,710
column here from this table from users.

56

00:03:36,720  -->  00:03:37,690
All right.

57

00:03:38,010  -->  00:03:43,140
And we're going to say where a user name column is equal.

58

00:03:43,390  -->  00:03:47,160
We're going to put this in quotes because there's a string coming in right.

59

00:03:47,360  -->  00:03:48,480
It's a tÃªtes.

60

00:03:48,480  -->  00:03:50,440
So user name.

61

00:03:50,520  -->  00:03:51,320
There we go.

62

00:03:51,370  -->  00:03:56,100
Now what we've got to do is send this with my ass you are like Querrey this is something else that I

63

00:03:56,100  -->  00:04:02,490
want to also do we want to actually use another API ph be just to make our application a little bit

64

00:04:02,490  -->  00:04:03,120
more secure.

65

00:04:03,120  -->  00:04:07,090
We're going to do that in later lectures but I just wanted you guys to know that.

66

00:04:07,110  -->  00:04:07,680
All right.

67

00:04:07,710  -->  00:04:12,270
And for those of you that are looking for next course to take after this one I think the Logan system

68

00:04:13,040  -->  00:04:14,370
is a really good one.

69

00:04:14,450  -->  00:04:17,510
PH BE which I have available really good course.

70

00:04:17,510  -->  00:04:22,110
Just to make your knowledge a lot better in procedural.

71

00:04:22,110  -->  00:04:24,060
All right.

72

00:04:24,180  -->  00:04:36,210
So let's actually save this and let's make sure that we use our function confirm Querrey which I have

73

00:04:36,210  -->  00:04:40,630
above all these functions just to check that our result is good.

74

00:04:40,630  -->  00:04:42,620
Does it have any errors or Querrey.

75

00:04:42,930  -->  00:04:44,180
All right.

76

00:04:44,430  -->  00:04:50,810
We can actually make this a little bit tidy.

77

00:04:51,270  -->  00:05:01,850
Let's let's do my Eskew ally fetch array actually.

78

00:05:03,360  -->  00:05:13,140
And we're going to fetch our table we are resoled of course and we are going to see that here in this

79

00:05:13,140  -->  00:05:13,710
variable.

80

00:05:13,710  -->  00:05:16,920
So we're going to save all that data rate and is variable there.

81

00:05:16,950  -->  00:05:20,500
So let's do a check real quick let's just say if the ROE.

82

00:05:20,880  -->  00:05:26,750
And of course we have the table name right here to the table column user role.

83

00:05:26,790  -->  00:05:33,590
So if this user role is equal to admin which should be equal to I mean right.

84

00:05:34,110  -->  00:05:41,100
If the user name is an admin if the user always an admin or if not then we do something else but we

85

00:05:41,100  -->  00:05:42,650
can't return true.

86

00:05:42,660  -->  00:05:44,110
All right.

87

00:05:44,640  -->  00:05:48,930
Then else we are going to be returning false.

88

00:05:48,930  -->  00:05:50,370
You got it.

89

00:05:50,370  -->  00:05:51,500
Good job.

90

00:05:51,510  -->  00:05:51,870
All right.

91

00:05:51,870  -->  00:05:54,780
So I think we're done with this function this looks pretty good.

92

00:05:55,320  -->  00:05:57,700
If we have some type of error we'll fix it.

93

00:05:57,720  -->  00:05:58,120
All right.

94

00:05:58,170  -->  00:06:01,070
Not going to check it right now.

95

00:06:01,080  -->  00:06:03,200
Let's actually go to users.

96

00:06:03,210  -->  00:06:08,260
This is where this is the page where we don't one regular users to be on.

97

00:06:08,310  -->  00:06:09,260
Right.

98

00:06:09,270  -->  00:06:10,870
We might change this in the future.

99

00:06:10,890  -->  00:06:12,640
Might change is cold to make it better.

100

00:06:12,660  -->  00:06:16,850
But right now let's just go to the top.

101

00:06:16,900  -->  00:06:18,790
This is what we're going to have it.

102

00:06:20,220  -->  00:06:28,510
And this just opened up BHB tag real quick here and we're just going to say if because we're returning

103

00:06:28,510  -->  00:06:35,520
to a force from this function we can say if it's admen if it's not it is admin with exclamation in front

104

00:06:35,520  -->  00:06:38,610
of it and we've got to take this from the session.

105

00:06:38,610  -->  00:06:43,040
Remember that we have user name available throughout the whole application.

106

00:06:43,080  -->  00:06:43,640
All right.

107

00:06:43,640  -->  00:06:50,280
If if the user name if this user name is admin around these users not an admin I want you to do something

108

00:06:50,280  -->  00:06:57,780
for me and this something would be Hetter of course would be to get this user out of here.

109

00:06:57,900  -->  00:07:02,310
We should be a function for this like a redirect function.

110

00:07:02,730  -->  00:07:04,920
And it's step BHB.

111

00:07:04,920  -->  00:07:05,280
All right.

112

00:07:05,310  -->  00:07:07,270
So this is what we're going to be doing right.

113

00:07:07,350  -->  00:07:09,260
Super simple.

114

00:07:09,990  -->  00:07:14,330
We can probably do this in one line I'll show you later on.

115

00:07:14,340  -->  00:07:17,390
But let's let's check this out real quick.

116

00:07:17,490  -->  00:07:22,710
So we are this is Santa Santa Maria.

117

00:07:22,890  -->  00:07:30,300
She is a subscriber we refresh this is going to redirector to and it's because she's not allowed there

118

00:07:30,300  -->  00:07:30,760
anymore.

119

00:07:30,770  -->  00:07:33,220
Now I'm going to log out.

120

00:07:33,720  -->  00:07:34,680
All right.

121

00:07:34,680  -->  00:07:38,220
We've got all right low now here this Sunday I got a fix here.

122

00:07:38,220  -->  00:07:46,990
You might now have this Arab What I do log out and log out that BHB make sure that you have your orbi

123

00:07:47,040  -->  00:07:54,910
start right here because we are not including any Fouchier that have the orbi star in the admin header

124

00:07:54,930  -->  00:07:57,540
has all the star but we're not.

125

00:07:57,700  -->  00:07:58,230
All right.

126

00:07:58,320  -->  00:08:07,630
And these D-B that BHP should have a all star on top as well right here.

127

00:08:09,150  -->  00:08:11,710
All right.

128

00:08:13,710  -->  00:08:18,880
See this is just because logging is the only follower that has this.

129

00:08:19,020  -->  00:08:24,480
But anyway we'll make this a little bit more tidy for later on.

130

00:08:24,480  -->  00:08:24,990
There we go.

131

00:08:24,990  -->  00:08:26,500
So let's actually.

132

00:08:26,760  -->  00:08:31,710
Well right now we don't have anybody logged in.

133

00:08:31,710  -->  00:08:32,400
All right.

134

00:08:32,610  -->  00:08:36,680
So let's log in Rico which is an admin enter.

135

00:08:36,720  -->  00:08:37,480
There we go.

136

00:08:37,500  -->  00:08:38,730
Rigaud is low again.

137

00:08:38,760  -->  00:08:42,930
And if we go to users where we go we are able to access users.

138

00:08:42,960  -->  00:08:44,230
Pretty cool stuff right.

139

00:08:44,470  -->  00:08:47,120
We were even able to add users.

140

00:08:47,180  -->  00:08:47,610
All right.

141

00:08:47,610  -->  00:08:48,380
Cool.

142

00:08:48,390  -->  00:08:48,960
Great job.

143

00:08:48,960  -->  00:08:50,280
If you were to follow me.

144

00:08:50,460  -->  00:08:51,220

Let's jump into the next improvement on the next lectures.

00:08:53,790  -->  00:08:54,530
Right.

00:08:54,630  -->  00:08:56,880
If you don't see the next lecture just give me a moment.

00:08:56,880  -->  00:08:57,330
All right.

Thank you so much and I'll see you then.
