1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,530
Go right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:07,380
So going from the future again teaching you some more stuff about BHP.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:07,840
Right.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,740
But anyway on this lecture we're going to be learning how to actually write to the file.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,510
We already know how to open the file and we don't have is going to create it.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,300
But now it's time for us to put some of the information in there right.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,520
So let's go and let's do it.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:31,320
So I'm going to grab the opening files one file and I'm going to actually rename it to Aceves and say

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,410
writing files safe.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,820
All right so we're going to have the same file here.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,510
And remember when I told you this was a handle here.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,480
Well let's use it.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,050
All right.

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,530
So what I'm going to do is we're going to say give

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,550
and I'm going to put all this in there.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,860
And I take that semi calling out there.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,700
All right.

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,470
And then you say else

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,270
first of all we'll close this right here and then we can say something like.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,740
We're not

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,470
could not see something like this.

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:47,390
Fall was not OK or the application of Education was not able to write on the file.

23
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,420
Something like that.

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,270
All right.

25
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,130
Which is why I wanted to teach you how to handle this information coming back.

26
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,760
All right.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,360
So what we want to do is actually before we want it actually write to the file so we're going to use

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,020
another function call f right and it's going to take two parameters.

29
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,120
First the follow that he needs to access and what he needs to write.

30
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,620
In this case we're going to be writing like I don't know.

31
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,890
I love BHP.

32
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,850
And this is really really good stuff.

33
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,970
Something like this.

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,690
Make sure you use your semi-colons right.

35
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,240
Don't use me.

36
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,300
So let's save it and now let's run it.

37
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,130
So I'm going to go here and you're going to see there.

38
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:45,330
Let's just refresh here.

39
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,110
I wasn't able to run it to.

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,600
Actually we have to come to the demo right here and there we go.

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,320
And as you can see I love BHP and this is really good stuff.

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,610
So it was able to write to the file pretty cool right.

43
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:12,380
Let's go here and let's just put this one to your saved and let's come back and refresh.

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,150
Let's open this up a little bit.

45
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,440
I'm going to do and another side or I refresh.

46
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,120
And as you can see it will actually rewrite everything again.

47
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,870
Right.

48
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,340
So this is how you write two files in PHC.

49
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,480
And this is how you handle that information coming back with an if statement.

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,950
All right.

51
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,260
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

52
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,080
Hope you're having a lot of fun and I'll see you in the next one.

53
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,860
Take care.
