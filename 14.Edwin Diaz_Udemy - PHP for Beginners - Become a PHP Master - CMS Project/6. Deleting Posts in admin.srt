1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,570
All right so in the last lecture we already were able to input stuff to our database.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,490
Right.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,180
So now let's go to the polls and view all polls and we are able to see right here as you can see.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:22,320
Now what I want to do on this video here is to include a link on the right hand side here to be able

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,110
to delete some of these information.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,880
All right so first let's go ahead and make this available here on this link since it's not working right

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,490
now.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:44,070
So let's go to the navigation and inside our includes in the admin area navigation and let's add it

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,100
right here.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,550
So let's say What is the link here to go to that post.

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,420
We actually need to send a request.

12
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:07,620
So Ed it actually the name of the polls right and request would be source

13
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,750
was at post right.

14
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,380
So let's go ahead and check that out.

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,780
Let's check that out.

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,990
Whoops.

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,950
All right.

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,720
Come here and we say actually yes that's fine.

19
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,840
Post Oops we did this the wrong way we need to.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,290
HP of course.

21
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,820
I hear from the HP we go.

22
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,150
I was I thinking.

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,770
Well.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,660
Or what was not.

25
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:52,410
Well all right whatever it is that pulls right there as you can see we get that.

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,100
All right.

27
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,880
Available to us right.

28
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,020
I got a stumble there a little bit.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,430
So on this one here let's at the end it

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,170
actually is not going to be and it's going to be leaked.

31
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:14,670
We wanted at least some data so we need to go to our post right here.

32
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,910
All right.

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,100
So where are we going to be making that request.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,810
Well let's go from the top to the bottom right.

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,620
Let's make that request on the same page right here.

36
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,330
And what I want to do is I want to check if something is set

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,590
on going to do something right.

38
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,290
So as a matter of fact it's not even here.

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,230
Sorry.

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,100
It's we need to go to view all polls.

41
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,630
This is where we are right here.

42
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,530
Silly me you post.

43
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,600
Go and this is where we're going to be catching that data.

44
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,680
Great.

45
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,360
We don't want to have much information in the post section right here.

46
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,490
This is just going to do some of the switchin for us in that set.

47
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,750
As a matter of fact we could make another file called delete and have them follow the lead but we are

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,980
not going to do that.

49
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,290
So let's do it right here somewhere.

50
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,990
I'm just trying to decide where we have to select polls.

51
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,970
Let's do it down here somewhere.

52
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,710
At the end of the table where we keep our code separate.

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,020
Right.

54
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,070
How about that.

55
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,600
So the HP tax and let's check for a submission here.

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,990
So if this set

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:47,490
right if this is set and what we're checking is for a get super global right I get requests and we're

58
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,490
going to call this the lead.

59
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,090
And we haven't made this yet but we will right now this check for that.

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:02,990
First let's include a link right here the end of this and this link is going to say the least and I

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,710
show you the link in a minute there.

62
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,230
All right.

63
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,850
So the link is going to be right here.

64
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,740
A sheriff.

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,870
Let's close it let's open it right here closer there.

66
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,290
Right.

67
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,860
And this is just going to say the least

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:39,310
and if we go to our usual page we can see the link right here.

69
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,290
That's going to delete any of these polls right here.

70
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,700
All right.

71
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,380
And we need to delete this stuff here.

72
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,980
But we'll do that later.

73
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,010
Right now let's concentrate on this.

74
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,150
All right.

75
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,380
So

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,140
all right so we've got the lead.

77
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,730
Let's send it some information.

78
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,710
So we're going to send it to the same page.

79
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,940
View all polls

80
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,310
up here.

81
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,130
And we're going to send it in

82
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,380
some information and the information will be delete

83
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,970
lead if I can get it right.

84
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,690
That would be nice.

85
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,120
Delete equals what.

86
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,960
What do we want to this to equal the post ID right here.

87
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,540
Of course we go and we can close it in this if we wanted to.

88
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,940
All right.

89
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,460
So let's go to it now and check it out.

90
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:56,490
We clicked this is going to take us to another post because silly me forgot that this is going to be

91
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,340
here.

92
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,400
We're sending it to your post instead sending it to post-up.

93
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,110
All right here we go.

94
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,350
Cliggott perfect.

95
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,260
We got this delete one there.

96
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,580
So we're going to delete one.

97
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,470
We're going to lead to.

98
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,660
We're going to delete three.

99
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,060
Right.

100
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,630
All right.

101
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,910
So let's make the Querrey for it now that we are catching it right here let's just say something for

102
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,470
it right here just to check it.

103
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,200
Hello

104
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,570
click it and we get it we see the halo right here in the bottom.

105
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,540
All right.

106
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,730
So that's working.

107
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,940
And what do we want to do.

108
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:45,560
Well the first thing that we need to do is convert this into the what what is this what is this coming.

109
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,370
This is the lead.

110
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,000
Right.

111
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,640
So we just say posts I suppose Id right here as a matter of fact.

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:04,620
But we can just call it use to differentiate from the top post ID and then we can say let's do a Kohary

113
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,350
and we already have this query probably somewhere in the categories section but just going to make it

114
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,750
really simple to do it anyway.

115
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:22,380
Select the lead from posts where Id where post Id actually that's the name of the field in our data

116
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,540
table database table equals what.

117
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,470
This one here.

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,670
All right.

119
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,760
So you can close this too if you want it to.

120
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:48,300
And then we are going to send a we're going to send this query so it's going to be the query you call

121
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,500
my ask you Ally query

122
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:03,950
and we're going to send it in with a connection of course and the query right.

123
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,880
So once that's done that's it.

124
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,750
That's all we've got to do for this.

125
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,940
I think we're good.

126
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,700
All right so let's check it out.

127
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,050
Or another thing we may have to but that's fine that's just too late.

128
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,270
That's fine.

129
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,640
All right.

130
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,260
So I'm going to delete this one

131
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,330
and then delete this one.

132
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,620
There we go.

133
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,800
So he's working with one of the little that content because we need more content right to edit.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,610
So on the next lecture here we're going to be talking about how we can edit some of this and keep going

135
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,550
with of course I think he's doing is going great.

136
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,720
What do you think.

137
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,180
All right.

138
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:49,860
Perfect.

139
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,780
Thank you so much and I'll see you on the next lecture.

140
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,670
Take care.
