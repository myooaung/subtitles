00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.920
I won't come back.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.660
I hope he's still feeling great.

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.450
But anyways if you not be grateful about it like I always say All right you've got your feet you got

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.060
your hands you got your eyes and you've got a computer right in front of you.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.860
Feel happy.

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.980
But anyway on this lecture what we're going to be doing is adding some extra functionality to our CMS.

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.600
And what I really want to add is I want to go ahead and where we are on the home page if I click read

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.510
more I want to be able to go to that specific post and if I click on the picture I want to be able to

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.590
go to that specific polls.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.940
Right now we don't have that functionality but we will in a minute.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.740
So let's go the first thing that we've got to do is go to the internet stop BHP because that's where

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.020
our lupis right there is putting all this information in our button right there are pictures there too.

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.360
So let's go to the end it's and that's going to be inside the CMS folder.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.320
And then it's all right here we see that button right here.

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
But we also got to get the image and we see the image right here the image right now doesn't have an

16
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.120
anchor tag around it so that's why we need to add this to the image first.

17
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.890
There's an anchor tag around there just to make it a link clickable link image.

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.880
And we're going to put it right around the image.

19
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.570
There we go.

20
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.320
Whoops.

21
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.760
I was trying to make it smaller so you could see it.

22
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.000
Well I see.

23
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.950
But I'm just so it's clear for you.

24
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.850
There we go.

25
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.880
All right.

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.820
So now that we have the anchor tag what I want to do is when I click on it I want to go to that specific

27
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.230
page.

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.620
Right so how are we going to do that.

29
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.780
Let's look at how we did the this link right here for the post.

30
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.720
Let's just actually copy this whole thing right.

31
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.550
So I mean we got the information right here.

32
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:54.860
So let's just copy this whole thing here right there and then just copy right here.

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.360
Now when we go back and we refresh on that we put on mouseover we can see that it turns into a hen or

34
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.620
something like that right.

35
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.900
And if we click on it takes us to that specific post.

36
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.230
We can make comments that we can do other things with it right.

37
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.360
Let's do the same thing for this link right here so I'm going to go back and right now the link is just

38
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.950
refresh the page.

39
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:25.680
So let's go back here to her in that speech and let's do the same thing for this anchor tag right here.

40
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.820
You see the remore right here on going to do.

41
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.110
And I still have it on my computer memory right now because I did a piece in the last time we did this

42
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.930
for the image and you're going to paste it right here.

43
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.890
Sent in again.

44
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.890
And if I go back to it refresh and click on this read more.

45
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.620
It's going to take me to that specific post.

46
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.300
All right.

47
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.310
So we had some really cool functionality to pose a mess and we are golden.

48
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.220
Right so anyway feel great about it is s.c are really good because they're going to keep going and going

49
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.750
and you're going to keep learning and learning.

50
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.620
I don't know how much you spend for the course but this is something that I will always update and I

51
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.620
will always keep adding more things and more things are always going to keep learning.

52
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.960
Do you have nothing to lose with me.

53
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.590
Believe me everything to gain.

54
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.020
Anyway it was a pleasure showing you and teaching you and I see you on the next lecture.

55
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.460
Take care
