00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:02.330
All right welcome back to that.

2

00:00:02.400  -->  00:00:04.680
So let's get it done.

3

00:00:04.680  -->  00:00:05.290
All right.

4

00:00:05.400  -->  00:00:07.110
So I hope you're really excited.

5

00:00:07.110  -->  00:00:10.640
Now we are the contact page in the online server.

6

00:00:10.740  -->  00:00:11.180
All right.

7

00:00:11.190  -->  00:00:16.050
As you can see here as in college calms him and contact that BHB perfect.

8

00:00:16.050  -->  00:00:17.990
Now we need to write r.b.

9

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:19.920
So let's go to our panel.

10

00:00:19.950  -->  00:00:22.160
This is Whoops.

11

00:00:23.220  -->  00:00:24.670
Let's go to our panel here.

12

00:00:24.690  -->  00:00:30.570
Let's go to our public and then I'm going to go to my CMAs and find out what my contact page is.

13

00:00:30.600  -->  00:00:33.990
And let's just call it here.

14

00:00:33.990  -->  00:00:34.910
All right.

15

00:00:35.010  -->  00:00:38.130
So to send the e-mail is pretty easy.

16

00:00:38.130  -->  00:00:38.690
All right.

17

00:00:38.760  -->  00:00:40.710
I'm going to show you how easy it is to send an e-mail.

18

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:45.810
So I'm going to go here and say mail function.

19

00:00:46.320  -->  00:00:46.890
All right.

20

00:00:47.040  -->  00:00:50.000
And I'm going to go to this link right here.

21

00:00:50.130  -->  00:00:51.470
I'm going to show you how easy it is.

22

00:00:51.470  -->  00:00:51.980
All right.

23

00:00:52.140  -->  00:00:53.260
You got to laugh.

24

00:00:53.280  -->  00:00:55.850
I'm going to go here to this Web site.

25

00:00:55.890  -->  00:01:02.630
The only three schools are come right and then copy everything in between the BHB tags and anger on

26

00:01:02.630  -->  00:01:04.590
a pizza right here.

27

00:01:04.590  -->  00:01:05.830
All right.

28

00:01:06.090  -->  00:01:09.610
So this cold is not going to run unless I click submit.

29

00:01:09.630  -->  00:01:13.000
But this call is going to run no matter why when every fresh speech.

30

00:01:13.140  -->  00:01:20.640
So right here I'm going to put my e-mail address support at Edwin d stucco

31

00:01:23.490  -->  00:01:30.520
and right now I should say first line of tets and then whatever second line Skylane even the wadis and

32

00:01:30.570  -->  00:01:31.220
save it.

33

00:01:31.290  -->  00:01:34.910
Whoops I don't know what in the world that is saying right here.

34

00:01:34.910  -->  00:01:36.250
I'm so used to saving it.

35

00:01:36.270  -->  00:01:37.600
Command as that I.

36

00:01:37.770  -->  00:01:38.530
That's what I did.

37

00:01:38.760  -->  00:01:39.460
But anyway.

38

00:01:39.660  -->  00:01:48.890
So I'm going to go right now and I'm going to go to my e-mail.

39

00:01:48.930  -->  00:01:49.500
All right.

40

00:01:49.590  -->  00:01:51.200
And I'm going to open up my e-mail.

41

00:01:51.240  -->  00:01:52.740
First let's go to that page.

42

00:01:52.740  -->  00:01:56.400
There's a law where you can see all right how this works.

43

00:01:56.400  -->  00:02:00.060
Let's go to contact and you're going to refresh I just refresh.

44

00:02:00.060  -->  00:02:01.570
I should get the e-mail.

45

00:02:01.830  -->  00:02:06.000
Like sometimes it takes a long time but sometimes it's fast.

46

00:02:06.040  -->  00:02:07.810
I've got to get it I already got it.

47

00:02:07.810  -->  00:02:10.400
I'm going to show it to you right now.

48

00:02:11.460  -->  00:02:14.680
All right.

49

00:02:14.700  -->  00:02:16.430
Right here.

50

00:02:16.470  -->  00:02:16.740
All right.

51

00:02:16.740  -->  00:02:22.680
As you can see first line of tÃªtes second line of tats and this is where this survey is coming from

52

00:02:22.830  -->  00:02:24.030
where it's coming from.

53

00:02:24.030  -->  00:02:24.720
All right.

54

00:02:25.050  -->  00:02:30.810
So as you can see right here I got it.

55

00:02:30.810  -->  00:02:31.760
All right.

56

00:02:31.980  -->  00:02:41.340
So let's send another e-mail so you can see let's just say something else.

57

00:02:41.640  -->  00:02:44.730
Second e-mail.

58

00:02:46.080  -->  00:02:49.380
Yes.

59

00:02:49.440  -->  00:02:51.970
Safe.

60

00:02:52.020  -->  00:02:55.750
I just got the e-mail.

61

00:02:55.980  -->  00:03:00.100
Actually I have not gotten the e-mail yet.

62

00:03:02.020  -->  00:03:08.190
See sometimes you get the e-mail right away.

63

00:03:08.190  -->  00:03:08.580
All right.

64

00:03:08.580  -->  00:03:13.920
And the reason for that is because it might get blocked.

65

00:03:13.920  -->  00:03:15.340
All right.

66

00:03:15.960  -->  00:03:19.920
So I'm going to show it to you right now right here.

67

00:03:19.920  -->  00:03:21.860
As you can see all right.

68

00:03:21.870  -->  00:03:27.560
And the reason why this is so big is because I don't want you to see my other personal information.

69

00:03:27.570  -->  00:03:30.780
All right so you can see a second e-mail right here.

70

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:31.440
All right.

71

00:03:31.560  -->  00:03:32.070
Perfect.

72

00:03:32.070  -->  00:03:36.130
So it is working it's coming from Rico 20:30 whatever.

73

00:03:36.240  -->  00:03:41.820
That's probably the user name anyway.

74

00:03:41.850  -->  00:03:45.990
Let's actually call this a little better so that way you can see how this works.

75

00:03:45.990  -->  00:03:46.980
All right.

76

00:03:47.610  -->  00:03:47.850
All right.

77

00:03:47.850  -->  00:03:48.780
Perfect.

78

00:03:48.810  -->  00:03:52.470
So we know that it works and we know that how to do it now.

79

00:03:52.770  -->  00:03:55.450
So let's actually do this.

80

00:03:55.770  -->  00:03:58.000
So this is that too.

81

00:03:58.020  -->  00:03:59.510
All right variable.

82

00:03:59.570  -->  00:04:01.630
That's going to be the e-mail.

83

00:04:01.980  -->  00:04:06.380
The body is going to be the body fund formed by here.

84

00:04:06.960  -->  00:04:09.140
And the subject of course we got that.

85

00:04:09.150  -->  00:04:12.130
All right so we getting all the feels we want.

86

00:04:13.090  -->  00:04:16.670
Now let's put the mail right here.

87

00:04:16.980  -->  00:04:17.950
Let's actually take this.

88

00:04:17.940  -->  00:04:19.250
We don't need this anymore.

89

00:04:19.260  -->  00:04:24.140
We can do a word wrap on that message if we wanted to on the subject.

90

00:04:24.290  -->  00:04:30.320
And I put the line there and I take that off real quick if I can make this a little bigger so that what

91

00:04:30.330  -->  00:04:36.060
you see what I'm doing actually sorry this leave it like this.

92

00:04:36.060  -->  00:04:36.530
All right.

93

00:04:36.690  -->  00:04:41.940
So let's do a word wrap on this here.

94

00:04:42.150  -->  00:04:48.360
So word wrap.

95

00:04:48.390  -->  00:04:49.480
There we go.

96

00:04:49.530  -->  00:04:58.150
And the second parameter would be we want to wrap it around 70 to 70 characters right.

97

00:04:58.230  -->  00:05:02.700
So that's a perfect saving.

98

00:05:02.980  -->  00:05:03.580
All right.

99

00:05:03.720  -->  00:05:07.100
So another subject is going to be the variable.

100

00:05:08.360  -->  00:05:10.690
Right.

101

00:05:12.130  -->  00:05:20.080
He's sitting there and the message is going to be the body.

102

00:05:20.080  -->  00:05:21.160
All right.

103

00:05:21.840  -->  00:05:23.230
Keep that in mind.

104

00:05:23.230  -->  00:05:25.200
Whoops sorry about that.

105

00:05:25.200  -->  00:05:26.200
All right.

106

00:05:26.310  -->  00:05:30.620
So the body got one last thing that we need to do this mail here.

107

00:05:30.630  -->  00:05:37.500
This one's here needs to be the two variable and we can pass another parameter here and this will be

108

00:05:37.500  -->  00:05:38.240
called a header.

109

00:05:38.250  -->  00:05:43.050
I show you right now in a minute what it is is going to be a variable because we're going to have some

110

00:05:43.050  -->  00:05:44.020
stuff in there.

111

00:05:44.250  -->  00:05:50.160
So the header would be where the image is coming from.

112

00:05:50.580  -->  00:05:57.290
And I think we have already a post down here for the e-mail e-mail.

113

00:05:57.570  -->  00:05:59.790
Yes.

114

00:05:59.790  -->  00:06:01.690
All right.

115

00:06:03.040  -->  00:06:06.180
That would be the e-mail.

116

00:06:06.240  -->  00:06:07.830
All right.

117

00:06:08.740  -->  00:06:11.810
Whoops again.

118

00:06:12.120  -->  00:06:14.970
So they had it would be the e-mail where he's coming from.

119

00:06:15.360  -->  00:06:16.910
OK.

120

00:06:16.920  -->  00:06:20.010
Perfect.

121

00:06:20.010  -->  00:06:20.320
All right.

122

00:06:20.340  -->  00:06:22.040
Let's test this to see if it works.

123

00:06:22.050  -->  00:06:22.810
OK.

124

00:06:22.830  -->  00:06:24.690
Organized this a little bit.

125

00:06:25.220  -->  00:06:26.450
All right.

126

00:06:26.890  -->  00:06:28.400
That is good.

127

00:06:29.010  -->  00:06:31.510
Let's go back to a forum here fresh.

128

00:06:31.750  -->  00:06:33.740
We got no errors there.

129

00:06:33.930  -->  00:06:34.590
And

130

00:06:38.100  -->  00:06:40.640
let's actually try this out real quick.

131

00:06:41.490  -->  00:06:48.360
Let's say my e-mail address would be no Rico Suave G-mail.

132

00:06:48.400  -->  00:06:49.550
Com.

133

00:06:49.600  -->  00:06:52.070
I saw geez.

134

00:06:52.830  -->  00:06:55.770
This is Edwin.

135

00:06:56.230  -->  00:07:00.410
Yes hello.

136

00:07:01.050  -->  00:07:05.360
This is pretty cool.

137

00:07:05.400  -->  00:07:08.020
It's working.

138

00:07:08.040  -->  00:07:11.460
I know how to send e-mails

139

00:07:14.250  -->  00:07:17.630
a click submit.

140

00:07:17.650  -->  00:07:18.460
All right.

141

00:07:18.480  -->  00:07:22.860
And then we go to my e-mail I mean one second.

142

00:07:22.890  -->  00:07:25.680
Check it out and let's see what I got.

143

00:07:26.010  -->  00:07:29.740
And voila.

144

00:07:30.440  -->  00:07:34.110
As you can see here we got the e-mail right there.

145

00:07:34.110  -->  00:07:34.970
This is Edwin.

146

00:07:34.980  -->  00:07:35.840
Hello.

147

00:07:36.010  -->  00:07:39.440
We check the e-mail Rico Suave.

148

00:07:39.450  -->  00:07:40.740
This is pretty cool it's working.

149

00:07:40.740  -->  00:07:44.790
I know how to send e-mail a so it is working guys.

150

00:07:44.820  -->  00:07:46.420
And now you know how to send e-mail.

151

00:07:46.440  -->  00:07:49.300
So pat yourself in the back.

152

00:07:49.320  -->  00:07:51.170
Show your friends what you can do.

153

00:07:51.180  -->  00:07:52.050
You're awesome.

154

00:07:52.080  -->  00:07:54.270
You are learning more every single day.

155

00:07:54.270  -->  00:08:00.450
And also keep in mind that you can actually extend this and basically put a massive cheer saying your

156

00:08:00.450  -->  00:08:01.710
form was submitted.

157

00:08:01.920  -->  00:08:04.540
All right so it's up to you to do that.

158

00:08:04.560  -->  00:08:07.450
That's very easy to do with an echo.

159

00:08:07.450  -->  00:08:07.860
All right.

160

00:08:07.860  -->  00:08:10.750
Or you can use sessions.

161

00:08:10.750  -->  00:08:12.580
So now you know how to send e-mails.

162

00:08:12.630  -->  00:08:13.350
Thank you so much.

163

00:08:13.350  -->  00:08:14.610
And I see you in the next lecture
