1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.390
All right so we are on Section 10 finally.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:04.970
Right.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.930
So now we've got to Section 10 here.

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.050
Congratulations.

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.190
For those of you that made it for those of you that did not make it well we'll wait for you right.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.340
Yeah right.

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.300
We need to keep going.

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.860
But anyway so we are in Section 10 here inside that practical app folder right here.

9
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.560
And we've got 10 there we are.

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.910
So now what we need to do is follow some instructions here.

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.330
He's asking us to create a class called Dog essential properties for dog example why collars nose or

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.590
fur color make a method show all name show all that echoes all the properties and instantiate a class

13
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.800
or create an object and call it.

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.410
All right call the method show or of course.

15
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.200
All right so go ahead and look at this.

16
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.410
Post a video or look at instructions follow it and do it.

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.330
You should know how to do that.

18
00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.960
If not you need to go back to the section and find out how to do it right on the next couple of seconds

19
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.890
after you posit.

20
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.510
And when you come back of course for a couple of seconds for me but it might be a day for you I don't

21
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.810
know.

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.580
I don't know how advanced you are yet.

23
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.190
So anyway a buzzer beater can do it.

24
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.890
All right.

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.450
So hopefully you won't want to do it and not get easy if you get lazy.

26
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.410
Then what whoever would suffer is you because you will not learn as much.

27
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.050
But anyway it's up to you.

28
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.090
So if you did a good then we are good if you were able to make this class.

29
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.230
If not don't worry.

30
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.400
I'm here to help you out so let's go ahead and make a class is open.

31
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:42.860
BHB tag's first thing that we've got to do and this is put.

32
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.300
All right so the class that we've got to call is that we've got to make is called Dog.

33
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.060
So we've got to capitalize that idea remember that then some curly brackets and bring it down there

34
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.410
and he's asking us to separate some properties.

35
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.130
So I call his nose and fur color.

36
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.850
So I color would be something like We need to put the key word var remember that.

37
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.570
And let's just say ice is the first one here.

38
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.660
Eye color and nose.

39
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.420
All right.

40
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:20.850
So I colors and this just say is blue.

41
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.700
All right.

42
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.900
And the next one will be a.

43
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.910
I'm going to find out which the next one next one is going to be NOS.

44
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.770
And for.

45
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.290
All right so nos.

46
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:42.740
We're just going to say nose and I don't know why he knows.

47
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.370
And make sure that you put his dollar sign there actually.

48
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:57.540
Let's create another one called for for color that just make everything no color and fake color.

49
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.150
This would be no color black and for would be

50
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.940
brown.

51
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.610
So this dog is going to have blue eyes on no color is going to be black and brown.

52
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.440
All right.

53
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.640
So all right so we got all these properties here.

54
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.760
Now we need to call the method and then we need to actually not call them meant to be created.

55
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.510
So we created with a function key word there and to make this meant his name is going to be show or

56
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.230
so he's going to copy that and put it right here.

57
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.390
Right.

58
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.570
We call it just like we do with a regular function because it is a function but it's called Mentha inside

59
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.260
the class.

60
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.870
And then we're going to echo all this stuff here.

61
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.080
You remember how we Eckl how we reference this class here inside the class.

62
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.180
Do you remember that.

63
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.690
Well we use the word does.

64
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.760
All right.

65
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.950
And if you said it then good job.

66
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.880
If you didn't you need to go back and watch his videos and make sure you got this right.

67
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.540
So let me go ahead and we don't need to use the dollar sign anymore.

68
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.080
We just need to use that and just create a couple of this here.

69
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.570
This is just the one right here.

70
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.050
And this just copy this is on the right here.

71
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:28.440
And for color right here and I'm going to forget the semi-colon right here right now.

72
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:37.380
This is just going to look like this could display all of them and concatenate all of this one after

73
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.340
the other.

74
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.190
But I wanted to do it like this.

75
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.570
Boy goes there all right.

76
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.640
And this should be good.

77
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.690
All you got to do here is concatenates spade a B or tag

78
00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:03.320
the tag and then just going to copy this here.

79
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.230
So now we created that math and then says that goes all the property instantiate the class.

80
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.270
All right.

81
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.580
So we got this method here.

82
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.960
Great.

83
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.710
It looks nice too.

84
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.440
Right.

85
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.250
As a matter of fact this should be and it will be that way.

86
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.220
And I did that with command.

87
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.870
Right bracket right curly bracket right here like this.

88
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.740
All right.

89
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.440
So you enter.

90
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.760
That's how I moved everything around.

91
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.790
So I said like that impressed a command in that bracket move everything you could do control if you

92
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.650
were in Windows.

93
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.350
All right so we're going to start Sheedy's class or how we do this.

94
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.270
Very simple.

95
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.560
After we see this make sure that it's the class there.

96
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.490
OK.

97
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.410
So how we do this first we need to call this right.

98
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.980
We need to say new dog.

99
00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:03.360
And we go to see that make sure array that you have that capitalized there.

100
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.950
And now that we call that we can assign it to a assign sign too.

101
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.760
I think it does say what kind of a dog we got to assign it to a people.

102
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.840
Yeah it's a sign into a pit bull.

103
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.820
Nice doggy.

104
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.500
Right.

105
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:28.120
So we assign it to that and then we use that to call it pit bull.

106
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.960
You need to call the method right here because that's what he says at the end.

107
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.050
Call the method right here.

108
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:41.160
So let's call that let's get the name right here.

109
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.050
All right perfect.

110
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.690
Let's look.

111
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.520
Look it up.

112
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:56.490
We get an arrow here on dog 34 saying syntax error on the expected dog.

113
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.850
Of course this new thing and the thing and the reason why I made this mistake is because I was creating

114
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:08.930
another variable there and I stopped just to show you that you need to do this first and I did this.

115
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.040
I created this and then I stopped there and I left that I can go in here.

116
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.500
That's the whole reason.

117
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.890
All right.

118
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.030
So let's just return everything there.

119
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.630
Which way.

120
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.780
Refresh.

121
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.730
Perfect.

122
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.660
So we got blue black and brown.

123
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.300
All right.

124
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.450
So now we created a class with sets some properties inside the class right.

125
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.660
Great.

126
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:42.920
And we also created a method of that class and we instantiate it instantiated this class.

127
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.300
Basically created this little object here called Paint ball out of the flash right.

128
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.290
So this is quite an instance of the class.

129
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.890
In the case of this is an object now.

130
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.900
Right.

131
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.280
And we can create as many objects as we want.

132
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.190
We can go ahead and create as many instances as we want.

133
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:08.310
Pit Bull Dog Man Brock Woller whatever other objects you want to create and said different properties

134
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:08.890
for them.

135
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.070
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

136
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.710
Hopefully this gave you enough knowledge there to create your own classes and mentors and properties.

137
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:17.490
All right.

138
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.120
Take care.

139
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.800
And I see you in the next lecture
