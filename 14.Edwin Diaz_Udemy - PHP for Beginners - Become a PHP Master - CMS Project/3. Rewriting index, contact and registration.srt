00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,120
Welcome back my students so now that we have our engines on OK let's go back to our editor.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,790
Let's see if we can find our way to somewhere here.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,340
It's actually in the back here.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,730
Let me actually put this in a different screen.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,040
Let me just put it right here.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,680
Just there we go.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,370
So now that we have this on what we wanted to do is let's go here real quick and show you I want to

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,740
replace actually whatever something in that's And we've got an arrow here because we're not we turning

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,050
our rewrite engine on make sure we save it that we go OK now it works.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,560
So any little mistake that you make on this file here if you misspelled something here you have a space

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,070
where you shouldn't have it.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,360
You're going to have some type of error in your server.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,050
OK.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,410
Make sure that you have everything correct.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,800
So what I want to do is I want to replace that BHB I want to take it all from here.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,420
OK.

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,140
I want to be able to just type in just the root of this file.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,660
And they don't have to type in this here even though they can still get here because this indicates

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,170
we reroute automatically everything to our application.

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,100
That works fine.

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,740
Well what if they want to go to registration.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,520
All right registration

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,200
like this for a tree.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,520
OK.

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,960
That's not going to work.

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,330
OK.

27
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,090
So that's not going to work.

28
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,180
We also this Contac is not going to work either.

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,700
What if I type in the context of the HP that works great.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,920
So let's actually write something for that and let me show you how that works.

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:57,390
So while whatever we are going to be writing now in our code rules rewrite rules so rewrite one word

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,660
well and then rule two words together uppercase each of them.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,790
The start of each and now we do a space and this is where the regular expression is going to come in

34
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,710
handy.

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,200
We're gonna say well I won this this search of this match to start like this.

36
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,120
And I wanted to end it like this.

37
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,460
OK.

38
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,430
Now this is like start this match here and in the here I'm going to write something in between.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,910
Now this is regular expression guys OK.

40
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,850
I'm going to put a parentheses and I say well if you find in this or that's where the pipe is for you

41
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:43,420
find contact or registration.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,070
I want you to grab those values and I want you to subset to them with this.

43
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,750
Now I know you don't understand why in the world I'm actually doing.

44
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,230
Let me just put this here.

45
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,890
And then I want you to do the I don't want to be not case sensitive.

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,250
And last this is the last thing that we were writing uppercase.

47
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,210
Make sure there are no spaces here and see call Ma Bell.

48
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,670
All right.

49
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,440
So like I say I'm not going to show you regular expressions on this because I have a course on that

50
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,550
and because it's a little bit complicated to explain in one lecture.

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,880
Well basically what we're doing here is we're saying stuff like this and like this and this parentheses

52
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,870
OK.

53
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,410
Now this is our regular expression.

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:41,200
But this parentheses are grabbing the value ok of index or contact or registration and we're grabbing

55
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,990
we're using valuable we are assigning it by using this Dallas symbol here.

56
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:53,200
And number one this dollar symbol is like a variable basically gay.

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,070
And that one is saying well we only have one because every parentheses if I had another expression and

58
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,610
I just paste it here.

59
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:08,690
I have now two parentheses and now we have to use another variable here called Number Two.

60
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,290
Every time I've enclosed something like this in parentheses I'm like enclosing this in a variable so

61
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,440
that I can use it later in regular expressions we use it with a dollar symbol and the number one or

62
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,530
number two if we have more in the going order.

63
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,540
So one this will be one this will be two.

64
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,020
OK.

65
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,980
But anyway that's just a little bit there.

66
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:44,590
So this is in the BHB as you can see we just basically when we find this we just apply apply apply the

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,850
dot BHB to it.

68
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:53,980
So basically we are mapping every time we find in it's by itself we map it and we concatenate it basically

69
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,280
without BHB right here.

70
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,810
OK.

71
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,500
So that's what it is Say.

72
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,470
Let's come back here and let's just say well let's go to registration to see if it works.

73
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,330
And I thought already that we go registration that works.

74
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,700
I was working there.

75
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,670
It seems to me Good to see a mess.

76
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,500
There we go that works.

77
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,190
Let's go to contact

78
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,630
contact and as you can see that works as well.

79
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,640
OK super simple guys nothing out of the ordinary.

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,250
You have some type of error in your surveys because you mistype something here.

81
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,820
OK.

82
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,520
Make sure you have it exactly the way I have it in this Kerick symbol.

83
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,180
OK.

84
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,570
This is a ball.

85
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,760
You are cits.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,570
So chiff and you sit and you should get something like this OK.

87
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,140
All right look at it pretty good.

88
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,510
And make sure you have it.

89
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,160
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
