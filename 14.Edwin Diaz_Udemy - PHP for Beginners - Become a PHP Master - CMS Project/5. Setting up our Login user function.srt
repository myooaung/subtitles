1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,430
Welcome back my student let's actually start by taking out this message variable.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,130
There are right in registration that BHB should be right here.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,410
Let's just take this guy out.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,070
We're not going to need him for now.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,990
Maybe we're not going to ever need him again.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
So sorry for them for him.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,480
We moved on already right guys.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,500
All right so right now this is not doing anything.

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,930
That's fine.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,350
We'll make it work.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:38,400
So the next thing that I want to do here is actually loop through this era's array and find out if we

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,710
have any problems.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,150
And if we do we want to either register the user or not.

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,660
All right.

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,890
So let's actually create a For Each loop right here.

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,380
And we are going to take apart the associative array.

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:07,530
We're going to take the key out and the value and we're just going to see if the kid is empty.

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,480
All right then.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,550
Well another key the value actually.

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,190
Then we want to re-use to the user.

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:24,030
And of course we're going to be using our register beautiful function right here that we have not tested

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:35,250
yet and we're going to take in the user name and the email and the password.

23
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,490
So you have not.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,440
And then of course we want to log in the user we have not created this function.

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,480
We will.

26
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,360
Right.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,940
So user name and the password.

28
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,710
All right we need to create a function and then we need to test everything out.

29
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,990
We have reading a lot of code here guys.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,370
So I suggest you start putting some comments on each of your functionalities.

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,480
And so that way you can start debugging this later on if something is wrong.

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,030
Right.

33
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,010
All right.

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:21,770
Let's actually go ahead and create our logging user functionality.

35
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,560
And let's actually include

36
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:38,460
we need to include here something we need to include our functions that ph be there because if we don't

37
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,870
it's not going to work.

38
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,990
So if I remember correctly and that's what I'm trying to remember where it actually is we need to go

39
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:57,020
out a little bit to our admin and then we know we need to have functions of BHB.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,670
There we go.

41
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,890
If you have some type of arrowing in your path your whole page will break.

42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,790
All right so make sure that it is working.

43
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,310
So NDB them see something here in the way we have a session so we don't have a session start on the

44
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,720
B that's fine.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,040
We do have a session start right here.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,640
We could just put this all the way up here.

47
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,640
That's fine.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,490
All right.

49
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:35,130
So let's start breaking this down.

50
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,290
This is a big function here.

51
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:43,640
Let's just take all this out and the

52
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:56,040
auction function you are logging user right.

53
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,990
We need to fix that in a minute.

54
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,220
Of course this would be the user name.

55
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,520
Geez it would go in the mail.

56
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,630
All right.

57
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,530
Let's take that out of here

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,370
and

59
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:30,040
we can see a little user here.

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,010
I told you guys I was going to take it from a beginner's level to an intermediate level so try to keep

61
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:48,200
up with me and we go I'm just going to take all that out and look at that beautiful right.

62
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,870
All right.

63
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,200
And let's go back to functions in here.

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
We are going to be trimming our variables.

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,190
Let's actually trim it right here.

66
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,990
Hopefully those and create a problem

67
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,130
with scaping and then we're trimming it.

68
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,060
I don't like to make it like this since it's not clear what we are doing.

69
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:24,390
I don't want you to let's just trim it.

70
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,450
That's fine.

71
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,810
Let's just trim here

72
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,450
and we'll trim the passwords.

73
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,730
Well

74
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,890
here we go.

75
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,510
I like to write it up like this on times and not for functions and functions together just because I

76
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,960
want you guys to understand exactly what we're doing.

77
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,120
Plus I wanted to make it clear since I now writing a lot of comments here.

78
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,690
All right so let's make this here.

79
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,050
Clean this up a little bit.

80
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,480
And I already can see

81
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,950
that we could use our redirect function right here.

82
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,810
All right we're going to leave that for later.

83
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,700
When we test this out right now we need to also include our connection

84
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,670
right.

85
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,780
This is very fine setting all of the what he needs so let's let's look at this real quick and let's

86
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,000
see where we are.

87
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,420
All right.

88
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,460
The next thing for us to do would be to actually put some type of user notice here telling the user

89
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,040
that something is wrong with their form.

90
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,790
All right.

91
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,710
Now we still need to work on our functions at BHP this might not be 100 percent yet.

92
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,020
So we would need to replace as we redirect we or redirect function that we have.

93
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,380
We also need to just make this a little better.

94
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,380
Right.

95
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,150
And we might need a little work here as well.

96
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,060
But on the next lecture we are going to be modifying our Fung our form here just to give the user some

97
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,900
notification to wice run with their information.

98
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,600
And then after all are we going to test this out if something is wrong we're going to fix it.

99
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,250
All right.

100
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,360
See you in the next lecture
