1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,770
All right so we have some work to do in the admin section here.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,660
We have a lot of links here that don't belong here.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,160
And we have a lot of elements here that don't belong here so let's go ahead and add some of this here

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,560
so that way we can get it ready for some of that dynamic data that we want to be able to display here

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,240
in the admin section.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,010
And let's go and do that right now.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,800
So let's go to our brackets editor right here.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,670
And let's go to the ad men.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,460
Remember that we made a

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,950
navigation for admin make sure that you are included navigation actually.

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,460
Add.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,200
You see that was the wrong navigation right here.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,210
Admin includes navigation that BHB.

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,060
All right so we have a lot of things here that we need to remove.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,650
All right.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:02,790
So this is actually the left side navigation we should divide this into let's sigh and I don't want

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,320
to complicate things I just got to leave it one navigation but just know that there's a lot of things

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,170
that we need to hear.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,910
All right so the first thing that I want in the lead is not really we're going to leave some links actually

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,030
well delete.

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,210
We're going to leave dashboard we're going to create a link.

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,710
We're going to have to drop down.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,150
I don't know if you remember the demo that I showed you in the beginning of the mess we had to drop

24
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,450
down for posts and for users.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,730
And we're going to have to drop downs also for that.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,090
Right.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:41,440
So we're going to replicate this one and then we have a total of six links if we compare this with Demel.

28
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,380
So we need six links there.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,610
So let's find out.

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:50,120
Let's first take this SB ad me outta here and just call it CIMS system.

31
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,420
Him as admin.

32
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,640
Save it refresh.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,990
And we can see that that works OK.

34
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:08,280
So this is the top in the right hand side here but in here

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,480
you're right John Smith.

36
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:24,130
We're done with we're actually not done with his previews it's a preview but instead is that dropdown.

37
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,950
All right.

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,310
And is drub down there.

39
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,400
Is this one here

40
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,510
right here.

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,580
Joe Smith and John Smith Right.

42
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:42,660
So let's get rid of that dropdown actually and say to him I want to get rid of that want to get rid

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,120
of this drop down.

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,670
So that's all I've done is huge and we don't need it because we're not going to use it.

45
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,530
Why have something we're not going to use.

46
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,330
Right.

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,200
So let's just bring it down let's just get rid of it.

48
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,910
All right.

49
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,300
All right so refresh come back here refresh.

50
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,850
Done to get rid of these belt you don't need that unless you are going to need it.

51
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,920
You can leave it there or you can just always copy it from the template.

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,970
All right so this bill is this drop down right here.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,800
We're going to delete this one too.

54
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,540
It's just gone.

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,650
It does.

56
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,170
And we have another drop down this where we will be using.

57
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,400
So I just going to leave the I just going to take the invites out of here we're going to be using e-mails

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,100
on this stuff and the settings and I used that either.

59
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,730
When I use Logo and profile right

60
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,540
refresh John Smith profile and all that.

61
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,460
Perfect.

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,890
Let's go ahead and finish this up.

63
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,930
And the left side then we have some time for that one and this go.

64
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,530
So the right hand side.

65
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,580
This is navigation.

66
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,160
Actually that's that's an application right here.

67
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,270
Perfect.

68
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,290
That is a whole enough bar.

69
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,790
And this is just that part of the left side navigation sidebar menu items right here.

70
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,360
All right so we are we have many links here.

71
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,730
One two three four five six seven eight nine and we say we only need six.

72
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,660
So I'm just going with the lead three charts tables and forms.

73
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:44,200
All right charts tables forms.

74
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,720
Save.

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,500
Come back here.

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,730
See we're broke it wouldn't break anything.

77
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm going to call this pose.

78
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
I leave this dashboard.

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,270
I'm going to actually replicate that drop down because that's what we have in there.

80
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:04,770
See a mass drop down is the drop down.

81
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,830
So it does replicate that.

82
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,920
And is this one right here.

83
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,700
So let's make this a little smaller to see where it is actually.

84
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:23,220
So you can see right now much you know that I'm actually replicating these dropped down and replacing

85
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,360
it with a bootstrap elements right here.

86
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,870
Write this column back to it and refresh perfit work.

87
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:44,760
So actually it doesn't work if you click on it it's actually selecting both.

88
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,590
So let me just make it big again here.

89
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:55,360
All right so I replaced I copied this drub them right here and I replaced it with a static something

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,590
that wasn't moving.

91
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,400
Another element here.

92
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,570
This is actually opening for them right here with this pound sign is oping this well right here with

93
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,560
his ID.

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,960
See the data target is a javascript.

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,010
It targets javascript all right out of you.

96
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,490
And he's opening this into what he's saying is I want you to dig up data.

97
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,630
Total collapse.

98
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,820
This item right here.

99
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:26,210
All right so we're going to call this the polls posts.

100
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,960
We're going to give you an idea of polls.

101
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,520
Polls dropped down.

102
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,060
Actually let's just call it make it more meaningful draw down.

103
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,930
All right.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,400
Let's just make sure that we have the same on this poll and right here on this day data target.

105
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,300
All right.

106
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,350
And this is going to be called polls.

107
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,970
Are we going to change names of polls.

108
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,250
And this is going to be at the polls.

109
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,390
Whoops Geez

110
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,200
posts view or polls.

111
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:21,010
Actually I keep making that mistake of fuel polls polls right here.

112
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,020
All right.

113
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,300
And let's say that you just savor here and refresh it.

114
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,790
All right perfect.

115
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,470
The next one is categories.

116
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:42,780
So this one here that blank this category right here categories.

117
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,970
Refresh it.

118
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,100
Actually it wasn't down in the bush track grade actually.

119
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,710
All right.

120
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,850
Post grade.

121
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,740
I that right here I can barely see.

122
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,110
Sorry guys.

123
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,200
That's where the categories is.

124
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,380
And a copy here category is perfect.

125
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,160
And this one is going to raise and touch so I know where I am.

126
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,720
So categories.

127
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,320
This one would be comments

128
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:33,800
and this one would be users.

129
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:42,030
I think we need one more down here for profile and I use is going to be also a drop down.

130
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,430
So it's a matter of fact we have a draw down here.

131
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,990
This is going to be users actually sorry about that.

132
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,540
And I just want to make sure that we take this out of here

133
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,660
and replace it with the users line right here.

134
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,840
All right.

135
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,170
As you know looking suppose category comments users.

136
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,070
And there's going to be has to be a drop down.

137
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:16,120
But actually they just put these users.

138
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,300
All right so

139
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,240
that's the dropdown right now on their comments.

140
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,140
And that should be name users

141
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,920
users.

142
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:32,930
Right.

143
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,790
And then one more link after this one here.

144
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,920
And when I do that I'm just checking to see the end tag OK.

145
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,760
And this is going to be called a profile.

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
All right.

147
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:57,840
So that's where posts category's comments users profile perfect since there space on this one here.

148
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,670
Separate a little bit from here.

149
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,840
So I think we're done with this right for now.

150
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,810
Later on we will be styling making this a little bit nicer but we'll leave that for last.

151
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,370
Since we are concerned more about the functionality.

152
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,680
But anyway I'm going to end this video here because it's getting kind of long and as a matter of fact

153
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,790
well we need this.

154
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,860
We will leave it the same.

155
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,580
We'll leave this the way it is right now.

156
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,480
So anyways let me end the video and I'll see a nice lecture.

157
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,880
Take care and keep going.
