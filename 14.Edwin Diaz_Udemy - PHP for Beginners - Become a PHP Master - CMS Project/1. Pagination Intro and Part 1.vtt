00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.050
Welcome back my student in this lecture here or this section I'm going to show you how to build a pagination

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.950
system.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.330
What's a pagination system.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.900
Well I know most of you know where pagination system is but I'm going to show you right now.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.670
So for example a search in Google and click on cars you can see this little number see here right.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.150
This is a pagination system.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.510
And we're going to create something very similar to that sense.

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.120
We have a lot of content.

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.250
Well I have a lot of content right here on home page and I really want to limit this page here maybe

10
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.820
like 10 posts instead of I don't know a hundred.

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.700
So tempos per page.

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.080
Every time if we click on the second page like we do here on Google it would take us to the next 10

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.920
results.

14
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.630
Right.

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.140
So this is going to be a pretty exciting really really cool section.

16
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.530
All right.

17
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.800
So let's go ahead and get it on with that.

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.780
All right so now

19
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.640
let me show you right here.

20
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.750
Let me just trust this and let's go to where we're going to be doing this.

21
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
It's going to be on in this array of course.

22
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.570
And what I want you to do is I want you to do is save us on these and it's because we might you might

23
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.970
make a mistake in the beginning and this is not a very simple thing that we are going to be doing is

24
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.890
actually the system's going to be pretty simple because it is simple but if you don't know it could

25
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.440
be a little hard to do in the beginning to understand the ball once you understand the super simple.

26
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.810
So let's do a save as on these and it's just going to save it to end it's underscore old.

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.080
Just in case we messed up right.

28
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.960
So of course.

29
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.430
Let's open up in this again and let's close down.

30
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.980
It's on the square old.

31
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.240
All right.

32
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.080
Just in case that's a little back up there that we have.

33
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.770
So how are we going to build this.

34
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.070
First of all I'm going to show you here and I know and show you there's another lecture's that we can

35
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.920
limit post right we can say limit and we can say limit to 3 right.

36
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.670
So if I come here to the home page you can see that I only have three pools available.

37
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.080
Right.

38
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.220
So this is something like we're going to be doing this dynamically though is going to be instead of

39
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.230
that three they're going to have a number variable.

40
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.810
All right.

41
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.570
So another way to use that I would be like this.

42
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.140
So if I say zero Colma 10.

43
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.310
All right you can guess what this is going to show me in the beginning here.

44
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:36.070
So enter I'm going to say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

45
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.660
All right.

46
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.740
So this is going to show me 0 2 temples if I do 5.

47
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.380
All right.

48
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.540
Of course.

49
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.670
Look at this one two three four and five six seven a nine and 10.

50
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.100
Of course it's going to show me 10 because it's just showing me from five to 10.

51
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.540
But look at this.

52
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.510
Five one two three four and five.

53
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.050
All right.

54
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.540
So this is almost a symptom that we're going to be doing it and doing it in a different way.

55
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.470
All right.

56
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.680
So how are we going to do this.

57
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.170
First thing that we are going to be doing here is we need to find out how many polls we have.

58
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.930
All right.

59
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.490
So let's do a query up here.

60
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.240
All right and we want to do this outside the loop right because this count if I put the count inside

61
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.330
here is going to change things anyway.

62
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:46.950
So let's go ahead and create like Querrey to find out exactly how many points we have.

63
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.290
So I'm just going to set select pools where we weren't just going to see polls where we count.

64
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.080
All right.

65
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.600
And just going to say select

66
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.580
all phone polls.

67
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.980
Now we need to send in our query right.

68
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:18.270
I'm just going to copy this guy right here and place right here and now I could say something like.

69
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.770
Find another county right.

70
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.380
Find count.

71
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.460
This is the results right here.

72
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.760
So now we need to find the count so I'm just going to create a variable real quick and assign the function

73
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.920
my Eskew a lie.

74
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.380
No Rose is going to count how many rolls we have on that specific table right.

75
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.710
So on this resultset right here.

76
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.880
There we go.

77
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.430
Now we have the count.

78
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.150
All right.

79
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.220
But we need to put this there OK.

80
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.320
Make sure that you do that and you can verify you can just echo that count.

81
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.470
And find out that that's what we are doing right now of course I'm going to take this out a year because

82
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.680
I don't want to do anything with that now.

83
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.270
All right.

84
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.640
So anyway I'm going to cut this lecture short.

85
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.170
All right because I mean I you know I use some of the minutes here to explain to you what we were doing

86
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.600
and now we created this piece of code here and the next lecture we're going to continue building on

87
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.180
this.

88
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.790
And I want you to just copy everything that I have done.

89
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.680
All right don't just watch me do it.

90
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.650
And on the next lecture we'll continue.

91
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.220
All right so let's have some fun and see you in the next lecture
