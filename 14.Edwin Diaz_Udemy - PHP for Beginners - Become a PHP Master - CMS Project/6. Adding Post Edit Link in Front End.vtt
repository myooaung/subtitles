00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.320
All right.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.970
Welcome back on this special lecture we are going to be adding.

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.350
Really cool functionality to our CMOS and extra functionality right.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.300
So the functionality that we want to add is very simple.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.780
Let's say I want to go to a post right and I'm on these polls right here number 37 and I want to go

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.930
backing any of these polls I would have to go to admin.

7
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.720
I will have to do all polls and I will have to click on edit.

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.970
I don't want to keep doing that.

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.290
That's a very long way to do that.

10
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.380
What I want to do.

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.120
I'm going to update the polls.

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.380
I want to add a link here if we are logged into our CMOS.

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
I want to be able to see a link here that comes up and says edit post.

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.380
And when I click on it it pulls it's going to take me straight to the edit post page so I can edit this

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.780
post.

16
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.320
All right.

17
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.100
So I don't have to go all around and see all this and undo all that looping around.

18
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.560
Right.

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.370
But anyway.

20
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.430
Let's go heading out there.

21
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.060
So the first thing that we need to do and I hope you're having a great day I'm having an awesome day.

22
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.120
I'm healthy.

23
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.490
I was sick for like a week and I feel really good now I'm healthy.

24
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.640
And then you know it takes only one day for you to realize how lucky you are to have health when it

25
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.900
takes only one sick day or two sick days to say you know what.

26
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.670
Wow.

27
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.240
You know I take for granted all the health that I get I should not take it for granted and enjoy it

28
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.660
while I'm healthy you know.

29
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.470
So that's what that's the kind of mood that I got right now.

30
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.410
But anyway.

31
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.260
Well thanks.

32
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.980
Let's go ahead and let's go to navigation.

33
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:44.130
We have to go to our CMS folder and if you don't know where we are I'm going to show you right now.

34
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.190
Actually Doc CIMS and then we're going to go to includes And we're going to go to these navigation right

35
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.700
here.

36
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.990
Right.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.250
That's where we are.

38
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.840
So we're going to go.

39
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.740
And every time I say the root it means to see a mass folder in there.

40
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.070
So let's go to navigation and here are navigation.

41
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.160
Let's go to all the way down where we comment is links out right here.

42
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.780
Well we're going to be doing is we're going to be using one of these links and we get the lead if we

43
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.080
wanted to and just use this one here.

44
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.820
I'm going to open it will be it be taxed since we're going to be doing some coding.

45
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.540
And we have this static link right there.

46
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.910
I just want you to be aware of it.

47
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.720
So let's close our BHP tax right there.

48
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.030
And so we're going to be doing a check here.

49
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.890
What I want to check is if I'm still logged in or a user still logged in I want to display the added

50
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.810
post when we are in the edit post page.

51
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.560
If we're not on the edit post page I don't want to display it.

52
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.190
So we need to do a check and we need to make sure that it is set.

53
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.910
So I'm going to make this a little bigger here.

54
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.890
All right.

55
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.540
Perfect.

56
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.260
So we're going to say if it's set.

57
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.930
And what do we want to check if it's set.

58
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.750
What do you think.

59
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.820
What is it.

60
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:19.530
What variable or thing is available through our or our site how can this CMOS know who we are.

61
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.310
Do you remember that feature that we added when we log in that personalizes or admin sessions if you

62
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.590
got it right congratulations you passed the test.

63
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.260
But anyways so we want to check if the sesshin is available and what session do you think.

64
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.690
Well it could be anything.

65
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.500
We said a whole bunch of sessions up right.

66
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.170
We set them up and we can check for even user Roe if we wanted to or I don't know user name whatever

67
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.580
we want and you can use this user role here converting to a variable and check if they uses an admin

68
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.840
or subscriber and let him see certain pages or certain links.

69
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.790
It's up to you what you want to do with it.

70
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.290
It's really cool.

71
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:09.120
But right now we're just checking to see if the user will if this session is set if it's set we're going

72
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.460
to do another check and we're going to do another if statement we're going to.

73
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.240
This is called a nested IF statement.

74
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.620
And we're going to check a GET requests.

75
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.390
Right.

76
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.030
Because we have a GET request on there you are now when we are looking at that post page we want to

77
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.290
make sure that it is there because if we do this without checking without using this set we're going

78
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.830
to get a big error on the page.

79
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.530
All right.

80
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.530
So if this is said then we want to do something else.

81
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.070
We want to do something now.

82
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.930
What we want to do is to echo a link like this like that.

83
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.590
All right.

84
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.060
And I'm was going to say this contract out of the I don't need that that's static.

85
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.740
All right.

86
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.340
So let's go a list item with a link and say.

87
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.160
All right.

88
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.100
Let's build that right now.

89
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.370
Ref because it's going to take us somewhere.

90
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.000
Let's close it right there.

91
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.690
And then here I'm just going to say edit post.

92
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.720
All right.

93
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.600
And now we get to think about it very hard.

94
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.140
What is it.

95
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.450
How are we going to redirect this user from the front of our site from here to the edit post page.

96
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.430
Well it's actually very simple if you're going to admin and you click on View or polls and you click

97
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.400
Edit you can see that you are all right here and this is the same Eurail that we've got to use with

98
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.970
a source parameter right here equaling the edit post that's how we get to the edit post page but then

99
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.150
we got to pass it to an actual parameter for the ID.

100
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.770
Right now remember we are in the room so we can actually go there and just type and post up BHB we need

101
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.680
to modify a little bit so it goes to the root.

102
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.390
Right.

103
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.570
So lets do that.

104
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.890
So actually night and we need to modify.

105
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.390
So he goes to the admin from the root.

106
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.460
All right.

107
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.760
So let's do that right now.

108
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.810
All right so so who won this link to go to admen next thing.

109
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.110
The first thing that we need to do is add the admin folder for the path right.

110
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.090
Then we add the page polls that ph because everything goes there and then we start adding the parameters.

111
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:37.280
The first parameter that we need to add remember is going to be the source equal to edit polls.

112
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.500
That way we can get to the edit speech.

113
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:49.050
So source and it's going to be equal to edit post then we are going to be adding another parameter and

114
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.010
if you remember how to do that if you don't remember I'm going to remind you right now.

115
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.660
All right.

116
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.400
We will use an ampersand right there and then we include the next parameter and that's Parama is going

117
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.500
to be the ID.

118
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.360
MP stands for.

119
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.510
Post ID right.

120
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.470
Post on the score ID and equal to what.

121
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.100
Well we need to get this from here.

122
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.550
He said we need to get that.

123
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:21.780
So let's actually convert this get request right here this you are l parameter right that we have on

124
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.340
top lets convert it to the pulse ID.

125
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.020
Why not we have the values there right.

126
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:35.730
If we get to a page that has a parameter if as a get request equal to this then we have the value of

127
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.070
there we have the idea of the post.

128
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:44.490
So lets use that and put it right here in brackets.

129
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.220
There we go.

130
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.580
So let's check this all right.

131
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:54.470
Admen posts that BHB sourceless good equals to edit posts.

132
00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.810
Perfit and pre-signed to divide the parameters be on the score ID equals to the boss ID.

133
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.100
This looks great.

134
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.000
I don't know about you but I'm feeling great.

135
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.850
All right.

136
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.850
Tiger from frosted flakes right.

137
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.860
So let's go to home site and we got an arrow there.

138
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:18.450
So it's unexpected something there let's just make sure that we clean that up.

139
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.110
All right.

140
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.540
So this is there.

141
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.010
We forgot a semicolon right here.

142
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.120
That's all.

143
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:23.840
Don't get scared.

144
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.470
Everything is good.

145
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.000
There we go.

146
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.630
So we bring in there so we.

147
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.610
We don't have any arrows here.

148
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.070
Remember we are navigation.

149
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:38.290
If we do that is set checking for any parameters that we would get an error there if we didn't do that.

150
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:44.370
But we don't have that so if we click on the title you see this link appear right there and we are on

151
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.750
the post page right.

152
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.420
So perfect.

153
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.000
And now click edit post and it takes us to that specific post number 37.

154
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.110
All right so let's click up real quick.

155
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.960
Let's go to actually update and added more posts.

156
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.970
And let's go to this one ID number 39.

157
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.280
I edit of the post you post.

158
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.870
We got the post right here.

159
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.020
Thirty nine.

160
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.610
We click on it and we see that we are in that specific post.

161
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.880
So we did a great job if you follow me all the way and you were able to do it.

162
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.560
Congratulations.

163
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:28.020
You landed a really cool technique right now that could pay you a lot of big bucks if you do for somebody

164
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.190
else.

165
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:28.670
All right.

166
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.850
So anyway it was a pleasure.

167
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.590
Thank you for watching my lectures and have a blessing day.

168
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.070
Take care
