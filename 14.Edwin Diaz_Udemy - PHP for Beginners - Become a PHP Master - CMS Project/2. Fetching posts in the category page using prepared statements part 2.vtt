00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.170
Welcome back my students before we go on I to explain to you why we're doing this well of course we're

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:13.530
doing this just to make a publication like 100 percent secure I almost 100 percent and a lot more secure

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.670
basically than what it is now.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.030
But one of the reasons why we were doing this and I'm doing this is because I notice first I want to

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.310
provide more value for the course.

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.110
But second I notice that if somebody comes here now to our application and they know database names

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.690
like like thousands of you know my database names and table names you can go ahead.

8
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.660
Basically create a query here and pull out information from the database and then log into the Web site

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.330
and basically delete information from there.

10
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.350
You can do a lot of damage.

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.520
Hackers can do a lot of damage.

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.460
So in order for us to prevent We cannot prevent that with my ask you all real SKAIFE string we can prevent

13
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.380
some stuff but we cannot prevent everything with this prepare statements.

14
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.040
We can because it's not going to take external data is not going to take its turn or data is going to

15
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.650
prepare.

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.770
And then he's going to execute it inside the application.

17
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.290
OK.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.290
So he's going to be different is going to be using a different process here than what he's going to

19
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.580
use down below.

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.650
When I show you the next functions OK so he's going to prevent all this stuff is really great.

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.570
But anyway let's continue with this.

22
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.100
So we have statement number one.

23
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.910
We have them no one asked them and number two what else.

24
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.780
Well we don't need this guy here anymore and we need a couple of functions here.

25
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.700
First of all we need to detect to see which statement we're sending in.

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:45.330
First of all we got a couple of variables and would be nice if we say listen if the SDM empty one is

27
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.180
this the SD empty one is ready then I want you to do this for me.

28
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.970
This what we're going to be doing we're going to be doing that for the and over to us.

29
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.680
Well but let's do that for this one first.

30
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.290
So we're going to say it's my you Elias TMT and first function that we're going to be using for this

31
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.040
is buying program.

32
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.720
OK.

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.950
And this is going to take an argument it's going to take this guy as an argument.

34
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.860
The second argument is going to take the format that placeholder is coming in.

35
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.600
So we know that this format is an integer right.

36
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.110
So we put another way if there was a string we put an s.

37
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.800
OK but we're putting an eye on this one then we're going to give it the value of that placeholder which

38
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.520
is puls category idea I believe.

39
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.310
Okay.

40
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.530
And then we can just execute it.

41
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.710
But we need another function for that.

42
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.590
Okay.

43
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.900
And the function is that SECU simple is we.

44
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.750
Why are we executing well.

45
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.810
The variable there SBM complicated variable name that I gave it.

46
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.740
OK.

47
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.420
And now if we were inserting code or updating or something like that this is done well because we are

48
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.950
fetching data we have to go another step and then we have to say listen I want to get I want to bind

49
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.560
the resource from this statement and it's going to take as an argument why results are you a binding

50
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.230
water where are you getting out of it.

51
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.170
Well let's.

52
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.780
And you can see here the object this guy here in the midst of variables.

53
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.500
OK.

54
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.970
So I'm going to grab one of these guys and I'm going to paste them in here.

55
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:40.860
Now one of them all of them I'm going to put the dollar symbol on them.

56
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.270
Whoops.

57
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.720
That's a for

58
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.650
to too there.

59
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.430
And this is poolside ID.

60
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.770
There we go.

61
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.110
Simple as that.

62
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.120
And then of course you closer here.

63
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.070
We're done with this one right.

64
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.520
But we need a now statement just in case this is not said.

65
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.540
What else you said.

66
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.460
Well we got the second parameter set.

67
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.820
I mean the second statement.

68
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.890
So let's do that one.

69
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.650
OK.

70
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.770
Just copy all this.

71
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.470
Put it right here.

72
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.920
Now we change this to two.

73
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.320
And now this is going to take two values.

74
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.730
First we have an integer and then we have a string here.

75
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.730
So we say integer and then the string was the first integer which is.

76
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.410
This is the first integer it was the second one.

77
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.010
The second one was a string because it's looking for string as a second.

78
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.770
So the string is going to be this guy he published which is a static stuff that we gave of their value.

79
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.780
OK.

80
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.480
Simple.

81
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.450
Now change this to two.

82
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.630
And if you guessed this one too you're completely right.

83
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.650
OK.

84
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.870
Pretty simple.

85
00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:03.170
Now we're doing this here and we've got to figure out how we can do this because we have to change is

86
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.920
we have to change it to as empty as empty as TMT actually sorry about the elves get confused with his

87
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.860
number this name as t t.

88
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.880
There we go.

89
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.890
And then what do you think is going to take is it going to take number one statement with one or statement

90
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.630
or two which statement.

91
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.910
What we don't know right.

92
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.460
So we got to make a functionality for this we got to create some type of variable that symbolizes both

93
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.240
fry that that means that reference is both.

94
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.630
So just in case is number one we assign it to this variable and if is number two we assign it to the

95
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.310
same variable because variables change right.

96
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.420
So just make sure that you have your semicolon there.

97
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.050
OK there we go then.

98
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.270
And now all we have to do here is get this guy and put him right here together.

99
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.890
Simple as that.

100
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.360
So this is looking pretty good.

101
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.800
I want you to digest this information.

102
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.930
And we're just going to recap a little bit if you understood it go to the next lecture.

103
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.740
But we're going to recap them and then we're going to go to the next election.

104
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.110
We are preparing the statement of course.

105
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.930
First we start with a new function that we created a couple of years ago.

106
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.630
We are starting with my as you apply prepare we are preparing it with the first parameter is a connection.

107
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.490
The second parameter is going to be the Querrey with the placeholders.

108
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.210
OK because that's how prepared statements work.

109
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.750
Then we assign whatever is coming back from them if it works we assign it to this will come for two

110
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.140
or four.

111
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.540
So you can put an if statement if in here if you want to.

112
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.670
OK.

113
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.070
And if it doesn't work then whatever you just die the the page.

114
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.480
Make sure he dies and you report some type of error and you can use my ass to apply error or for that

115
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.890
OK.

116
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.190
Oh I think I believe we have a function for that code from Querrey.

117
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.870
So we can use something like that.

118
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.830
But now guys like I say if you want more information about this BHB on the Web sites a bunch more.

119
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.110
But anyway so we do we do the same thing for the second Querrey here.

120
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:13.380
So the second statement but we have different requests here because we are requesting for two conditions

121
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.140
with this one and this one.

122
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.940
And of course because here you see him publish

123
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:30.330
here we cannot pull the string here we need it to make it a variable so we can really come and put this

124
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.000
whole thing here because it wouldn't work.

125
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.950
It wouldn't take that.

126
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.850
He has to be a variable so that's why we create a variable here for that specific functionality right

127
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:39.480
here.

128
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.460
OK.

129
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.080
So once we have these statements we are checking to see if they estimate and we're what is available

130
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.520
if not then we have a statement over to right or whatever else.

131
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.810
But if Stehman number one is ready we use this function to bind the statement number one make sure is

132
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.820
cast into an integer.

133
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.290
Make sure that we put the data that we are supposedly receiving.

134
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.180
We know that.

135
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.730
And then the value of that placeholder there then we execute it.

136
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.050
So this is in a different space or a different.

137
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.990
It uses a different process different protocol than what he uses here.

138
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.240
OK.

139
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.460
So that's why I ask you and it cannot happen because a preparer's it uses a different protocol once

140
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.570
it comes series using another one because it's already doing this inside the process.

141
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.640
OK.

142
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.420
So then we have binding that data.

143
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.830
OK we're telling it listen this two separate process.

144
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:37.560
Basically we're going to bind the statement to this data that we've got set up that placeholder and

145
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.900
we know that place is an integer and then we just executed.

146
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.470
And here because we're fetching we just fetching those resource we're binding that statement to these

147
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.670
variables.

148
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.710
OK.

149
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.620
Well the next lecture we're going to end this and we're going to make sure that it works around your

150
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.010
percent.

151
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.920
See you in the next one.

152
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.300
Take your
