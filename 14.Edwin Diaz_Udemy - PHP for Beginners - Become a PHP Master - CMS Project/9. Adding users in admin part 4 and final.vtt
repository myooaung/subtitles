00:00:00.780  -->  00:00:10.320
If you went ahead and used the code that we made on the last section on The Last Lecture on the AD user

2

00:00:10.950  -->  00:00:15.240
right here if you went ahead and tested this because it was complete already we didn't need to do anything

3

00:00:15.240  -->  00:00:16.150
else.

4

00:00:16.350  -->  00:00:18.420
What we needed to do is actually test it.

5

00:00:18.480  -->  00:00:21.640
So if we went ahead and did it you realize that it is working.

6

00:00:21.870  -->  00:00:28.690
So just to prove to you that it is working I can I'm going to go to users and you can see that I add

7

00:00:28.680  -->  00:00:30.660
any user what we're going to add right now.

8

00:00:30.660  -->  00:00:32.910
So that way you can see for yourself.

9

00:00:32.910  -->  00:00:35.970
So we're going to say William is the first name.

10

00:00:36.070  -->  00:00:42.150
Williams Let's just say I don't know.

11

00:00:42.150  -->  00:00:44.310
I don't even remember last names.

12

00:00:44.700  -->  00:00:52.650
Peterson I guess Peter's son and this just said This guy's a subscriber and they just say his name is

13

00:00:52.680  -->  00:00:55.060
Peter B or something.

14

00:00:55.170  -->  00:00:56.600
I just went blank there.

15

00:00:56.640  -->  00:01:03.590
I don't know about you but too much information overload can get you a blank.

16

00:01:04.110  -->  00:01:11.200
So let's do this and let's just say Peter.

17

00:01:11.220  -->  00:01:13.080
One two three and a user.

18

00:01:13.130  -->  00:01:21.250
We go to View now view polls view users we can see that we have we have a new user here.

19

00:01:21.510  -->  00:01:22.620
He's a subscriber.

20

00:01:22.620  -->  00:01:28.030
And that said we can go to the database also and look at that.

21

00:01:28.130  -->  00:01:29.140
All right.

22

00:01:29.340  -->  00:01:35.400
So we are able to to add different users here.

23

00:01:35.400  -->  00:01:36.390
Perfect.

24

00:01:36.810  -->  00:01:46.070
All right so the next thing would be to come here and to to go to View oppose action and not view polls

25

00:01:46.070  -->  00:01:51.090
of your users and work with this delete.

26

00:01:51.090  -->  00:01:54.510
All right so we're going to do that in the next lecture we're going to just leave this one the way it

27

00:01:54.510  -->  00:01:57.310
is and if you want to go ahead and start doing that.

28

00:01:57.390  -->  00:01:58.920
Go ahead and do it and try it.

29

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:00.920
It's basically the same thing with a pulse.

30

00:02:00.930  -->  00:02:02.410
All right so.

31

00:02:02.430  -->  00:02:04.140
Or comments.

32

00:02:04.500  -->  00:02:09.900
So if you want to go ahead like I say and try to do that well yourself and if it doesn't work no worries

33

00:02:09.900  -->  00:02:13.050
just do everything and then follow me.

34

00:02:13.050  -->  00:02:14.600
So that's lecture by by
