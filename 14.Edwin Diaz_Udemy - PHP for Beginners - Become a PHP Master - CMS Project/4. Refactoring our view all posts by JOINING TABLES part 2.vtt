00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.590
All right welcome back my dear student.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.070
So we're going to finish this off right here in this lecture.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.450
So we're putting all this information from here right now.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.690
The next thing for us to do is to come in this hour we don't need it anymore as a matter of fact you

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.700
can take it off but I'm just kind of comment it out and show you.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.950
Oops.

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.720
I'm going to select all this and comment.

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.660
All right.

9
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.160
So now where we are actually getting in the making all this square here just to get this cat to this

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.760
category tied right in that category ID burn.

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.950
What we're going to be doing now is we're going to be pulling out some more information from our virtual

12
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.390
table.

13
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.080
OK.

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.610
So we want to pull out.

15
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.010
And let's go to our BHB admin where is it if I can find it.

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.380
There we go.

17
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.760
So we want to pull out the cat title and the cat ID.

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.850
All right.

19
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.850
Why.

20
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.160
Just because we want to.

21
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.360
So Cat title and this is where it could get confusing.

22
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.130
Right remember that this table's I join now we can pull information from both tables and the information

23
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.490
that we're pulling is information that we got right here that we were asking for.

24
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.070
All right.

25
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.730
So we're going to say category title.

26
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.230
All right.

27
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.530
Let's do another one.

28
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.870
And carry ID here.

29
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.840
I don't even think we need a category ID but I just want to show you how you can pull that information

30
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.290
out.

31
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.040
But anyway save it.

32
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.720
Now back here.

33
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.350
We're down here where we come in this now.

34
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.780
Well we haven't yet let's comment this out.

35
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.350
And now here we're going to say category title category title saving.

36
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.410
And if we have any mistakes this is going to let us know when we refresh.

37
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.760
All right.

38
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.600
Unexpected in 1964 right that's fine line to 64.

39
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.440
That means we.

40
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.850
There we go.

41
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.050
We have this little common this owl saving

42
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.340
category title

43
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.810

44
2:33 Where is it.

45
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.860
This variable doesn't exist.

46
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.480
Let's make sure this is spelled correctly up here.

47
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.920
Yeah.

48
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.720
We have a capital C there.

49
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.450
So be careful with that right.

50
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.620
Save it now.

51
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.260
Enter And now you can see that we are displaying the category title according to whatever post we have

52
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.610
here.

53
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.680
Basically the same thing we had before but just we one Querrey.

54
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.740
All right.

55
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.930
Super simple to do.

56
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.800
Again let me just.

57
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.770
Actually I was going to take everything off and do it again so that way you can see that we are displaying

58
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.820
the same data.

59
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:06.520
So I'm going to do this and come and out.

60
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.970
All right.

61
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.220
I mean sure you say we come back here in a file refresh you going to see BHB in the bottom you going

62
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.630
to see all these javascript there.

63
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:28.830
Show you actually we see it backwards here and just that's because we're doing the order by id Querrey.

64
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.480
All right.

65
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.890
Order by id and we can do this in our new Querrey as well.

66
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.480
But as you can see here they are all javascript screen one is BHB.

67
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.660
So all right you get my point right there.

68
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.070
Come in this hour again this.

69
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.380
And let's actually do the order by ID right here.

70
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.640
So I'm going to grab this

71
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.230
kind of pizza right here.

72
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:05.040
But remember it's not post by ID it's posts dot by post you know post that post ID.

73
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.620
Right.

74
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.480
Just don't confuse that because that could give you a big problem.

75
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.570
All right let's come in this hour you can take it off if you want.

76
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.790
All right.

77
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.470
Save it.

78
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.880
Make sure we have this come back here and boobs again.

79
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.190
Sorry about that.

80
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.310
I keep forgetting this little guy right here.

81
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.540
There we go.

82
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.440
Same thing again.

83
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.960
All right but we are making one query so this page is a lot faster now right.

84
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.910
So now I do have an idea how this is done.

85
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.840
Review this video a couple of times until you get it.

86
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.450
Well this is super easy.

87
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.210
All right we're selecting all this.

88
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.910
All right.

89
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.530
And then we're doing our conditions right here.

90
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.150
We're saying from polls we left join in at that table you can play around with it and do this through

91
00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.170
your application that way you make less square as you make your application faster and it's cleaner.

92
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.960
That way you don't have to have more coding here that you don't need.

93
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.210
All right we can take this off.

94
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.730
We wanted to oh this clean this up a little bit.

95
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.910
All right.

96
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.380
Remember the goal is to clean things up to make things with less code.

97
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.430
And you know which just more portable so that where you can you know keep doing the same thing over

98
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.380
and over again without writing too much code.

99
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.770
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

100
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.630
I hope this helped you a lot and I'll see you in the next one.

101
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.170
Thank you
