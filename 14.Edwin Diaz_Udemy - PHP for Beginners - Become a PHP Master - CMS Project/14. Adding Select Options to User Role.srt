1

00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:06,060
All right on the last lecture we were able to displace on data from the database here depending on why

2

00:00:06,060  -->  00:00:08,830
use it we have select the here right one click Edit.

3

00:00:08,850  -->  00:00:13,860
We get this parameter and depending on the parameter we make a query pull this information from the

4

00:00:13,860  -->  00:00:16,640
database for this specific user right.

5

00:00:16,860  -->  00:00:25,170
So now the last thing for this is for displaying data here is being able to display the dynamic options

6

00:00:25,170  -->  00:00:26,290
right here.

7

00:00:26,730  -->  00:00:30,330
So for that we need a little bit of coding there and let's do it right now.

8

00:00:30,330  -->  00:00:35,620
Let's go to the select option and that will be right here.

9

00:00:35,760  -->  00:00:40,660
And what I want to do is I want to put some BHB here what we want to do right.

10

00:00:40,680  -->  00:00:44,700
Because you're supposed to be doing this with me hopefully.

11

00:00:44,700  -->  00:00:51,840
All right the first thing that we want to do is display a default option.

12

00:00:52,080  -->  00:00:55,560
So this default option is going to be cold.

13

00:00:56,250  -->  00:00:59,260
Well we're going to be pulling this information from the database right now.

14

00:00:59,290  -->  00:01:09,290
As a matter of fact BHB Eckel and we're going to call the user role.

15

00:01:09,290  -->  00:01:11,730
All right.

16

00:01:11,730  -->  00:01:12,090
All right.

17

00:01:12,100  -->  00:01:14,160
So let's check it out and see how that works.

18

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:14,510
All right.

19

00:01:14,520  -->  00:01:19,770
So we are displaying these guys are admen and we can verify that we can go to your users and we can

20

00:01:19,770  -->  00:01:22,960
see that we're always anatman the right click on it again.

21

00:01:22,980  -->  00:01:24,780
Perfect.

22

00:01:24,780  -->  00:01:28,050
Let's go ahead and do that and do the rest.

23

00:01:28,050  -->  00:01:32,770
So what we're going to do is we're going to create an if statement here and we're going to say if user

24

00:01:32,780  -->  00:01:33,780
roll.

25

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:34,870
Right.

26

00:01:35,190  -->  00:01:45,420
It's equal to what to the strain what ad men we're going to do something if this admin We want to display

27

00:01:45,420  -->  00:01:53,250
the subscriber because that way we can give the user the chance to change it to a subscriber.

28

00:01:53,260  -->  00:02:01,770
All right so let's go ahead and change this double quotes here so that we can echo this properly put

29

00:02:01,770  -->  00:02:03,180
the double cords there.

30

00:02:03,180  -->  00:02:11,310
Make sure you close your statement with a semi-colon there and then if it's not an admin then we're

31

00:02:11,310  -->  00:02:15,600
going to say else we're going to play the admin one.

32

00:02:15,660  -->  00:02:21,900
So if it's a subscriber we're going to display admin so that where we can give the option to change

33

00:02:21,940  -->  00:02:24,830
to admin.

34

00:02:24,830  -->  00:02:29,460
All right this is going to come out great you're going to see.

35

00:02:29,460  -->  00:02:31,080
All right perfect.

36

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:33,500
I think we're good to go here.

37

00:02:33,510  -->  00:02:33,970
All right.

38

00:02:34,170  -->  00:02:38,260
So let's go ahead and check that out and see how everything is working.

39

00:02:38,640  -->  00:02:39,970
Save it.

40

00:02:40,050  -->  00:02:45,510
Come back here and then we can see that he's adamant and then we get the they subscribe and we can send

41

00:02:45,510  -->  00:02:47,240
those parameters.

42

00:02:47,310  -->  00:02:49,910
You see that perfect.

43

00:02:50,190  -->  00:02:53,060
So let's go ahead and change something here.

44

00:02:53,060  -->  00:02:56,230
Let's just make sure this is all lowercase.

45

00:02:56,790  -->  00:03:00,750
That's fine since this is lowercase here.

46

00:03:00,750  -->  00:03:04,610
I don't want that to look on uniform.

47

00:03:04,620  -->  00:03:05,300
Right.

48

00:03:05,310  -->  00:03:07,260
Actually I put an age there.

49

00:03:07,440  -->  00:03:09,250
Geez.

50

00:03:09,500  -->  00:03:10,750
We go.

51

00:03:11,150  -->  00:03:11,570
OK.

52

00:03:11,580  -->  00:03:12,970
Perfect.

53

00:03:13,680  -->  00:03:14,890
That's working great.

54

00:03:14,910  -->  00:03:19,310
And then that's the lecture we're going to finally update this form and make it work.

55

00:03:19,430  -->  00:03:19,910
Right.

56

00:03:20,100  -->  00:03:21,860
So I see you then take care
