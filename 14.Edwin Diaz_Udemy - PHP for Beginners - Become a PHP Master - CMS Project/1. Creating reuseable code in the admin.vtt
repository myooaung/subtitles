WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.700
All right so we are kind of done for the first section.

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.020
Here we have a post showing we have categories on the right side.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.610
We've got categories on the top and navigation area.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.890
We got the search engine working we have a widget we use.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.840
So reusable cold here that we can use as well as a widget.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.360
What we need is and this will probably be in the course later on actually it will be laid on because

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.310
their original original A My sister has a logging system and we're going to create another part of the

8
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.650
sidebar here to log in to our system even though this one the template doesn't have that.

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.680
We're going to create one.

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.360
All right.

11
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.390
And we're also going to be creating a registration page.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.640
Well that's that's like an extra feature and we will be doing that but right now we don't need to do

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.840
that.

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.960
We're concerned about doing things from the admin area right now and being able to create this without

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470
going manually and putting data in there.

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.210
All right.

17
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.220
So I want to be able to create is automatically all this data here.

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.300
So for that we need to go to the admin side.

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.110
So if you type in here admin after they see a mass folder you're going to be redirected directed to

20
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.220
that.

21
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.930
In that stoppie be in the admin folder right.

22
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.180
And this is the admin for that.

23
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.840
And we can see that it has a whole bunch of fields here of course none of them work.

24
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.090
Just for this demonstration purposes only.

25
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.640
And we're going to be cleaning up some of these files content here element in things like that.

26
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.000
So let's go ahead and do that right now as a matter of fact.

27
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.650
The first thing that we need to do is add a little link right here so that we wouldn't have to keep

28
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.510
typing this all the time.

29
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.810
So let's open our brackets editor here and let's go ahead and

30
00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:00.460
let's go to navigation and we are displaying all the navigations from here.

31
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.570
But let's add another link here.

32
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.010
When we finish this

33
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.380
ph be cold right here.

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:20.370
Let's just comment this out and I did that by pressing command forward slash and I'm just going to come

35
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.890
in these other out and I'm going to leave this on here make sure we have that they're available.

36
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.700
I'm just going to type in admin there and this should be in here also.

37
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.750
So let's see that

38
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.530
we have that.

39
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.680
Then there were click on it takes us to the.

40
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.160
And it just make sure they capitalize at least in the beginning here is better.

41
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.600
All right.

42
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.280
So we don't have to.

43
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.460
And now we want to do also is that I don't want to keep typing in that either.

44
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.860
So I'm going to put a link here somewhere to take me to that Web site.

45
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.290
I mean to that home page right.

46
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.190
So that is in and it's in the admin folder right here.

47
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.130
And it's we have to organize all these data.

48
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.100
By the way.

49
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.690
But let me just put the link here somewhere if I can find what it is.

50
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.830
John Smith So what I'm going to do if I can't find data like this.

51
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.330
I don't know.

52
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.910
I'm going to type in command to see if this editor has a fine feature and does and I'm just going to

53
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.060
type in John there John.

54
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.590
And he found it right here is it was right in front of me all this time.

55
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.530
So John has some type some data there with him and that's amble over there of type in John if I right

56
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:05.400
click on it and inspect Elam and Google Chrome I can see that data here and in a nav bar right here

57
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.090
has a drop down and now you just analyze it to see where I'm going to be placing does

58
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.630
this link.

59
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.000
Right.

60
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.310
We have a lot information you don't want to make a mistake and then mess everything up.

61
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.210
I think this is the data right here.

62
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.090
So I'm going to put a long

63
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.650
list item right here and just going to say I want you to take me back to.

64
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.490
And it's the be and two that's just going to take me back there and save it.

65
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:55.630
First refresh fresh here and do not do anything because I think we'd put it somewhere else.

66
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.270
Let's go back to it.

67
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.030
It's use right click on and see where we are.

68
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.570
We need to be

69
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.740
this little bird here is just try and play hard to get not Bart.

70
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.640
Tough.

71
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.470
Top right top.

72
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.540
All right.

73
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.010
So let's take this idea.

74
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.000
Here it looks like he's now here it looks like.

75
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.640
But I see it there.

76
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.190
And if we go ahead and

77
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.110
of course he's not one that we won't be able to see it is there actually but we won't be able to see

78
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.870
unless we pull something there right.

79
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.450
So Web site home page home site site.

80
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.280
I just got home sites for now.

81
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.760
And as you can see here it's going to take us back there and can go back to admin there.

82
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.170
All right perfect.

83
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.780
All right so let's clean up the this page really quick because we're running out of time here.

84
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.100
And let's take out let's do the same thing we did in the other and the other for their home page and

85
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.660
it's make includes folder here.

86
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.150
Actually not a file.

87
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.430
Keep making files.

88
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:34.040
Let's take that off site admin and delete is actually right click on a folder called includes the clothes.

89
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.920
All right.

90
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:42.270
And in saying colludes and in the right click and make a file called the header that BHP make a file

91
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.670
called the footer.

92
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.320
Ph be.

93
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.190
There we go.

94
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:55.900
Let's go back to the index and we go we are in say admin.

95
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.350
All right.

96
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.360
So this is the admin I that's.

97
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.230
And let's get this out of here

98
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.370
let's make it crude and didn't just take it all.

99
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.820
I took it off with command or control.

100
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:20.750
All right so just in case you take it off and don't copy it don't make that mistake.

101
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.080
I mean you take it off and don't copy it.

102
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:29.400
Make sure that you take it off with Kemang ads or right click on our Whatever you need to do to have

103
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.690
that data there don't lose it or control Z just to do that stuff.

104
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.270
All right.

105
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:42.360
Include unless you include make sure that we put the for the where it is includes.

106
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:52.590
Header that BHP right now doesn't have anything save it come back to the header form and then go back

107
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.980
to that file and take out the footer.

108
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.720
A lot of data is here.

109
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.690
You see why why not go ahead and take it.

110
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:07.740
Get rid of some of this stuff here and that's fine let's just minimize this a little bit.

111
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.830
And is Forder.

112
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.860
It looks complicated right.

113
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:22.150
Container it is because we don't have a regular footer for this Admin Page.

114
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.940
This is the ID wrapper of everything and it should be the footer right here.

115
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.920
Subheading dashboard.

116
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.520
Actually

117
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:37.370
let's go back to adamant because we have a lot of you see there's name even he doesn't even have a footer

118
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:46.280
so that all that data there we're just content there it's content from navigation mostly.

119
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.940
But this here is the ID wrapper.

120
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.820
This is the whole idea Rob for for the whole thing navigational.

121
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.760
And I just want is to be like the content basically.

122
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.880
So because I pay page heading

123
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:17.840
there's actually a page heading that something else this is taking was all the way down to the.

124
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.080
That's a wrapper one to go here.

125
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.300
There we go.

126
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.470
And this could be maybe the page count or something.

127
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.700
Keep taking the wrapper

128
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.670
wherever you go.

129
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.520
All right.

130
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.420
So this would be the footer of this.

131
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.460
All right so let's take this out

132
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.220
and let's convert it into the foot right here.

133
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.950
Save it.

134
00:09:53.310 --> 00:10:02.610
Come back to him that's And let's use this function the same thing down here and it's just a footer

135
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.730
here.

136
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:14.260
If we change this this is you can see that that is here.

137
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.750
All right so we've got the heading here and we're going to put whatever now for the heading something

138
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:25.250
like welcome to admin.

139
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.770
All right.

140
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:32.490
And this would be probably the alter name and we're going to do some dynamic data here later on we're

141
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.390
going to put it here.

142
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.740
OK.

143
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:42.990
So we're going to take this break from out of here.

144
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.770
All right.

145
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.510
I need that.

146
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.960
Let's take this out too.

147
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.880
All right.

148
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.850
So I think we're done actually right now.

149
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.390
This is where we're going to be putting some of these data come here.

150
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.690
Now we got that.

151
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.620
All right.

152
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.380
We're not going to be putting anything here now.

153
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.080
Just know that we are just organizing some of this stuff.

154
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:19.930
And let's go ahead and take out some of this navigation real quick and said a lot of navigation right.

155
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.960
This is an obligation right here.

156
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.620
Really huge navigation

157
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.000
systems make sure that that's the navigation.

158
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.730
Let's just take it out of here.

159
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:40.410
All of it in navigation.

160
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.440
Right.

161
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.770
Right clicking here again and it's called is navigation

162
00:11:52.260 --> 00:12:00.590
actually going to make its fall here and we need to put it includes actually right click on it and call

163
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:12.900
this now the nation of HP and to perfect this piece that in there are for this go back to and it's used

164
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.780
that function to include navigation.

165
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.460
This looks a lot better now right.

166
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:27.850
You got that out of the way navigation BHP.

167
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.150
All right.

168
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.390
So a lot better than before.

169
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.220
So anyway I think I'm going to just end the video here and we're going to continue some of this stuff
