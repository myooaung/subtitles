1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,920
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,320
Media students so it's time for us to start actually creating our all the functionality that we need

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,510
in our registration that BHB and that is for checking the e-mail.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,010
All right.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,520
We already have one that checks the user name.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,700
We need another one that checks the e-mail.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:26,100
And then we're going to start more refine our form just to our registration page just to make it better

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,010
than what it is right now.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,950
We have a lot of cold here that I would like to fix and make better.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,250
So let's actually create that real quick.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,940
Let's go to functions and what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this because this email Wise's function

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,040
is going to be very similar to the user name of Jesus right.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:55,060
So we're just going to say e-mail I exist this is going to take an e-mail right.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,720
We're going to have database connection

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,820
and we're going to check the mail the user e-mail column.

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,180
This is going to be an e-mail as well.

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,880
And this is going to be the user e-mail.

18
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,420
All right.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:35,760
Basically the senting is a very similar to let's just put this here make it a line.

20
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,640
All right.

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:44,880
All right.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,600
So I don't see anything wrong with this one here.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,050
I'm going to leave it the way it is.

24
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,710
We're going to check this anyway you're welcome to check in right now if you want but what I want to

25
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,610
do is I want to fix this for him right here.

26
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,320
All right.

27
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,860
I want to fix it.

28
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,230
I want to remove a lot of things from here and just make it a lot better.

29
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,510
All right.

30
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,820
We want to be able to.

31
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,020
Every time we register a user we want to be able to redirect the users somewhere else right redirect

32
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,400
into admin because they already register right.

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,510
Unless you want to put them in a queue where you you know you set the user manually but if you have

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,310
a Web site that kind of large you might now want to do that.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,450
You might want to just register the user and then if the use is causing some trouble delete them or

36
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,060
sent them idle banned them from your Web site.

37
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,030
So right now we're going to register the user and we're going to redirect them to admin.

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,070
And if you know if this doesn't work we're going to redirect them back to this forum of course.

39
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,100
So we need to build a functionality for that.

40
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:52,260
What I have in mind is also this the head or function that we have we're doing a lot of head a redirection

41
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,360
like this is it will be very nice to create a little Hendee function that we do that for us instead

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,290
of us writing this all the time manually.

43
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,000
So let's actually build a little quick function here.

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,410
We're going to call a redirect and it's going to take a location

45
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,240
and we're just going to return

46
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,410
something from this function.

47
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,400
We're going to re turn this concatenate this and that's it.

48
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,770
All right.

49
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,590
So very simple to create a function call right.

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,790
What else do we need.

51
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,850
All right.

52
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,550
So let's go back to registration here.

53
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,670
What can we do to make this better.

54
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,200
Why can we do.

55
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,560
I want you to look at really good guys.

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,280
Would these be nice to put in a function a register function.

57
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,700
Something that can register the user instead of us having all this code.

58
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,300
Here are restrictions that BHB we should have this code in functions at BHB.

59
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:14,120
All right so let's create that let's create this register function and this function here the redirect

60
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,120
let's just put it all the way on top here.

61
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:23,430
So the function to have this is put it there let's go all the way to the bottom there here and let's

62
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,350
just create a function to register the user register a user.

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,060
All right.

64
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,320
And this function is of course going to take the user name is going to take the e-mail the user is going

65
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:48,600
to take the password the user password and we go very simple.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,740
All right.

67
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:58,050
So first of all we need a global connection.

68
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,810
Beautiful.

69
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,830
And actually we have all this cold right here.

70
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,320
But we needed a connection.

71
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,610
We have all this cold here.

72
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,250
This is see where this ends.

73
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,690
These ants right here so I'm going to take all these out.

74
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,600
It's message thing.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,150
All right.

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,690
And let's just take all this and see what we can do with it.

77
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,100
All right.

78
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,580
Look at that.

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,920
That's looking a lot better now.

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,190
All right guys let's put it right here and let's see what we can do with it.

81
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,870
Let's fix it up a little nicer and put this call right here.

82
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,390
Whoops

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,650
push code there.

84
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,200
Everything's here a little bit

85
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,770
more that way.

86
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,700
All right there is a couple of things that we're going to be doing here.

87
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,340
But we already have a confirmed Querrey here.

88
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,420
So we don't need to use this.

89
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,570
We have a confirmed query somewhere I just want to make sure so we don't need to see we already don't

90
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,190
need something we don't need this guy here.

91
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:41,640
We just need to use a function call from Querrey and then we just say register use a query like this.

92
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,160
There we go.

93
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,670
All right.

94
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,050
So that's even looking a lot better now.

95
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,680
Right.

96
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,720
So we just want to take this in here.

97
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,190
Look at that.

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,970
Looking a lot cleaner right.

99
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,450
All right.

100
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,540
So go ahead and finish this up.

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,770
All right just the way I'm doing it right now.

102
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:17,130
And on the next lecture we're going to continue cleaning this up a little more and figuring it out figuring

103
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,170
this thing out.

104
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,630
How we are we can make it a lot better than what it is right now.

105
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:21,930
Right.

106
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,960
So right now we are moving all the coal that was here.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,120
Most of it by because we got a little bit left and we are putting it in a function.

108
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:40,290
But we also need to be able to register the user logged in the user and redirect the user right.

109
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,910
So this race or function is going to be doing a couple of things.

110
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,120
And I also want to Dady K or create another piece of code which is going to be able to log in the user

111
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,950
a swell we have this code here so we're already repeating ourselves right.

112
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:03,720
We need to log in the user you know functions that BHB and this register the user function we need to

113
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,860
already log in the user from here.

114
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,440
So we would need to write this whole function.

115
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,640
Again we don't want to do that.

116
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,850
So what I want to do is I want to take all this code out of here put it in a function so that we can

117
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,010
use it wherever we want.

118
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,270
All right I'll see you in the next lecture where we're going to be learning how to do that.

119
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,260
See you then.
