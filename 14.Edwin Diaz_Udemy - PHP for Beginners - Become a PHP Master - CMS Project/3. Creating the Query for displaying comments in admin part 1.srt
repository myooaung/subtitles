1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,700
All right so we got the comments displaying the same thing as the viewer polls.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:11,160
We've got the same table there but we need to do is make this table bring data about comments.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,140
Right.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,430
So we need some information here.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,620
First we need the I.D. They all there that's fine.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,700
It's a matter of fact that is totally fine.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,860
All that information there what else do we need from the comments.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,190
We need the e-mail so we got the author actually.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,620
Let's have the comments right here.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,970
I think is more important.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,470
And we're going to be changing the header.

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:47,360
And by the way we are in the view on this score on the score comments that BHB inside includes in sigh

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,010
the admin.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,710
All right.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,370
We have the right here on top is the path.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,590
Just in case you don't remember.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So what else we want to bring from there.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,310
We want to bring the e-mail the status.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,970
Actually we had it right there.

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,990
And let's bring another field in response to

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,210
that feel that we are going to be putting the title of the specific post where the comment was made

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:24,860
too.

23
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,890
All right.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,220
We're going to see a proof here.

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,560
And this is going to be the opposite of a proof.

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,010
Don't.

27
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,820
We're going to be able to approve or approve comment and then delete

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,670
on other important data that we might need is a date.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,780
Let's bring the date of the comment.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,040
That way we know the date right.

31
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:59,070
So let's bring it up to springeth right here.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,200
All right so we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

33
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:13,020
Well that's a lot of information here and we need to change some of this too right because we are our

34
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,340
columns are named differently in.

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,210
That table comment alter what else we bring it in.

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,820
Calm and content right.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,800
Let's actually check that the table so that way we know exactly what we're bringing in coming Id impose

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:39,150
ID and put it right here so that I know exactly what I'm bringing in.

39
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,970
There we go.

40
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,740
That way we can see exactly what's going on.

41
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,880
So the comment Id comment posts ID

42
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,070
and what else become an an.

43
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:06,040
This just copy this one here right into this one here and into this one since we have the first comment.

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,890
All right.

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:16,020
Coming up Id comment author and if you want you can go ahead and you know it

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,820
says you probably can type faster than me.

47
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,810
I got like five screens in front of me so it's sometimes a little distracting.

48
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,980
Right.

49
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:43,700
So all right come in and start as an uncommon date.

50
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,340
All right so we are getting all those fields we don't need this here.

51
00:03:47,670 --> 00:04:00,980
And let's just go ahead and make these variables come impuls ID with no hopes post

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:13,500
come and e-mail come in content as the comment itself come.

53
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,740
That is Whoops again and come into it.

54
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,990
All right.

55
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,220
That is a lot of great information there.

56
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,560
So we're going to be the plaintiffs in the to your role like we did for the.

57
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:41,300
So let's actually comment this is play the common ID right here pulls ID and a display that we don't

58
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,230
actually need to play that one as we're bringing in and that in response.

59
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,400
But I'll show you right now in a minute comment alter.

60
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:58,200
Let's just play that right here comment e-mail.

61
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,690
Should actually have the comment content before the e-mail.

62
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,920
I think so.

63
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,210
More important data right.

64
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,880
So we got one two three four five six seven.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,980
All right.

66
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,170
And it looks good right now.

67
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,910
The title we don't have a title for this but we have the content

68
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,690
here.

69
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,210
What else do we got from the comment e-mail we got that e-mail.

70
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,010
Even though right here the content is before the image before they can't and that's fine.

71
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,190
We don't need to worry about that here we're making a query here on this one here so what we are going

72
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,130
to be making equerry on this one is going to be that we're going to select we're going to do a query

73
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:57,270
here to find the polls actually and related to this comment later on but right now let's finish up this

74
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,310
form.

75
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,270
And as a matter of fact I'm going to

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,590
comment that for now coming content.

77
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,480
We need the comment e-mail after that.

78
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,730
Whoops.

79
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,220
That's just the history here.

80
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,610
Come into e-mail

81
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,080
and we don't need this image here.

82
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,630
Let's take that out.

83
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,080
Come and e-mail content.

84
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,950
Do we have the author.

85
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:40,640
Now we don't have the alters on just going to come with it come right here.

86
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:49,620
Are content e-mail down here and status and date

87
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,270
and date.

88
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,950
All right.

89
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,760
And this just take this out of here we are going to be live in the edit

90
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,020
and delete.

91
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:18,960
We are also going to be needing proof fields so we might as well make that right now.

92
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,700
All right.

93
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,120
Going to be live in this.

94
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,930
You going to see a proof here

95
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,120
and this is just an essay on to prove

96
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,300
prove it in the least.

97
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,900
Of course when it's in different parameters here.

98
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,490
Right.

99
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,940
So that's about it.

100
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,560
That's all we need for this.

101
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:53,070
Here we're going to be making a different query and we're going to be selecting everything from comments

102
00:07:53,070 --> 00:08:01,530
here to fix that and select comments fits that too.

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,610
OK.

104
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,200
So we are done.

105
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,070
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten.

106
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,590
And here we go.

107
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,390
Four five six seven eight nine ten.

108
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,100
All right.

109
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,060
So I think this video is long enough.

110
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,020
You can go ahead.

111
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,880
I'm going to go slowly scrolling here so that we're you composite and copy everything have done whatever

112
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,130
you need to copy it to.

113
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,410
All right.

114
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,650
And on the last lecture we're going to finish it up.

115
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,520
All right thanks a lot.

116
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,510
And I see your next one.

117
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,210
Take care.
