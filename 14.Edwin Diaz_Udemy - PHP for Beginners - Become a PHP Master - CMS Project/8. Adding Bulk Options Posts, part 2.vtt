1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.730
All right so we are looking good.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.370
We have to add a couple a couple of things here we need to add the radio bands right here to select

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.240
everything and we need what each individual radio button right.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.570
So let's go ahead and do that.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.200
Probably.

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.860
All right.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.130
Let's go ahead and do that.

8
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.280
I was going to do something else say something else but that's fine.

9
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.900
So first we need to go to the heading and we need to add this another heading right here.

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.330
So why would the heading be.

11
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.680
Well we need it to be a t h input right.

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:48.800
So let's make it input and the type is actually a checkbox is not a radio button.

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.430
All right.

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:59.220
And Id We need to give it an ID because we need to use javascript and I do have a course in javascript

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.600
if we want to learn Javascript in BHB and Javascript Zych actually is why you need for web development.

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.080
Those are the most important things.

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.070
Once you know the mail and c he says in this markup languages and studying languages then you need javascript

18
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.320
and BHB right so I have a good course on that.

19
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.040
Select all boxes we're going to name this.

20
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.030
Perfect.

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.600
All right.

22
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.580
So let's go back and see how that looks.

23
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.680
Refresh and we can see that we have a checkbox right here.

24
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.410
All right.

25
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.450
So we need to have more checkboxes here on the left side.

26
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:47.180
All right so for that we are going to be actually echoing something before everything else are right

27
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.630
here.

28
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.710
This is the first echo that we making right here.

29
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.290
This is the cat title right here for this one.

30
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.150
We need to echo that right here and it has to be an input.

31
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.360
So first we need to put the T in there.

32
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.900
Close it out.

33
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.350
And this put the input here of course and I'm going to get any Let's get it from here.

34
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.290
Get the input from.

35
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.080
Here we go

36
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.770
here.

37
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.730
Let's take out the chords.

38
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.330
We don't need to make a single quotes since we are inside BHB right.

39
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:47.130
And I'm just going to give this a class actually besides the I'm not an ID but a class of

40
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.640
checkboxes.

41
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.300
All right type checkbox that's fine.

42
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:07.140
And then you could as a matter of fact you know what I feel.

43
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.300
Let's take this out of here because I want to know what we are doing here.

44
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.010
So I'm just going to not echo this anymore.

45
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.480
And this just break BHB right here.

46
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.640
And then I started back here again and take this to the right here for the right here that way.

47
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.010
Clean to us right.

48
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.530
That way we know exactly what we were doing.

49
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.760
It's very it looks cleaner.

50
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.700
So we have this highlighting right.

51
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:52.090
So check box here and we are also getting have to give it a name and a value and the name actually.

52
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.420
And we can use double quotes.

53
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.860
Now that's fine.

54
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.960
Let's just keep using single call since we are using those.

55
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.310
Now here is the fun part.

56
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.290
All right you're going to probably tell me why in the world are you doing.

57
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.350
Well we need to give these actually as a value.

58
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.230
We need to make this an array.

59
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.890
And I got to tell you in a minute why we need to make this an array is going to be an empty array.

60
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.120
All right.

61
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.490
All right.

62
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.300
So check this out.

63
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.300
All right so now that we have this check box here the way that we find each value of this check box

64
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.160
is when we click it right.

65
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:45.350
Then we get information once we click that we get this guy right here right automatically Well the form

66
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.160
has to be submitted.

67
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.780
Of course when we click Apply and this name matches it is going to go to the polls.

68
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.140
So pro-global right.

69
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.260
As an array.

70
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.760
But right now they are always empty so we send it the way it is is going to be empty.

71
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.840
We need to provide a value before we send it in.

72
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.470
So what what value are we going to be sending.

73
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.860
Well let's put the value right here value

74
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.410
and the value is going to be what you think divided is going to be.

75
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.540
You tell me.

76
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.320
I think right now.

77
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.720
Tell me what you think the value is going to be.

78
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.880
Well you can't tell me.

79
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.180
But if you save the post ID you are correct.

80
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.630
Think about it like this.

81
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.150
You click here.

82
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.420
You need to provide this specific I.D. for this specific post to be able to delete that specific post

83
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.930
or delete this one.

84
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:51.570
So we need to feel that way we have IDs of our polls that we want to delete.

85
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.330
This is an empty array right now.

86
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.410
The valley is an empty array.

87
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.180
Right.

88
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.330
So the Post IDs this one right here right.

89
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.110
Great.

90
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.770
All right.

91
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.430
So just put the value right here and we need to just make sure that you echo it.

92
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.240
There we go.

93
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.500
All right.

94
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.190
Perfect.

95
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.730
As you can see now it's good.

96
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.800
Good to go.

97
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.370
All right.

98
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.060
So anyways I think we are.

99
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.460
We're done with this lecture here.

100
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.480
I don't want it to get too long and the next one we're going to end up.

101
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.390
I think we we need to make another piece of coal that it's not too large but it's normal large.

102
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.860
Right.

103
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.870
But anyway I hope you're having fun having a lot of fun and I know you're learning good great things

104
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.200
things that we help you in the future.

105
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.480
And I'm really grateful to be able to teach you this.

106
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.100
So I see you the next lecture right.

107
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.650
Take care
