00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.570
High on this video I'm going to show you how to create a database using Ph.D. my admin.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.190
So let's go to your browser.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.060
Let's open the browser.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.920
First of all and you can click localhost you can type in localhost and therefore slash ph be my admin.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.350
I already have it here my history.

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.520
Right.

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.660
So click on databases and type in any name you want for your database name logging app is the one that

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.650
I'm going to create.

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.700
And then I click Create and then we have our database right here we have a couple of databases here

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.850
that we now using that were created automatically with BHP miasmic.

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.810
So I'm going to click on it and you can see that you can create a database here but we are not going

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.180
to do that right now.

13
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.920
Wow.

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.090
I will be showing you a couple of different settings here.

15
00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:00.850
So here only ask you how you can create a database or you can run as you all queries here on your database.

16
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.630
You can do many different things with it right.

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.730
This would be as.

18
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:15.000
By the way so you can create a database like this if you want to create then you type in database and

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.020
the name on the database that you want to create.

20
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.790
And and this example is just to name example.

21
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.760
Very descriptive right.

22
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.970
And then click OK and then you see the database right here and here you will see that it's green.

23
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030
That means it created something for you.

24
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.650
In this case it was a database for us.

25
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.210
All right.

26
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.940
So let me show you how to delete it.

27
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.960
Let's click on it.

28
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.640
That's my file.

29
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.790
We don't need to click on the database so we can just click on the homepage right here and click on

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.360
databases.

31
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.880
Now you got all your databases here and you can do things with it.

32
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.360
You can check your privileges or you can drop it.

33
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.780
So I'm just going to drop the one that I may call example and to click here.

34
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.110
That's how you deleted and click OK.

35
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.690
All right.

36
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.410
Perfect.

37
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.150
So now we created our database that we have right here called logging app and on the next video we're

38
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.880
going to show you how to create a table and then later to put some data into it.

39
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.280
Anyway thank you so much for watching.

40
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.670
I'll see you in the next lecture.
