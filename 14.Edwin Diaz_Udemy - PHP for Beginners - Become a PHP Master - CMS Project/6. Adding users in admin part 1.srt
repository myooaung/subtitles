1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,320
All right so we are able to see some information from our table users say we're in a database.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,990
Now what I really want to do and I have going to target one of these yet what I really want to do is

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,160
go ahead and why not just add the users add user pilpul page.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,640
Right.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,160
Let's go adding that page where we can use this to our interface so that way then we can start doing

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,720
the leading and improving and doing other things right.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,540
So let's go ahead and do that.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,980
I like to switch things around.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,820
I don't like to be neutral or like to be boring you know.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,890
The more I switch around from one place to the other the more you learn the more you exercise your brain

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,020
and the more information gets stuck in your brain.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,510
Right.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,470
So let's go ahead and let's add users and let's go to the user page right here and let's see how that

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,440
looks first.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,530
All right so let's see if we got it right here at the user.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:58,990
All right.

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,060
We're not even going to page yet.

18
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,050
That See includes the user.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,490
So let's go and check it out.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,520
Why that's not showing.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,130
All right.

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,490
So you all users these pages are supposed to send it.

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,130
No actually the user's page is right here.

24
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:34,870
This is the one they're supposed to send us to the user and to the user that BHB.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:43,610
So we need to say as user on top for us to go into that page and now we refresh we are there.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,610
All right.

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,550
Perfect what it is is that this page here

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,480
we had this wrong right here on the uses that BHB right.

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,780
So make sure that you also added this on here as a user.

30
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,480
All right.

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,750
OK.

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,400
So that is good.

33
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,650
That's good.

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,730
All right so what we want to do we want to have the first name the last name the role maybe the user

35
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,050
name email and password.

36
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,730
So let's go ahead and get a couple of these fields in here.

37
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,350
I want to have the role actually let's use that.

38
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,440
All right.

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,570
So let's go to view all users not your users I'm sorry users.

40
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,900
All right.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,140
So here let's have the first name.

42
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,490
How about that.

43
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:48,260
And let's just right here let's just call this first name user first name user underscore first name.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,840
All right.

45
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,980
Let's just make it a little bigger.

46
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,960
Here we go.

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,930
All right.

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:05,630
And here I want to say last name and this call this is your last name.

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,470
Remember these fields this values are different from the database and just naming it the same.

50
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:19,240
So the way it's all the same all over the place and they're missing something your last name.

51
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,150
Sometimes I'm too fast for my own good right.

52
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,740
What else.

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,740
This will be.

54
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,930
So we got the first name.

55
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,220
Actually we went ahead ourselves right here.

56
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,110
This is supposed to be those feels right here.

57
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,770
All right so let me just take that off

58
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,950
and let's replace it with his first name and last name.

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,590
We want to be above the category side of that array.

60
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,960
And this is a match.

61
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,130
My fact I want false image.

62
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,710
There what I my want is the image of the user.

63
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,810
Why not right.

64
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:16,790
And let's just go ahead and I'm going to come in that aisle and we're going to leave that for later

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,030
for extra features or something like that.

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,630
There's worry about getting this thing done here first.

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:34,020
So we got the user last name here we're going to put the role of the user and after the role we want

68
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,010
the user name.

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,360
So let's go ahead and say user name and

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,590
user name thing.

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,530
Email right here and we've got to change his input

72
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,030
right here and this change right here with e-mail.

73
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,870
That type is going to be e-mail.

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,830
That way we have that validation there right.

75
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,660
These are e-mail.

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:12,230
And the last one is a name put here and then just going to copy that one here and just change the title

77
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,050
password.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,360
This will change it to password.

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,750
Everything will change the password and user password.

80
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,660
We need to do a check on this anyway.

81
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:25,890
But

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,940
this is the way it is.

83
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:39,510
So create users mad and this would be user.

84
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,590
All right.

85
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,450
So this is looking OK I guess right here.

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,420
Select from users.

87
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,970
All right but I'll have another one.

88
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,080
Do we have another one.

89
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:07,980
So let's select from users where we're actually we don't need to add where here because this is going

90
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,800
to be adding is not going to be editing.

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,570
All right.

92
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,490
So this is going to be adding something.

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,400
So what is his value here.

94
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,320
Well what we want to do is play here.

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,680
We want to display the role right.

96
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:33,450
User role right here and we need to get it out of the user role but we need to change all that and the

97
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,000
rest of the names right.

98
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,520
So and of course we need to send the user ID.

99
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,930
Actually I'm sorry about that.

100
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,760
I don't put

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,800
licious user ID.

102
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,520
Restoring order.

103
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,610
Let's do everything in order.

104
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,810
User role and

105
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,620
user role right here.

106
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,120
All right.

107
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,790
That's looking good and right here user id verify that that is loose.

108
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,070
That it is the same in the database.

109
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,570
All right.

110
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,510
So let's go to a local B-tree my admin user ID and user roll.

111
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,730
All right.

112
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,420
All right.

113
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,460
So we're going to sell everything from users and we're going to say select users here.

114
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,870
This data this query is great for a function right.

115
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:43,130
So select users or select user users and we're going to copy this right here.

116
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,440
Yes.

117
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,410
So our functions can check in this custom function that we got here.

118
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,290
It's right here also.

119
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,070
All right.

120
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,370
Perfect.

121
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:04,310
This select is going to be the name user role right now right.

122
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,060
All right.

123
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,110
Perfect perfect perfect.

124
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,090
So in the next lecture here we're going to finish it up and I'll see you in the next one.

125
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,520
Take care
