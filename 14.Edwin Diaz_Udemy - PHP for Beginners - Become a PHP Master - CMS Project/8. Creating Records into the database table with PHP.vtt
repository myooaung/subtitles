00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.590
Hi welcome back.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.330
Now that we connected to our database is time to create records to create put data in say using Ph.D..

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.360
This lecture here is going to be really exciting.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.690
So let's go ahead and OBRA co-editor right.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.050
And we are going to be doing a Save As from luggin which is inside the folder called my ask.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.210
Well let's do a Save us here because I want you to keep that data for you and that's yours.

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.360
Go ahead and do underscore create and if you don't remember.

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.970
Hold on let me just cancel this if you don't remember this where we are and I know you might take a

9
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.980
break or two and then come back and not know where you are.

10
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.840
So let me just make sure that you know where you are.

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.870
We were here in the last video here and we made a connection here connected.

12
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.260
All right so we made a connection with our database and we echo something I was just saying you know

13
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.460
we are connected right here.

14
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.510
OK.

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950
So now we are going somewhere else.

16
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.420
Let's go and do a Save As and let's call this logging on the score create.

17
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.440
All right so we switch to that page.

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:20.160
Make sure that you go to your form and change that action review to reflect the new page form on the

19
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.930
score create.

20
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.330
Right because want to send that data there.

21
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.760
All right so what do we need here.

22
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.130
What do we need to start making queries to our database.

23
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.360
Well very simple.

24
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.350
We're not going to end up going here to overdo it let's just make this a little more condensed right.

25
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.220
All right.

26
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.230
Perfect.

27
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.480
All right so the first thing that I want to do is I want to be using a function to send all these data

28
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.620
to my is who Elbel right now.

29
00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.160
I'm going to put things on variables so I'm going to write my query in as tets here as a tets value

30
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.290
for this query variable.

31
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260
This is where I'm going to write my query.

32
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.710
I'm going to save it in this variable and I'm going to use this variable to submit it.

33
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.210
Right.

34
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.550
Because I think this is a better way of doing it right.

35
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:25.910
So choose me insert into this is the command This is the su command that you can type in your SU El-Khodary

36
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.770
and your ma as well a new APHC my admin and it will create a sense in that that we will be creating

37
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.440
OK so that you can even type this in the command prompt for us u l and he will do it.

38
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:47.250
So anyway it's inserted into what users is our table and then we're going to put parentheses here and

39
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.310
we're going to say what do we want to put in there.

40
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.660
Well we have a page here username and password.

41
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.420
So it feels that we want to be in the database as a matter of fact that's those other fields.

42
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.670
Those are the columns that we got in the database.

43
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.210
We have a colorful user name and a column for password.

44
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.620
Of course we have one for ID but that's being incremental automatically We don't need to worry about

45
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.400
that.

46
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.620
So we have to call them c and we need to fill them up with some data.

47
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.930
All right.

48
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.650
So let's go ahead and take it from here.

49
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.300
It's a user.

50
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:27.470
Just copy and paste their comma and grab it again here.

51
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.580
All right.

52
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.020
Perfect.

53
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.450
So that we are done with this as a matter of fact.

54
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.910
Now we've got to go to the next line because we could put it together here.

55
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.140
The next line that actually is on one line but I'm going to divide this since I like to see all my code

56
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.460
divided right.

57
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.770
And I'm going to use a dot notation to put all this together.

58
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.260
So I'm going to put the same variable here and this might look weird to you but I'm going to make it

59
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.920
very clear and we'll put a dot in that equal sign.

60
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.150
And what is this is going to do is that it is going to concatenate

61
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.570
this text that I'm going to be putting down here with this line here.

62
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.190
So it's going to smash it together.

63
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.360
OK.

64
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.590
So right here like this is just create values or Capital.

65
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.500
You don't have to but this is just best practice right.

66
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.420
Make sure you do.

67
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.300
And why do I want to put as values.

68
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.980
So we going to insert data into that user name column and the password column.

69
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.180
Right.

70
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.170
What do we want.

71
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.070
What are data.

72
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.860
What is the user name right so let's use a variable.

73
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.740
Why not use a variable we can use use we can use the user name we can use that.

74
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.950
But why why are we going to use something that we can use any tetch we want here.

75
00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.500
We can set it into but we want we want to be able to set it to what the user types in this field.

76
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.580
Right there.

77
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.950
Well it was there when we finished writing this you will see it and the password would be the next value

78
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.620
for this.

79
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.120
And let's just make sure we put quotes around it since they are strings for the values we need quotes

80
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.760
for this we don't because these are columns.

81
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.890
All right.

82
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.140
Well for this.

83
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.700
These are strings and they are coming from here we need to let him know that they are strings.

84
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.240
Right.

85
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.940
All right so we are done here with this.

86
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.710
And the next thing we do is we use a command a prevailed function call my rescue.

87
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.520
Well.

88
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.650
And they have my rescue.

89
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.930
This is the old version.

90
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.550
Right.

91
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.260
So make sure they have this on here my as well.

92
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.680
But this is the old version I don't use.

93
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:47.980
I use a new version.

94
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.420
Always you want to use the newest version.

95
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.210
And here we take two parameters.

96
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.320
The first one is the connection.

97
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.990
So we're going to take this variable since this very was equal to that connection.

98
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.770
And the next one is the Querrey where we send in there and I take this very well this is why I like

99
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.000
doing this.

100
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.810
If if I were to use this without this what I have to do is copy this whole thing in there and put it

101
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.710
in here or that tets and I don't want to do that.

102
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.550
I want to save everything on the little variable here and just put it in.

103
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.270
Here's a lot cleaner right.

104
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.490
All right.

105
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.790
So once we do that we need to I mean we can send it the way it is.

106
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:41.620
But I want to check on this connection here so I'm going to create a variable called resoled sign in

107
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.070
that connection.

108
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.570
Now this will work the way it is.

109
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:52.260
But with this very well here allows me to do this to check on the query to see what happened to it if

110
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.350
it went through if it did not go through.

111
00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.400
So I'm going to put if not true then I want you to die.

112
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.770
Meaning that one all commands everything to stop.

113
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.130
And I want you to display this Querrey failed.

114
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.690
So until I really ugly right.

115
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:14.300
All right.

116
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.980
So I think we're done here.

117
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:22.200
If we have a mistake somewhere in your cold BHP will let us know.

118
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:28.170
We can also concatenate here this and say my ask you well let me see my ass.

119
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.110
Q Well I error.

120
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.530
I believe it is there.

121
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.860
There we go.

122
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.880
And this would give us an arrow here.

123
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.210
All right.

124
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.540
But I think we are good to go.

125
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.890
Let's use and this is a pre-build function too that will give us an arrow here.

126
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.460
Just in case you are interested in finding out finding out.

127
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.310
All right.

128
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.610
So let's go ahead and check this out let's see if it works.

129
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.590
All right.

130
00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:08.610
So I'm going to create a user name called it's man and the password would be submit all it looks like

131
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.970
we did something because that's a good sign we didn't get any errors.

132
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.110
And he said we are connected.

133
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.010
So.

134
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.990
All right so let's see let's see what happened right let's let's have some fun let's look at it.

135
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:32.250
All right so let's go to look A-holes ph be my admin and look at the logging app users and 2 2 2 2 2

136
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.300
2 2 2 2.

137
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.620
Yes.

138
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.420
There we go if you able to do with me congratulations.

139
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.830
If not don't worry about it just rewind this and get it done do it 100 times if you have to.

140
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.630
This is your subring porn right.

141
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:53.940
So with this you can create a logon page basically and have people log in to your app and you will keep

142
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.980
their information.

143
00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:00.990
Of course you have to extend it and put some more security on of course maybe encrypt the password and

144
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.440
detect the user and the side with a cookie or session.

145
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.280
But anyways you get a major idea here.

146
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:12.690
Hopefully you are able to to get some valuable information I'm pretty sure you got some valid information.

147
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.120
But anyways on the next video we're going to continue with the crowd and we are going to be reading

148
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.630
this information from the database now that we created.

149
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.230
All right.

150
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.200
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in next lecture.

151
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.670
Take care
