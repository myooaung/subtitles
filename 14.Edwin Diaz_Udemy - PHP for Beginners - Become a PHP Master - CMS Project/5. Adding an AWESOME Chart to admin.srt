1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,450
All right so it's time for us to ask on really cool for Chanology and we're going to be adding the graphs

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,730
that I show you in the demo before they're going to be graphs below here.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,860
And we're going to get it from Google.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,710
So the first thing that we need to do is actually go to Google dot com and make sure you have a Google

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,650
account and just go to Google charts.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,620
I don't know if they or they will let you use their API without a Google account.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,420
I suggest you grab grab one anyways so you just have a Google account.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,250
Go to the first link there when you search for Google.

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,250
Their results then go to overview chart gallery.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,520
And here we're going to have a whole bunch of charts that we can use.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,670
Right now we're going to be using a simple chart like this one right.

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,060
And this is that you are Elle you can welcome to post the video and copy that you are l If you want.

13
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,150
It's got a column chart.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,120
And here we will grab one of these pieces of code that will be used and this is just showing you what

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,190
the type of things that you can do.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,160
All right.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,400
Just change a couple of things on it and you should be good to go right.

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,500
But now we need to grab this whole thing.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,530
And if you keep going down to where you see this.

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,290
This one with the colors.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,270
This is the one we are going to be using.

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,960
So what I want to do is copy the first thing here which is the script that we are going to be using

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,490
from Google to pool this functionality out of it.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Right.

25
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,090
They have this library that has all those javascript called defined already.

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,960
So we're going to use that.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:46,380
Let's go to our admin Hetter at that link in there that script link this is that remould script link.

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,070
All right.

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:56,610
So admin on the score header and under all this files we're going to add this before the end of the

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,660
head tag right here.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:01:59,930
Right.

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,470
And that's why we got there.

33
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,570
Perfect.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,920
Now we need to go to the end it's.

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:17,100
And I think I had a working in the tray here and I see him as one wanting admin if I'm passing already.

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,880
All right.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,020
I don't see either.

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,520
Let me just go to the whanging admin

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,380
right here.

40
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,590
All right.

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:35,640
So what we want to do is all the way down here we want to make Roe all the way below all this widgets.

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,290
Right.

43
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:45,270
We're going to create a def with a class of row and we're going to save the file We're going to go back

44
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:53,640
to charts and we're going to copy this script from there below the head stop actually above the head

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,830
start there.

46
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,660
Copy with your mouse key we're And you're going to come to that.

47
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,860
And that's that BHB and paste that in there.

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,470
All right.

49
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,130
Now this is not going to work because we don't have any.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,670
We are getting the document GALIUM and by the Culham chart we don't have that div anywhere here.

51
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:21,960
As a matter of fact right now we don't have that so we need to go back to here and you see this right

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,320
here is this.

53
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,810
This is what we need in order to put all this functionality inside it inside of it.

54
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,320
Right.

55
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,510
And if you don't know javascript this is javascript if you don't know javascript I have a really great

56
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,770
cors and Javascript really great reviews a lot of people like it.

57
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,810
All right.

58
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,930
Larry you know and we're going to play out there right here.

59
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,260
All right so let me just make sure that you see it there.

60
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,370
Perfect.

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,370
Let's go ahead and check it out.

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,720
See how that looks.

63
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,540
I just say to by the way and if I refresh you can see that we have really cool functionality already.

64
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,910
All right.

65
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,200
Perfect.

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,470
Now we going to of course clean it up a little bit.

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,300
And we're not going to be displaying three columns of anything there since this is just plain the data

68
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,550
is related.

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,780
We got on this plane probably just pose acted post-draft draft things like that in here.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,470
So we're not we're not going to be needing all these colors there.

71
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,360
By the way it's up to us if we want to.

72
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,390
But I'm not going to complicate things.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,690
All right.

74
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,790
But anyway so we were able to create this chart here the next election we're going to be able to we're

75
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,040
going to start courting this all we make it dynamic so it can pull information from our database into

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,170
these nice charts that Google offers.

77
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,740
All right.

78
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,270
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

79
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,200
Take care.
