1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,090
I will come back on this video here we are going to be learning about one of the most important components

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:14,550
of B loops and loops allow us to repeat code until certain conditions are met.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:22,110
You see I loop we go around and around and around multiple times executing the code in between the curly

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,710
brackets until a certain condition is met.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,710
Very similar to the statement but more powerful.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,090
So let's go ahead and learn how to write a syntax and let's learn how to use it.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,540
We start with a very simple very simple loop called the while loop.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,020
All right so let's go ahead and we'll bring it to let's do a Save ask on the blank that BHB.

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,160
All right.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,940
Let's call these while on the score.

11
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,910
There we go and we we don't need that right.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,920
So let's go ahead and just change the title here for a while.

13
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,040
Why not right.

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,910
Do this on the browser.

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,310
Open it up.

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,270
Perfect.

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,090
All right so how can we write a sentence for you.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,450
Let me just expand this so you can see the loops are very similar to a statement.

19
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,270
All we have to change is the key word if in the if statement for the key word while.

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,080
And we already have a WHILE loop.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,310
Very simple look at this.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,560
So let's say we have a statement like this.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,050
Let's first write a PH VTX I don't think is going to work without it right.

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,590
All right.

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,740
And this closes down here

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,050
and we say that space really doesn't matter.

27
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,510
This is just for to make it clear for you that that's what it is.

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:00,570
So let's choose a key word for while as you can see here my code is already highlighted the key word

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,130
there.

30
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,550
So while this is true wow it is.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,250
All right we're going to repeat this.

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,770
When he falls we'll stop.

33
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:18,300
So for example very very simple very simple to do.

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,680
They say wow I don't know.

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,780
Four is less than 10.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,570
I want you to keep repeating yourself and what are you going to be repeating.

37
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:37,220
I don't know let's do an echo and say hello.

38
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,960
I don't know what was there.

39
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,940
Hello students.

40
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,090
All right.

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
And that's enough.

42
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:54,020
Hello hello it's unbelievable how these words very close related right well not close related but how

43
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,520
you can just write a bad word there and you can write a good word right here with another word which

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,660
is like preview arrows so we're getting error here.

45
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,810
OK I see what we're doing.

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,690
You see that they explain to you what happened here.

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,980
Right.

48
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,770
We create an infinite loop.

49
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,830
And just because my code is already executing this call when I save it so we got to watch it with brackets

50
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,190
and saving them right.

51
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,260
So let's just go ahead and take that off.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,300
Right now I'm going to show you right now what happened.

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,130
All right so while four is less than 10 we're going to keep executing.

54
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,110
But the problem is that four is always going to be less than 10.

55
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,500
That's why you see you saw the cold there in the browser going crazy.

56
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,450
So a lot of words there.

57
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,620
That's because the loop kept going and going and going never stop.

58
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,890
Because four is always going to be less than 10.

59
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,780
So this condition here will not be met.

60
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,760
What we need to do is change the for every time we go around the loop so the loop would go like this.

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
I would first start here.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,640
Right.

63
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,620
It would look at this and say OK perfect.

64
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,520
But you would look at it and say All right we have a while loop was a condition and then we gave with

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,210
a condition and we say listening Apache as long as four is less than 10.

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,950
I want you to keep executing whatever is in these lines right.

67
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,190
He's actually talking

68
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,490
right.

69
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,030
Well we're talking BHB is talking to Apache right.

70
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:31,030
So now the batch is going to be processing this is going to be giving us this.

71
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,120
Every time it goes around the wall the loop starts here and we'll go to the next line and we're printed

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,790
on the screen.

73
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,660
Then it ends right here and then we go around again.

74
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,320
He will look at the condition again.

75
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,390
It will still be false.

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,190
And then we come back here and print this over again until this condition from 2 until 4 is bigger than

77
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,690
10 we're four is bigger than 10.

78
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,950
That is going to stop.

79
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,440
But like I said before Fornes never bigger than 10.

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,250
So we never stop.

81
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,580
This is called an infinite loop.

82
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,460
Right.

83
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,570
And we can't write it like this.

84
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,290
So what we usually do for a while loop is that we create something called a counter initialiser counter

85
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,600
or initialiser whatever you want to call it for the loop.

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,050
All right.

87
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,200
So we were places for for that count.

88
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,880
We started the loop 0.

89
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,130
So this is what counter very well we can name and whatever we want and we can in I for initialiser.

90
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,900
We wanted to really doesn't matter.

91
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,530
I just wanted this to be descriptive for you.

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,690
Descriptive.

93
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,250
So counter right now is zero.

94
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,980
So we're saying Wow 0 why this counter here that is equal to zero is less than 10.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,910
I want you to keep writing this because that's still an infinite loop.

96
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,350
What we need to do to stop the infinite loop is that every time we go around before the loop finishes

97
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,350
we need to increase counter to 1.

98
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,980
All right plus 1.

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,030
So we're going to add one to it every time it goes around.

100
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,980
So this is how we want to play very well.

101
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,540
This is one way of doing it.

102
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,110
So I hope you see what this is doing.

103
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,300
This is outside the loop we have a counter right of equal to zero.

104
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,800
And we're saying here as long as it's counter which is equal to zero is less than you want you to keep

105
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,080
executing the code.

106
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,930
So it goes here analyzes this and goes to the next page and print this out.

107
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:31,020
And then he goes to the next one and says OK egressed counter we write country again we add 1 to it.

108
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,010
So now Cantu's is going to equal to 1 going to go here.

109
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,180
Going to go up again.

110
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,080
Now the same wild counter which is one now is less than 10 right.

111
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,490
Q This is going to execute it again and again to add another one to counter and remember counting is

112
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,020
already equal to 1.

113
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,110
Now with this extra one is going to be equal to two and it's going to keep going three four five six

114
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,390
seven eight nine.

115
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,290
And then when he reaches 10 then this is not going to execute since 10 is not less than 10 then the

116
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,380
loop will stop.

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,330
So this will stop.

118
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,830
All right so right now if you want to see and when he stops or we have to do is printed on the browser

119
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,120
and you see what I mean.

120
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,080
There we go.

121
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,410
All right.

122
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,410
Long story and it goes to the end of the story.

123
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,070
All right.

124
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,340
Nine times now.

125
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,770
Let me show you the shorthand version of this is dividing this one.

126
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:47,160
This is so common that there is a shorthand version for it called right here the increment operator

127
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,900
right there.

128
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,520
Same thing as all that call that we had either.

129
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,430
And just going to leave it here comment.

130
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,390
So you could see it.

131
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,850
It's going to come at that hour.

132
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,320
And then going to write a real one.

133
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,740
One other real one but the different one the short hand version that where you have this in your exercise

134
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,150
files.

135
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,670
There we go.

136
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,330
OK.

137
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,990
So now what I want to do is I want to show you I want to.

138
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,410
Now I don't want to echo Hello Stuart and I want to Aqua's the counter just to show you what happens.

139
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,860
Look at that.

140
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:27,060
The counter starts a 0 and goes all the way to 9 and then stops because then when he goes to 10 10 he

141
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,680
said Oh no no no no no.

142
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,690
It's now equal to then stuff's right here.

143
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,410
Those in gold and Prince out of 10 if you wanted to print out 10 then you said as long as the counter

144
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,150
is less than or equal than.

145
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,610
So when he gets to 10 is going to print that out because it's equal.

146
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,450
Look at that.

147
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,780
So the printouts 10 printed out.

148
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,910
Right.

149
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,160
Very simple to write for the while loop on the next video we're going to be discussing about another.

150
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,510
All right.

151
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,150
So anyway hopefully you were able to learn a lot on this code and on this video and you can see the

152
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,520
power in this.

153
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:08,970
We can for example use a while loop to go through a I don't know a paragraph for some type of database

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,590
and say while this user is equal to this I want you to check the user and do this to the user as long

155
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,750
as this paragraph is read.

156
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,820
