00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.300
Or write my students down the last lecture I don't know how in the world I saw this here then he says

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.260
we are not connected but actually we are connected.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.420
The reason why this confused me is because we don't have no data here.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.670
And the reason why we have no data is because we need to import our database.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.720
Hello Edwin I'm going to leave this lecture here because this is a silly mistake and it could happen

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.360
to anybody out there.

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.260
So I'm just going to leave it in.

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.700
All right.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.370
Don't laugh and just enjoy the course.

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.880
All right.

11
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.970
So let's get to it.

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.500
So let's go to our database.

13
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.080
All right.

14
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.710
And I'm going to go back here to return to my ask you all databases.

15
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.750
This is Go Daddy.

16
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.410
All right.

17
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.360
We're going to have to get out of here and go back to database.

18
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.340
All right.

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.310
So let me go to my SEE panel that's what I need to be.

20
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.260
I've got to put the screen to the side because I'm going to go to some personal information real quick.

21
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.690
All right.

22
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.150
All right.

23
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.770
So this is going to take me to the gateway right here to see panel and what I'm going to do here in

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.860
this panel is I'm going to go to BHB my admin.

25
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.720
All right go that he has application which is really cool.

26
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.100
Same something that we got you our local hosts in here.

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.700
If we go to databases and we check this is empty.

28
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.480
So there's no way this was going to work.

29
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.980
I was just saying things last the last lecture I need my coffee again.

30
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.680
So anyway I'm going to import right with this data selected and then I choose File.

31
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.400
And I go to my desktop and I already have the CMOS in there.

32
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.750
And the reason why these house numbers is because I don't or I it's part of this a couple times already

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.680
used to give to some of you out there.

34
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.400
All right open and click.

35
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.430
Go.

36
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.890
All right.

37
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.720
So it worked.

38
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.530
Now we've got to go back to where when.

39
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.430
Well whatever domain you're using and school called both Azlan cold's college enter.

40
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.940
Now this one but the folder where I have it.

41
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.650
All right.

42
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.590
So now we're getting some information.

43
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.680
It is connected.

44
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.230
We always were.

45
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.070
But now they is showing some information.

46
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.890
All right so now we're getting our data.

47
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.410
It would go to admin.

48
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.880
We can see some stuff here that does not work and will the war will fix that.

49
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.320
There's a couple of things again that he's now working they are now working 100 percent.

50
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.040
And don't worry.

51
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.960
But we are going to fix to fix it.

52
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.730
And this was the issues that I told you about since this was not meant to be to work on line.

53
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.740
We always we're going to have some issues and we need to fix them.

54
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.650
But anyway the great thing is that now you have your application on line.

55
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.930
Now you can play around with it on line.

56
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.590
And congratulations if you made it this far on the next lecture we're going to fix a couple of issues

57
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.630
and we're going to keep continue fixing stuff and learning more.

58
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.200
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

59
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.200
It was a pleasure.

60
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.300
Thank you.
