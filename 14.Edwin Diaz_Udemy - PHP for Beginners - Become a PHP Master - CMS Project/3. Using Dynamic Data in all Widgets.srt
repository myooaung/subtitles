1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:00,890
All right.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,510
Perfect.

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,440
The last one we were able to put this value here that namak right.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,810
So now we're going to do the rest.

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,880
And they got to be super easy because most of the time what we've got to do is copy and paste right.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,350
So anyways if you are following along grade you are doing awesome.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,990
I'm telling you right now this information this knowledge would pay off.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,960
There's nothing like knowledge and knowledge is power.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Keep that in mind.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,670
All right.

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,730
So we've got the Square right here that we're getting and all we've got to do is make a copy of this

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,850
right here and go down to the next one which is right here actually.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,870
Yes I was just going to fix this a little bit so you can see it.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,780
All we got to do right now is paste that information right here.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,640
All right.

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,460
And this is comments as you can see there.

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,840
So we're going to select everything from comments

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,470
and select comments change this a little bit.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,540
All right then copy and paste out here.

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,800
And call this for comment counts

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,170
comments count.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,490
Perfect right here.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,010
Whoops.

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,070
All right so let's let's check it out.

25
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:37,240
Refresh undefined variable one in 991 ry nine.

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,420
All right let's do it again refresh.

27
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,960
And now we see we only have one comment so we go to comments we only see how only have one comment.

28
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,020
So we are able to do that when they are right.

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,930
So let's do the next one we can all fits all these data but let's go to the next one real quick.

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,210
Let's go to the users and do a piece right here on these huge these days with a class of huge array.

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,560
This is going to be users.

32
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,750
So select all from users

33
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,650
select all users.

34
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,380
Perfect.

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,940
And you're right here

36
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:32,700
and here is our account we should take the out of the first one that we did for the post since it's

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,690
not count it's just count.

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:45,060
And if we go back here to our dashboard we can see that we have two users right now and they do another

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,100
copy here.

40
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,980
Let's go to the categories so let's do a pace right here on this.

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,150
They were a class huge again unless the send thing here hopefully you don't have the same issue that

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,740
I have with a resolution.

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,140
Since you don't have to.

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,550
You can have a big screen and I have a problem I have to have a bigger solution so that where you could

45
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,480
see it better.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,930
So select everything from categories and you is going to say select all categories.

47
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:30,570
Can I copy this and right here based in category count we're going to have a couple of those right.

48
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,330
Let's go back and just refresh and we can see we have five categories check on that categories 1 2 3

49
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,990
4 and 5 perfit where the splits on that Nemec data.

50
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,020
This is beautiful.

51
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,780
Now these links don't work.

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,850
They go to the users actually and you see the post.

53
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,640
No they're not working right now we need to fix that.

54
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,770
But right now when we are displaying on the namak data we are going there right now.

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,290
Right.

56
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,380
So let's go ahead and fixed view polls actually.

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,380
I don't like this says counts.

58
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,670
So post counts.

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,580
They just make a post count right here.

60
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,830
Perfect.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,830
So we were able to accomplish a lot on this lecture here and that's what we're going to be doing some

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,790
other great stuff.

63
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,380
All right.

64
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,780
So thank you so much for watching this lecture and you're doing awesome.

65
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,700
Keep doing it you're the best.

66
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,450
See you in the next one.

67
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,160
Take care.
