1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:02,330
All right welcome back to the students.

2

00:00:02,370  -->  00:00:06,520
So let's finish this function right now let's just finish it.

3

00:00:06,930  -->  00:00:11,750
Right now we are sending a request to the server and we're getting some information back.

4

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:15,730
But the thing is that we need to keep constantly sending this information.

5

00:00:15,770  -->  00:00:17,880
We got to fetch our database constantly.

6

00:00:17,880  -->  00:00:18,510
Right.

7

00:00:18,780  -->  00:00:20,980
Well in order for us to do that we got it.

8

00:00:21,030  -->  00:00:25,130
Type in you know execute this function every couple of seconds.

9

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:31,740
So for that we're going to use a javascript function call set interval.

10

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:35,190
I think it funny spelling it correctly it's like this.

11

00:00:35,190  -->  00:00:36,150
There we go.

12

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:47,300
And then in here will create a function well like this and we'll call this function up here every couple

13

00:00:47,300  -->  00:00:48,360
of seconds.

14

00:00:48,840  -->  00:00:51,410
So I'm just going to call it every half hour.

15

00:00:51,780  -->  00:00:53,510
One second.

16

00:00:53,510  -->  00:00:59,490
All right so 1000 would be one second 1000 millisecond because this is milliseconds right here.

17

00:00:59,580  -->  00:01:00,250
All right.

18

00:01:00,390  -->  00:01:01,890
So half a second.

19

00:01:02,160  -->  00:01:04,710
I want to call this functionality.

20

00:01:04,710  -->  00:01:05,190
All right.

21

00:01:05,340  -->  00:01:09,600
We are done actually with this.

22

00:01:09,650  -->  00:01:10,300
All right.

23

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:12,870
So there's nothing to be done here in if done.

24

00:01:12,870  -->  00:01:15,990
If something happens we'll debug it but we are done for now.

25

00:01:15,990  -->  00:01:18,620
Now let's take this value here.

26

00:01:18,960  -->  00:01:22,070
Copy it and let's take it to functions.

27

00:01:22,070  -->  00:01:22,350
All right.

28

00:01:22,350  -->  00:01:28,530
So here in this user's own line function what we need to do is we need to the text of value that we

29

00:01:28,530  -->  00:01:29,680
just copy.

30

00:01:29,700  -->  00:01:31,590
All right.

31

00:01:31,590  -->  00:01:34,680
All right so because this is coming in a GET request remember.

32

00:01:34,740  -->  00:01:45,860
So if it's set and let's just say get in the space that value in there and it's actually move or there's

33

00:01:45,910  -->  00:01:48,700
a little bit to the right.

34

00:01:49,060  -->  00:01:50,310
Whoops.

35

00:01:50,730  -->  00:01:52,530
My resolution is super small so

36

00:01:57,140  -->  00:01:57,960
super small.

37

00:01:57,960  -->  00:02:03,330
Sorry about that guys right here.

38

00:02:03,330  -->  00:02:05,900
I'll move it later on when I make my resolution a little smarter.

39

00:02:05,910  -->  00:02:06,940
But anyway.

40

00:02:07,230  -->  00:02:20,580
So let's go all the way to the bottom here and we can just mark this as it gets requests.

41

00:02:20,610  -->  00:02:23,640
All right he said or something like that.

42

00:02:24,120  -->  00:02:26,300
So that way we know that that's where it is.

43

00:02:26,310  -->  00:02:29,190
And then with that a little bit there.

44

00:02:29,190  -->  00:02:34,530
All right so once we get this get requests what do we want to do.

45

00:02:34,530  -->  00:02:36,480
Well we would like to

46

00:02:39,150  -->  00:02:43,240
include our connection but now this connection is not going to work.

47

00:02:43,290  -->  00:02:48,450
And the reason why this is not going to work is because when we are coming to this function straight

48

00:02:48,450  -->  00:02:53,510
to this function the data base is not going to be included.

49

00:02:53,550  -->  00:02:59,760
We're not we don't have this global connection available to us in functions that BHB this global connection

50

00:02:59,760  -->  00:03:02,930
is available to us in the header only.

51

00:03:02,970  -->  00:03:08,910
So we go to a head or admin head or we can see that we got this connection this deep be right here and

52

00:03:08,910  -->  00:03:10,440
then we got functions right after.

53

00:03:10,440  -->  00:03:14,610
So that's the only reason why it is.

54

00:03:15,180  -->  00:03:17,310
It is available in functions.

55

00:03:17,640  -->  00:03:22,150
So this is not going to be available once we come straight to this function here.

56

00:03:22,290  -->  00:03:23,800
So we need to include it.

57

00:03:23,820  -->  00:03:24,470
All right.

58

00:03:24,570  -->  00:03:31,440
So first of all Will we try to get it but if we don't have it we'll just put another statement here

59

00:03:31,440  -->  00:03:35,760
will say if not connection.

60

00:03:35,970  -->  00:03:41,760
And chances are it's not going to be of any one just showing you what you can do to test it but by now

61

00:03:41,760  -->  00:03:42,780
you already know that.

62

00:03:42,930  -->  00:03:48,870
First of all we started this session because we don't even have a session at this point because this

63

00:03:48,870  -->  00:03:54,160
functionality is coming straight to functions at BHB and we don't have that available here.

64

00:03:54,270  -->  00:03:59,770
So we started the session and then we include.

65

00:03:59,910  -->  00:04:00,360
All right.

66

00:04:00,360  -->  00:04:02,600
The D.B the D.V. connection.

67

00:04:02,600  -->  00:04:10,700
So we got to go back and includes the Wii that Ph.

68

00:04:11,110  -->  00:04:11,650
All right.

69

00:04:11,770  -->  00:04:14,250
Beautiful.

70

00:04:14,610  -->  00:04:23,760
So once we do that then we can start writing our code and make some space here and now go and get this

71

00:04:23,850  -->  00:04:28,170
all these data out from there and pasted in here

72

00:04:31,620  -->  00:04:38,590
and then make my resolution a little smaller I'm tired of my cold being like that.

73

00:04:39,630  -->  00:04:43,490
This is that connection right here.

74

00:04:43,500  -->  00:04:52,500
I'm going to move everything over like this.

75

00:04:52,740  -->  00:04:53,870
OK.

76

00:04:54,630  -->  00:04:55,040
All right.

77

00:04:55,080  -->  00:05:02,610
Let's just come back.

78

00:05:02,760  -->  00:05:03,440
All right.

79

00:05:03,540  -->  00:05:06,850
So once we include it we got everything available to us.

80

00:05:06,900  -->  00:05:13,200
So the next step will be to return it because we don't have anything else that can catch this.

81

00:05:13,200  -->  00:05:16,880
We don't have any and all that HBL there to catch this result.

82

00:05:16,980  -->  00:05:22,620
We need to echo it out like this.

83

00:05:22,710  -->  00:05:25,230
All right.

84

00:05:25,230  -->  00:05:28,580
Beautiful.

85

00:05:28,620  -->  00:05:32,650
Double check if everything is working well.

86

00:05:33,070  -->  00:05:33,600
Be working.

87

00:05:33,600  -->  00:05:36,310
Now let's check it out.

88

00:05:37,650  -->  00:05:39,440
Let's refresh.

89

00:05:39,440  -->  00:05:43,140
We are not getting any results here right.

90

00:05:43,290  -->  00:05:47,310
So let's go back here and see what's going on.

91

00:05:48,810  -->  00:05:53,880
So we are including this we're checking if connection is available or if it's not.

92

00:05:54,120  -->  00:05:55,490
We are starting the sessions.

93

00:05:55,500  -->  00:05:59,370
We got we include in this includes the Wii.

94

00:05:59,610  -->  00:06:02,280
This all looks really good.

95

00:06:02,280  -->  00:06:07,510
One thing that we are not doing is we're actually calling the function.

96

00:06:07,560  -->  00:06:07,980
Right.

97

00:06:07,980  -->  00:06:11,980
So right after your function finishes let's call it like this.

98

00:06:12,000  -->  00:06:12,740
Save it.

99

00:06:12,870  -->  00:06:14,510
And now let's go back to it.

100

00:06:15,090  -->  00:06:19,770
And now you don't even have to refresh is already pulling the information from the database as you can

101

00:06:19,770  -->  00:06:21,400
see right here.

102

00:06:21,720  -->  00:06:22,070
Right.

103

00:06:22,170  -->  00:06:23,970
So now let's test this with another browser.

104

00:06:23,970  -->  00:06:32,490
I'm going to graph Firefox and I'm go into right now log in.

105

00:06:32,940  -->  00:06:33,240
Right.

106

00:06:33,240  -->  00:06:36,000
So let's go to localhost.

107

00:06:36,150  -->  00:06:42,070
See a mess and it's right here.

108

00:06:44,100  -->  00:06:47,120
Actually that was chrome sorry about that guys.

109

00:06:47,760  -->  00:06:48,690
Let's go right here.

110

00:06:48,690  -->  00:06:50,250
This is Firefox right.

111

00:06:50,310  -->  00:06:53,260
You just have a huge monitor and Reihan sigh.

112

00:06:53,500  -->  00:06:55,220
And I got to be minimizing this.

113

00:06:55,350  -->  00:06:57,590
So we got which you use or do we have connected.

114

00:06:57,630  -->  00:07:03,120
We have Rico so let's logon swab it real quick.

115

00:07:03,120  -->  00:07:07,960
So let's say sloven and then the password enter.

116

00:07:08,250  -->  00:07:11,360
And as you can see that changes.

117

00:07:11,570  -->  00:07:17,430
Well you're not going to see adding action like this what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to the

118

00:07:17,490  -->  00:07:22,950
online function and I'm going to make this change every five seconds so that way you can see it because

119

00:07:22,950  -->  00:07:27,110
we're not going to wait 30 seconds for the four to two to see it working right.

120

00:07:27,300  -->  00:07:29,350
So I change this to five seconds.

121

00:07:29,550  -->  00:07:33,410
And if it's not active in five seconds this is going to change.

122

00:07:33,420  -->  00:07:34,140
All right.

123

00:07:34,140  -->  00:07:39,710
So I'm going to logout from another monitor for another.

124

00:07:39,780  -->  00:07:40,590
See this.

125

00:07:40,620  -->  00:07:44,850
I'm Logan using Chrome and you can see it on top.

126

00:07:44,850  -->  00:07:46,550
And this is Firefox.

127

00:07:46,570  -->  00:07:47,310
All right.

128

00:07:47,430  -->  00:07:50,140
So on our logo you're going to see what happens.

129

00:07:50,220  -->  00:07:51,670
I just logged out right now.

130

00:07:51,700  -->  00:07:54,640
See that and look at these numbers going to change.

131

00:07:54,660  -->  00:07:56,750
There you see it just change.

132

00:07:56,820  -->  00:07:57,470
See that.

133

00:07:57,540  -->  00:08:01,240
And now I'm going to log in again right here.

134

00:08:01,590  -->  00:08:02,760
So I'm logging in.

135

00:08:02,760  -->  00:08:04,320
Watch this.

136

00:08:04,320  -->  00:08:07,350
So I've got to log in RICO Rico.

137

00:08:08,690  -->  00:08:09,810
Enter now.

138

00:08:09,870  -->  00:08:14,460
Look at that number change you see that logo.

139

00:08:14,460  -->  00:08:18,500
Watch this.

140

00:08:18,510  -->  00:08:18,990
There you go.

141

00:08:18,990  -->  00:08:20,730
You see that five seconds.

142

00:08:20,790  -->  00:08:21,390
Beautiful.

143

00:08:21,390  -->  00:08:24,120
So now we've got instant results coming from our database.

144

00:08:24,120  -->  00:08:25,970
Really cool stuff right.

145

00:08:25,980  -->  00:08:27,990
Anyway thank you so much for being my student.

146

00:08:27,990  -->  00:08:29,670
I'm always thinking about you.

147

00:08:29,710  -->  00:08:33,270
You know if you have any issues any problems just let me know.

148

00:08:33,270  -->  00:08:34,460
Have a great day.

149

00:08:34,470  -->  00:08:35,250
Enjoy your day.

150

00:08:35,250  -->  00:08:38,580
Have fun and I'll see you in the next lechers
