00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:06.750
All right so we were working on the comments to display the comments on the admin area.

2

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:11.600
Right now we are displaying polls.

3

00:00:11.640  -->  00:00:12.470
All right.

4

00:00:12.930  -->  00:00:18.510
So what we need to do is we got this heading right here.

5

00:00:18.600  -->  00:00:20.100
And I think this is fine.

6

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:23.480
This is all the information we need to display.

7

00:00:23.580  -->  00:00:31.100
Of course some of this would be hard coded since we don't have that information right now so we're going

8

00:00:31.110  -->  00:00:37.920
to edit the comment Id that author and I have a repeat of you right here.

9

00:00:37.920  -->  00:00:39.120
This should be content

10

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:45.910
content and then e-mail.

11

00:00:46.650  -->  00:00:49.440
And of course I don't have that e-mail.

12

00:00:49.470  -->  00:00:55.590
Now remember that we are in the admin for slashy includes for Slash view on this score on the score

13

00:00:55.590  -->  00:01:00.430
comments stop BHB inside the admin right includes.

14

00:01:01.020  -->  00:01:02.130
So.

15

00:01:02.310  -->  00:01:04.260
All right.

16

00:01:04.260  -->  00:01:05.430
So after content

17

00:01:08.230  -->  00:01:09.550
what do we have of the content.

18

00:01:09.580  -->  00:01:10.170
E-mail

19

00:01:13.430  -->  00:01:16.890
e-mail status.

20

00:01:16.890  -->  00:01:21.670
So this email right here and that that is in the end date.

21

00:01:21.670  -->  00:01:26.900
I think that that's about it for now one two three.

22

00:01:26.910  -->  00:01:27.210
All right.

23

00:01:27.220  -->  00:01:33.370
Coming up we're now going to play that right now because that would be the response field.

24

00:01:33.750  -->  00:01:39.030
That's a matter of fact we can't have to start as we can't just play that but it would be court right

25

00:01:39.030  -->  00:01:46.620
now so let's just play that right now hardcoded and song title right here and she's going to say some

26

00:01:46.620  -->  00:01:49.510
title.

27

00:01:50.010  -->  00:01:51.350
All right.

28

00:01:52.170  -->  00:02:00.010
And the common date that we have we need to display here on a.

29

00:02:00.180  -->  00:02:01.720
That's fine.

30

00:02:01.740  -->  00:02:05.900
So these links here is going to say proof here proof.

31

00:02:06.540  -->  00:02:10.930
Is just closes that way we can get it more approve won't approve edit and delete.

32

00:02:10.950  -->  00:02:12.820
OK that's fine actually.

33

00:02:13.260  -->  00:02:15.220
That's where we should be displaying there.

34

00:02:15.450  -->  00:02:19.880
As a matter of fact let's take this out of here because this is going to give an error in the page if

35

00:02:19.890  -->  00:02:22.130
we really are right now.

36

00:02:22.140  -->  00:02:25.300
All right.

37

00:02:25.600  -->  00:02:27.230
Just take it out.

38

00:02:27.630  -->  00:02:30.170
And later on we'll complete it right now.

39

00:02:30.180  -->  00:02:33.320
When we make equerry right.

40

00:02:33.720  -->  00:02:34.710
Perfect.

41

00:02:34.710  -->  00:02:36.870
Let's go ahead and check it out and see how it looks.

42

00:02:36.950  -->  00:02:39.090
Comments click on it.

43

00:02:39.090  -->  00:02:40.070
All right.

44

00:02:40.080  -->  00:02:41.670
So we are displaying some data.

45

00:02:41.670  -->  00:02:46.850
Great idea Id that's only one comment that we have all heard come in here.

46

00:02:46.840  -->  00:02:47.880
This is an example.

47

00:02:47.880  -->  00:02:50.130
This is all coming in come in from the database.

48

00:02:50.130  -->  00:02:57.610
Remember this is the first comment that we made there that when we sort of some data the e-mail this

49

00:02:57.620  -->  00:03:00.750
that is a pool song title that date.

50

00:03:00.920  -->  00:03:05.170
All right prove it and prove link and end it.

51

00:03:05.220  -->  00:03:07.370
This is actually of course.

52

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:08.270
Right.

53

00:03:08.790  -->  00:03:14.550
We had the lead where he doesn't need to go.

54

00:03:14.580  -->  00:03:16.910
We actually are missing one here.

55

00:03:17.250  -->  00:03:18.260
Delete.

56

00:03:18.780  -->  00:03:23.810
We're missing the edit that heading here.

57

00:03:23.890  -->  00:03:24.450
All right.

58

00:03:24.510  -->  00:03:32.480
We are not going to have an edit for this one we might we may have later but right now I'm just going

59

00:03:32.480  -->  00:03:34.630
to take it off.

60

00:03:34.680  -->  00:03:36.690
I'm interested in inches to get into.

61

00:03:36.690  -->  00:03:38.370
Done right.

62

00:03:38.460  -->  00:03:41.010
So I think we're good here.

63

00:03:41.010  -->  00:03:41.890
All right.

64

00:03:42.530  -->  00:03:43.050
We're good.

65

00:03:43.050  -->  00:03:50.430
I think this lecture is big enough and the next one let's actually start making some Querrey and for

66

00:03:50.430  -->  00:03:51.030
other things.

67

00:03:51.030  -->  00:03:51.600
All right.

68

00:03:51.630  -->  00:03:53.950
So thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one.
