00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:02,240
All right welcome back and with your students.

2

00:00:02,280  -->  00:00:06,080
So we got this working pretty good right.

3

00:00:06,090  -->  00:00:11,870
We can make a post and we can assign it to a user from a user's table.

4

00:00:11,880  -->  00:00:12,840
Pretty cool.

5

00:00:12,840  -->  00:00:14,740
And then we can see it right here.

6

00:00:14,910  -->  00:00:15,330
All right.

7

00:00:15,390  -->  00:00:20,970
So now that all the functionality is not going to be working right here unless it's coming from the

8

00:00:21,000  -->  00:00:22,050
outside.

9

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:23,670
All right.

10

00:00:23,670  -->  00:00:31,580
Now one thing here is that when we click on edit we don't have the functionality right here right.

11

00:00:31,590  -->  00:00:35,780
Remember that is going to be users now so we need to do something very similar to what we did to that

12

00:00:35,820  -->  00:00:36,380
post.

13

00:00:36,540  -->  00:00:42,150
If you want to go ahead and do that yourself try it because that way you can learn more if not you want

14

00:00:42,150  -->  00:00:45,380
to do the easy lazy way then look at me.

15

00:00:45,500  -->  00:00:47,530
Let's up to the edit post page.

16

00:00:47,550  -->  00:00:53,470
Actually let's go to our pools and copy the user right.

17

00:00:53,520  -->  00:01:01,560
What we got here and they use a copy this come back to the edit posts and right here an author comment

18

00:01:01,560  -->  00:01:03,720
is out.

19

00:01:03,720  -->  00:01:07,160
Save it phased out the code here.

20

00:01:07,280  -->  00:01:08,090
Save it.

21

00:01:08,140  -->  00:01:08,750
Come back.

22

00:01:08,760  -->  00:01:17,280
Hearing update oh this way says Plus son just going to do with a lazy way actually going into Command

23

00:01:17,310  -->  00:01:25,250
F O control f and make sure that every post on the score alters replace.

24

00:01:25,380  -->  00:01:29,930
So actually is replace right here my editor.

25

00:01:30,420  -->  00:01:42,210
So I'm going to replace all of that with post user replace beautiful and save it.

26

00:01:42,550  -->  00:01:46,560
Right now there is another thing that I need to do.

27

00:01:46,750  -->  00:01:49,850
Actually actually I think we're good.

28

00:01:49,910  -->  00:01:51,330
That should check right now.

29

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:53,650
I think we're good I don't think we're going to change that.

30

00:01:54,000  -->  00:01:57,210
Let's go ahead and refresh.

31

00:01:57,390  -->  00:01:59,700
And now we can see the user right here.

32

00:02:00,420  -->  00:02:00,900
All right.

33

00:02:00,960  -->  00:02:02,700
See that category right here.

34

00:02:02,700  -->  00:02:05,880
It would be nice if you put a label on it so let's go ahead and put a label real quick.

35

00:02:05,880  -->  00:02:06,640
Right.

36

00:02:07,170  -->  00:02:10,740
Let's put a label on our categories.

37

00:02:11,820  -->  00:02:15,090
Where is it where is it right here.

38

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:19,590
So we get a category here and the user lets put it.

39

00:02:19,590  -->  00:02:20,820
Copy this.

40

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:33,770
The lazy way and paste and see category is my cut.

41

00:02:34,200  -->  00:02:38,400
To dories and then come back here and save.

42

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:41,640
Now we got categories and then we got users.

43

00:02:41,710  -->  00:02:44,990
Beautiful right beautiful.

44

00:02:45,000  -->  00:02:45,510
Now

45

00:02:48,830  -->  00:02:52,110
we click petite and update pulls.

46

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:57,900
We could see that right now we have a problem that we are not explained the default user and we need

47

00:02:57,900  -->  00:02:58,600
to fix that.

48

00:02:58,650  -->  00:03:02,370
If we go to Edit polls you could see the user he is BT.

49

00:03:02,430  -->  00:03:03,750
Let's change it to something else.

50

00:03:03,750  -->  00:03:10,490
I send it to recall of the polls and more polls and we can see now that added the user is Rico.

51

00:03:10,590  -->  00:03:12,450
So in the next lecture we're going to fix that.

52

00:03:12,450  -->  00:03:14,690
We get to add a default user there.

53

00:03:14,740  -->  00:03:16,110
See you in the next lecture.

54

00:03:16,170  -->  00:03:16,590
Take care
