00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.430
I will come back on this video here.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.050
I want to show you how to start communicating with my school using BHB.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.880
Now one thing that I forgot to tell you in the last video is that you can always go back and it's common

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.490
sense but it might not be common sense if you are very new to BHB.

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.420
You can always go back BHB my admin of course I need to put my admin.

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.210
You can always go back to where you were before and edit stuff so you can update the information that

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.410
was there.

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.690
So always make sure that you if you want to go back in the old days stuff you can just make sure that

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.870
you come here and you click whatever you need to click here and you can even update some of this information

10
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.320
if you want.

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.980
You click on the table you edit and then you can update stuff.

12
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.700
All right.

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.100
So anyway now that we done with that I just don't want you to think that every time you make something

14
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.170
you cannot.

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.660
Coming up data just in case I wanted to give you that information.

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.670
But anyway so let's go ahead and create a mark up because now that we have a database and now that we

17
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.940
have a table with some data in there we need to actually have ph we communicate.

18
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.910
We may as well and find out something about these data or create new data.

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.410
Right.

20
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.770
So it would be fun to do that.

21
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.250
So let's do that.

22
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.910
All right.

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.420
So let's come here somewhere and right click on it and let's create a folder I'm going to call this

24
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
for my AS WELL MY as well.

25
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.990
All right.

26
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.100
Perfect.

27
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.410
So I have this for the record my ask you I'm going to reichlich this for that I'm going to create a

28
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.130
new file and call this logon.

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.650
The reason why I'm going to separate this from everything else here is because I want you to have these

30
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.920
files just in case you have any issues connecting with my school.

31
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.260
I'm going to click enter.

32
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.450
I have this log in here.

33
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.480
Actually it's got to be logging that BHB enter.

34
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.500
There we go.

35
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.700
All right.

36
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240
So we need so mark up for this.

37
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.310
And now will be using this markup so I'm just going to copy that.

38
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.080
I should add we did a save as on on that file but that's fine.

39
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.390
Let's go to Logan.

40
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.320
Save it.

41
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.560
All right.

42
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.830
One last thing that I'm going to do here and just this is just personal preference is that I'm going

43
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.920
to go to get bootstrap.

44
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.000
The reason why I'm going to do this is because I want the styles for my for I don't like my forms to

45
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.270
be completely empty with no styles or where or little style not too much but not too little.

46
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.870
All right.

47
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.000
So I've got a corset here on the platform you give me a bow.

48
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.330
Get a bubble strap.

49
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.110
All right so if you like what I do here you can always look at that course and learn something about

50
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.090
it.

51
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.370
All right.

52
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.960
So I'm just going to link this.

53
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.030
And this is basically a framework that is going to make your applications responsive and there is going

54
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.010
to make a really nice and you're going to see in a minute how we can make a form look really good.

55
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.780
Right.

56
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.940
So now that it's linked I don't need this anymore I just need a browser or whatever that's fine.

57
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.830
They just open it up or open it up again.

58
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.890
What I need here is a markup so I'm going to do that.

59
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.390
All right.

60
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.990
So basically what I what I link here is a framework.

61
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.640
OK.

62
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.510
Don't get confused.

63
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.580
This is just going to make my application responsive and your application if you want to do that and

64
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.850
we'll make it nice and pretty if you know how to use it.

65
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.860
So I'm going to create a form and first create a div here with a container class.

66
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.730
You don't have to use this.

67
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.470
By the way if you already know how to create a form made you don't want to just go ahead and use this.

68
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.570
What I'm using right now that's fine.

69
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.440
I suggest you use this or that way you can learn something new.

70
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.320
All right so I created this for a class of container and inside here and then I created a number there

71
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.810
would be a class of access sets.

72
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.590
These classes that I'm put in right here has to do with this framework here.

73
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.360
They are already predefined inside his framework and they get to make my application more responsive

74
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:27.720
and they go and put some classes into them or write some styles into my application to my markup or

75
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.250
H them out if you want to call it that.

76
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.760
So I'm going to have a forum here inside this.

77
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.380
This is basically the grid grid class.

78
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.850
OK.

79
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.320
For those of you that know actually a male and I'm going to create another here with a class or form

80
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:52.560
group or write in an input field where a class of form control

81
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.800
by

82
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.570
that's fine that's fine.

83
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.840
All right.

84
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.060
Foreign control.

85
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.880
And does this differ here.

86
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.560
My father should create a label for my for my inputs but I was going to do that later so I'm going to

87
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.750
create the second he was going to be password was me and this one here.

88
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:35.700
Let's create a label for it because it looks really bad label for user name and it's called a user name

89
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.140
here.

90
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.240
And this copy that one into the next one.

91
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.410
And this makes this a little bit

92
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.710
better.

93
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.570
All right.

94
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.870
This is because my resolution is so big so that way you guys can see what I'm doing.

95
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.560
That's why it looks like this but I can make it smaller like this and then fix it up.

96
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.670
All right.

97
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.930
Hopefully you are seeing this and you're going to fix it up real quick and.

98
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.950
All right.

99
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.730
So let's just put it right here that's fine.

100
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.610
This will this for him he has a problem.

101
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.400
Is this just fix this.

102
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.260
Real quick right here.

103
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.240
This is for form control

104
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.560
control.

105
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.230
Fix that.

106
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.950
And this is fix it right there.

107
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.970
All right.

108
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.180
So now we need to put another class here.

109
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.830
Well actually we are done with classes here but this is a password level

110
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.690
password Leavell.

111
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.530
Geez.

112
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.390
All right.

113
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.900
And this of course has to be password too.

114
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:15.780
We are getting everything ready to be sending this via method might be a post.

115
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.500
OK.

116
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.610
And this is here that's fine.

117
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.930
There we go.

118
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.360
Scary right scary.

119
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.950
Make sure that this will

120
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.010
go to the same page up here.

121
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:41.100
And first the user name field will need to pass and the user name to the post.

122
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:48.710
So for a global and this one that we need to pass in the password should know how to do this already.

123
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.110
Shoot me.

124
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.760
All right.

125
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.520
All right.

126
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.530
I'm losing my voice sorry guys.

127
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.880
All right.

128
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.840
So all right.

129
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:07.550
So when you get some by in here OK long form.

130
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.230
Let's make a button here.

131
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:16.860
So Mitt and I'm doing this a little faster explaining much since you already know how to do this HD

132
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.580
mail.

133
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:26.430
If you don't you need to do that because if you want to know about BHB really good you need to know

134
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.650
how to implement the smell.

135
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.940
You don't have to be an expert in the mail but you got to know a little bit.

136
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:39.740
So let's make this been called so mad let's name it let's put a name attribute here called sort MIT.

137
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.760
Let's put a value here.

138
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:48.930
I've met with a capital S and that was me my boy and really.

139
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.410
Oh and let's just do another class here just to make a.

140
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.750
Looks good look good.

141
00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:03.690
So if I go back here and I see my band is black right here and he's actually sending get information

142
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.340
here.

143
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.040
If you notice this sending in there you are always sending some information.

144
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.810
And we talked about that already.

145
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.810
So but anyway that's another topic.

146
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.770
Let's make.

147
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:21.460
Give us some class here between primary will make this look good with this framework.

148
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.460
All right.

149
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.950
Now how nice right.

150
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.960
That takes a lot of classes to make the little Bunday like that a lot of styles.

151
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.300
And we were able to do it with only two classes.

152
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.940
Right.

153
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.630
With this framework so we created the markup now.

154
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:45.060
And on the next lecture in this lecture is already big enough we will create a way to for this to submit

155
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.320
and receive this data via post in the other side.

156
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.050
Right.

157
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.590
So perfect.

158
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.430
Thank you so much for watching this and hopefully you get this down.

159
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.680
This would be in your course that the size files don't get lazy do it.

160
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.670
It will benefit you.

161
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.040
Thank you so much and I see you in the next lecture.
