1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,290
All right guys so in the last section we were able to you know make our phone work.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,480
All right let me show you exactly OK.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,310
So we were able to you know every time we select something here our form is submit and some type of

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,260
data right here on top.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,860
Now that data right now it's not doing much because you know we don't have first of all we don't have

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,230
the right data and we're now even detecting the data right now 100 percent.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,670
So let's start playing around with it a little bit over here on the top.

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:41,840
I want to start working with it right below this code OK.

9
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,410
As a matter of fact we can do this above.

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:52,270
I think this code is super important so I'm just going to he's going gonna do this sending email here

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,810
because that's how I think we got push it here.

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,810
Let's just put pusher C..

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,810
Yeah.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,890
Push your stuff and just put pusher below and then we're doing authentication.

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,140
I'm just gonna put something here real quick.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:24,770
Anyway so I'm just gonna put this right here above and here I'm just going to do something like setting

17
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,390
language

18
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:38,180
variables something like that and I'm just gonna check right here real quick to see the same function

19
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,780
we have been using a set to see if I guess some type of data.

20
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,050
Let me see the name of the data right here in this form.

21
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,550
All right.

22
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,650
So as you can see right now the name of the data that's coming in that variable is going to be called

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,540
Lang.

24
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:03,240
OK that's super important because that's what we're going to have all the values of the option right

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,420
here.

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,010
That's option elements I'm going to have I'm going to be recognized this is this is a value that we

27
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:14,520
want to catch the N and the yes and depending on these values we're going to be including files.

28
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,520
OK.

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,000
So let's take the first lesson Make sure that's coming in.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,890
OK and once it comes in.

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,400
We want to assign that value to a session so we can play around with it.

32
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:33,900
OK.

33
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:40,300
So every time we refresh a page it we do not lose our value those values.

34
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,680
OK.

35
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,730
So we can do that.

36
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,490
Now the next step is we want to reload our page.

37
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,960
OK.

38
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,460
Depending on the data.

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:02,700
So let's say if a set let's just say session lag because right now this should be let's just put assign

40
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,130
it to a key here which I forgot.

41
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,400
And let's just put language you just to make it.

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,320
That's fine.

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,270
Lang is fine it's just too lagged for short.

44
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:21,350
Lot of people do that and I do it myself so I'm just going to copy this guy out put it right here and

45
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,330
let's do another check real quick as well.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,330
Let's do and and let's put session equals to this guy right here

47
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,070
OK.

48
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:46,680
So we are saying here if a set session Lang and the session Lang is equal to this guy right here that's

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,430
coming in then we want to refresh a page.

50
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,910
All right.

51
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,140
So right now what I'm going to do I'm going to put some javascript MP HP stuff so I'm just gonna do

52
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,190
a script I'm going to close.

53
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:04,970
Let's make sure we have it open my script tax here going to close him I'm going to make sure that he's

54
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:13,180
type of JavaScript OK and that's JavaScript or something like that.

55
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:23,050
And then we see and you say here I just want to execute a function is gonna be the location that reload.

56
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,180
OK.

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,850
This function is gonna be in charge of refreshing the page.

58
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,310
OK so this should be working 100 percent all right.

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,740
And we can test this out.

60
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,720
But right now we're not going to see anything because our beaches refreshing anyway because of the form

61
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,220
data.

62
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:52,010
So the next step for us would be to write some more code that is going to include those files that we

63
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,360
created.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,630
OK.

65
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:03,450
So I'm going to copy this guy out right here and I'm just gonna do this and do that like that.

66
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,010
So I'm going to include

67
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:16,410
those files inside includes folder inside the languages folder and I'm just gonna finish my script right

68
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:25,420
there but I don't want to attach the name of that file which is gonna be in this session called Lang

69
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,500
and I want to also attach the BHP extension.

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,560
OK let's make sure we got this right though languages.

71
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,870
And then here we have an extension.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,030
OK.

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,560
And then here what I want to do is I want to also provide an L statement here because we want to make

74
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,780
sure that we have on top of the full file that we are including so else.

75
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:02,370
And then we just say listen if you can't find this here there's value.

76
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,480
OK.

77
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:15,380
If the session is not set then what I want to do is I want to include the English file and BHP OK so

78
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:25,990
let's check it might not work 100 percent so let's see we're going to refresh this.

79
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:32,450
And if I click on this this is not going to probably work because we've got a lot of stuff that's you

80
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:39,120
know that needs to happen before we we make this whole application work 100 percent.

81
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:46,500
All right but we need to inspect this a little bit and make sure that this is correct this looks correct

82
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,850
and this looks correct right here.

83
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:55,350
But you know later on we'll probably encounter some type of error here and we'll fix it.

84
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,230
So I'm going to leave this lecture the way it is.

85
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:04,410
I think we've done enough here and I'll see you guys in the Nats lecture where we are gonna make sure

86
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:10,320
that we have our form sending the right type of data our option elements are showing a right type of

87
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,120
data and everything is actually working 100 percent.

88
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,210
So that's where we are going to be going on the next lecture.

89
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,820
See you then.
