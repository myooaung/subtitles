1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,140
All right.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,190
So we made our cold a lot more usable now.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,930
Our index is looking great since it doesn't have all that extra mail that clutters everything.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,210
So we will probably be including this in another file later on but right now for simplicity we're just

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,630
going to leave it in there.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,490
So what we want to do right now is we have a table in our database called category.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,870
As a matter of fact let's just change it make it more little bit a little bit more appropriate since

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,370
we're not going to be holding one category.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,940
We're going to be holding many categories.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:40,590
Let's just change a name on it and let's go to operation just click here and go to operation and click

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,280
categories and click go right there where we can rename it.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,060
Let's go ahead.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,800
Insert some data into that.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,030
And let's call this bootstrap.

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,120
You don't have to call it bootstrap but you can call it whatever you want but if you want to follow

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,160
me exactly do that javascript click go.

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,480
And we have some information there that we can pool now and find out how to do this right.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,040
So let's go to navigation.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,720
I'm going to go to my working files right here and just to show you this field right here this header.

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,990
Am going to separate a little bit just to show you.

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,340
Remember that we are using a framework so this called all of these classes are being reproduced by the

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,150
framework of the Templi.

23
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,440
If I minimizers and you click I click there that is that section right here.

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,050
Right.

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:38,440
This next section is the links that were going to be replacing right here.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,530
You know that right.

27
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:49,740
So we're going to be doing some BHB here to replace those links ongoing right now too.

28
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,150
We can just go ahead and comment this out for now.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,740
Then later on we take it off.

30
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:04,840
All right so what we want to do right now is start with a BHB tag of course open and close BHB tag.

31
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:13,260
It is a little bigger so you can see what we're doing and let's make a query here.

32
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,810
Querrey if

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,340
this is going to be a variable Actually I'm going to pull this I'm going to pull this query into a verbal

34
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,240
and I'm going to say select and you probably see me doing this before in the database section.

35
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:37,410
I had to select all from where where we actually wanted to display here categories remember that Categories

36
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,070
table.

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,070
Right so we're going to select all the data from categories categories

38
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,600
and that's it.

39
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,580
Let's say that's what we want to select.

40
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:57,070
That's that's actually would make sure that we write the key we're from select all from categories.

41
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,720
Right.

42
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,210
And then we need another query here.

43
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,990
Actually we need to send this in.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,520
All right.

45
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:13,830
So we're going to say Querrey category select and you can name this differently select all categories

46
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,160
or US

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,550
query.

48
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,500
This is a long name I just want you to know that that's what it is.

49
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,670
And actually we don't need this here.

50
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:35,760
My S Q Well I Querrey is a function we use to send those parameters out query and we got to send it

51
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
in with a connection.

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,520
Remember that variable that we used to make this a little smaller tool for the connection that is this

53
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,000
variable from the database and that variable is in the includes the be right here.

54
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:53,820
All right.

55
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,280
And we need to include this file actually there for that to work but I just finish it up right now.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,050
Now again it's good to know again.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,300
So we need to foster the connection and we need to pass of the Querrey that would go right here.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,670
We also need to make an all file call functions but we'll probably do that later on since I want to

59
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,910
show you how to do this first and then later on we start refactoring everything into functionality like

60
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,830
we've done before and other lectures.

61
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,630
So select all categories from that and then we need to display to bring back those values.

62
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,910
We use a while loop.

63
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,770
All right so we're going to look through all that and we're going to sign that all that value all those

64
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,420
values to another to a variable.

65
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,610
But right now before we do that let's use another function here that is going to help us do that.

66
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:56,910
It's called My Eskew Well I remember we use an API my YOU ALLY fetch.

67
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,940
We can use a saw to this.

68
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,930
That's fine.

69
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:14,320
All am spending this wrong actually right there and we want to fetch what does result right there.

70
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,410
OK.

71
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:28,530
And then we want to assign that resoled too because it comes into our in an array and associative array.

72
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,100
All right.

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,510
So that's how it comes out.

74
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,120
And what are the names all those roles are kept.

75
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,340
Title is the name.

76
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,850
All right that's what we want to display on that kind of where we are.

77
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:50,740
And if I because this is a UL right now what if one of these planes that is UL is our ally right.

78
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:59,190
So I'm going to sign this to a variable called Cat title just to make it more a little bit easier to

79
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,290
see inside.

80
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,830
Is going to do a ekal.

81
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,590
And inside this egg we're going to put this variable right here to this play.

82
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,520
We want to display as an ally list item.

83
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:20,360
And inside this item we'll want to put that cat's title variable in there.

84
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,670
So Cat Fido.

85
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,600
All right.

86
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,280
So let's just make sure that the reason I put double quotes is that way I can use this.

87
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,330
Make sure you use double quotes when you can use brackets and make this separate from your mail in a

88
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,990
way.

89
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,920
All right.

90
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,600
This is the only way you can put variables in there with his brackets with double cords outside for

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,320
posting records.

92
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,870
I think I show you that already.

93
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,680
They don't work.

94
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,010
That's in the beginning of course I have a lecture on that lie.

95
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,630
All right.

96
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,580
So we should be able to see something here.

97
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,550
If I'm fighting forget it.

98
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,960
I started my life I almost forgot.

99
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:08,430
We need to include our D-B connection in our.

100
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:18,190
It's so we have the header but we need a connection right here also so I'm going to copy this and we're

101
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,990
gonna include a connection.

102
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,350
And this is going to be called the B.

103
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,050
So let's see how that works so maybe we have an error or something actually says we are connected actually.

104
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:37,600
And he's already displaying the files here we can't see it because we need links for that.

105
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,280
All right.

106
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,390
So we are connected we are displaying what we need to organize in a little bit.

107
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,070
And this is playing we are connected.

108
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,370
Let's go back to the D.B and take that we are connect the I'll just comment that for now we don't need

109
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:50,840
it.

110
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,400
Let's go back to navigation and we need to put this in the link right here.

111
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,720
He's going to copy this.

112
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,910
Make sure that they are on the link made this single chords.

113
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,160
OK.

114
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,220
So

115
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,860
now we should be able to see something nice sir nicer.

116
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,740
There we go.

117
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,250
They see navigation is not working yet.

118
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,860
It's not directing us to any contemn because we don't have any contact associated with this.

119
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,110
But as you can see here we are displaying this from the database.

120
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,280
All right.

121
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,600
So that's a start.

122
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:40,170
And if we go heading another field that's insur and I'll field say something like

123
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,220
BHB.

124
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,320
And here we're going to say Java go.

125
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,720
And then we go back to this and we refresh.

126
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,740
You can see that that's being incremented there automatically we are displaying dynamic data from our

127
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,050
database.

128
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,650
Right.

129
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,390
Just we are a little bit of cold here.

130
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,280
We are doing all that.

131
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,760
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture here and get ready for the next one.

132
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,800
Take care.
