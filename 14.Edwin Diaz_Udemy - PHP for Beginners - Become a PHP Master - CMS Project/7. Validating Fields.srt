00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,900
Welcome back my students I hope you're having a great day in this lecture here.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,490
We are going to be validating.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:07,890
All right.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,840
They use every little bit that way.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,560
You know we don't submit data that is not empty well not data wouldn't submit forms like these that

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,030
are empty.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:25,380
For example if I click here now and I go back to here you can see an empty field right here so we don't

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,520
want to do that we don't want to have this here.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,260
So let's go ahead and fix that right now.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,090
So the way we're going to be doing this is super simple.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,360
All right we are going to be checking on these fields right here to see if they're empty and we've done

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,600
this before many times.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,020
If you want to go ahead and pause the video and do it you know you can go ahead and do that.

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:54,570
Well now what I'm going to do is I want to check first in my file we can do it from up here if we wanted

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,400
to from the top.

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,240
So we're going to say if whoops if it's not him.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,920
There we go.

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,130
And I'm going to put this a couple of times.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,910
All right like this.

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,420
And so we're going to check if it's not empty.

21
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,930
They use their name right.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,910
The e-mail.

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,980
So we've got this and the what password.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,430
That's right you are right.

25
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:29,840
All right.

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,580
Let's open our curly brackets and close them right away.

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
And let's just copy and paste all this stuff in there right.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,430
Right.

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,480
From here.

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:44,800
Going to copy this thing and I commend ed to actually you and paste it there.

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,500
So now we save and we go back to it.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,110
Remonstration right here.

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,740
And I try to submit something actually that school its users.

34
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,950
Is open there.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,640
You can see that nothing has been submitted.

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,430
All right you can try it many times and refresh this in nothing there.

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,290
All right.

38
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,610
So keep that in mind.

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,600
We're good to go with that.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,230
All right.

41
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,390
So now what I want to do besides this is that I wanted to also give the user we want to give the user

42
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,050
some type of notification here saying they cannot leave this feel empty right.

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,750
And also when they submit the form we also want to give them you know some type of message right.

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,220
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

45
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,720
So the way we do that is super simple once we finish writing all these Square-D down we know that it

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,710
works right here we're going to set a variable and we're going to put some strings in this very well

47
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:51,210
we're going to say something like your registration restriction has been submitted.

48
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,110
All right.

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,490
There we go.

50
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,320
Perfect.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,230
Now when they submit the form are they going to get this.

52
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,060
But what about if they don't.

53
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,200
So we also need to make sure that they have a valid date we have a validation for that by a message.

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:15,930
So if it's not if is empty then you know if it's 90 it is empty so we need to put something for that.

55
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,870
So now of course we need to equity's this variable somewhere else here in the form and I'll show you

56
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,520
in a minute where but right now let's just finish this fields.

57
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,250
Words can be empty.

58
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:32,930
There we go.

59
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,680
I'm laughing because I'm making so many typos they're so fast.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,970
All right.

61
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,810
So we got to make sure that we put this somewhere here too.

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,930
All right.

63
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,790
So right here below this for am I going to minimize this a little bit so I can see my form better.

64
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,100
All right.

65
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,710
It's all right here.

66
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,340
On to the form element.

67
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:03,140
I'm just going to put in a h sits and I'm going to make this a little bigger so you can see it sits

68
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,920
and some DHB in there.

69
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,350
I need to get down to completion feature.

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,970
Hopefully they maybe they have a plug for this editor about that.

71
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,610
But I've got to look it up.

72
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,520
Anyway so we've got to equity's message right here.

73
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,340
All right.

74
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,570
Right now let's make sure that we also make this test straight.

75
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:33,000
You know when that line is tead So we're going to put a class here of touch center têtes hyphen Center.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,720
All right that's going to center this message we don't want this message to be all the way to the left

77
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,190
like he's defaulted to do.

78
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:49,170
Now another thing here is that if for some reason we clicked we don't click submit this BHB is going

79
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,800
to be looking for this message here and he's going to be empty so that's going to cause an error.

80
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,160
So let me just show you real quick.

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,520
You see that we've got this arrow here because the variable is undefined right now which is actually

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,600
trying to equil but is not in there right.

83
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,790
So what we need to do is right below here and this is the main if statement.

84
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,110
The first one right here you can see that it lie onto the curly bracket.

85
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:23,830
There we do a now statement and we are going to be making that variable empty.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,780
We don't want to display anything there.

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,130
We don't need a variable so we're just going to make it empty.

88
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,550
So now if we go back and we click enter nothing is there.

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,630
So let's just go ahead and submit something right to see if it works for us.

90
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,900
Let's check this one.

91
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,900
Register fields cannot be empty.

92
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,990
That works.

93
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,910
Let's check something else.

94
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,140
And you can be as great as you want.

95
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,290
You can make this maybe put a class here or EQ or something inside here.

96
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,070
I mean think about it try to be creative you know.

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,530
There are many different ways of doing this.

98
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,150
You can put on javascript thing here I mean and I show you how to do that in one of the videos from

99
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,790
before.

100
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:10,770
How you can click here and have a pop up box open and say you know something to the user but I prefer

101
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,110
they use it to see something.

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,000
Têtes But anyway let's go ahead and submit on this I'm just going to call this gambit from the X-Men.

103
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,910
Remember those cartoons that were pretty cool.

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,920
Well some kids still watch it.

105
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,050
I don't watch it anymore.

106
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,090
Of course not guys.

107
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,110
Come on.

108
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,120
And some passwords.

109
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,420
There we go and register.

110
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,240
And as you can see here says your registration has been submitted.

111
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,380
All right let's go back to Weidmann.

112
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,510
Actually we can have it right here.

113
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,700
Refresh and you can see that the user was submitted.

114
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,330
Now we're assuming the user with the first name the last name will let them come over here and edit

115
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,240
and put their name right Robert.

116
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,680
And then Sandro.

117
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,230
I don't know if anybody's name like that of the user.

118
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,590
And we go back here and we could see that there.

119
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,080
All right.

120
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,690
So that's a way of doing that.

121
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,180
All right so anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I see you in the next one.
