WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:10.680
All right so in the last video we created the form and we test of the form to see if it was working

2
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.630
to see if we got some data out of it and we were able to get some data out of it.

3
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.490
Now this search engine is sending information.

4
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.050
We know that it's working.

5
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.870
You can see that.

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.970
But right now it's not working in a database level so we need to go to our database.

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.080
We need to make a query and find the what the user types in and compare it to what we got in the database.

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.410
Right.

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.140
So we we got what the user types and what we need to go in and jump into the database and compare it

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.960
with the data that we got in there.

11
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.900
All right.

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:54.120
So if this meant I apply this search this data to a variable I want to use that variable to go inside

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.790
the database but let's make a query first.

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.580
So we make a query here.

15
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.170
Let's close it before we forget.

16
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.780
Right.

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:13.870
And let's go and say select what I want to select everything right from Polsce because that's where

18
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.830
we are going to be looking for.

19
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.620
Right.

20
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.840
And we're going to set a condition here inside the HE WILL way or post-tax.

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.140
Remember that field in our side our database show you real quick where that is post-tax right here.

22
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.770
All right we made a feel inside our table polls and this is where we are going to be searching for.

23
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.880
So we're tax equal why let's just make sure that our search.

24
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.720
That's right.

25
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.710
You forgot this correctly you are awesome right.

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.570
But wait wait a minute.

27
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.320
Hold on.

28
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.580
This doesn't work like this.

29
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.350
Actually we want to be able to find out a little bit more data about about our what user types in.

30
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.450
So we're going to be using another key word that I want to show you about a place that we're going to

31
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.950
use this keyword like.

32
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.780
So we select everything from posts where post tax like our search is in our database.

33
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.310
Remember this is a string.

34
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.980
This is a tets coming in.

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.880
Right.

36
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.140
And we need to actually include something else percent here.

37
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.760
All right.

38
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.050
Perfect.

39
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.400
I know that we're all right but you can look it up on line.

40
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.130
That just makes it go.

41
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.210
It's like a variable.

42
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.670
So but anyway so now that we select everything from posts where post-tax like our search.

43
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.140
All right then we need to send a query to the database.

44
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.290
Let's go ahead and send that and we're going to say search Querrey

45
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.110
search query is there.

46
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.410
So let's use this function in mind.

47
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.110
You lie Querrey

48
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.770
right connection.

49
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.240
All right.

50
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.140
Perfect.

51
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.920
So I think we're good.

52
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.960
All right.

53
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.130
Let's go ahead and check to see if that work is good because I don't want to make a long piece of coal

54
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.110
beneath that and then find out where he's the one making the mistake.

55
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.230
You know the one not being this place so if I fails I'm going to use another function I'm going to use

56
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.310
the statement for us and say if not Querrey meaning that this returns false then we are going to be

57
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.620
killing everything after it.

58
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.010
That's what my dysfunction means and we've got to output something.

59
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.720
So I'm going to output Querrey failed.

60
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.880
First of all and then I just want to put a message also Aram

61
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.540
era Eskew illai actually is my guess.

62
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:25.710
Q A LIE ALL error function here with pass it in the connection and it's very good get in the habit of

63
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.370
doing this because that way you can find out the errors that you have to go through.

64
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.100
I see a lot of developers and programmers actually missing out of this information checking for the

65
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.860
query.

66
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.610
And what happens is then you have a code in your syntax and you spend like three hours looking for and

67
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.360
you never find it or you find it two days after.

68
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.130
Because sometimes you you write a lot of code and you know you just can't see it right in front of you.

69
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.680
The mistake is right there you can't see it because you write too much.

70
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.990
All right.

71
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.500
So

72
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.590
let's test this out.

73
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.420
Hello.

74
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.530
It's not working.

75
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.270
Of course not.

76
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.990
Actually my reworking I think this one has Paul stacks off.

77
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.170
We don't have enough there to to actually check these out.

78
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.020
Let me see the post tags.

79
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.800
Let's go to the polls and let's check out some some of the polls tags information

80
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.540
javascript.

81
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.830
When

82
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.300
we don't have.

83
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.960
Hello there.

84
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:39.120
So let's just do a simple test here just to make sure that this is actually working.

85
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.440
All right.

86
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:51.230
So let's actually count the rows that are coming out of our Querrey as you lie numb rolls.

87
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.240
Just going to check if we have any results coming in.

88
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.450
If not then we display some type of message right.

89
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.570
Well we're going to check.

90
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.100
We've going to take these results here and check it out.

91
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.050
And we're going to sign it to a variable here so that we can use it more effectively.

92
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.790
All right so now that we have the count there let's check it out.

93
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.900
Let's do another count equals zero.

94
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.270
Then we want to play something.

95
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.900
What do we want to display.

96
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.380
I don't know.

97
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.420
Something like H-1

98
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.990
no resort.

99
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:38.420
We can later on fix this but let's just do this real quick and find out which one are we sold.

100
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.930
Or let's just make sure one more time that everything is good here select from polls where poll stacks.

101
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.640
Like I'm pretty sure that's good.

102
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:57.960
And Querrey here is also good thing if it's not search and we have no syntax error here so let's make

103
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.640
sure this tax match is curly brackets.

104
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.570
All right.

105
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.470
I think it is good to see what happens.

106
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.400
So when I say hello no result.

107
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.840
All right so in that coming up with waiting for put Edwin Dan addling is right here.

108
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:28.630
If I put Belinda our key word listee that Linda actually we have the polls tagging here somewhere post-tax.

109
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.960
Right.

110
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.150
And

111
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.990
it is actually coming now it's displaying the data right here.

112
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.930
But he's also explained this one here.

113
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.660
So we need to make it a little bit more descriptive list.

114
00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:03.180
Eddy this one here and let's this is the let's just enter one key word here.

115
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:08.430
Melinda centers should work anyway.

116
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.290
Well

117
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:21.120
actually the reason why this is not working is because we're not telling you what to display.

118
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.930
All right.

119
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.120
We're not telling.

120
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.270
We're not selling this display this display right.

121
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.270
This is all the functionality right here but we're not selling it.

122
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.190
Hey when you find your own what are you going to display.

123
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.790
Right.

124
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:42.720
Because right now if we say else of course not we say some result right.

125
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.600
Because if it comes it comes with a saw then we'll explain something.

126
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.550
I'll show you right now.

127
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.190
It is finding stuff out.

128
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:57.720
We just can't display it right now so we say Belinda You see some result we just haven't given the data.

129
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.200
So the last lecture we're going to give us some data.

130
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.970
All right.

131
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.740
And we're going to make this display something else.

132
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.590
All right so it is working.

133
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.550
We just got to give us some data to explain.

134
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.040
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

135
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.940
I'll see you the next one.

136
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.900
Take care.
