1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,330
All right so we have this form working with their images or images are going to the right place but

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,430
we need to put some data here and submit it to a database.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,140
All right so we need to do the query to do that.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,580
So we are an admin includes at pool stoppie HP right.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,870
And we this is where we left off last last time.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,170
All right.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,190
Perfect.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,560
So the next step here is to do the query.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,790
Now I do have the equerry copy and it's kind of long.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,950
So I just got to warn you on that and I'll paste it right here.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,250
All right.

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:44,070
So all we have is just a normal query here to insert into posts and then we have the parameters enclosed

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,180
in parentheses.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:53,250
As you can see all in one line divided by code my These are the fields in our table here.

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,930
And we discussed this earlier.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,550
These are exactly the same columns actually in our table.

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,040
All right.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,300
So that's the first part of the query.

19
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,900
Remember usually this goes in one line.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,810
All of it and the rest that I'm going to be pasting here right now in a minute we're going one line

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,460
two but we don't have that much space is good to divide it especially for your understanding.

22
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:25,600
So if I faced this in here we're going to follow the same query to concatenate this with this.

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,920
All right so remember this is all usually all in one line but it's too long.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,410
So we have to improvise.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,850
So we're concatenating and the next step is values and we enclose that in parentheses and then we pass

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,560
it in the variables from here.

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,410
All these variables were passed down here to this call for this columns.

28
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,040
So we are inserting values for each of these columns down here and these values are coming from our

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,970
form.

30
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,870
Keep that in mind.

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,880
We are also using single calls for each of these values since they are strings.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:07,250
Well this one is not a string so you don't have to use a court for that because it won't be a string.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,380
It will be a number.

34
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,510
All right.

35
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,110
So post-Idol pulls.

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,740
Here.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,110
There's another thing that you have not seen and is that we are sending as a value a function.

38
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,500
All right.

39
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,940
This is going to format this date right here that we are sending in and make it look good in in the

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,700
site in the database when he goes there.

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,750
All right so no that is now functioning You can also look that up in the be there and there is a lot

42
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,140
of functions for the date.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,680
I mean there is a lot of ways that you can format your dates so that's a different topic.

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,270
OK.

45
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,930
And has you I can make a coarsen that that's how that's how much information there is on the date.

46
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:58,950
So we're sending the post image here that they feel in a database post content that's way single codes

47
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,290
and coma.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,550
So remember that you can copy and paste all of this.

49
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,290
Another way of doing this actually would be to divide this all all these values each of them into queries

50
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,760
and concatenate it with an assignment operator.

51
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,720
But I'm not going to go into details with that right now.

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,110
Let's go ahead and say this.

53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,850
Hopefully you.

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,080
You got you got it down.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,830
Copy and let's try this form out right.

56
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,280
That's stuff that we've been looking for.

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,420
So let's go and do it.

58
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,510
All right so I'm just going to click here and we have an arrow there that's why I click there to just

59
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,510
make sure that we don't have any errors in saying that we have something on line 23.

60
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,670
We have a mistake line 23 we have an on expected.

61
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,050
All right.

62
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,810
So because we didn't copy the we don't have the dollar sign.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,160
Here we go.

64
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,340
Let's get it done.

65
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,490
We didn't copy it right.

66
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,350
And you believe it.

67
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,360
Yes.

68
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,510
That's bad paste.

69
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,130
All right so let's just put something like javascript here.

70
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:15,750
Post category is just going to be three or whatever and others are just going to be me for now.

71
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,780
And my name is my last name is Flash.

72
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,510
Like I was about to write there the start of this is going to be draft actually to publish.

73
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,470
It doesn't really matter.

74
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,690
This is for the most patient purposes only.

75
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,430
We're going to set a different image so we can know that that's what we're doing.

76
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:42,300
Let's send Sontag's javascript Korsh class right.

77
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,830
And let's just put some content.

78
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,550
This course is great.

79
00:04:52,020 --> 00:05:01,370
And the minute that see it on the database post we need to refresh it when he says that pulls.

80
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,790
And let's see if he did.

81
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,510
All right.

82
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,610
One thing that I want to show you right here before we go any further is that we have a problem we have

83
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,450
a mistake somewhere and we need to check for that.

84
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,340
And right now I'm going to take this and make a little function to check on this because we have been

85
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:28,680
making queries over and over again like this if not actually we have not send it I'm sorry we have not

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,800
send it.

87
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:36,990
I thought we did and we had a mistake but when we didn't paste this this is basically we'd make it just

88
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,730
like we would a category's would make a variable here and we hold the connection in my ask you I query.

89
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,380
I don't I copy that down.

90
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm sorry about that.

91
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,730
Let's check it out now.

92
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,430
So it should work.

93
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,600
But anyway we're going to do that function just to check to see if the Querrey worked.

94
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,070
So we don't have to be doing copy and pasting all the time.

95
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,680
I just going to write anything here since I don't want to take your time too much.

96
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,580
And this I got to write my name please.

97
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,330
And then let's just do it right away.

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,030
Right.

99
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,730
Well the fields are there.

100
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,900
Let me see.

101
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,200
I think it will help me out.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,860
Yeah it's helping me out.

103
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,730
And actually if I just yeah it's helping me out filling it up.

104
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,410
For me this is not helping me out here.

105
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,320
And let's get an image real quick we'll go and let's publish.

106
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,490
Let's see if it works.

107
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,890
Right working but we've still got to make that function anyway.

108
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,720
Refresh.

109
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,340
All right.

110
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,920
So we got the idea right here automatically we have the category and this idea might look might be different

111
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,680
for you.

112
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,080
Don't worry about it.

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,070
Javascript to push all do everything is in the right order.

114
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,580
That day came out good here.

115
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,680
Image placeholder This is the content post tags comment and publish perfit everything in our database

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,310
came out good.

117
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,290
Let me show you the function real quick and you should know the function.

118
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,790
But we're going to make it a function and there's a little piece of code actually it's not even a function

119
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,360
yet.

120
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,290
If

121
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,840
not quavery right remember that.

122
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,320
Well we've got to make a little function of me because I'm tired of typing this am I.

123
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,890
And you should be tired too.

124
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,860
You should be making this easier right.

125
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:31,710
I should be making this easy let's say Querrey failed and then we can Kartini a function to do the error

126
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,170
for us and we pass it in that connection.

127
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,350
All right.

128
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:46,080
So let's say we make a mistake right here and I just put another Colma here at the end just you know

129
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,980
just checking this out

130
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,930
and just going to do whatever here and just publish we got an area right here where we feel you have

131
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,530
an error in your it's near line 1 or whatever right.

132
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,550
Well this is working we know that already.

133
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:11,950
And what I want to do is take this to a function Yeah I'm a little tired here of salt.

134
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,810
I just cannot command Etzel control that's it.

135
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:25,440
And let's take it this two functions are functions fall and we have a functions right here.

136
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,180
All right let's take it in and let's put it all the way on top here.

137
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:40,500
Let's call this function call frm Querrey.

138
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,290
Right.

139
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:50,340
Actually confirms so shorter like that we don't have to write anything now but actually yeah that's

140
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,710
fine.

141
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,690
Let's leave it like this because I just don't want to write too much.

142
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,020
All right.

143
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:03,480
So while we need to do to call this function then we need to pass it a parameter so we need to say the

144
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,800
result here or something like that where resoled.

145
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,820
All right.

146
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,300
And make sure that you put it right here because we're going to be passing his parameter from somewhere

147
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,310
else.

148
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,090
Make sure that's good.

149
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,500
All right.

150
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,120
Let's check it out.

151
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,600
Let's go to our polls and.

152
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,140
All right.

153
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,100
Take this out with us.

154
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,230
First confirm

155
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,520
and put it right here.

156
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:45,410
Let's is make sure that this is confirmed and we're going to be confirming this guy right here right.

157
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,130
So we're going to pass it in that.

158
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,980
And there you should know how to do this.

159
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
We did this before.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,300
And let's see if it works better.

161
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,280
All right.

162
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,050
And we have a narrow but it's not confirmed confirmed create post Querrey.

163
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:12,450
And let's go to functions whether we forget here now resort to this.

164
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,060
Right.

165
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,870
Well we need to actually return

166
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,780
right return result.

167
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,900
We need to return it back.

168
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,160
All right let's do it right now.

169
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,290
Let's do it again.

170
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,350
Actually I think it was fine.

171
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,530
But anyway let's go to this this this and publish.

172
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,890
Oh you know what it is.

173
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,630
We don't need to return actually anything.

174
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,140
Sorry about that guys.

175
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,860
We need to do the global global connection.

176
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,270
Why would I need to return to this.

177
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,400
We don't need to return it.

178
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,610
We can just call it like this.

179
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,120
All right.

180
00:10:51,250 --> 00:11:00,060
So enter into this into that is foolish and that's it.

181
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,110
It's working.

182
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,180
All right.

183
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,650
So as you can see here what we're doing here is we created a function.

184
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:16,080
We're passing it pass in this variable and to the function which is here and these functions taking

185
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,940
care of that connect.

186
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,740
Now every time we need to call this we just call confirm and we can confirm anything.

187
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,400
All right.

188
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,060
You want to make him more descriptive.

189
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:33,150
Go ahead confer inquiry make him more descriptive and go back here and change the name of course and

190
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,910
that's it.

191
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,680
Let's take this out of here since we don't have that mistake anymore.

192
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:48,330
Refresh identify function confirm querulous save and let's make sure we save it in our functions file.

193
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,130
All right answer.

194
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,820
All right.

195
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,120
So it's working.

196
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,180
And hopefully that will help you out.

197
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,690
Make a little bit make this a little bit more dynamic OK.

198
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,200
Perfect.

199
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,020
It's going to speed up our production.

200
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,380
All right so I see you in the next lecture I think we're done for this with this for now and later on

201
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,260
we're going to be doing some more great stuff.

202
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,400
So see you in the next one.
