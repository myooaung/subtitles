00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,210
All right welcome back my students in this lecture here we are going to be learning how to join tables

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,250
and this is super important.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,710
But first of all before I explain why it's so important let me show you what tables talking about I'm

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,320
actually referring to the database tables.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,900
All right we've got to learn how to join any of these tables with another table right.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,760
For example we can join the post tables and the Categories table together we can join them and then

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,080
display information in one go.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,560
Let me show you what I mean.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,390
So if you go to your view or post page and this is the page that we are going to be working which is

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,210
this page right here in our front end right we're back an admin page.

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,990
All right we can see that we are displaying a lot of information here which is playing information from

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,230
the post table.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,200
We have the category title from the Categories table.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,990
We have the comments count from the comments table so we're using a couple of tables here but we're

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,640
not joining any of those on any of these tables.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,150
So we have to make a different Querrey all the time.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:10,200
All right so let me show you right now we are making inquiry right here to display all the post information

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,500
to get that data out so we can display it right.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,760
And then we also creating another query right here for the categories.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,280
All right.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,790
And then we are also creating another query for the comments table.

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,400
So you can imagine if we had an application that requires a lot more than this making queries all the

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,240
time so the database can be a problem.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,780
All right.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,990
So we're joining tables you can solve that problem by putting all these tables together and then explain

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,560
it in one query dummies that's going to give your server more memory is going to allow your server to

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,750
have more memory to do other stuff you know.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,060
So let's learn how to do this how we do this.

29
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,860
Well first of all we just joined the Post table in the Categories table just to give an example.

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,470
And then you can actually search all the information from there is super easy to do.

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,680
And if you want to take this to another level Ph.D. then that is your best friend.

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,880
And even my Eskdale Web site is your best friend.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,490
Right.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,400
You just look for joining tables and you're going to be good to go once you see how I do it.

35
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,240
All right.

36
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,520
So I'm going to come in this hour because you know you might want to use it.

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,600
So if you're following me commented out.

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,780
All right.

39
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,890
And let's create another query here to join some tables.

40
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,400
All right.

41
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,980
So the way we refer to a table in its column name when we are joining table is by first writing the

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,820
name of the table separated by a dot and then the name of the column like this.

43
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:49,710
So the Post tables post ID column and then we separated with a comma like this.

44
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,500
So we separate this with a dot.

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,470
All right.

46
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,130
So we separate the table name and the column name with a dot.

47
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,940
Now we want to get the next value right.

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,040
The next value is Port Arthur.

49
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,360
So like this.

50
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:03,870
There we go.

51
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,020
And we keep separating each value in table name.

52
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,480
Right.

53
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,800
Each column name and table and in this case we want to keep pulling information from the post table

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,160
so we keep using that postop right notation right here.

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,650
We keep using this.

56
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:28,560
Now if we wanted to pull our information from another table we'd say category's dot cat I.D. or cat

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,410
title right title.

58
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,180
Now we pull in the title that column from this Categories table.

59
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,830
All right.

60
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,810
So we keep you we can keep pulling information from every table like this and column.

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,030
So now let's I actually copy some stuff down because this is going to get too long.

62
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,670
I don't want you to see me typing it but I'm going to paste this information here and I'm going to close

63
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,910
this and see that I have the coalman here OK.

64
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,470
I'm going to go to the next line concatenate is going to make this a little bigger so the way you can

65
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,650
see what I'm doing.

66
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,500
All right.

67
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:16,230
So we're going to see this concatenated string again and I have another I have another set of

68
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,260
table names and column names here.

69
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,080
All right you see that I have the comma here and a little space.

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,290
And now I don't have it right here so we keep putting values in here right.

71
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,340
Keep putting that.

72
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,880
And this is Paul's views is the last one for the business for the pool table.

73
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,470
Then we get to go and we're going to put information now from the Categories table.

74
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,650
Then I get the cat ID if we need to.

75
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,810
All right then coma and then we're going to get something else from the Categories table.

76
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:58,260
We're going to get to that title you know right now once we have all this information we have to tell

77
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,030
my as well where we want this information to be coming from in this case.

78
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,940
We want this information to come from the polls right.

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,880
That's what.

80
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,690
That's a table that's the main table that we're working with.

81
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,270
All right.

82
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,880
So we're going to we won this from pools.

83
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,310
There we go.

84
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,140
All right.

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,620
That's where we went from now.

86
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm going to concatenate this because I still have some more writing to do.

87
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:36,420
So in this Querrey and make sure that this is together here we are just going to put this down a little

88
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,760
bit so that you can see what I'm doing.

89
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm going to close this again.

90
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:45,390
So once we select this from polls and you can you know what you can separate this and just put it in

91
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,330
that line right here so that way doesn't confuse you.

92
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,990
It does and then it gets a separate line that way you know where you are.

93
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,360
So we we won this from polls.

94
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,260
So and then we brought a condition here actually from polls.

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,760
We want to say something like.

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,140
Left join.

97
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,870
Right we want left join this.

98
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,350
And we want to let join which table do we want to join.

99
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,830
We want to join in with the Categories table and we have joined WE HAVE LEFT JOIN AND WE GOT RIGHT JOIN.

100
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,590
All right you can look it up online and really look at the definition.

101
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,250
But basically what he says.

102
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,800
All right we left joining this table because we are left joining in.

103
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,910
We left joining the Categories table because our main table is opposed table right.

104
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,330
This is the table that has more and more information so we want to put everything on the left.

105
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:40,910
All right.

106
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:49,970
So we want to grab our categories table and put it you know on the left of this table right here.

107
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,770
All right.

108
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,680
One for the Categories table on the on the left anyway.

109
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,900
So let's join categories on.

110
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,510
All right and this is super important.

111
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,240
All right.

112
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:11,160
On polls dot what this feel right here the post category or ID is the same field and I mean just where

113
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:21,240
I put this this post category field right here is the same as our cat ID right here.

114
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,340
Right.

115
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:29,960
So you need to make sure that these two fields are the same.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,750
All right.

117
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,230
Let me repeat that again.

118
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,650
These two fields need to be the same.

119
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,570
So these 48 51.

120
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:43,340
If you go to the polls right now you can see that the polls category right here is 48 and 51 right here.

121
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:43,870
All right.

122
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:51,930
So you need to have a common like basically a foreign key basically a common feel the common column

123
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,140
in both tables right this table right here is the same as this table right here.

124
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,940
All right.

125
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:07,410
So so Polsce let me just take that from here.

126
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,180
All right.

127
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:17,140
And then is equal to what the categories dot caught ID.

128
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,330
That's right.

129
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,730
So I want you to you know get this information now I'm going to divide these lectures into maybe one

130
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,590
more lecture so that where you can copy these down and you can digest it.

131
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,640
All right.

132
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,810
Again let me just repeat it and go over here a little bit.

133
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,340
For those of you that don't understand it for those of you that understood it go to the next lecture.

134
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:46,050
So we're going to select all these fields from this table pools and we also have the categories table

135
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,120
right here.

136
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,530
All right we're going to select those fields and then we're going to say the work is going to come from

137
00:08:52,530 --> 00:09:01,560
polls because this is our main table and we get a left join in with the Categories table on where basically

138
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:09,640
is this on this like a where they mean in a way because it's saying on polls category ID or cat I.D..

139
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,750
Right.

140
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:18,430
So these two fields here have the same number the same category ID both for them.

141
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,280
Have the category at the right here.

142
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,520
And these polls kind of category I.D. We have the same number.

143
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,770
So this is where they are both the same.

144
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,130
They are related now.

145
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,500
So just because they are related we can point formation now and this is going to be basically like a

146
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,250
virtual table where we're going to have we're going to be this The state is going to be available to

147
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,430
us.

148
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:44,310
We're going to have all these data that we're pulling right here is going to be available all the column

149
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,550
names that you see here going all the column names that you see right here.

150
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:47,820
All right.

151
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,710
On the next election we're going to finish this off.

152
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,230
Thank you so much and I see you in the next lecture
