00:00:01.230  -->  00:00:05.680
Welcome back my students a staff for us to make this 100 percent.

2

00:00:05.680  -->  00:00:12.780
We're not 100 percent because you know to be honest there is a lot of ways that we can prove our registration

3

00:00:12.780  -->  00:00:13.580
form.

4

00:00:13.710  -->  00:00:22.100
We can put notifications were colors we can't color all this put it in read by including a class and

5

00:00:22.100  -->  00:00:25.690
that's very easy to create with bootstrap.

6

00:00:26.100  -->  00:00:31.390
We can you know we can do a lot of things to our form release endless possibilities out there but we

7

00:00:31.390  -->  00:00:36.050
are almost finished with we're what I wanted to show you the I think for some of you you learn a lot

8

00:00:36.060  -->  00:00:39.270
and there's a section here so let's finish it up.

9

00:00:39.270  -->  00:00:39.690
All right.

10

00:00:39.750  -->  00:00:43.610
So we are ready should the user but we are not redirecting them.

11

00:00:43.620  -->  00:00:49.620
We're not loading them in and redirecting them to admin right now yet.

12

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:58.230
So let's go to our registration that BHB And right below here we are going to log in the user and we

13

00:00:58.230  -->  00:01:05.420
can make this function even more flexible if we use our creative imagination.

14

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:10.770
All right but I'm going to leave that to you because what I'm what this course is all about is about

15

00:01:10.770  -->  00:01:14.360
you guys using thinking outside the box.

16

00:01:14.370  -->  00:01:16.040
You know how can you make this better.

17

00:01:16.050  -->  00:01:22.170
How can you refactor this in such a way that it makes that is different.

18

00:01:22.230  -->  00:01:23.940
Angevin and works a lot better.

19

00:01:23.940  -->  00:01:24.420
Right.

20

00:01:24.600  -->  00:01:26.520
So we get a log in the user here.

21

00:01:26.640  -->  00:01:28.500
Let's go to functions real quick.

22

00:01:28.500  -->  00:01:38.300
Make sure that in logging user here you are getting the password I think I had e-mail before.

23

00:01:38.440  -->  00:01:42.240
Supposed to be password so make sure that it is password right.

24

00:01:43.470  -->  00:01:45.280
All right so that's password there.

25

00:01:45.300  -->  00:01:47.890
And here we're good.

26

00:01:48.150  -->  00:01:49.470
Let's go back here.

27

00:01:49.680  -->  00:01:55.590
And I think another change that I want to do here is shouldn't be using this head or function we already

28

00:01:55.590  -->  00:02:01.520
have a little custom function that we created for that and this one is the redirect.

29

00:02:01.860  -->  00:02:06.720
Well we want to just want to go to the root as well we put it forward slash there and then we want to

30

00:02:06.720  -->  00:02:07.640
go to admin.

31

00:02:07.640  -->  00:02:08.090
All right.

32

00:02:08.130  -->  00:02:15.150
This is going to help us go to where we need to go all the time without you know

33

00:02:17.940  -->  00:02:18.990
missing the target.

34

00:02:19.350  -->  00:02:22.350
And this one is just going to go to that stuff.

35

00:02:23.110  -->  00:02:23.850
And that's it.

36

00:02:23.880  -->  00:02:26.510
I think what should be done with this here.

37

00:02:26.520  -->  00:02:31.650
Like I said there's a lot of more improvements just to give you an idea in register use or you could

38

00:02:32.010  -->  00:02:40.530
if you want to create an if statement here and say listen if the my SU ally affect the rose equals one

39

00:02:40.620  -->  00:02:43.090
that means something was inserted into the database.

40

00:02:43.110  -->  00:02:50.370
I want you to log in the user you know and you know just call the function from here for register user

41

00:02:50.850  -->  00:02:56.420
and do the redirect right here if you want to if you don't want to put the function right here.

42

00:02:56.410  -->  00:02:57.960
All right is up to you.

43

00:02:58.120  -->  00:03:02.050
Leaving you room here so you can make this better.

44

00:03:02.100  -->  00:03:02.730
All right.

45

00:03:02.910  -->  00:03:04.390
So I'm going to refresh this.

46

00:03:04.410  -->  00:03:08.490
And when I come up with some really cool names for our users.

47

00:03:08.490  -->  00:03:09.080
All right.

48

00:03:09.240  -->  00:03:13.030
So how bow to Allah.

49

00:03:13.260  -->  00:03:15.670
Is that a good name guys.

50

00:03:15.940  -->  00:03:18.410
If I can spell that right Lou piola.

51

00:03:18.420  -->  00:03:18.810
All right.

52

00:03:18.900  -->  00:03:24.920
So if you are name Lupi law send me an e-mail because I have never heard of anybody named Lupica.

53

00:03:24.930  -->  00:03:25.460
All right.

54

00:03:25.530  -->  00:03:27.300
Just send me an email please.

55

00:03:27.300  -->  00:03:28.470
I want to get to know you.

56

00:03:28.590  -->  00:03:29.230
All right.

57

00:03:29.340  -->  00:03:31.410
So we try to submit this.

58

00:03:31.470  -->  00:03:32.720
There is nothing going on.

59

00:03:32.730  -->  00:03:34.920
Of course I mean everything is empty here.

60

00:03:34.930  -->  00:03:36.630
Let's just give.

61

00:03:37.260  -->  00:03:41.270
And she does not work for courting Fox with the guys.

62

00:03:41.270  -->  00:03:42.710
All right let's this.

63

00:03:43.030  -->  00:03:53.090
Let's say she was born in 2000 actually 1978 her son died.

64

00:03:53.100  -->  00:04:08.160
They actually azing hundreds because you know anyway Lissa's uster loopy Lupica in there we go Lupi

65

00:04:08.160  -->  00:04:18.060
lies raised her great let's look out and let's see if we can look we even have autocomplete right here

66

00:04:18.120  -->  00:04:19.420
which is cool.

67

00:04:20.070  -->  00:04:25.140
And let's see if we can log in.

68

00:04:25.380  -->  00:04:31.680
We are now logging her in.

69

00:04:31.680  -->  00:04:33.450
All right there we go.

70

00:04:33.480  -->  00:04:35.130
She's able to log and you see that.

71

00:04:35.130  -->  00:04:39.170
So if she doesn't know again is being redirected back here.

72

00:04:39.180  -->  00:04:41.020
Same thing with registration.

73

00:04:41.070  -->  00:04:42.650
If we are able to.

74

00:04:42.720  -->  00:04:47.100
Of course we're going to be able to register once they go through our validation.

75

00:04:47.220  -->  00:04:51.360
They're going to be able to register and we're going to be able to log in without any problems.

76

00:04:51.570  -->  00:04:53.490
But anyway that's it for this section here.

77

00:04:53.490  -->  00:04:54.990
Hopefully you like it.

78

00:04:54.990  -->  00:04:58.190

79
