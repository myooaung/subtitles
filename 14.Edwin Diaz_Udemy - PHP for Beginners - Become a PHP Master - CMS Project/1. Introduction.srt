Hi my dear students.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,430
I told you I care.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,870
So I'm gonna give you some tips that are going to help you finish this course successfully.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,780
The first one is make goals for yourself.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:26,010
If you don't make goals there is no way that you are going to know where you really are going and if

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,440
you don't know where you're going how you are going to get there.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,500
So make goals for yourself for example today you want to make a goal.

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,130
Let's say you want to do one video today or maybe you want to do one video daily.

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,160
That's 30 videos a month.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,460
Within a couple months you finish a course.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,700
If you want to finish it faster you'll do two or three videos daily.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,820
Maybe you do 10 videos daily depending on what type of time you have.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,580
But make sure you write it down.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,010
If you don't write it down all right.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,770
You might forget and you might not really do anything on the day.

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,810
Another thing that I want to also tell you is that make sure that you do something daily even if it's

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,700
one minute of one video.

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,870
We'll make sure that you do something daily.

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,740
I want you to do one thing.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,350
Think about it we sort of this course.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,220
Think about what you can achieve once you learn GHB and once you are able to build a CMA system.

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,020
Are you going to be able to make more money in your jar.

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,330
Maybe find a new job and have a new car maybe get Mary maybe buy your wife or your girlfriend your boyfriend

24
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,870
a really nice gift.

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,780
Maybe your mom your family.

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,100
Think about it we sort.

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,500
Think about the positive things you're going to be able to get with this course that's going to keep

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,840
you motivated.

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,940
Another thing that I want to tell you is that believe in yourself nobody else is going to believe in

30
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,570
you.

31
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:58,530
If you don't believe in yourself make sure that you really believe in yourself that you can do it or

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,620
you have to do is make goals for yourself.

33
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,060
Stick with him.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,400
Think about the resorts all the time.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,900
Another one last thing that I want to tell you.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,760
All right.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,500
Make every minute count of your life all right.

38
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,540
Your day is not going to come back to you again.

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,520
If your days gone why do you do with that day.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:20,980
All right.

41
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:27,820
Think about that you our time here on this earth is very short but it is very short because we don't

42
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,560
actually take advantage of it.

43
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,710
We waste a lot of it doing nothing.

44
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,720
We give up too easily.

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,380
We need to stick with whatever we want in life and we need to keep going until we achieve it.

46
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,330
I'm pretty sure if you follow these rules right here you're gonna be able to finish his courses as fully

47
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,290
and he's going to change your life because he has changed my life and I want to transmit my changes

48
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:00,280
to you my knowledge to you so that way you can also be successful not only in this course but in life

49
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,290
in general.

50
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:08,320
Make every minute count do something today stick with it and know you are busy because we are or are

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,750
busy right.

52
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,430
But make sure that you are busy in the right things in the things that are going to get you to where

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,640
you really want to go.

54
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,740
I really look forward to seeing you at the end of this course saying you know what instructor.

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,810
Thank you.

56
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,260

57
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,080
