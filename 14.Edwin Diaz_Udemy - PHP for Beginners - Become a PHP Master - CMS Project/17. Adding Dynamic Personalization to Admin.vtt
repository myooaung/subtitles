00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Your students will come back in this lecture.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.290
Here we're going to be adding a dynamic name user name to this right hand side right here to this link.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.560
We're going to be basically doing the same thing we did here but here we are going to be doing it right

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.760
now.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.930
So pay very close attention.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.820
This is going to be a great thing to do because you can apply this to any of your pages.

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.250
Right.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880
So let's go ahead and personalizes a little more.

9
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.000
So I'm going to go ahead and open our brackets.

10
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.180
We need to go to where that link is.

11
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.700
All right.

12
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.800
This name we need to replace it with some BHB right.

13
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.240
So let's go and do that.

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.670
So go to admin and then here we get to see where we place that.

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.710
Let's go to includes And let me just make this a little bigger there so you can see it.

16
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.560
Admen navigation that's where that is.

17
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.540
So I'm going to double click it because I want to open up here in the working files.

18
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.190
And let's also go.

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.150
Let me just minimize this or close it.

20
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.460
I'm going to go to includes in the root directory and Logan double click on that.

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.900
The reason is because I want to show you something here.

22
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.070
This is why we are going here.

23
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.740
As you can see we set some sessions before and we are going to use it now so we're going to be using

24
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.360
that user name session.

25
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.940
All right.

26
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.280
So that's what I want you to see.

27
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.610
Let's go to navigations right now in here.

28
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.930
Mine's on my online dating I don't know where yours is but you can see that we have Joe Smith right

29
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.400
here.

30
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.570
All right.

31
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.640
So this is the link right here.

32
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.160
This is the last item right.

33
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:48.360
And this last item has some custom attributes right here from Bootstrap data tol'able.

34
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.420
This is in charge of actually activating javascript so that way when we click here I me show you when

35
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.190
we click here it comes down and you can see this is javascript doing that.

36
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.630
But of course we are using bootstrap with this which is a framework.

37
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.170
And that's why bootstrap is using this custom attribute to activate javascript.

38
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.420
But anyway that has nothing to do with why we are doing.

39
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.740
So let's go ahead and replace this with BHB.

40
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.540
I'm separating the words there so that way we have a clear working area.

41
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.990
And basically what I want to do is first we add B tags.

42
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.250
All right.

43
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.250
Let's do that.

44
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:47.230
I'm just going to do it here because every time I woman was Omar I have a problem with my tax appearing

45
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.310
right here anyways.

46
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.590
So we want to check to see if they use it in that session is available if it's not available.

47
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.350
It will cause an error in our page if we don't check it.

48
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.470
So we are going to be doing that a set functions so make sure that you do it if you want to do it right

49
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.860
now.

50
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.970
You can do it.

51
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.540
Let me just make this a little bigger so you can see it better.

52
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.520
So it's set.

53
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.680
What do we want to check this session right.

54
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.330
Hopefully you got that right.

55
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.510
Session.

56
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.220
And then inside the session we want to check for what user name.

57
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.130
That's correct.

58
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.840
If you got it right.

59
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.430
Good job.

60
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.710
All right.

61
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.900
So now if we said well we want to do is echoey.

62
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.780
Right.

63
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.120
So we're going to echo that session.

64
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.100
So we're just going to grab the session actually and we can just echo it right here.

65
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.110
Do we even have to assign it to a variable.

66
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.310
We can if we wanted to but I'm just going to I quite like this.

67
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.560
So let's go ahead and do that.

68
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.460
Let's check it out and see if it works.

69
00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.270
I'm going to delete this Smith and let's go back to it and let's check it out.

70
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.580
I'm going to pull my cursor here click enter and as we can see here is replaced by the recall.

71
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.340
All right.

72
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.520
User name perfit.

73
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.970
So now this is going to be all across our site.

74
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.470
All right.

75
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.320
Perfect.

76
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.280
Looking good.

77
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.690
All right.

78
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.380
Perfect.

79
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.160
So in the next video we're going to be adding some more functionality right.

80
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.490
This was short and sweet.

81
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.200

82
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.940

Good job.

84
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.140
This will pay off at the end I promise.

85
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.510
And you know just keep learning and learning keep it up know that you are learning something super special

86
