00:00:00.810  -->  00:00:02.250
Hi welcome back.

2

00:00:02.250  -->  00:00:03.530
There is one thing.

3

00:00:03.570  -->  00:00:11.820
Well one of the things that I want to add to the post side of things here in this Post's Page we're

4

00:00:11.820  -->  00:00:18.270
going to click on it and if you notice that on the post start as we always have to be typing in draft

5

00:00:18.270  -->  00:00:22.920
and pull and and publish if we want something to change rights and status to change.

6

00:00:23.010  -->  00:00:27.870
Well I don't want to be doing that what I really want is a drop down just like this year that will give

7

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:31.470
me options to do a Publish or do we do a draft.

8

00:00:31.470  -->  00:00:32.150
All right.

9

00:00:32.460  -->  00:00:35.050
And also show me the status of it.

10

00:00:35.370  -->  00:00:37.050
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

11

00:00:37.050  -->  00:00:42.270
By the way if you're here you you're doing awesome you know gastro feature that means you already went

12

00:00:42.270  -->  00:00:43.230
through the course.

13

00:00:43.230  -->  00:00:44.130
Hopefully you did.

14

00:00:44.130  -->  00:00:46.550
If not you need to go back and learn.

15

00:00:46.770  -->  00:00:47.820
Most of the things I write.

16

00:00:47.820  -->  00:00:51.240
But anyways let's go in and start doing this real quick.

17

00:00:51.240  -->  00:00:57.390
So what we want to do is we want to go to admin for slashing includes signing colludes we're going to

18

00:00:57.390  -->  00:01:00.070
go to the edit on the score pools that Ph be.

19

00:01:00.150  -->  00:01:01.050
All right.

20

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:06.110
So I got to go to this line right here that says poor status in the form.

21

00:01:06.210  -->  00:01:12.840
So go to the forum all the way down and look for that pool status right here.

22

00:01:12.960  -->  00:01:18.650
I'm going to come in that out and I'm going to put it down a little bit and get a copy.

23

00:01:18.660  -->  00:01:20.310
Actually we don't even need to copy this.

24

00:01:20.310  -->  00:01:25.960
We already have a query up here that brings down a lot of elements from the polls.

25

00:01:26.190  -->  00:01:31.320
So I'm going to use that for my advantage.

26

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:35.280
All right so I'm going to do right now is create a select right here actually

27

00:01:38.010  -->  00:01:43.170
select and and bring it down a little bit and I'm going to create option

28

00:01:45.820  -->  00:01:49.460
and I'm going to put just single quotes here because I need that later.

29

00:01:49.740  -->  00:01:51.770
I'm going to create another one.

30

00:01:52.510  -->  00:01:55.400
I said my father's go one by one.

31

00:01:55.410  -->  00:01:55.710
Right.

32

00:01:55.710  -->  00:01:58.370
So let's go one line at a time.

33

00:01:58.400  -->  00:01:59.660
I don't want to confuse you.

34

00:01:59.700  -->  00:02:05.120
So the first thing that I want to do and why is it that I'm going to display the full status.

35

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:10.860
So I'm going to open APHC Tigray here and I'm going to Eckel the pool status because we already have

36

00:02:10.860  -->  00:02:17.870
that information that is variable available right like we were doing right here.

37

00:02:18.030  -->  00:02:22.380
So I'm going to echo that with semi-colon there of course.

38

00:02:22.380  -->  00:02:23.330
I'm going to take this off.

39

00:02:23.340  -->  00:02:29.520
You know the only thing that I need from here is this name poor status so let's make sure that we have

40

00:02:29.520  -->  00:02:33.040
that name right here on the Select right.

41

00:02:33.060  -->  00:02:37.890
Everything else is just going to take off.

42

00:02:37.920  -->  00:02:38.180
All right.

43

00:02:38.190  -->  00:02:38.640
Perfect.

44

00:02:38.640  -->  00:02:44.160
So we have that select Let's see if we can see that value right here.

45

00:02:44.160  -->  00:02:53.910
Just refresh and of course we don't see it because US and do an echo on the value of option and that's

46

00:02:53.910  -->  00:02:55.210
not where I should be doing that.

47

00:02:55.220  -->  00:03:00.180
So it should be right here.

48

00:03:00.180  -->  00:03:01.680
All right there we go.

49

00:03:01.730  -->  00:03:08.880
As you can see there we have the little option there but we don't have the other options.

50

00:03:08.880  -->  00:03:11.730
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

51

00:03:11.730  -->  00:03:17.020
So now another thing that I want to do is to select is that I want to add a day for a year with a class

52

00:03:17.020  -->  00:03:21.680
A form group so let's add that around it so that way we can have some space as you see right here.

53

00:03:21.800  -->  00:03:23.400
He has no space.

54

00:03:23.400  -->  00:03:25.140
So that's an inconvenience right there.

55

00:03:25.140  -->  00:03:26.200
See that.

56

00:03:26.850  -->  00:03:34.800
So let's just make sure that we have a diff class of form group around it and that's refresh.

57

00:03:34.800  -->  00:03:37.670
Now as you can see now I have a space.

58

00:03:37.830  -->  00:03:38.550
All right.

59

00:03:38.550  -->  00:03:41.260
Perfect.

60

00:03:41.260  -->  00:03:41.560
All right.

61

00:03:41.580  -->  00:03:43.450
So what is the next thing I got to do.

62

00:03:43.620  -->  00:03:51.060
Well what I want to do is if I want to create here a condition because I want to say that the way we're

63

00:03:51.060  -->  00:03:59.340
going to do this is if the post is published I want to display a draft option to put the post on draft

64

00:03:59.630  -->  00:04:04.390
but if it's already on draft I want to offer the user a public option.

65

00:04:04.410  -->  00:04:10.020
So we need to create a statement a condition.

66

00:04:10.020  -->  00:04:11.950
All right so let's do this with an if statement.

67

00:04:12.200  -->  00:04:19.260
And let's say if the post is right because that's what we're checking it's equal to what.

68

00:04:19.560  -->  00:04:25.030
Well actually let's go ahead and put this in a b right here.

69

00:04:25.190  -->  00:04:28.420
Don't we were impeached already but we just did a.

70

00:04:28.470  -->  00:04:30.740
We closed the peach B-type right here so.

71

00:04:30.930  -->  00:04:31.530
All right.

72

00:04:31.860  -->  00:04:43.050
So if this is equal to publish here it is then I want to play something right now and what is it that

73

00:04:43.050  -->  00:04:44.070
I want to display.

74

00:04:44.400  -->  00:04:46.050
Well I want to play

75

00:04:49.050  -->  00:04:55.530
this whole thing right here or now every day and you're going to grab it from here actually here it's

76

00:04:55.560  -->  00:04:58.230
kind of grabbed one from the category.

77

00:04:58.230  -->  00:05:04.560
I'm going to put it right here because it's very similar to what I want what I want to do right here

78

00:05:04.560  -->  00:05:10.860
is I want to play the poll status right here.

79

00:05:10.860  -->  00:05:14.620
I actually one of these play year a static option.

80

00:05:14.880  -->  00:05:21.300
So this one's just going to say draft.

81

00:05:22.560  -->  00:05:24.920
That's where we are going to be sending.

82

00:05:25.170  -->  00:05:27.840
And the value is going to be draft also.

83

00:05:28.230  -->  00:05:31.850
But we're going to say that with lowercase D.

84

00:05:31.880  -->  00:05:32.950
All right.

85

00:05:33.060  -->  00:05:35.480
And this one is going to be uppercase D.

86

00:05:35.970  -->  00:05:39.590
So draft and else.

87

00:05:39.600  -->  00:05:44.750
So if it's not published if it's something else and that something else would be probably dropped.

88

00:05:44.760  -->  00:05:45.480
Right.

89

00:05:45.830  -->  00:05:48.640
We were going this play the opposite of this.

90

00:05:48.750  -->  00:05:51.910
So let's see if this works out.

91

00:05:53.610  -->  00:05:54.480
All right.

92

00:05:54.480  -->  00:05:58.020
So this one is going to be published

93

00:06:01.380  -->  00:06:06.160
and this option is just going to say capital the publish.

94

00:06:07.290  -->  00:06:08.160
All right.

95

00:06:08.520  -->  00:06:10.050
So I think we're done here.

96

00:06:10.050  -->  00:06:13.410
I mean we don't have to do anything else there.

97

00:06:13.740  -->  00:06:17.340
We're pretty good in pretty good shape.

98

00:06:17.370  -->  00:06:17.910
All right.

99

00:06:17.940  -->  00:06:26.250
So now let's set a value here the full value for this here and that the full value would be probably

100

00:06:26.870  -->  00:06:34.660
if only for some reason we don't choose any of these the default value would be maybe the current pool

101

00:06:34.660  -->  00:06:37.090
status right now.

102

00:06:37.110  -->  00:06:40.020
Right right there.

103

00:06:40.020  -->  00:06:48.570
So that would be that the full value but let's make it in speech actually has opened up the HP tag and

104

00:06:48.570  -->  00:06:53.580
let's just make sure we have the full value for that right.

105

00:06:57.050  -->  00:06:59.670
Oops.

106

00:06:59.760  -->  00:07:00.150
All right.

107

00:07:00.150  -->  00:07:01.000
That looks good.

108

00:07:00.990  -->  00:07:04.700
I think we're golden here so let's check it out.

109

00:07:04.710  -->  00:07:05.210
All right.

110

00:07:05.430  -->  00:07:10.750
Refresh me is a little smaller and if I see here is a draft.

111

00:07:10.770  -->  00:07:17.060
And I can click on publish any file of data right there is published right now.

112

00:07:17.130  -->  00:07:18.410
So that's published.

113

00:07:18.420  -->  00:07:19.940
Let's publish another one.

114

00:07:20.250  -->  00:07:25.860
So on draft publish published you will post.

115

00:07:26.160  -->  00:07:27.050
Perfect.

116

00:07:27.060  -->  00:07:29.370
So this functionality looks really good.

117

00:07:29.430  -->  00:07:30.450
I like it.

118

00:07:30.480  -->  00:07:33.210
It's actually a lot easier to deal with.

119

00:07:33.240  -->  00:07:36.250
And instead of typing draft and polish right.

120

00:07:36.270  -->  00:07:37.710
So anyway good job.

121

00:07:37.710  -->  00:07:40.710
If you were to do this with me and I think is great.

122

00:07:40.710  -->  00:07:42.080
What do you think anyway.

123

00:07:42.090  -->  00:07:44.970
Keep having a great day and I'll see you in the next lecture.

124

00:07:44.970  -->  00:07:46.200
Take care.

125

00:07:46.200  -->  00:07:46.520
Bye bye
