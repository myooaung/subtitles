1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,920
All right so in this video here we're going to be learning about switch statements and switch statements

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,000
are very similar to her statements but we're a couple of differences.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,760
I want to show you how they work right now.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,640
So let's go ahead and we'll bring our co-editor right.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,350
And for those of you out there that might be a little lost we are in the local host.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,750
So I would say right here local host for Slash Demel.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,840
All right that's the father that we're working on we are working with his files.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,750
Right.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,000
This was opening my co-editor right now as you can see right here.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,650
All right.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,650
So I'm going to go rather blank Doppie HP and do a Save As with my key word and you can do a save us

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:52,110
right here if you want and I'm going to call this switch statement let's call it switch statements state

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,610
ments.

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,030
There we go.

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,330
All righty then.

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,690
Just like what was this guy named Jim Carrey.

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,140
All righty then.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,880
Right.

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,310
And if I can remember how to write this really what's going on with me today.

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,810
Hopefully you're better than me writing the BHB tax already anyways.

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,880
So what how do we use the estate switch statements and why are they so useful.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,480
So which statements are very useful.

23
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,090
Let me show you why if let's say for example you have an if statement here.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,850
Right.

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,170
And you want to test the conditions you say for less than 10 whatever right.

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,750
So you have a four here.

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:53,110
Let me just do it as a variable here and I have I want to test that number is less than 10 right.

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,460
And then I'm going to ask you something here and then I say Eckel this for example we already did.

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,300
I'm just giving you a quick example.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,950
If I wanted to test number again I wanted to test this variable again against another condition I would

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:16,950
have to write another if statement here and another if statement here if I want to test number against

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,410
other numbers here for example 20 or you know 40 Konstanz in our program when we want to change we want

33
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,340
to test 1 condition against multiple values.

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,250
Right.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,370
And that's where we switch statements with saver's are a lot of time I'll show you right now the center

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,020
of it.

37
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:45,380
So let's say I have the same variable number and I have it right here and that's create a switch statements.

38
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,040
So 60 Minutes would Right them like this switch keyword switch parentheses and the curly brackets.

39
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,730
There we go.

40
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,110
Now we switch statements.

41
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,280
We don't use anything related to ifs.

42
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,290
We use something called case.

43
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,320
So we write our case and the case could be anything we want.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,490
In this case it's going to be a number 34 and then we put not a semi-colon board calling this two dots

45
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,540
right here.

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,070
And then we we put the code that we want to execute in the bottom

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:28,120
array for example and then all we have to do is keep writing these cases

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,270
if we want to test it against another condition.

49
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,990
You see that so we can say thirty seven.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,130
Here we can start again this if you don't understand the worry I will explain it again right now.

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,530
OK.

52
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,800
So we have these cases here but we need to grab we need to put something right here because we need

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,210
to test these values.

54
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,850
These values against something right.

55
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,010
So we put the number right there and we test one single value.

56
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,830
This is that if statement right.

57
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,560
It says one single condition one single condition I'm sorry against multiple values so right now this

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,550
number has been tested against this case.

59
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:13,920
All right.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,510
Is it equal to 34.

61
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:22,750
No it's not going to go to the next case if it's equal to 37 then it's going to echo this.

62
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,660
But if it's not going to go to the Netscape.

63
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,550
Netscape in that case.

64
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:34,670
All right so I'm just going to say that is equal to 30 for just for demonstration purposes only.

65
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,290
And let's go ahead to the browser and see how that looks.

66
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:39,900
All right.

67
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,820
Oh so we have a problem here.

68
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,970
It printed everything.

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,180
I wonder why that is.

70
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,070
Why did it print to everything when we already found our.

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,320
Our answer right here 34 right.

72
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,640
We don't have anything similar whether to print that everything out.

73
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:02,170
Well this is a very important topic right here very important thing for cases here.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:09,800
All right to make sure that this works properly we need to add another statement here called break.

75
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,230
All right.

76
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,330
So it would come here.

77
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,320
You say it is for right.

78
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,030
Well is it a misspelling a here and I need to fix it.

79
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,410
It is 4:34.

80
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,660
All right but whatever and just not going to even fix that but as you can see here if they want this

81
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,170
to work properly you need to have this break here why this break he's doing is saying all right.

82
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,840
He found what he needed and then is going to break out of this and that say he's done with it not he

83
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,500
doesn't need to look anywhere else.

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,030
But if you don't put that break he keeps printing everything underneath because he's saying I I still

85
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,500
haven't found what I want and you're going to keep going.

86
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,670
This break here is going to make you break out of that when he finds the answer to that.

87
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,390
All right.

88
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,000
So make sure that you put your break right there.

89
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:06,120
Everywhere in the bottom of this case right below the executable code.

90
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,430
Right so for example let's say

91
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,790
I'm going to put this equal to 24.

92
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,470
What happened.

93
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,200
All right.

94
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,480
Come back here it is 24.

95
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,660
So it goes all the way.

96
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:25,810
It starts with the first case here if it doesn't finally go to the next one and so on and so on to find

97
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,230
this one and says break I don't need to go around anymore I don't need to go anywhere else.

98
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,730
This doesn't go around by the way.

99
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,670
It's not a loop but it will go to the end and that's it.

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:44,160
Now for this here we can also price a default just in case all these cases are not true enough just

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,250
in case this is not found here anywhere.

102
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:47,730
All right.

103
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,470
We can race on default and this default could be anything we want.

104
00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:01,260
We can just say we couldn't we couldn't we could not find anything.

105
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,200
Right.

106
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:08,390
And they only really need to write this but I will just to keep the structure of this.

107
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,450
All right.

108
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,840
And let's just make this equal to something else so no way we can have this.

109
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,830
We can not find anything you see that.

110
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:24,030
So this is that before this is like similar to the statement if everything here is not met we can't

111
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,880
find these 100 anyway here in these cases.

112
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,460
Then we are going to execute that default.

113
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,530
All right so this switch statements.

114
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,720
I want you to take this out of this lecture here.

115
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,240
60 statements are gray when you're testing one condition against multiple different values.

116
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:49,020
All right just in case you testing maybe a form or you're testing a made entry to a database or something

117
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,220
like that and you're just testing one condition.

118
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:59,400
If this user has not done this if this user has done this if the user does this that you know why were

119
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:05,280
you testing a user and you're testing multiple conditions against the user in a database or a log in

120
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:10,850
page or something like that you were using you statements a lot better than using one that AIDS Day

121
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,150
mass switch statements.

122
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,150
It's a lot better than using IF statements and it's clear you can see that it's more clear to write.

123
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,640
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

124
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,000
