1

00:00:00,770  -->  00:00:02,650
Or write welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02,670  -->  00:00:07,050
So in this lecture here we're going to continue to build our pagination system.

3

00:00:07,230  -->  00:00:08,010
So what's next.

4

00:00:08,010  -->  00:00:09,280
We already know the count.

5

00:00:09,330  -->  00:00:13,040
All right let's go ahead and call this out for us and find out that it is working.

6

00:00:13,050  -->  00:00:17,540
All right who you wanna keep writing without knowing we are getting our count.

7

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:22,920
So let's ekal our count and find out exactly how many posts we have.

8

00:00:22,920  -->  00:00:28,960
All right so let's go here and now you can see I saved it by the way RAYOS keeps saving it.

9

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:31,640
We see that we have 42 posts available.

10

00:00:31,650  -->  00:00:33,530
All right cool.

11

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:36,630
So how can we actually find out.

12

00:00:36,840  -->  00:00:37,090
All right.

13

00:00:37,170  -->  00:00:41,200
How can we create like a page type of functionality right.

14

00:00:41,400  -->  00:00:44,270
Well if we want to find now.

15

00:00:44,380  -->  00:00:47,050
All right let's say we want 10 items per page.

16

00:00:47,100  -->  00:00:47,340
Right.

17

00:00:47,340  -->  00:00:53,310
All we have to do is actually divide right by the count by 10 right.

18

00:00:53,310  -->  00:00:54,720
So let's say something like this.

19

00:00:54,720  -->  00:00:58,060
Let's say count.

20

00:00:58,350  -->  00:00:58,700
Right.

21

00:00:58,710  -->  00:01:05,060
And we go ahead and say count could be equal to count.

22

00:01:05,070  -->  00:01:06,900
Same thing here.

23

00:01:06,900  -->  00:01:09,560
Divide it by five.

24

00:01:09,630  -->  00:01:11,330
Let's do five.

25

00:01:11,500  -->  00:01:19,500
And now if we save it and come back here we can see that we have eight point four.

26

00:01:19,500  -->  00:01:20,170
All right.

27

00:01:20,580  -->  00:01:25,440
So eight point four times five equals 42.

28

00:01:25,440  -->  00:01:25,740
Right.

29

00:01:25,740  -->  00:01:30,630
So the thing is that the problem here that this is a float number eight point four we need an integer

30

00:01:30,900  -->  00:01:32,130
because we don't have an integer.

31

00:01:32,130  -->  00:01:33,510
We're going to have a problem later on.

32

00:01:33,510  -->  00:01:34,260
Right.

33

00:01:34,710  -->  00:01:39,390
So let's make this an integer.

34

00:01:39,390  -->  00:01:40,150
How do we do that.

35

00:01:40,140  -->  00:01:45,770
Well we could use a function called ceiling or Seele like this.

36

00:01:45,840  -->  00:01:49,800
And I think I show you this in the math section enter.

37

00:01:49,920  -->  00:01:52,200
And now we got nine so he rounds it up.

38

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:53,220
All right.

39

00:01:53,400  -->  00:01:55,760
Beautiful.

40

00:01:55,830  -->  00:01:58,140
So what else is next.

41

00:01:58,140  -->  00:02:01,710
Well after this what we can do is let's go ahead and displace all links.

42

00:02:01,710  -->  00:02:02,510
All right.

43

00:02:03,000  -->  00:02:05,360
Let's go all the way to the bottom here.

44

00:02:05,550  -->  00:02:08,220
We got our sidebar here and we got even our footer.

45

00:02:08,430  -->  00:02:13,490
Right below are 40 or less display a pagination.

46

00:02:13,740  -->  00:02:22,680
So let's go here and you will I'm going to put a little class here of pager which is from Bootstrap

47

00:02:23,060  -->  00:02:30,600
and is going to help us make our links a lot nicer than what I want to do here is I'm going to display

48

00:02:30,660  -->  00:02:37,300
a static one for now just to show you how this looks.

49

00:02:37,320  -->  00:02:39,540
So let's say this is going to be one

50

00:02:43,260  -->  00:02:45,180
and this is going to be two.

51

00:02:45,210  -->  00:02:48,040
Let's see if this actually looks good.

52

00:02:48,150  -->  00:02:48,780
Answer.

53

00:02:48,960  -->  00:02:53,250
I've got to go all the way to the bottom to show you this is crazy.

54

00:02:53,310  -->  00:02:55,830
All right so you see this right here one and two.

55

00:02:55,830  -->  00:02:56,630
So we got this.

56

00:02:56,640  -->  00:03:00,780
We're going to have to we're going to put that produces links dynamically.

57

00:03:00,780  -->  00:03:01,090
All right.

58

00:03:01,090  -->  00:03:03,750
And when we click on two is going to go to the next page.

59

00:03:03,780  -->  00:03:04,460
Right.

60

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:06,220
For that we need to process.

61

00:03:06,240  -->  00:03:09,470
We need a loop actually to repeat stuff for us right.

62

00:03:09,750  -->  00:03:12,560
So let's go ahead and create one right now.

63

00:03:12,560  -->  00:03:13,590
Right.

64

00:03:14,310  -->  00:03:23,650
Let's play some ph BTX right here and between this UL and let's actually use a for loop to do this.

65

00:03:23,810  -->  00:03:24,330
All right.

66

00:03:24,330  -->  00:03:28,040
So we're going to say I it's going to be an initialiser right.

67

00:03:28,380  -->  00:03:30,510
It's going to be equal to 1.

68

00:03:30,700  -->  00:03:36,490
All right we want to start one then I want we want I as long as I.

69

00:03:36,600  -->  00:03:41,600
Is this smaller or equal to what count.

70

00:03:41,600  -->  00:03:47,220
All right then we're going to increment.

71

00:03:48,530  -->  00:03:51,730
And now here we can just call.

72

00:03:52,230  -->  00:03:54,480
Nice link.

73

00:03:54,720  -->  00:04:02,160
Can you say a lie and Cluseret here.

74

00:04:02,980  -->  00:04:09,000
As with age referee you're also going to need NH ref so.

75

00:04:11,170  -->  00:04:12,340
All right.

76

00:04:12,900  -->  00:04:16,920
And let's echo this I right here too because that's going to be the number.

77

00:04:16,920  -->  00:04:20,400
Remember counting is Lupin to count.

78

00:04:20,730  -->  00:04:25,720
So we can see here.

79

00:04:25,800  -->  00:04:29,500
All right let's go ahead and check this out.

80

00:04:30,130  -->  00:04:31,400
Enter in.

81

00:04:31,420  -->  00:04:34,520
I don't I don't like that we're going to have to.

82

00:04:34,890  -->  00:04:38,520
We're going to have to actually limit this so that we can show it to you instead of scrolling all the

83

00:04:38,520  -->  00:04:39,700
way down.

84

00:04:39,720  -->  00:04:41,210
This is annoying right.

85

00:04:41,670  -->  00:04:43,440
This is crawlway here.

86

00:04:43,450  -->  00:04:46,440
There you go see that.

87

00:04:46,440  -->  00:04:47,770
So he's starting to look OK.

88

00:04:47,780  -->  00:04:48,090
Right.

89

00:04:48,090  -->  00:04:49,760
Starting to look better.

90

00:04:49,830  -->  00:04:50,410
Beautiful.

91

00:04:50,460  -->  00:04:52,290
So he's looping through or count.

92

00:04:52,290  -->  00:04:53,070
We've got nine.

93

00:04:53,070  -->  00:04:55,770
Remember that we have nine right here.

94

00:04:55,860  -->  00:04:58,590
We rounded up beautiful.

95

00:04:58,590  -->  00:04:59,210
All right.

96

00:04:59,460  -->  00:05:06,720
So the next step is that we need to send a get requests all right and depending on that get requires

97

00:05:06,720  -->  00:05:07,940
that we're going to send.

98

00:05:08,140  -->  00:05:13,980
It's how many pages how many posts we're going to have through page.

99

00:05:13,980  -->  00:05:15,410
All right so what does it get requests.

100

00:05:15,410  -->  00:05:22,710
We're going to sent what are we going to send a request to it's that BHB and the request is going to

101

00:05:22,710  -->  00:05:28,120
be called Page equals what do you think Page is going to equal to.

102

00:05:28,400  -->  00:05:34,790
If you guess the I you are totally correct to put the i right there.

103

00:05:34,810  -->  00:05:44,760
And now if I go here and of course I'm going to scroll down and I click here you can see that he's actually

104

00:05:44,760  -->  00:05:49,120
sending a request number two because I just clicked on number two right.

105

00:05:49,650  -->  00:05:53,730
And if I do 5 he's going to send a 5.

106

00:05:53,740  -->  00:05:54,320
All right.

107

00:05:54,450  -->  00:06:02,190
So now what we need to do is we need to create a condition to the text that get requests and depending

108

00:06:02,190  -->  00:06:09,020
on Dagget get requests we will change our variable dynamically and limit the amount of posts there are

109

00:06:09,030  -->  00:06:11,190
showing in our home page.

110

00:06:11,290  -->  00:06:13,860
Anyway I'm not going to explain any more.

111

00:06:13,860  -->  00:06:18,770
I'm going to start coding and let you know but I'm going to do that in the next lecture.

112

00:06:18,770  -->  00:06:19,420
All right.

113

00:06:19,480  -->  00:06:21,190
So thank you so much for watching.

114

00:06:21,270  -->  00:06:23,830
Hopefully you are enjoying this and I'll see you in the next one
