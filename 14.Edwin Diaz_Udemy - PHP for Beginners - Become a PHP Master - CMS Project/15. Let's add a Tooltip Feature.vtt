00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.770
OK so I decided to come back and add some more stuff to this section here.

2
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.930
So if you guys remember endangered auctions for this lecture for this second year I showed you when

3
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:21.700
we were over they like buy and when we are logged in that you know it was a tool to like us some type

4
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.180
of message saying that we like this before.

5
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.830
So I want to show you how to do that dynamically.

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:35.900
You know booster has a class and a couple of data attributes that allows us to do that.

7
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.790
OK.

8
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:45.600
I mean if you look it up let's see let's get this out of here we don't need that no more.

9
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.660
Let's go to bootstrap for a quick bootstrap tool.

10
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.040
I think I've done this in a course before maybe another one I don't know when the number three.

11
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.250
OK because that's what we got in the but anyway I'll just look it up.

12
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.810
This is number three.

13
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.010
OK.

14
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.020
So it's a plugin you add some data and you execute it.

15
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.870
Something like that.

16
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.510
OK let's do that.

17
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.460
See if I remember how to do this.

18
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.230
Now we just look at the communication.

19
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:31.750
So in the Allaman where we want this to be implemented we have to create some data attributes or something

20
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.960
like that right here.

21
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.540
Some attributes like that.

22
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.190
Let's just put this down a little bit.

23
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.320
I'm going to even pull down that BHB there.

24
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.570
It's like that everything.

25
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.610
And so here I want to start targeting that button.

26
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.570
OK.

27
00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.830
So the first thing that we need to do is have some type of toggle.

28
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.670
OK.

29
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.520
Data toggle and data toggle this tool.

30
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.030
Title.

31
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.990
OK.

32
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.390
I think I got it down.

33
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.260
So that's the first thing we do.

34
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.820
They're data and you guys can post this video and try to do that yourself.

35
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.600
OK.

36
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.100
So the data toggle

37
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.440
in mine still inside this link.

38
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.230
No I'm not.

39
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.930
Whoops.

40
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.690
This is a Tref.

41
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.100
This is what I need right here.

42
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.830
So data toggle and this is just has to be tool tip.

43
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.810
OK.

44
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.200
Just for your information.

45
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:51.120
And the other is the data placemen we can't.

46
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.530
We have they to please men and I don't think my idea is going to help me with this.

47
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.000
I know we have a data placement because this is where I want we can put this anywhere we wanted the

48
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.180
bottom the left or right whatever another data place meaning is on top.

49
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.670
That's what I did in my order application which I don't have with me crazy.

50
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.920
I should have it and title.

51
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.570
What is the of that we want to display.

52
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.360
So this one could be a matter of fact.

53
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.960
Let's use this guy here.

54
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:35.620
And here instead of like what we can say is I liked this before.

55
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.170
Just like we had in the you know them all.

56
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.730
And what is this like here.

57
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.580
One to like it

58
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.420
ok.

59
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.160
Nice.

60
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.540
So once it's done now we're not done with this functionality now.

61
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.470
The next step is to activate this.

62
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.040
OK.

63
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.780
So we need to go and activated where we have javascript because that's how we do it.

64
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.680
We will strap if everything is working in your app right here and when we are making sure that document

65
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:26.100
is loaded we are going to target this with Jay Querrey and we are going to say at one time get this

66
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.430
attribute called Data toggle.

67
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:40.520
If I'm not mistaking OK but make sure you toggle the data toggle that has the value of.

68
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.770
As a matter of fact we can just do a double say

69
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.790
the value of to tip.

70
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.320
The fact is I don't think this is works like this.

71
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.340
I think it's inside here.

72
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.140
We'll find out in a minute if it works too.

73
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.800
OK.

74
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:12.320
So that said that and there is a function attached to this Nabel shrub allows us to use cold today.

75
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.050
And that said I think I think I'm doing it right.

76
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.080
Let's find out guys.

77
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.770
All right.

78
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.000
I know some of you get upset when I say that all couldn't do it right.

79
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.190
Come on guys pull my mouse over it.

80
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.760
There we go.

81
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.020
Look at that.

82
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.580
You see it.

83
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.400
Want to like this.

84
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.060
Click it.

85
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.640
And now I should say something different like this before some guy.

86
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.640
So that's an extra thing for you guys.

87
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.770
Remember to organize your code a little better than me.

88
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.400
Make your comments.

89
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.400
Tie everything up more so that way your application is looks nicer.

90
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.170
You know your code looks nicer and you don't have all the developers screaming at you because your code

91
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.600
is all messed up or something.

92
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.270
OK.

93
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.150
So you can encloses this if you want

94
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.120
gracious it will work the same ok but

95
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.170
will go you know just double check it to see if it works guys.

96
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.610
OK.

97
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:41.140
Like for example make sure that you open your console and refresh like that's working pretty awesome

98
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.030
when you think OK.

99
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.520
All right we're done with this guys.

100
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.790
So make your career your requests.

101
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.030
If you if you're having any issues in the course entirely please.

102
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.930
When you when they create some type of announcements on the list you can mention aid when help me out.

103
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.680
You know I'm having like big issues in this you know so that way I can you know I've got thousands of

104
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.900
students so it's hard for me to actually know that everyone is making a mistake even if my assistants

105
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.090
tell me sometimes they might skip it too.

106
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.160
So I would like to know if you have any issues but don't Crowl the announcements or anything like that.

107
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.900
You can also send me a private message if it's something personal to you or project or something like

108
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.120
that.

109
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.850
If I have time I can help you all.

110
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.600
Thank you so much and I'll see you on the next lectures.
