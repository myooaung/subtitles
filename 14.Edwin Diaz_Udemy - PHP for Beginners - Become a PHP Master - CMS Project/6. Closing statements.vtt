00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.010
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.720
Now one thing that you know that I get asked all the time do we need to close the database connection.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:17.270
Well in reality in the way we see in the community yes you do have to close the database connection

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.970
but if you don't BHB will close it automatically for you.

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.720
Just like this statement just like that my ask you I'll prepare statement but it's good practice to

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.300
do that because your cold could run better.

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.450
You don't have to you know let me figure it out.

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.180
You what you can actually let BHP know listen I want to close it right here so it kind of works better

9
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.040
with memory.

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.570
So let's actually close this and I'm going to close just to show you one and then you can close the

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.230
rest.

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.920
So once you finish your statement and I'm going to do it right here after this while loop because that's

13
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.450
when I'm done with my statement I can just call this function my SU ally is TMT close.

14
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.860
And now we can close our statement here.

15
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.660
OK.

16
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.630
Simple as that.

17
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.580
And then you can do the same thing for the rest of the functionality.

18
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.430
Make sure you have your semi-colon somewhere.

19
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.740
You can you can do that for the insert.

20
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.140
Let me see if that's one in seven categories.

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.590
So once you finish this statement you can just close it and we're just checking right here.

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.560
Let me just see you can close it anywhere we want to be on as this is a category function.

23
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.600
This is

24
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.000
submit so we can just close it right here and the categories here for

25
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.240
update categories just closer wherever you want.

26
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.820
Okay.

27
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.070
And again it works fine without it.

28
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.330
But you know if you if you can help me figure it out faster you you make your application a little faster.

29
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.860
OK.

30
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.770
So close your statements if you want.

31
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.440
You can also close your database connection with my ask you like close.

32
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.050
OK.

33
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.180
So you can close your Maia's you realize queries as well.

34
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.040
But like I said BHP would figure that out OK.

35
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.320
But anyway thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoy this as a couple of series here and we're

36
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.050
going to I'm going to try to always add more things to the course.

37
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.540
Thank you.

38
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.540
I'll see you on the next lectures
