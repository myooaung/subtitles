00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.880
I will come back on this video here we're finally going a goal in getting to building objects.

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.910
Well not exactly.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.230
Before we build objects you know that we need to define its environment its environment is a class definition

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.690
description a blueprint of the object.

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.240
So we need firstly we need to set the properties and methods of this object that we will be building.

6
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.970
Right.

7
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.440
So let's go ahead and define the class.

8
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.860
That's what I'm trying to say here.

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.420
I don't want to go too deep on it.

10
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.070
And boy you to death.

11
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.810
But let's go ahead and describe.

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.450
Let's define a class.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:49.110
So let's go to the blank that BHB let's do say maths and let's go ahead and say it as a class on the

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.320
score card.

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.300
BHB Boom.

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.630
Let's take that off.

17
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.690
Safe.

18
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.360
Are not going too fast for you.

19
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.360
Let's open that tax right here.

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.240
All right so what is the syntax of a class.

21
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:15.780
All right so the syntax class is the key word that we need a right to get this going and the name of

22
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.940
that class just like functions or we have a key word just to say Apache knowing that we will be creating

23
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.540
a class.

24
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.730
So get ready Apache we will be creating a class and the class name will be car.

25
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.150
Make sure you capitalize that see if you're following me or whatever for the letter of that word that

26
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.970
you are creating that class is always going to be capitalized if nice not going to be consider a class

27
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.130
rule.

28
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.910
Unbelievable right.

29
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.060
Opening curly brackets perfect.

30
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.150
We have done.

31
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.190
We created a class.

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.650
So now this blueprint here has to have many things inside and we're not going to go into details in

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.310
this video here but we will check to see if this class was already defined if it's working right.

34
00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.970
So let's do that.

35
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:09.200
Let's create an if statement and let's use a function pre-build function of PH BE CALLED class exist.

36
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.610
I believe this is the word right there.

37
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.170
And what class are we trying to find out.

38
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.220
That is it.

39
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.770
Which one is it right here right here.

40
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.350
Car.

41
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.300
This put some code in there and write it down.

42
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.390
So what I want to say for that is just do I want to say something boring.

43
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.070
It does exist.

44
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.510
So we want to say something like Yeah a nice nice right.

45
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.320
And then if it doesn't work well when I say something like

46
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.860
something really excited like you know I hope you're laughing right now.

47
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.310
All right.

48
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.840
But anyway we're going to leave it like that.

49
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.340
All right.

50
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.510
So let's go ahead and open in the browser.

51
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.990
All right.

52
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.040
And let's see oh yeah.

53
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.670
The class is working.

54
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.300
Nice.

55
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.660
What about if I go like this.

56
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.790
Change it.

57
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.140
No that does not sound very exciting.

58
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.460
Let's see.

59
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.650
Let's try that again.

60
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.850
Yes.

61
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.650
The classes were iggie.

62
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.130
All right.

63
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.660
Let's try that again.

64
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.150
No man.

65
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.540
Anyway thank you so much for watching this video here.

66
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.400
So we define a class here.

67
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:37.710
Now the next step to do this next step for the find in the class is actually creating some some content

68
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.430
for it right some properties or methods and and make it.

69
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.670
And then at the end the goal is to create an object right.

70
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.530
So anyways Hopefully you were able to get some valuable knowledge out of this and some laughs.

71
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.120
And I see you in the next lecture.

72
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.550
Take care
