00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.200
I will come back on the last video we were able to check if the form was submitted by checking if submit

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.030
was sent from that submit button.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.170
And we picked up this information and we were able to check it out.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.260
So we went like this and clicks of Mitt and we got this data here.

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.410
Now this might not be the case in the real form.

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.920
All right.

7
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.890
So we have to find a better way to actually check on this and then use that data.

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.320
Now we are we are going to be connecting to my school and this video here but I'm also going to show

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.990
you how to check if this data exists here.

10
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.570
Right before we do anything else we don't want to do anything.

11
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.090
All this data is there.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.870
We don't know.

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.870
We just know that the form was submitted but we don't know if they use a name is there.

14
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:59.260
So we know what we want to do is check this and say and user names so we're making sure that these bowlful

15
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.140
these values are included.

16
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.090
By doing that I mean just come in this hour and not going to need that neither need it right now.

17
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.960
And

18
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.190
we saw how to do this in the if statement tutorials right.

19
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.110
Elisha's videos.

20
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.680
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.150
I also wanted to Torrijos.

22
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.220
Well they are kind of tutorials right.

23
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.960
All right.

24
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.230
Let's just comment this here comment that back in.

25
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.050
And as a matter of fact.

26
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.690
Yeah that's fine.

27
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.980
We're just going to take a ball for them.

28
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.330
All right.

29
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.860
So if they use a name right here and the past exist.

30
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.610
All right we can use if said if you want to use that set you can use that for of function.

31
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.320
I think it's better for this for a small demonstration here and it's going to show you we'll show it

32
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.390
to you in a different way.

33
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.410
We'll I already show you how to use it this way.

34
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.180
All right.

35
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.910
So we're already picking up the data here.

36
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.510
So if user name and why what this if statement would do a when you just pass it in something like this.

37
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.080
It would just give you a true or false Boolean value.

38
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.110
So if user name is there is positives true and the password is true then I would call this out.

39
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.710
So I'm just going to say like that and this and that and click submit.

40
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.910
So it is there right.

41
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.050
Else we could say something like No.

42
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.220
Or something like that right.

43
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.270
No.

44
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.890
All right.

45
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.230
No submit.

46
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.710
And then we'd say no you see that we submitted the form and checked on that.

47
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.520
But then the user name is out there where you could say something like user name is not set.

48
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.520
You can say right here make sure that you say user name or this field can now be blank or something

49
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.630
like that these field

50
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.330
can be black.

51
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.150
Right.

52
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.170
Something like that just giving you an example right.

53
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.450
Right.

54
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.650
So it can not be black.

55
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.110
All right.

56
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.000
So anyway now that we have that in place here and let's connect to the database.

57
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.270
All right let's take this out here and just kind of comment is out and let's connect to the database

58
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.800
so to connect to the database I'm going to use an API called my HQ L I underscore connect I've got to

59
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.910
make a variable here.

60
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.820
That's that's how you you do.

61
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.950
You make a variable and you assign it its function.

62
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.360
My rescue.

63
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.140
I connect this function we're going to pass in a couple of parameters.

64
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.930
The first parameter we are going to pass is the server and this case we've got localhost.

65
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.740
Most of the time that's why you will have and the password I haven't set up any.

66
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.060
Well the user name is route.

67
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.040
Haven't said anything there and the password is empty we have or haven't set any password yet so that

68
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.720
the full password is root and that the full user names are his root and then the full pass was empty.

69
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.540
All right.

70
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.510
And

71
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.660
here would be what are we checking users.

72
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.500
That would be the table right.

73
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.140
It's a matter of fact I think it would be that this is a database I'm sorry database.

74
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.090
So we have our databases.

75
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.190
Let's go back logo's and

76
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.120
BHP my admin is a database admin.

77
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.550
I think it was oh I just don't want to make a mistake logging app All right.

78
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.510
Well mistakes are good.

79
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.680
Mistakes are really good.

80
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.050
I like making mistakes and not afraid of them makes me better.

81
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.120
So now that we have all this connection here and this function here we need to check it.

82
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.350
So we're going to have another statement here and we're going to say if connection remember what I told

83
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.890
you this will return the chool files if connection is true.

84
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.060
Then we will do something like

85
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:28.620
we are connected connected and here we say something like.

86
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.880
Else what you need to do is use some other function called Die in this thing.

87
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.470
Well what this would do is just would not execute any more code and would give you give the user error

88
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.230
here.

89
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:53.960
So I would say my database connection connection failed failed.

90
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.890
There we go.

91
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.100
So let's go and try this.

92
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.670
Let's keep our fingers crossed.

93
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.340
All right.

94
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.040
Let's click here.

95
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.770
Elisha's Samit we are connected.

96
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.300
So we finally connected to the database we are in business right.

97
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.400
So on the next leg you see I'm going to show you some more stuff we might ask you though and I hope

98
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.080
you enjoy this one.

99
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.700
And now that we are connected to the database we can start doing some great things with it.

100
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.260
So anyway thank you so much.

101
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.410
And I see you in the next lecture.
