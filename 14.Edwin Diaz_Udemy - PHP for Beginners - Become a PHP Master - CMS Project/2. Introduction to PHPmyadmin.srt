1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,950
All right welcome back on this video here I'm going to show you something really exciting.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,460
All right.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,220
Well we are going to give you an introduction to a tool called P-H be my admin is going to allow us

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,430
to manage databases create delete them edit them do many things with it right.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,820
Well most importantly is that we are getting into databases databases that really is a really exciting

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,300
topic.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,880
Right.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,770
So the first thing that I want you to do is open your browser.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:38,010
I'm going to show you how to go here by manually loco's for Slash BHB my at me like enter and this is

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,030
going to take it to the tool here and that's you can see we have many different options here.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,690
All right.

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,280
You going to give you a couple.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm going to give you a little tour here of other options but here just know that you will have all

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,590
the databases here at these default databases.

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,990
All right don't touch any of these.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,090
A little more advanced than the what I'm showing you.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,190
So we don't need to really go into this.

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,740
So here when you create a database to here so you put a name on the database and you click Create your

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,010
database is going to show here is going to show here on the left side we can type in the command manual

20
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:22,620
if we wanted to create a database so we can say create database or user and we will create it for us

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,700
when we click go.

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,620
If you know as well we can actually we can check the status of network traffic and all of that stuff

23
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,450
right here.

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,010
We have more is I mean is a tool has a bunch of information here.

25
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,960
This would be another course only on its own.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,610
All right.

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,460
If this course has I don't know how many lectures already this will be a course as we as much lecture

28
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,540
or more.

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,200
All right.

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,370
So databases are totally different animal right but we've got to get we're going to touch on them on

31
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,590
this course here a little bit.

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:56,930
All right.

33
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:04,830
So here we you can check the uses of databases is going to have Sunday for users with some privileges.

34
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,960
All right we can export databases here.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,510
So just in case you have a database is there a database you can export it right here.

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,400
So when you select your database you can go to the store and get to select that data was automatic that's

37
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,570
going to tell you we are exporting this database here you're going to click.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:31,240
You're going to get the file in that as well format and then you can import it right to another database.

39
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,840
Right.

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,220
So for example you create a database here called database 1 right.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,120
You do some stuff to create some tables inside of some information and then all of a sudden you want

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,950
to replicate that somewhere else.

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,330
Or you want to back it up or something whatever you make another big database called database to you

44
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,510
select database too.

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,880
And you go to import.

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,760
Well first you select the database one then you export it.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,110
So you've got the file on your computer called you know database one that ask you well then you select

48
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,460
all the database database too and you go to import.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,550
And here you will import or you choose a file and then once you have the files here then you can click

50
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:11,920
go.

51
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,680
And then you will import all that data from database one to that database to really awesome.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,820
You can check the settings of this tool here.

53
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,610
Features equerries and all of that great stuff replication variables.

54
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,680
I mean this is a little bit more advanced than what we are doing here but just know that this information

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,540
is here what we're going to be using is this database tab right here.

56
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,780
And that's about it.

57
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,080
And we're going to be probably using users to create users but we've got to create a database.

58
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,160
We're going to create a couple of tables inside because what we're going to be doing in the next story.

59
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,020
Well I'll let you in on the next on THE NEXT VIDEO.

60
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:57,720
We're going to be doing but on this video here I just gave an introduction of BHB my admin and now you

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,670
know your way around.

62
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,880
And on the next video we're going to build on that all right.

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,550
So hopefully you will enjoy this little part of my as well because we're going to be creating my Escurial

64
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,740
database right.

65
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,380
And it's going to be awesome.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:11,950
Right.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,310
So anyway I see you next.

68
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,060
And that's lecture and take care
