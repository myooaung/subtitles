1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,020
All right so on the last video we made this work.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,680
All right.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,610
But we thought that you know our search was not working.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,830
Our search engine was not working but it was working.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,920
We just did not give it any content to this play once they found a search.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,980
Once he found a result same result as you can see here and we did this and the last one I just deleted

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,010
it.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,170
It is displaying some of it.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
And if I go here.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,230
Well that's what it was before but if I go here.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,710
Hello.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,630
Well no resaw on that one.

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:45,370
And if I go here like Belinda which some results right javascript I know some resorts you see that.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:55,200
So what we want to do is we can have this search in you know we can have something else come here because

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,720
we are in the sidebar.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:02,470
So what we need to do is we meet we need to move all of this data somewhere else.

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,150
All right.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,540
We need to move all this functionality from the sidebar.

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,110
So what we need to do is make another page make this form submit to the old page and then we're going

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,200
to take all these data with us.

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:15,750
All right.

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,320
So we're going to take all this deleted when I delete it I come troll ads or command ads and your key

23
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:36,930
word and let's just make a new file and just do it from the index page and at the end it's all right

24
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:48,610
and do a Save As and it's called this search that BHB we should put this inside includes actually.

25
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,650
And let's leave it there for now.

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,150
Later on we will take it out of there.

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,330
We'll do it later.

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,030
That's fine.

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,760
Let's do it.

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,310
Let's do it.

31
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,460
Let's do it like this for now.

32
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,110
All right.

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:13,550
So let's just make make this right here in the same root as our end it's just to show you how it works.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,020
All right.

35
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,270
So this is a search here and what we want to do is this is the same page.

36
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:28,740
Now if I go to search here we're going to have some of the data here same data display to us when it

37
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:38,340
takes some of this data out there especially this from here to there.

38
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,680
But we're going to be putting our code right here.

39
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,020
I think we have some ph feedbacks that we need to worry about.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,080
But then I copy this there and we need to take that out.

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:02,980
You that BHP right here and is BHP what I want to do is inside these else says resoled.

42
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to pool all this information right here.

43
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:16,350
So I take all this and take it out and going to this play right here on this else I'm going to put it

44
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,660
in there.

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,390
All right.

46
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,290
So what I did.

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,790
Perfect.

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:30,990
Now we see a lot of information here but later on we're going to be able to at the end we're going to

49
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,190
refactor this and make this into function.

50
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,750
Right now we're not going to worry about it.

51
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,630
I think it looks good right now and it does what we need right now.

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:45,090
So another thing that we need to do actually we need to go back to the sidebar and make this Cyber Force

53
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,640
admit to that specific page.

54
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,840
So let's make a submit search that BHB.

55
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,010
All right.

56
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,350
Let's go ahead and test it out.

57
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,470
Let's go to the phone from page and it's.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,200
That works out.

59
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,720
Hello.

60
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,730
Click on it and we get in there of course expect them to follow what a team.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,410
I had a feeling that was going to do that one.

62
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:25,520
A team on the site search we have found here mistake.

63
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:32,180
We have a lot of this is breaking this test right here.

64
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,400
What we need is two and three here.

65
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,570
It should work fine now.

66
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,420
Perfect.

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go back to the that's again and let's look for something new.

68
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,560
Click on it.

69
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,500
No result.

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,930
Let's click.

71
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,410
And then we get that post that only that specific post says Belinda right.

72
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,020
Let's look for.

73
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,580
I don't know what else.

74
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,570
What can we look for.

75
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,050
Belinda right there.

76
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:20,930
Let's look for let's see in a database where we can look for structure I should post and doing this

77
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,470
look for.

78
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,630
Well when I that we only have two poses there.

79
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,980
And that's why it finds that it is working.

80
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,010
Now let's look for BHB.

81
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:39,130
All right which is let's look for BHB and see how that works.

82
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,820
We should make another in and try it out like that.

83
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,430
BHB finds out information

84
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,860
finds Belinda there.

85
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,190
But the only problem is I'll show you right now that is displaying everything.

86
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,120
What we want to do is just display why this search is just one item.

87
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,790
All right one individual item for research.

88
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,050
So that's the only thing that we want to display.

89
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,280
So that's why this is explain everything because every time you find something just displays a holding.

90
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,430
Right now we want to make this display just as specific individual polls.

91
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,800
All right.

92
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,870
So for that we just basically not put this in the loop right.

93
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,000
We're not going to be put in.

94
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,440
We get we've got to select it from what we want.

95
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,460
All right so let's fix.

96
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,310
Actually one one it actually FIND A polls.

97
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,250
Not a bunch of information.

98
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:48,210
So we select from polls where that and depending on that we select everything from polls here and we

99
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,050
are displaying the same polls over and over again there.

100
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,620
And that is the problem.

101
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,230
All right so we need to take this out of here because right now we have that there.

102
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,640
We don't need it.

103
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,620
We have that there and we don't have a while loop.

104
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,130
So we need we just need a WHILE loop.

105
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,780
Now we just take this out of here.

106
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,390
And I think we're good just with this.

107
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:24,240
We have to change this Querrey search query and put it into a WHILE loop here because that's our search

108
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,010
query.

109
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,220
We need to do that.

110
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,150
All right so now we will get individual results.

111
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,750
It was working fine.

112
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,320
It was it was now working for 100 percent.

113
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,580
We is finding the polls and everything else with it.

114
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,100
So now let's check it out again.

115
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,070
And now we should have something better.

116
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,840
All right.

117
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,050
So we have everything here let's just type in Belinda and see what happens.

118
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Haha nice right now I just found aspecific post right.

119
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,850
Let's pull the take on it.

120
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,910
Just.

121
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,450
Nothing else right.

122
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,830
Now a custom search engine is perfect.

123
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,200
Anyway I hope you like this tutorial this lecture and I hope you learn a lot.

124
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,660
So anyway I see you in the next one.

125
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,150
All right.

126
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,550
Take care.
