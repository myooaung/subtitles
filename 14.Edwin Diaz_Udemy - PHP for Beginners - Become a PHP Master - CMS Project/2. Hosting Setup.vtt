00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.190
Welcome back my student in this lecture I'm going to give you some tips on the best hosting provider

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.580
out there that I found over the years.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.200
I am also going to tell you why it's important to have a good hosting service and for those of you that

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.400
already have a hosting provider I just want you to look at this lecture because it's going to give you

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.500
insights on hosting services out there.

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.020
All right.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.270
So if you go to your you know to Google here that's where I'm going and you're typing hosting it.

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.190
You got a whole variety of options here many options right would make your head spin.

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.430
We need a hosting provider in order for us to be on line and that's mandatory.

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.090
Now the worst part.

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.440
The complication here is that choosing the right provider for us right.

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.200
For those of you that have hosting I want you to just wait a minute or two.

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.930
Right now choosing the right provider for us needs has to do with the best customer service the best

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.970
software right and the best affordable one.

15
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.470
So those three things.

16
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:04.800
Now I found that over the years you know bitesize emotion hosed gator which are the biggest one dream

17
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.660
holes blowholes one in one.

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.320
I mean the best one that I found over the years is Go Daddy.

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.280
And if you go to my Web site Edwin Diaz dot com and you click on resources and you click on this link.

20
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.820
This is going to give you the biggest discount in the whole wide world.

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.720
All right you got to get one dollar a month hosting.

22
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.130
That's like 12 hours a year free domain and free See panel.

23
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.740
Now you hear this correctly.

24
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.100
See panel C-SPAN was like that.

25
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.430
The biggest thing you can have in hosting.

26
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.960
Right I am going to show you what what that is right now.

27
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.490
I already signed up for that count.

28
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.650
If you go to Web hosting once you sign in.

29
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.490
All right.

30
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570
You're going to have this tax year and you click my account and then you go to web hosting that have

31
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.550
domains on this and then you click on the domain that you choose.

32
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.290
I'm going to show you a minute how to do that.

33
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.080
And you click manage.

34
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.610
I'll show you what's the panel is.

35
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.800
And then this is see panel see panel has like wizards for databases web applications software domain

36
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.580
configurations email Mattrick security.

37
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.130
I mean the whole nine yards.

38
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.920
And do you need it.

39
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.330
Yes you do need it.

40
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.610
All right.

41
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.990
This is something that is needed.

42
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.570
Why.

43
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.480
Because you've got a goal in grow over time and become a better developer and you don't need these tools

44
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.270
and you're going to need a way to set up applications really fast easy on.

45
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.860
Now let me show you the process if you go here to my Web site like I told you click on the link you

46
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.450
get the special for here and this is for one year right after the year if you want to cancel.

47
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.790
You can cancel it goes up a little bit but it's the best thing you can have.

48
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.730
All right is cheaper than any anybody out there anyhow see panel.

49
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.940
So I'm just going to type in any domain here just to show you.

50
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.460
So that way it is available.

51
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.140
How this is done.

52
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.510
Very simple you follow the prompt and this is because I already got I already got to hear it in my car.

53
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.760
I was doing this before so I need to remove.

54
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.160
I got I got two domains here.

55
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.480
That's the reason why he's doing that.

56
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.730
So let me just take this off here and take this off.

57
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.730
All right there we go.

58
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.460
So now I got the right one.

59
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.160
I was just doing this before in an old video and I messed up I had to go back.

60
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.790
But you should get something like this.

61
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.430
Twelve housing 18 cents and this is now I don't promise you this is going to be the hero of the time.

62
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.750
So you need to hurry up if you want to take advantage of this.

63
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.870
You're going to get economy Linux hosting we see panel $12 and that's all you pay.

64
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.260
You're going to have a whole year that you can mess around with.

65
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.640
And if you want to stay we go there you can.

66
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.200
All right.

67
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.840
Then you got to get your free domain which is usually $12 and accounts with Sopranos I usually like

68
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.320
six ninety nine and up.

69
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.480
Or something like that.

70
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.280
So take advantage of this for one year.

71
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.040
Right.

72
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.470
And once you go again you're going to see a panel like I show you you click manage.

73
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.180
You go to File Manager you go here and you're going to be able to see all your server files here.

74
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.450
Now you might not have a lot of server files because you're starting out a new account just like I have

75
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.420
a whole bunch of files here now right.

76
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.970
And I know he says one domain that you can only have one domain but I want to show you something.

77
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.720
I'm going to go to a couple of applications that I got on line and show you right now if I go to well-doing

78
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:49.830
College see a mess you can see that I have an application you have possumus system that we are making

79
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.550
and one of my courses right.

80
00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:02.430
And then I have called College C.I. another application here and I have a whole bunch of applications

81
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.990
here.

82
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.700
I even have another application right here.

83
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.890
All right.

84
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.870
And I have another application here.

85
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.620
All right.

86
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.210
So it's only you're only going to have one server that you can steal one domain.

87
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.840
Right.

88
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:26.070
But then you can install many different applications you know in different folders like I am doing right

89
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.880
here I'm going to show you how to do that.

90
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.030
So take advantage of it I think is word for you and I'll see you in the other side in the next lecture

91
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.430
right.

92
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.600
Take care.
