1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:01,450
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:07,590
Many students in this lecture we are going to be modifying our headers a little better to actually receive

3

00:00:07,920  -->  00:00:10,710
from a parameter here.

4

00:00:10,710  -->  00:00:11,510
The right way.

5

00:00:11,520  -->  00:00:18,150
Right now we are sending in just a email but hitter's actually are formatted in a different way.

6

00:00:18,180  -->  00:00:22,310
So let me just show you what I mean with the headers and I'm talking about the mail function.

7

00:00:22,530  -->  00:00:28,100
So right now let me go to my file manager right here.

8

00:00:28,980  -->  00:00:32,840
Let's go to the contact page right mortifies a little bit.

9

00:00:33,090  -->  00:00:36,450
And what we need to do is show you

10

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:45,240
right here and he's had a variable year there where we need to format this is with a string that says

11

00:00:45,240  -->  00:00:54,020
from without capital F F R M colon and then we concatenate this all right.

12

00:00:54,480  -->  00:01:00,120
And now what we've got to get is the right way of doing it doing this.

13

00:01:00,120  -->  00:01:13,580
All right so let me just go we can call college and see a mass and that this is contact contact up ph

14

00:01:13,620  -->  00:01:13,890
B.

15

00:01:13,910  -->  00:01:19,140
Believe us right here we go.

16

00:01:19,140  -->  00:01:19,920
Now let's do it.

17

00:01:19,950  -->  00:01:25,180
So I'm going to do Rico Suave a G.M. dot com or.

18

00:01:25,500  -->  00:01:26,110
And then.

19

00:01:26,130  -->  00:01:27,870
Hello Rico.

20

00:01:28,620  -->  00:01:31,890
How are you.

21

00:01:32,130  -->  00:01:32,790
All right.

22

00:01:33,090  -->  00:01:34,920
It's me.

23

00:01:35,700  -->  00:01:36,130
Whatever.

24

00:01:36,130  -->  00:01:38,180
I'm not going to even put a girl's name or something there.

25

00:01:38,180  -->  00:01:41,080
My wife would get upset.

26

00:01:41,100  -->  00:01:45,630
Hi this is.

27

00:01:46,770  -->  00:01:51,320
I don't know someone whatever.

28

00:01:51,450  -->  00:01:52,850
There we go.

29

00:01:53,820  -->  00:01:55,640
And by the way my wife would not get upset.

30

00:01:55,640  -->  00:01:57,120
I was just joking around.

31

00:01:57,120  -->  00:01:58,330
All right guys.

32

00:01:58,650  -->  00:02:00,400
Don't laugh at me.

33

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:02,300
You might have that problem not me.

34

00:02:02,390  -->  00:02:03,180
All right.

35

00:02:03,540  -->  00:02:04,050
All right.

36

00:02:04,110  -->  00:02:04,590
So

37

00:02:07,650  -->  00:02:16,000
if I go now and look at that parameter I can assure you right now that he says Rekos Swaby email and

38

00:02:16,030  -->  00:02:21,550
now is from Rico Suave G.M. dot com.

39

00:02:21,990  -->  00:02:25,580
And I don't know who this guy is but I guess that's Rico Suave here.

40

00:02:25,590  -->  00:02:27,260
That's his e-mail address.

41

00:02:27,260  -->  00:02:28,090
All right.

42

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:33,950
But anyway as you can see now is for Madhi the right way we got whoops make this a little more.

43

00:02:33,960  -->  00:02:34,710
There we go.

44

00:02:34,740  -->  00:02:39,470
Now we got Rico Swaby there and we got the tetes there.

45

00:02:39,480  -->  00:02:39,840
All right.

46

00:02:39,840  -->  00:02:41,630
So it's working now.

47

00:02:41,630  -->  00:02:45,660
Again this is in large there so what you don't see my personal information.

48

00:02:45,660  -->  00:02:46,520
All right.

49

00:02:47,130  -->  00:02:51,660
So thank you so much for watching this lecture and I see you in the next one.

50

00:02:51,660  -->  00:02:53,670
Take care.
