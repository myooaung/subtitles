00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.680
Hi welcome back on this video we're going to be learning how to use pre-define math functions from BHB.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.040
All right.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.150
So I'm going to give you a couple of examples and then we'll let you know where they are.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.190
So the first thing that I want to do is show you a function called how this function is going to be

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.580
in charge of actually doing.

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.450
Isn't that taught to the seventh power.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.070
All right.

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.170
So if we go here is 20.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.500
All right.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.340
Two to the second power is 28.

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.290
That too has a base right here.

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.780
All right.

13
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.320
So what else let's just do a b or tag here just to give an example this is not.

14
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.000
And there are many different functions and we will be using a couple of them just to give you an example

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.190
there is another function call ran this function is super useful.

16
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040
This is going to return a random number every time.

17
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.320
Actually we need to go look at and run the number crazy run the numbers right.

18
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.860
If I refresh it gives me a random number all the time and if I pass a one parameter I'm telling a start

19
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.290
from 1 and give me a random number from 1 to a thousand.

20
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.750
And now we fresh look at the different number from one to a thousand.

21
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:29.250
Perfect is better if I use my keywords actually faster if I use this I can use the mouse it as fast

22
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.530
as I could use my key where you see the command are all control are we go and let's do this do another

23
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.410
one go and use the square root.

24
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.920
I think it's q r t I believe as q r t.

25
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.580
All right.

26
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.430
This will for random I get my my editor is helping me out with this one I can't really get much help

27
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.550
but that's fine I think I got it right.

28
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.630
There we go.

29
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.640
The square of one hundred ten lead.

30
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.200
I think that's it.

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.380
I mean let's try one more try one more on that score and the muse.

32
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.180
All right.

33
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.230
So I'm going to use a one called ceiling and what I want to do is take a number like this with a decimal

34
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.040
and we get rounded up to the next.

35
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.040
All right.

36
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.890
All right so we can always use also one another one.

37
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.500
Now that I remember called floor

38
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.070
and we can run that down to the next integer.

39
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.000
Right.

40
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.600
So perfect.

41
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.950
So Floyd is going to run that down and the 5 is going to round up.

42
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.120
Let's look at some math functions here.

43
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.350
All right.

44
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.200
So we see some math functions right here.

45
00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.580
All right let's go ahead and see if we can find one called round selling rounds up.

46
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.000
Let's keep going and round rounds of flow.

47
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.480
So there is another one.

48
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.680
Actually that's what I wanted to make sure that we round.

49
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.540
You know depending on which is the second number here right.

50
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.050
So if we use this one here but we call it round actually does the name of the function right.

51
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.790
You see that if he runs it up to the nearest two depending on the second number.

52
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.040
So this was a 4 he runs it down to four.

53
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.690
So that just like we do in school.

54
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.610
All right.

55
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.030
So just to give you a couple examples here.

56
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.670
If you don't it this fall should be in your course.

57
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.270
I said site exercise follows.

58
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.940
You should be number 24 on the score math on score functions if you are doing in a different folder

59
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.410
if you use on different for the call.

60
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.840
Call it math on underscore functions that BHB.

61
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.470
All right.

62
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.440
You can always do or save us from blank that BHB.

63
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.680
All right so there you have it then.

64
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.980
And this is the address of course to find disfunctions.

65
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.910
Actually no this is the address right here.

66
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.960
All right.

67
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.980
So thank you so much for watching.

68
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.500
And I see you in the next election.

69
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.070
Good luck
