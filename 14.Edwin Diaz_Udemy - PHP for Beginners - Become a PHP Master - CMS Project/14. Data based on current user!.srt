00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,590
I welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:09,870
So this lecture here is to kind of answer a request that I have from one of you guys this particular

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,230
student your classmate was asking me how can I make this visible only to the user that is actually creating

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,430
it or actually have created it.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,680
Well it is very simple remember that we have already a user right when we log in when we register a

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,870
user we are setting sessions.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,750
I remember that we set a session called username and that's what we're using here to display this.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:43,490
So all you have to do is display this content or it is data for that particular user.

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,530
So let's let me show you an example how we can do this.

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,340
And you can apply this functionality to whatever you want in the sidebars here or top bar or whatever

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,980
to any part of your project.

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,560
OK.

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,170
So this is not set in stone.

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,260
Remember we're always trying to do is find out the identity of the user and we do this best by using

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,620
sessions or we can insert that data into our database.

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,120
Right.

17
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,160
But we're using data sessions in this.

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,820
And let's find out how to use that.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,210
So in that particular area this is what I think is the view post.

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,920
So let's go to admin and includes your post here.

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,720
So we've got to find out where we are displaying the data and it looks like

22
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,540
this really doesn't matter because this basically is just updating the idea of that specific post.

23
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,280
OK.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,570
So whatever post you are showing in that scream is going this is going to still apply.

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,680
You don't have to do anything else with it and you're going to see in a minute what I mean.

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,660
And let's see.

27
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,270
Oh I think it's right here.

28
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,360
This is a data.

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,780
So for example I know that my user name is Edwyn because that is what I'm using here and that's why

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,110
I'm actually seeing everything this because his admin.

31
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,750
Right.

32
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,680
So we're not putting any constraints here.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,450
We could if we wanted to set something like this.

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:30,420
Well so all from polls where polls user I believe is Colomb feel equals to one marker and while we are

35
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:38,030
not going to see any difference here OK just because you see this go back actually less save and we

36
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,390
should see a difference.

37
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,850
This is not Etling is not the same as admin user.

38
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,270
There we go.

39
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,350
You see we see less posts here.

40
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,110
OK.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,140
So this so you can do it.

42
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,230
Now we are just constraining here.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,250
How can we find out the coring user.

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,420
Well I'm glad you were at there you ask.

45
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:03,760
We could if we wanted to create a variable here to haul that and we could just say it's a matter of

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
fact we have the user

47
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,630
Let's see.

48
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,290
Let me show you how to find it in the

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,200
in the session.

50
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,450
And that should be very simple to you.

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,130
Right.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,670
And we can just say user name.

53
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,240
Simple as that.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,500
And let's come back here.

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,990
Let's just replace here like that.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,930
Save it let's call back here and we should see no difference.

57
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,120
As you can see everything looks the same.

58
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,540
Well now we can convert this and put it into a function or something right.

59
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,160
It's a matter of fact I think I already did.

60
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,730
Let me just come back here.

61
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,750
Two functions.

62
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,730
And as you can see I already have it done for you.

63
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,300
Let's check out how it looks.

64
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,410
So you can see we have the function current user and now we are checking here to see if that session

65
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,170
is set and this is the user name session right.

66
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,370
If it's set then we return that session if is now we return false.

67
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,270
But now can we use it here.

68
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:23,620
Well let's go back here and let's just do that and I'm going to use less use that function name comeback

69
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,640
here.

70
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,960
It's pretty easy stuff for you guys.

71
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,310
Come on.

72
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,850
And then instead of that we are using that right.

73
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,170
So that should work the same.

74
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,200
Now let's come back here and refresh.

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,360
And as you can see it still works and you can apply that to anything else you want.
