1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,280
All right welcome back to the students So what can we do next.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:10,960
Well first of all what I want to do is I want to change the Logan.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:20,320
Right now the way our logging is for the front page is that we have to go here what if we create a bond

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,030
here a link that would take us to another page just in case we need it and we do actually need it for

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,200
Forgot possible feature.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,380
By the way let's create a separate page that we can allow the user to log instead of just logging in

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,000
through the front of the web site only.

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,370
So let's actually find out where our logging pages are logging functionality.

9
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,940
So let's see right now

10
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,860
OK here we go to sidebar This is where our logon is.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,540
OK he's taking us to include and Logan.

12
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:07,820
So he's actually taking us right here to the same directory and we just have this functionality here.

13
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:19,980
So I want to move this to the root where your registration page is so let's use that folder there.

14
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,480
And that's where it is.

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,980
Now I'm going to remove a couple of things from here.

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,640
It's actually now we move all that as a matter of finding just going to remove everything.

17
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,890
I'm going to copy what registration has this to function includes here.

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,530
Just take it back to

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,670
back here.

20
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,580
OK.

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,240
And I have a piece of code that I want to download from this lecture.

22
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:06,470
OK is going to be where we are going to be using for for this OK.

23
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,040
Slow down make sure you download it in the resources section.

24
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:17,840
A feast not here and this page if it's out here on this video is on the video of this section that's

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,080
where you're going to find all your files.

26
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,820
But I'm going to try to include them in every lecture.

27
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,420
OK.

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:30,500
So whatever you're needing every lecture so let's go ahead and see how this looks in the outside.

29
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,390
Logan BHB okay.

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,190
As you can see it's just a regular logon page.

31
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,780
Let's change the footer

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,950
and let's just change copyright.

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,580
Or let's just say

34
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,100
I just don't like what the footer befooled is saying a date.

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,440
And one of the good things I like a bow.

36
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,600
The HP story is that it saves your files automatically.

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,060
So make sure you're saving your files OK if you're using any other type or that you that those unsaved.

38
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,210
So make sure that you use command save or command and control as.

39
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,840
So anyway now that we have a log in page there we need to create a link for it.

40
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,740
Here you know I see him as we need actually some type of NAB or something right.

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,740
So let's go here make sure that we our includes of navigation or something right here.

42
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:53,040
This guy here in registration would just go up right above the container and we go.

43
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,200
Now let's look at that.

44
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,850
See how that works.

45
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,630
There we go.

46
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:06,290
OK let's go back here let's go to navigation real quick and we have to create some type of link and

47
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,670
right here we says admen ongoing to create a link here

48
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,720
to say Logan

49
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,360
see

50
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,420
let's see if we can make it.

51
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,340
No I don't have that feature yet.

52
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:40,780
You can do the same thing with two registration taking that up BHB out like I show you in the last sections

53
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,380
last lectures.

54
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,530
I don't know my English is getting worse by the minute.

55
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,780
I don't understand it.

56
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,360
All right.

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,140
So let's come back here.

58
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,680
Beautiful.

59
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,840
So now what we need to do is detect if they use is.

60
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,790
Then if is low then we don't actually want to show this by in here I link and want to be able to make

61
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,770
this phone form.

62
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,340
Function right.

63
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:18,810
So to actually do this in the navigation area we need to use some of our functions here.

64
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,750
Let's see

65
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:31,510
come back here and let's open some BHB tags I'm going to use shorthand for this.

66
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,310
I don't know if I show you this but I have all the courses how to use shorthand BHB code.

67
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:45,590
So for example like for the IF statements we can close right here and then we can

68
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,920
open another ph speech tag here.

69
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,670
What's going on with my code.

70
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,380
And then we can.

71
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:07,050
And if like this OK now where you can do is just comput NEHTA mailing there and you don't have to put

72
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,310
BHB tags.

73
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,080
OK.

74
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,270
So let's use one of our functions if

75
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,490
it's logged then.

76
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,310
OK.

77
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,310
And if it's true then we're going to show whatever we want and what we want to show is this Admin Link

78
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,030
here.

79
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,650
And what about the log in.

80
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,890
Actually we are logged in we don't want to show that.

81
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,070
So let's create some type of statement here.

82
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,860
Let's just copy this real quick.

83
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:47,410
And the elves needs to have that call in here instead of a semicolon.

84
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,390
If I pull a muscle read my DS telling me they is expecting a statement.

85
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,230
We need to put our code below.

86
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,570
So if the user is not logged in we want to be able.

87
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,690
We want him to see the logon page right.

88
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,340
Or her like this

89
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:15,420
if he's logged in we see the Admin Link if he's not we see the log in.

90
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,400
OK great.

91
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,330
Later on we're also going to be putting the logo on here somewhere because as a matter of fact the list

92
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,230
is your just do it now.

93
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,100
Put a logo

94
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,230
and believe this is insane clues or something like.

95
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,370
BHB OK.

96
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,880
All right.

97
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,670
That looks about right.

98
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,990
We've got to try this out and see if it works.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,470
But first before we try that out we need to also fits our logo and Page 2 so functionality.

100
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,220
So what I want to do is up here somewhere

101
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,430
I want to start writing my BHB code.

102
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,530
So let's do it.

103
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,320
We can use one of our functions is called check if users logged in and redirect because we don't want

104
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,960
to use it to see the log in page right.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,720
If you're logged in we don't even one him here or her.

106
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,770
So this takes a session.

107
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,780
Actually we are now using the session anymore.

108
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,530
This just takes a redirect.

109
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,880
Bache redirect location.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,830
If you go back to functions you can see that right here just takes every location because we are getting

111
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,610
the session from this guy here for this function and we are using the function right there.

112
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,760
OK.

113
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,230
So simple as that.

114
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,750
That's all we have to do with that.

115
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:07,470
Now we can just use because right now we are going to be getting some information from this form.

116
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,050
So we want to make sure that it is the method that we are looking for.

117
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:19,290
So I believe we have one that is if it is method and we can pass in a string here for checking for posts

118
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:29,020
and we can just check the form variables here.

119
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,510
We can even make it more flexible if we wanted to but I think this should give you a pretty good idea.

120
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:45,470
On how to do it and this is make sure that all fields are set in the form

121
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,350
before we do anything

122
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,770
let's see why we missing one of these guys.

123
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,710
What am I doing with you.

124
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:15,630
Now here if everything said we want to use our logging user function and we are going to plug them in

125
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,940
right now.

126
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:23,330
Copy this guy here and this we just change its password.

127
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:30,620
Simple as that OK else we just redirect.

128
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:36,170
We can use our function redirect to redirect them somewhere or whatever we want.

129
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:47,190
In this case we can redirect the person or the machine write to log in and BHB OK.

130
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,280
Basically to the same form again.

131
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,920
Or we can use BHB self here if we wanted to.

132
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,070
I think that should do the trick.

133
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,130
Let's check to see if it works if we get any errors.

134
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,750
We'll fix it.

135
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,460
So now refresh your.

136
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:09,510
Make sure you save your form and as a matter of fact I don't even have the user name here.

137
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,270
For this

138
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,080
let's see he's a RICO think he's suave it

139
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,060
right.

140
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,410
Oh there we go.

141
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,120
I.

142
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,830
The password because I've been writing so many passwords that I forgot.

143
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,040
Let's just put whatever Bassal here just to make sure that it is working.

144
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,470
As you can see we get redirected back to the index page.

145
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:55,720
Actually if for some reason the form is now submitted OK so we need to change that we're getting redirected

146
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,960
there.

147
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,290
So let's change the functionality real quick change.

148
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,400
Let's go to what whatever this these functions returning.

149
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,870
Let's go to functions so let's look at a command f control F..

150
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,020
Let's look for logging user OK.

151
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:27,750
And OK well the problem is that we are redirecting here what we can do is we can just return false here.

152
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,470
We wanted to

153
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,610
that would take care of the issue.

154
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,670
Of course is in line 399 and

155
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:53,260
I see of course if we are not able to get any of these values.

156
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,480
These values are not going to work.

157
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,630
So I'm going to have all of that

158
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,980
and I'm going to put it inside this loop here.

159
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:17,890
Simple as that.

160
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,070
I mean take that back real quick.

161
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,930
This is missing something here.

162
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,940
It's like that.

163
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,180
It's another one missing here.

164
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,460
I took it off when I.

165
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,680
I think I did it cut it when I cut it.

166
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:51,740
There we go and this is missing return statement.

167
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,720
Take care of that.

168
00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:00,230
With a return statement of true here.

169
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,200
Simple as that.

170
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,270
So

171
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,210
let's go back here and let's make sure everything is working.

172
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,530
There we go.

173
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,410
See

174
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,870
beautiful.

175
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,720
OK.

176
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,530
So let's keep going.

177
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,180
We are almost getting close to build in the future.

178
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,690
Forgot Possehl feature so stay tuned for that.

179
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,190
See you in the next lecture guys.

180
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,820
Take care.
