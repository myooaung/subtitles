00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,010
Welcome back my student in this lecture here I'm going to show you how to turn on the feature that we

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,040
need in development to see the mistakes we make in our code.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,370
BHB will let us know if we have some type of syntax error.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,010
OK.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:21,840
So go to your local host in your Zahm folder and go to your BHB in full.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,550
And here we're going to have the server information I'm going to type in Command F F or control F for

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,470
Windows.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,160
I'm going to look for display on underscore score error.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,230
OK.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,500
And if I maximize this you can see that I found it right here.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,590
Make sure that yours is on all right because this is going to let us know some of you have this off.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,070
And when you make a mistake in your syntax you're going to spend hours looking for the mistake and you

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,180
can tell what it is.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,290
But this if he's on he's going to tell you if he's off what you need to do is you need to find your

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,280
Ph.D. Dayanidhi file and this you will find that I show you right now go to your Csound folder.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,380
Some of you have it on the C drive because you're using Windows and I using I'm using a Mac so I have

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,150
it on applications but I use them for the day and find your PC folder.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:24,930
And they say that you find your HP and I file drop it in your coeditor like this right here hear you're

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,530
going to drop it.

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,470
Get a load like this.

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,640
And then I make this a little smaller.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,790
All right.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,920
And then what you do is you search for it.

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,510
All right.

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,500
I press command for my co-editor and I can look for it.

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,030
And then we find this line right here.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,800
Mine is the line 533 and you can see that my is on.

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,150
All right.

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,800
If you have it off again.

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,970
Well you need to do is if you have it like this.

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:02:04,020
Change it to ON MAKE SURE YOU the Capitol there and save it go to your control manager on zap and restart

32
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,980
your services.

33
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:11,190
You click here and then for my school and for patchin you store everything all right once you do that

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:18,780
then you can go back to to that page right here refresh.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,200
And this is going to have to go back to BHB Imphal and make sure that when you search for Again it's

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,040
on.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,150
All right you double check is on to make sure it's on.

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:39,420
Another feature is they make sure that you have output buffering on to I have with a four thousand ninety

39
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,050
six bytes.

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,700
Right.

41
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,320
If you have it all.

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,720
All right.

43
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,480
Go back here.

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,660
Search for it output.

45
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,320
There we go.

46
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,730
Buffering.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,170
That's not even a look at a second time I got an on line to 64 and I have the values of four thousand

48
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,390
ninety six.

49
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,190
OK.

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,430
So make sure you change that when you output buffering.

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,970
All right.

52
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,010
This has output buffering here too.

53
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,900
For now the setting for the set of change that.

54
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,760
And the second one change.

55
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,250
OK.

56
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
So anyway you should be good to go after that.

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,430
Just make sure you save this restore your services and you are good to go later on.

58
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:31,290
The reason why we turning this on here for output buffering is because the headers sometimes sends information

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,930
when he says requests.

60
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,000
And we have some spacing between the header of the file when he leaves his call y space.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,930
We have some whitespace or any that files get sent to the server.

62
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,760
The server gives us an error.

63
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,460
OK.

64
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,780
You can look for more information about the output of buffering but just know that we need it later

65
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,690
on we're going to have to turn it in turn it on manually like this.

66
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,050
Let me just show you right here like this with this function all be on the score star and we put it

67
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:08,760
out the hetter all the way in the first line of that file that we will be using a function called Hetter

68
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,690
right here this function right here is going to redirect us to another page.

69
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,810
We're going to use this function to do that.

70
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,350
And if we use this function and don't start the output buffering on that specific page later on will

71
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,120
we have a problem.

72
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:25,470
All right.

73
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,650
Always pay attention to that if you get if you will use this function you get an arrow saying oh headers

74
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:37,590
already being sent then no that's because you are using you know turning and turning this on manually

75
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,210
on that specific page.

76
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,500
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture here and I'll see you in the next one.

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:43,920
Take care
