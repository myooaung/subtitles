1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,130
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,190
So on the last lecture on this having fun with the book section we created this functionality for the

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,020
no pulse available right.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,730
Beautiful.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,240
And this is for the home page.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,430
Now we need to create the same functionality for our category pages right.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,180
Cool.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,160
Let's go back here.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,530
Let's go to category here and one of the first thing that I want to do is that if we don't have a category

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,950
we shouldn't be showing anything.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,690
So let's take this little curly bracket all the way down here.

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,080
Let's make an L statement so we don't have a category.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,910
What else can we do.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,270
We can head or we can to send the person somewhere else so let's redirect the person to something like

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:48,890
that.

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,050
BHB right.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,880
Beautiful.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:01,260
Now what I want to do here is I want to return a resoled from this query and I want to return a resoled

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,620
based on the pulse status just like we did in this.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,270
But here we got to put another so a little bit different here we just say where Paul started Zeek was

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,310
publish but here we're going to say and because we got two statements.

22
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,210
Now another condition.

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,980
So and full status

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,140
status equals publish.

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,610
All right.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,870
And right here I want to create a if condition and it's going to say if my SU line known rows so we're

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:48,060
going to use this function to count how many rolls we have in this Querrey if our roles are less than

28
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,920
one that means we don't have anything coming from that Querrey that means there is no published Polsce

29
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,610
we can say something like There's no pulse.

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,410
Let's go back to end that BHB.

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,990
Copy that and paste it right here.

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,700
Beautiful else

33
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,910
then we can make them Querrey and let's just put another curly bracket right here.

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,100
All right let's go and try it out.

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,920
Category.

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,380
Colon in line 80.

37
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,910
All right here we go.

38
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,720
There we go.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,050
Javascript not in there no pose no pose.

40
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:47,050
Let's go and change it to publish apply and now we can see everything beautifully.

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,760
All right.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,570
Perfect.

43
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,710
This is looking good.

44
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,520
All right.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,370
So I hope you're having a lot of fun with the bugs and this section of the here and this is what we

46
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:56,730
learn.

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,670
This is where we actually get to be more creative and we find solution for problems and we fix them.

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,950
And what can I say.

49
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,140
I hope you're having as much fun as I am.

50
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,700
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next having fun with the box lecture.
