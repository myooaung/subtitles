All right so let's go ahead and continue this.

2

00:00:03.570  -->  00:00:05.620
So we have everything filled up here.

3

00:00:05.670  -->  00:00:09.170
Let's go ahead and make sure that we are displaying some of these data.

Of course not.

7

00:00:24.980  -->  00:00:32.950
We don't want to display the password the first name and then we need that last name actually square

8

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:38.220
and do that and we say user last name you're going to copy this one.

9

Here we go and let's just say last name the last name and user email.

10

00:00:47.580  -->  00:00:53.030
I think we just put e-mail on top here.

We got all up here on the had a user e-mail user role.

18

00:01:21.960  -->  00:01:26.160
All right.

19

00:01:29.280  -->  00:01:31.280
What else we need to take this out of here.

20

00:01:31.280  -->  00:01:32.810
We don't need it.

21

00:01:33.640  -->  00:01:37.050
I'm just going to come and decide we might need it for something else later.

22

00:01:37.050  -->  00:01:42.470
Not sure yet and we don't have a date yet because we don't have a date set up for the user.

23

00:01:42.500  -->  00:01:44.220
We should How would they feel right.

24

00:01:44.820  -->  00:01:51.990
By the way it is for now my being that extra features or something but we don't need it right now.

25

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:56.870
And this one here I'm just going to take this out take this.

26

00:01:56.880  -->  00:02:04.600
Now we are going to need those links now for this.

27

00:02:04.630  -->  00:02:05.140
All right.

28

00:02:05.160  -->  00:02:07.150

29

00:02:07.950  -->  00:02:08.330
Whoops.

30

00:02:08.340  -->  00:02:09.930
A lot of arrows there right.

Perfect.

37

00:02:19.710  -->  00:02:26.150
We have an extra feel here that we now use and let's take that off and just go to date.

38

00:02:26.620  -->  00:02:31.050
Yeah I thought it was a really good idea at that time but we're just probably going to add it later

39

00:02:31.050  -->  00:02:31.830
on.

40

00:02:31.830  -->  00:02:33.380
All right.
