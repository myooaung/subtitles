Hi welcome back my student in this lecture here I'm going to show you how to get your certification

2

00:00:06,210  -->  00:00:07,350
for the course.

3

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:08,970
This is very simple.

4

00:00:08,970  -->  00:00:14,790
Once you are done with all the lectures you're going to have this checkmark right here in green.

5

00:00:14,790  -->  00:00:15,140
All right.

6

00:00:15,150  -->  00:00:20,120
Well actually it's a little green circle with a checkmark inside with a white checkmark.

7

00:00:20,190  -->  00:00:23,530
You're going to have this for all your lections right once you finish a course.

8

00:00:23,550  -->  00:00:29,100
Make sure that you have all of them checked and was all or all of them are checked.

9

00:00:29,100  -->  00:00:31,390
Then you're going to get this little trophy right here.

10

00:00:31,440  -->  00:00:33,750
All you have to do is just click anywhere here.

11

00:00:33,810  -->  00:00:39,130
So that way you can select the page and pull your mouse over and click it once you click.

12

00:00:39,150  -->  00:00:43,170
You're going to get the certification page and all you got to do is download it to your computer if

13

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:45,260
you want like this.

14

00:00:45,300  -->  00:00:49,930
And you can download as a JPEG or a PTF and then print it out and that's it.

15

00:00:49,940  -->  00:00:50,360
All right.

16

00:00:50,470  -->  00:00:54,520
But make sure that all your lectures are completed.

17

00:00:54,830  -->  00:00:55,590
All right.

18

00:00:55,590  -->  00:01:00,870
They all have to be completed 100 percent for you to get this little trophy right here.

19

00:01:00,870  -->  00:01:01,170
All right.

20

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:06,780
But anyway that's it for you for this lecture and hopefully you enjoy this course.

21

00:01:06,780  -->  00:01:10,320
Thank you so much for for allowing me to be your instructor.

22

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:16,770
And don't forget to always leave reading my review just to show you instructor that you care also.

23

00:01:16,770  -->  00:01:17,250
All right.

24

00:01:17,340  -->  00:01:20,790
So take care and I see you in the next course.

25
