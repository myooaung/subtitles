00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.250
All right.

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.560
So we have come a long way and we are still scratching the surface of what we can do with a mass.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.660
We can extend it to whatever we want.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.780
Right now what I really want is to have the ability to have users come here and make comments on our

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.450
pools right we click on it.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.830
I want to be able to have users come here shoot up a comment and submit the form right now they can

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.390
do that.

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.450
We get this on post a day.

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.300
I mean we get a lot of mistakes here right.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.530
So we want to be able to actually not have any of these problems and be able to allow users to make

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.980
comments.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.840
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to go to the database and we need to create another

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.860
table.

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.660
So we need to go to PH be my admin here click on see a mass and let's create a new table called comments.

15
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.790
C o m m e t s.

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.640
And here we're going to set seven rows.

17
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.440
All right.

18
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.520
And let's go ahead and do that right now.

19
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.110
The first row is going to be coming in ID

20
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.710
comment Id the second.

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.050
Well right here we need to set this up for us.

22
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.060
Hold on.

23
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.720
So integer three values and in that primary order increment always on the ID right.

24
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:34.100
Now the second would be comment comment post ID and this was going to have Also 3.

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.710
And that's not an order increment.

26
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.500
We're going to increment that by ourselves come and date.

27
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.650
And if you want to just copy this commenting and change that's fine you can do that comment.

28
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.220
And we're going to say that come in Arthur right or title.

29
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.250
No that's fine.

30
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.980
All is fine.

31
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.890
Right.

32
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.980
And the next one would be maybe the e-mail.

33
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.300
I mean we can't stand that we can come backing at tables if we wanted to.

34
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.340
I just want to set the most common table here.

35
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.120
All right.

36
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.820
So a comment a comment Id come in post Id come and older come and email what else we want from them.

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.330
What about the content content.

38
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.240
I think that's good.

39
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.490
What about the status re status.

40
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.230
What else do we need from a user.

41
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.260
So we had the comment Id comment Id come in post ID oh the date.

42
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.920
It's a very useful one actually to date.

43
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.450
All right.

44
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:56.320
So coming out of our car and that's 255 email Varg car 255 would do content that's come in status.

45
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.990
Let's just save our car and they just put to five.

46
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.760
This one is just a day.

47
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.660
And that's it.

48
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.570
We are done with it.

49
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.060
Actually let's just go ahead and save let's make sure everything is spelled correctly here.

50
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.320
All right.

51
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.090
And save it.

52
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.200
All right.

53
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.740
So all we need to do here is go back go and click answer.

54
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.750
Insert some data first because we want to be able to display something for now.

55
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:35.120
And just to see the thing that this is working in Id say 10 coming out or lasy say doing this email

56
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.800
is India.

57
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.590
India Come come in content.

58
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.130
This is just an example of general content.

59
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.920
Thank you.

60
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.680
Come in status.

61
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.830
We're going to say approved and come and date.

62
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.040
We're just going to say this day right here and that's it.

63
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.000
And we ignore whatever is below here if we wanted to add something else.

64
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.130
We will check this.

65
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.340
But right now we just need one.

66
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.600
Well that's fine.

67
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.620
I think we can do one too.

68
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.820
Perfect.

69
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.030
Now that we have created the table an insert of some data.

70
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.000
The next thing is to go and jump into the cold and do some BHB and some queries are right but we need

71
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.890
to build a form first.

72
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.120
All right.

73
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.050
Anyways thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture right.

74
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.820
Take care.
