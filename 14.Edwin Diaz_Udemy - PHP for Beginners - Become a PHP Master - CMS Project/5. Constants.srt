00:00:00,810  -->  00:00:06,390
All right welcome back on this video here we're going to be talking about Constance and Constance are

2

00:00:06,420  -->  00:00:12,780
dissenting as variables is like a container where we can put information in the right data but the only

3

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:14,700
difference is that it doesn't change.

4

00:00:14,720  -->  00:00:19,500
And well it does have another difference that we defined it with a function.

5

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:22,260
Now let me give you an example.

6

00:00:22,320  -->  00:00:24,440
You already know how we define a variable.

7

00:00:24,660  -->  00:00:31,780
And if I can get this BHB tag bright We know that we define a variable like this.

8

00:00:31,800  -->  00:00:37,020
Now if you don't know where I am and you are a little lost right now know that I just made a save as

9

00:00:37,320  -->  00:00:39,240
on blank that ph B.

10

00:00:39,570  -->  00:00:42,670
And I called a constant dot ph B.

11

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:43,710
That's all I did.

12

00:00:43,710  -->  00:00:49,020
I grabbed that blank that ph B file that you have in your course exercise files or you shall have it

13

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:50,470
in your working file.

14

00:00:50,490  -->  00:00:54,910
Now that you are using and I just read Aceves and renamed it.

15

00:00:54,910  -->  00:00:56,380
Constance dopy.

16

00:00:56,480  -->  00:01:03,550
All right just so so that you know so we know that variables have something like this.

17

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:09,150
They are like this and we can just go ahead and call them on the screen like this right we can just

18

00:01:09,150  -->  00:01:11,620
print them out and we have number 10 right.

19

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:16,440
This is how we define a variable dollar sign the name of the variable we assign it a value.

20

00:01:16,440  -->  00:01:23,040
Now Constance We need functions for constant we need this pre-built functions from PH B that they already

21

00:01:23,040  -->  00:01:24,660
defined for us.

22

00:01:24,660  -->  00:01:26,430
We need to actually use them.

23

00:01:26,580  -->  00:01:33,120
So we need to use the function to define these functions going to define a variable for for us.

24

00:01:33,130  -->  00:01:36,430
Well not a variable constant because it's constant.

25

00:01:36,450  -->  00:01:41,520
You can't change the value once you set the value of a constant you can't change it no matter what you

26

00:01:41,520  -->  00:01:42,280
do.

27

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:47,050
So I'm going to set a constant called name.

28

00:01:47,130  -->  00:01:49,090
I'm going to put the name in the first parameter.

29

00:01:49,090  -->  00:01:51,130
Takes is the name of the constant.

30

00:01:51,270  -->  00:01:54,520
The second divided by a coma is going to be the value.

31

00:01:54,540  -->  00:01:55,960
So I'm just going to name it.

32

00:01:55,960  -->  00:01:58,050
Are you going to give it a value of a thousand.

33

00:01:58,050  -->  00:02:01,240
I could also give it a value of a string if I wanted to.

34

00:02:01,560  -->  00:02:05,500
But in this case I was going to name that and give it the value of a thousand.

35

00:02:05,530  -->  00:02:05,960
Right.

36

00:02:06,150  -->  00:02:09,840
So I'm just going to echo this like this.

37

00:02:10,170  -->  00:02:16,890
As you can see I got a thousand there if we use a dot and it was concatenations here just to make it

38

00:02:18,980  -->  00:02:20,790
go to the next line you can see that.

39

00:02:20,790  -->  00:02:28,680
Now if I try changing this value here for some reason if I say name equals 2000 if I try doing that

40

00:02:29,370  -->  00:02:30,000
I get an error.

41

00:02:30,000  -->  00:02:30,930
Right.

42

00:02:31,560  -->  00:02:33,660
So I mean that is a problem right.

43

00:02:33,690  -->  00:02:36,570
Well it's actually not a problem is actually very good.

44

00:02:36,570  -->  00:02:41,290
We've got variables and we can do whatever we want with variables and we can change the value of a variable

45

00:02:41,310  -->  00:02:46,340
we can come here and say number is going to be equal to a thousand.

46

00:02:46,350  -->  00:02:55,890
Now when you see that and then we come back here again and change your variable name to say Edwyn.

47

00:02:55,950  -->  00:02:58,590
You see that what you can do that have with a constant.

48

00:02:58,620  -->  00:02:58,990
Right.

49

00:02:59,090  -->  00:03:04,740
So you just keep in mind that this is how we define a constant by using this function define the first

50

00:03:04,740  -->  00:03:06,130
parameter is the name.

51

00:03:06,180  -->  00:03:07,730
The second would be the value.

52

00:03:07,820  -->  00:03:08,400
All right.

53

00:03:08,700  -->  00:03:09,920
Thank you so much for watching.

54

00:03:09,990  -->  00:03:11,160
And I see you in the next lecture.

55

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:11,650
Take care
