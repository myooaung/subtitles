00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.030
Hi welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.800
This is Edwin again.

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.850
Now on this lecture here I'm going to show you a really cool functionality if you already have it.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.890
Figure it out.

5
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.170
Now even if we know we are logged in we can still see this log in form right now.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.960
It would be nice that if we log in to the or see a mass and we come back to this page you would display

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.600
something like logged in with a user name and a little button that we can log out.

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.980
Right.

9
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.660
That would be nice.

10
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.660
So let me show you what we are creating in this lecture.

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.120
Something like this.

12
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.150
Again we go back there you can see that he says are logged in as Ricos so he will display the user name

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.580
and it will give you a little logout button.

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.230
All right so that's what we're building.

15
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.550
So if you're ready to build this let's get to it.

16
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.830
Now the first thing that you should be doing right now is opening your editor because we are going to

17
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.300
be creating this.

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.080
All right.

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.310
So go to your sidebar because that's where our code will be right here.

20
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.480
All right includes.

21
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.130
And then cyber.

22
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.970
Are you ready.

23
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.420
All right.

24
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.130
So the first thing that we need to do is detect to see if some user rule was actually set.

25
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.200
We know that if we login they use a roll the session use are always going to be set.

26
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.100
Right so that's the that's the way that we know that we are logged in.

27
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.550
Right.

28
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.060
So we're going to open some again tagging and I use a shorthand version of the if statement.

29
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.980
All right.

30
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.680
This shorthand version is like this with a colon.

31
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.680
So if we are parenthesis like this then we're going to end it up right here so we can say and if and

32
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.030
then you see me using this many times you're going to put to use a semi-colon there because that means

33
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.760
we're done with this command.

34
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.730
All right.

35
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.710
So it's just cleaner to do it this way.

36
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.880
And then we are going to also create an L statement and we do it like this with a colon.

37
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.930
That means that we can still write more commands here.

38
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.570
Right.

39
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.950
All right perfect.

40
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:08.940
So here we're going to use a function set just to check if the session user always set right here like

41
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.750
this.

42
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.740
Right.

43
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.490
And then if we said we want to display something while we are going to be explaining something it could

44
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.390
be anything you want.

45
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.970
I'm just going to display a

46
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.790
H are you going to say you know what.

47
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.520
Logged in as.

48
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.140
And then I put some more ph beats X here because I'm going to be echoing something hecho Why do you

49
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.120
think we are going to be echoing here.

50
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.660
Well we can decode whatever we want but I'm going to be echoing the user name like this.

51
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.140
All right.

52
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.370
Very clean.

53
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.180
Very nice.

54
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.210
If you find if you're following me you're doing great.

55
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.210
So in the statement that means that we are not logged in right.

56
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.400
This is not set.

57
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.790
We're not logged in and we can display whatever we want.

58
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.420
But of course it would be nice to display this whole form right here.

59
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.130
So I'm going to cut that out.

60
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.800
I'm going to be sitting here right.

61
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.320
So that fits this a little bit

62
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.190
like that.

63
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.910
You can go ahead and play around with it a little bit more and fix it up however you want.

64
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.240
All right.

65
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.750
Anyway let's go and check this out real quick.

66
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.110
So let's refresh not the year let's log in and save you your file.

67
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.980
Please enter.

68
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.060
We go back and we can see that it says logged in that's Rico.

69
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.820
So it's beautifully working.

70
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.500
Let's go back and create that button there so we can create a button right below here that logout button.

71
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.260
Right.

72
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:59.280
So let's write a class here for this in Bootstrap BT end between hyphen primary and tab.

73
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:09.690
Because I'm using Emett and the link is going to being kluges to log out BHB page which is right here

74
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.240
log out you see it.

75
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.710
We need to go to this folder right here because this is getting included from there and it's all right

76
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.080
so includes logout that BHP.

77
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.990
And then we can write whatever we want.

78
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.400
I'm just going to write it well like this safe answer and now you have a beautiful button here that

79
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.290
when you click on it it's going to log you out so you can go to really go to Weidmann and you can do

80
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.430
this same thing for admin.

81
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.470
All right.

82
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.870
You might now want to show admen when you're logged in or something like diceware whatever you want.

83
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.380
You can use this functionality here to show different pages or different sections of you see a mass

84
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.130
depending if you are logged in or logged out.

85
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.260
Right.

86
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.300
So all that's going to help you extend your application to do better things.

87
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.760
Thank you so much guys.

88
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.950
And I love your support.

89
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.270
Thank you for those that always give reviews and take the time for that I really appreciate that really

90
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.670

91
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.680
And you guys are awesome.

92
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.740
Seriously thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures.
