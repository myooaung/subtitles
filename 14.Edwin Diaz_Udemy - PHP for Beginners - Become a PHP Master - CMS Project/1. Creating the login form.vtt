00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.460
Hi welcome back.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.310
I hope you are really excited.

3
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.500
Well this section here we're going to be creating the log in functionalities of the CMOS is going to

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.030
be great.

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.040
We're going at a logging in right here.

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.340
We're going to process the form check the database for users or passwords and then depending on that.

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.460
So we're going to either redirect the user to the admin or redirect them back to index page.

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.300
Now before we go on I want to I just want to say congratulations because if you made it this far you

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.180
are different from 95 percent of the people out there.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.940
A lot of people give up and they don't see it through the end.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.460
If you see this through the end you're going to see the fruit of your hard work because right now what

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.110
you're doing is dedicating your time to something that is very valuable and is going to give you a lot

13
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.700
of things in the future.

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.390
Positive things.

15
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.970
Knowledge is power and what development can change your life.

16
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.220
But anyway let me not keep going about that I get too poetic anyways.

17
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.420
So the first thing that we're going to be doing is creating the sidebar here right.

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.320
So again I'm super happy for you that you made it this far.

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.860
But we've got to keep going.

20
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.300
Right.

21
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.170
So let's go to the sidebar.

22
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.920
Let's go to the root directory on your see a mass and if you don't know where you are.

23
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.020
Let me give me one.

24
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.160
Give me one second let me take you back there just to make sure that we are on the same page.

25
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.820
All right.

26
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.440
So we're going to see a mass and you're going to be right here in the room when I say rude.

27
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.600
This is where you are.

28
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.690
And then we go to includes And we're going to get to sidebar OK.

29
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.660
So let me just take that off since we don't need it.

30
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.450
Right.

31
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.070
So we're going to go includes sidebar in here.

32
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.820
We're going to be building the little logo form that we need.

33
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.470
All right.

34
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.540
We're going to be doing this by copy and paste in this blog search.

35
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.670
We already got it right here right.

36
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.020
Why.

37
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.900
Why write all that code when we have the basic structure right here the markup so I'm going to call

38
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.620
this log in of course.

39
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.130
All right.

40
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.820
And now we've got to do a little couple of modifications here because this is going to be a logging

41
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.780
for form.

42
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.710
And we're going to take people we haven't build this page yet but we're going to take them to includes

43
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.990
the logging forums are going to be in site includes And it's going to be called Logan ph.

44
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.130
Of course the Met is going to be post form group is fine.

45
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.360
This input we need to change and we need to change the input to tell us find search.

46
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:33.260
No this is going to be the user name and we're probably going to put a placeholder here let's just add

47
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.980
a placeholder.

48
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.200
I'm going to put this form all the way to the left there so that way you can see what I'm doing.

49
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.820
So let's put a placeholder.

50
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.250
I'm going to do it right after the class right here.

51
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:55.120
Placeholder and I'm just going to say enter name enter user name user name.

52
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.440
All right.

53
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.090
And this is for input group input group is too big.

54
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.320
All right so I'm just going to take this button right here.

55
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.890
Search.

56
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.860
So I'm just going to take that out.

57
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.560
All right.

58
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.290
And see how that looks right now.

59
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.590
Let's go to the front of the Silas refresh it and we see that we have this blocked search.

60
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.360
We've got to change the title and we need to change a couple of things so they then put there used to

61
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.220
make it look nice.

62
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.300
All right.

63
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.800
All right.

64
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.990
So remember that all this classes this is a framework that I'm using called Bootstrap and I have another

65
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.150
course on that Bootstrap which shows you how to make a responsive Wes's applications very easily with

66
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.890
this framework.

67
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.520
Right.

68
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.230
But we already have the framework installed.

69
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.750
So we just got to make some of this work.

70
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.130
So so we have this input here.

71
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.260
Let's do another input group right.

72
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.660
Let's call this save that let's call it Logan.

73
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.050
All right so this type is going to be password array

74
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:18.290
password and names are going to be password to placeholder is going to be password into password.

75
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.310
All right.

76
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.940
All right.

77
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.730
So let's let's check that out and see how it looks.

78
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.460
And we need to change the input group.

79
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.960
We need to give this whole thing a a form group that's a whole.

80
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.180
That's the whole reason why this is actually not looking good.

81
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.950
Because it has something called the input group and we don't we don't need to improve Garou right here.

82
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.800
All right.

83
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.040
But anyway let's go back and check on this.

84
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.390
She looks all right.

85
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.990
Her eyes started to look a little better now but we still need to try to work it really good.

86
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.550
Right.

87
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:05.370
So now that we have this what we need to do is add I'm going to change this poor girl to one group right

88
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.410
here this class and let's see how that looks.

89
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.010
Now refresh now that stands all the way across OK that's why we won here on this one.

90
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.430
All right.

91
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.140
The one below we're going to do a little something a little different there.

92
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.060
All right now on top let's just leave it like that.

93
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.680
Right.

94
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.120
So on this one here just going to make this a little smaller so that I can work with it.

95
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.180
Here we can add a couple of things I don't want you to get to Los on on what I'm going to do right because

96
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.260
it might look a little bit that's for you but it's not just the little framework that I use and all

97
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.560
you have to do is basically copy what I'm doing right now.

98
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.280
All right.

99
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:54.430
So we're going to be adding a spam right here and say this one.

100
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.610
All right.

101
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.200
And the spam we're going to be adding a class of show you right now.

102
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.850
Class of input group Betty.

103
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.710
All right.

104
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.150
We're going to be what we want to do is we want to create a button right here on the right side.

105
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.000
It's going to be stuck to this field right here.

106
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.670
Right.

107
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.580
And again this is using a framework.

108
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.460
All right so now that we have that we're going to we need to create a button right here.

109
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.230
And of course we need to put a couple things on the button first we need to give the button a class

110
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.030
so to make it look good.

111
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.830
Couple of classes actually.

112
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.370
So VTAM and then VTM primary.

113
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.720
Right then we need to give a little attribute because we need to know that we need to receive this somewhere

114
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.510
else so we're going to give it in that review of and then the name Actually you to give it a value of

115
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.870
luck getting it right.

116
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.770
And this is going to be a types of Mitt.

117
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.510
Make sure you put that type in there make sure that we know is a button there right.

118
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:15.020
All right so that's that's all we've got to do for this one here and that's it.

119
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.630
That's about it.

120
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.860
That's what we need for this and a little spam right here another issue another spam.

121
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:29.510
And let's give this a class of actually this and let's not even class let's just say call submit submit

122
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.260
that's fine.

123
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.730
I think we're good to go we are golden.

124
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.160
See how that looks now.

125
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.230
All right refresh perfect.

126
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.970
Look at that.

127
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.200
Looking good right.

128
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.700
And we just did that with a little with this framework.

129
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:52.280
Now if you want to do that VSC says doing it yourself you know that takes a long time to write with

130
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.350
it it's like within two minutes right.

131
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.960
All right.

132
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.500
Perfect.

133
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:01.700
So now we have the form here and we are sending it to the include.

134
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.710
So when we click on it let's just check it out click on it.

135
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.140
He sends us to enclose Logan up here.

136
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:13.290
So we are done creating the form in front of it in front of the site on the next lecture we're going

137
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:19.740
to be continuing this and creating the rest of the day for that we need to process some of these BHB

138
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:25.080
that's going to come some of these values that are going on that are going through this form right here.

139
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.590
Right.

140
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.040
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I see you the next one.

141
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.630
Take care.
