1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.460
Great the time has come for us to start writing some Ph.D..

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.710
All right but before we do that let's go to our root directory.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.360
Make a short cut and put on a desktop because we need to put files there all the time and I don't want

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.880
to be traveling from applications or programs whatever operating system you are.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.380
I don't want to be traveling a long way to find this folder.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.200
We've got to find this for this for the Right now in Mac.

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.610
If you are in a Mac you can find it in your Applications folder and it's going to be HD docs.

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.980
OK.

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.600
That's the folder that we're going to be placing our courses Course Lectures and files all that stuff

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.130
is going to be right here.

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.850
All right.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.080
Now for Windows users go to you go to your programs go to zap your C drive you should.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.630
You should find zap when you find them.

14
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.220
I think it's computer C drive and then zap ending the docs OK I think I show you that when we were installing

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.720
zap.

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.160
But anyways find that create a shortcut.

17
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.260
I'm going to make an alias because that's the way you create a shortcut in Mac.

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.570
You rightly can create an alias that they they name it different needs a whole different animal.

19
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.020
Right.

20
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.390
Just click it for Windows and create a shortcut and drag it to your desktop.

21
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.790
Right.

22
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.860
So now that we have this here we can go ahead and just click it and go straight to our root directory

23
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.490
and this is where we're going to be putting all files.

24
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.550
So right.

25
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.730
What I'm going to do right now is I'm just going to open or coeditor just open it up and of course we're

26
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.200
going to have some files on the full files and I'm going to go back to the dogs here.

27
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.860
I'm going to right clicking and going to create a new folder called Demel.

28
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.750
This is going to be where or if files are going to be right.

29
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.640
So we are going to drag this here and now this is going to create worry about that going to create a

30
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.580
new project for us here or files are going to be listed right here going down.

31
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.700
I'm going to click on this and I'm going to say in bed.

32
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.100
I'm going to make a new file or embed might be a HP.

33
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.690
Now how do we start writing Ph.

34
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.760
All right well very simple We have an opening tag LHD a mail in a closing tag.

35
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.170
This is the opening tag for BHB less than symbol questionmark and then the key word ph be this is going

36
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.440
to open it up knows a Apache right now.

37
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.980
Whatever you see after this render it as Pietsch be called you know BHB cold here and then when you

38
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.520
finish a PH BE call your command that you need to close that with a semi-colon.

39
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.570
Very important.

40
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.520
Every time you finish a command you need to close a you need to let people know that you are done with

41
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.810
this command and you might write other commands here.

42
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.600
So this is what a semi-colon is.

43
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.360
I'm done with this command.

44
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.320
That's it.

45
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.110
Apache.

46
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.200
I'm done with it.

47
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.430
That's what it means.

48
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.850
Now this one here is the closing tag for BHB.

49
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.280
All right.

50
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.720
So if we don't have anything here that would be the closing right that usually does what you write it

51
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.320
you put it down all the way down and you write your speech be code here and then you put the semi-colon

52
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.130
and you're done.

53
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.670
And then you write some more ph be called down here with a semi-colon semicolon means stop this command

54
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.680
right here and then you can write whatever the command after and close the command.

55
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.190
Also this one closes all the command and right and then after this goes the mail.

56
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.960
So you can insert disengage the mail right now just the way it is.

57
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.810
Another thing is that whitespace really doesn't matter in BHP.

58
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.760
You can pull all this in one line.

59
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.560
You can bring this all the way down.

60
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.140
You can pull this called here is called here as long as you have a semi-colon there.

61
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.800
You're good to go.

62
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.530
You can put a call like that but of course we're not going to do that because it looks bad right.

63
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.580
Just to let you in that it really doesn't matter.

64
00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.890
All right.

65
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.310
I know things that you will see BHB cold reading like this.

66
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.130
Leave this there.

67
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.800
You will see.

68
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.840
You will see like this.

69
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.620
That's a shorthand version and you will see it like this right here.

70
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.300
UCLA is right this other formats that you will see BHB.

71
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.150
These are this is that form the reasoning is even.

72
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.360
Even though is easier to write like this.

73
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.660
Now all computers not all servers or Apache servers would be this would be turned on them will not be

74
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.650
turned on on them.

75
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.620
You have to manually go to BHB die and I found turn this on.

76
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.540
So for example let's say you write a plug in for president or Drupal.

77
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.150
When when you become a programmer.

78
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.630
Right.

79
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.160
And if you write in this way that people that have a server they have Apache running and they don't

80
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.210
how if they don't have it turn on.

81
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.640
This would not work.

82
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.200
This would not work and this would not work.

83
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.290
Right so you cold all of a sudden does now work in many people's computers or servers or web sites or

84
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.310
applications.

85
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.260
It would not work.

86
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.360
So this would work everywhere.

87
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.490
HP is available by default.

88
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.760
All right it will always work.

89
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.150
So that's why it is bad form right.

90
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.170
That's one one thing there and I wanted to also explain to you that if you have another file here for

91
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.220
example the example that a mail

92
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.330
and for some reason you try to put some BHB courting here.

93
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.250
It will now work.

94
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.000
You can go ahead and try right now but this would not display.

95
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.900
It would not it would now rended PH BE sense.

96
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.350
This does not have a dot ph B extension.

97
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.940
You see a patch looks at this and says you know what this is the amount whatever is in this file is

98
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.680
actually a male and not going to even look for BHB.

99
00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:02.070
But when you tell Apache when you put the extensions here that BHB you're telling Apache that this file

100
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.760
here might include some BHB so be on the lookout for BHB Abaci you will see something there.

101
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.080
That's what you're telling me.

102
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.620
Patchi when you when you have a BHB extension.

103
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.360
Right.

104
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:21.670
So always make sure that you put your that BHP stanching if you want your file to actually work right.

105
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.660
So now that we have that how do we look up files right how do we we see them on the screen let me write

106
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.440
a simple function here or it embedded ph be here.

107
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.540
And this is called an echo.

108
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.580
This function here is going to print out tetes on the screen right now is going to say hello.

109
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.340
Student.

110
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.200
There we go.

111
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.310
And if I can write it and then we close it with a semicolon G's then we don't save it.

112
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.370
That's what you're going to do is going to this is going to Eckel.

113
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.290
All right he's going to print something out.

114
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.000
We put in double Quarter we can put single quotes.

115
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:03.090
That's how we write strings right in strings I mean tetes and that's the term that we use in programming

116
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.360
string.

117
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.670
All right.

118
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.010
And then we close it with a semicolon with close and BHB tags there.

119
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.070
So I'm going to click on this little.

120
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.710
I can hear.

121
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:21.070
For those that have brackets and as you can see there we can see that it is.

122
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.710
Hello student.

123
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.510
Now this might not work for some of you because I already set up mine but I'm going to help you set

124
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.710
it up right now if you click this it might give you a window to tell you how to you know to set the

125
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:41.890
base of this right the base directory of this and just close that body and go to file project settings

126
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.240
and then he'll find your setting then put this down.

127
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.140
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.890
Poor poor be calling for Slash for Slash local holes.

129
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.820
And then the name of your father where your files are going to be and click done and then go ahead and

130
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:07.920
close whatever browser you have on if he's not working you close it and go ahead and turn this on again.

131
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.360
All right.

132
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:17.250
Turn it on again when you're is working or if you want to go ahead in it for some reason is not working.

133
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.660
Just go to your local host

134
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.920
right here and that's going to direct you to zap right.

135
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.670
Because he has an issue that's there.

136
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.240
What he's doing is directing us redirecting us back to this folder.

137
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:39.750
I'm going to take this farther off and going to type in the folder name and and I click enter in as

138
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.260
you can see here this is the end of them.

139
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.590
And here we've got two files.

140
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.620
The embed that BHP and that example that HDMI is going to show you the example.

141
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:55.620
There is nothing there and we have some BHP there but if it doesn't work well let's just put a function

142
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.040
here real quick just to show you hello.

143
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.600
There we go.

144
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.900
And the FI refresh doesn't work.

145
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:10.170
Let me show you if I right click on it this is Google Chrome by the way if I click on this and choose

146
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.400
View Source we can see that ph be there but he's now rendering.

147
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.380
Let's put some NHT of mail here and you're going to put a H-1 tag.

148
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.270
And no.

149
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.640
All right refresh and we can see that that's work.

150
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.340
Let's take this view source.

151
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.500
Let's open this in

152
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.610
let's go to the demo there and go to the example the mountain we can see the H-1.

153
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:46.650
But if we click on it and we check on view source we can see that it should be there but he's now working

154
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.840
so it doesn't work with the Deitsch the mail.

155
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.040
Make sure you have that that ph in there.

156
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.810
Right.

157
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.860
Another thing I want you to install if you use in brackets is an extension called Emma.

158
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.360
And this is really really easy to install.

159
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:06.600
Go to your file tab here click on extension manager.

160
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:14.790
Here we can still many different plug ins for exactly for these coeditor and type in e m m d t Emett.

161
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:15.830
Right.

162
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.590
I already have it in stores so this is going to be great out.

163
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.910
But you're going to have a little button like this here.

164
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.580
Is going to sing stold just clicking any will store this automatically.

165
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.410
The reason why I want you to install that is because it's going to make you a better programmer.

166
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.760
Let me tell you why you got to be a lot more productive when you actually use this.

167
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.880
Now that you have it installed right.

168
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.810
I want you to put an exclamation there with a shift key and you press number one on your keyboard.

169
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.980
And then after the exclamation there you put your cursor here and you press on tab.

170
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.700
Look at that.

171
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.660
We roll all this code just by doing that.

172
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.920
And we can do many different things with it.

173
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.740
So that's one of the reasons I want you to do that.

174
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.720
So let's say for example I have something here.

175
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:03.450
Class what to do with a class and them more than one and put you well there and then you show you the

176
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.100
power of this.

177
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.660
You might think we're in there was he doing.

178
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.320
Well look at this.

179
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.730
All right.

180
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.640
This is the type of things that we will do.

181
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.750
Now I won't do this all the time sense and if I do.

182
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.050
For those of you that don't have this code or I will wait for you.

183
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.220
All right so I will wait for you to write this and I will go slowly so don't worry about me writing

184
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.250
code too fast.

185
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:32.610
I just want my students that downloaded brackets to know that this is available to them if they want

186
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.190
to.

187
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.930
Right.

188
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.850
Anyway thank you so much for watching this video here.

189
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.150
Let's go to the next lecture.

190
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.720
I want to show you some more BHB
