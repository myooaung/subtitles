1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,140
All right so we are able to approve and approve comments.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:11,780
Now I did maybe make a little change here that I want you to make is that I added a d here to this status

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,290
here.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,590
I'm going to show you exactly what I did that and the way I did the deeds because when the status comes

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,710
here and we approve it I should be in the past tense right.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,840
So I went to you all comments where we were working on.

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,190
And I changed it right here on this two queries when we are getting the key and changing the status

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,820
to approved.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,720
And this one to own approved.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,230
We did.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,360
That's all I'm doing.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:40,980
All right.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,540
So make sure that you update those fields.

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:51,570
Now what we want to do is we want to go to the post page here and we want to take a couple of pieces

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,230
of the comments actually called out.

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,880
So what I want to do is stay with this one here and everything else just throw it out.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,210
All right.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,750
And this is going to be the comments right here.

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,280
He's going to throw out this part right here done.

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,350
So we go back and we see this.

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,640
Right click on it and let's go to that page.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,080
We can see that come in right here.

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,910
Well that's not the original comment but it's specific to this post but it is a placeholder.

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,910
That's what we want.

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,870
All right so now let's go ahead and make the Querrey.

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,550
I'm not going to write the whole code because I already wrote it down.

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,040
But we explain every little detail.

28
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,930
So what we're going to be doing is doing a Querrey just to select everything phone from where comments

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,640
right.

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,280
So let me just copy and paste that cold right here and then to show you it's just a Querrey as you can

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,810
see right here.

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,870
All right.

33
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,830
And I will break that loop right here because we're going to pull some makes milk comment.

34
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,310
Cold inside the loop.

35
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,040
So that way we can get some of this values out there.

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,940
So and I'm going to explain right now exactly what's going on.

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,780
So let's get this cold right there in the middle right here.

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,450
This one we don't want to get this here because that's the whole column and we'll break the HDL code

39
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,010
if we do that if we get that little deaf and deaf there.

40
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,670
Right.

41
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,510
This is the

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,790
column up here.

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,750
You see that.

44
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,000
All right

45
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,030
so now that we're here let me explain what we were doing.

46
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,570
So very simple.

47
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,030
We select everything.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,630
That's what actually means and you know that from comments where common post ID.

49
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,130
All right.

50
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:06,200
This is what the the the column in that table that has the pulse ID.

51
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,360
All right equals to the post ID of here.

52
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:20,790
See that we are getting it as a get request from you are all on the page right here and we are converting

53
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,380
it to that variable and then we are using it down here.

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,220
That's all we are doing right here.

55
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,960
And then we saying we using another statement called and and this is just a condition right and common

56
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,320
standard is that's another column in the table equals approved.

57
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,090
Actually we need to change it to the D because we already changed made that change.

58
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,780
Right.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,270
And then we use another statement right here.

60
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,750
And another excuse statement saying order by comment ID which is a column.

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,990
Right.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,330
That's the common ID column descending meanings.

63
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,600
Again I give us the newest comments first on top.

64
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,210
All right well it's going to give us a new idea on top.

65
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,980
All right.

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,800
And then here we just sending it would that would send him back where he is and we are checking here

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,490
in the next line.

68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,770
We've already done that.

69
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,030
We we're running the loop right here to get so much information out and we get in the coming days the

70
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,280
content and the altar here.

71
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,520
We are going to be that information right here.

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,710
We're going to be this plane the other.

73
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,150
OK.

74
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,850
So let's get that right there.

75
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,940
Oops he's made another copy here at my keyboard.

76
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,690
And let's just go ahead and copy this one to this and put the day right here.

77
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,140
And let's take this out and we'll do the comments right here.

78
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,750
The content.

79
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,580
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,440
Well a comment symtab right content.

81
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,280
All right let's go ahead and check it out and see what happens.

82
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,960
We have the placeholder here.

83
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,190
I refresh here on top.

84
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:15,520
We get the comments here but we don't we're not getting the content itself actually come in content.

85
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,500
We are having a issue because we are not echoing anything.

86
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,480
Hey make sure you echo that.

87
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,360
If not you're not going to get anything.

88
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,420
Right.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,660
Let's go ahead and do that.

90
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,540
All right so we're getting some information.

91
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,130
All right.

92
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,560
So as you can see here we're getting some of this.

93
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,520
And just to show you that it is actually telling me it's actually giving us information from the news

94
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:38,850
coming.

95
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,260
Let's go ahead and make a comment.

96
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,090
I'm going to say the author of this right now has one.

97
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:53,220
Let's call this make a comment with Peter and it's for the Peter information here.

98
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,900
Peter already got press there.

99
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:09,440
And whenever she mail come and this is just another piece of comment.

100
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:17,760
Is just another this this is just another piece of comment Perfect's of Mitt.

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,910
And it's not showing here because it's not approved.

102
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,990
Let's go to admin and prove it.

103
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,090
Let's see if we got it right here let's just refresh this.

104
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,170
And we need to also play the order of descending right here.

105
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,330
This one used to show the newest on top right.

106
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,010
Let's approve it approved.

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,670
Let's go to the specific polls and then I right click and go there let's go and check it out.

108
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,160
As you can see here this is just another piece of comment.

109
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,980
Let's let's actually approved and see what happens.

110
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:59,680
Let's go back to admen comments and approve it and approve everything and see what do we get.

111
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,860
Let's go back refresh.

112
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
We didn't get any comments at all right.

113
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,340
Beautiful.

114
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,900
All right so we are done with a section here.

115
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,620
Hopefully you got some valuable information and I'll see you the next lecture.

116
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,470
Take care.
