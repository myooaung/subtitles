00:00:00,700  -->  00:00:06,360
How my students welcome back in this lecture here we are going to be adding some functionality to this

2

00:00:06,370  -->  00:00:08,460
button right here right now if I click on it.

3

00:00:08,470  -->  00:00:13,710
It's going to take me to a page that does not receive this information.

4

00:00:13,710  -->  00:00:17,070
All right so let's go ahead and fix this.

5

00:00:17,070  -->  00:00:22,260
Let's go to our co-editor and this is getting kind of crowded here isn't it.

6

00:00:22,260  -->  00:00:28,700
So I'm just going to delete a couple of things here ladies right.

7

00:00:28,740  -->  00:00:30,180
You know we don't delete the files.

8

00:00:30,180  -->  00:00:31,520
This is just the leading.

9

00:00:31,620  -->  00:00:42,000
Well we've got in our walking file section so on just clicking this a lot here I want you to do the

10

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:45,400
same where you have like a cleaning area that you can work on.

11

00:00:45,450  -->  00:00:49,510
Now what I want you to do is go to admin underscored navigation.

12

00:00:49,770  -->  00:00:57,240
And here mine or my site is lined a 47.

13

00:00:57,240  -->  00:01:03,480
This is a type of part that I want to take from here since we already have this link right here and

14

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:07,650
that's the link that we are going to be airing right here because we want this to go to this page right

15

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:08,000
here.

16

00:01:08,000  -->  00:01:09,520
If I add post.

17

00:01:09,900  -->  00:01:11,450
That's what we wanted to do.

18

00:01:11,550  -->  00:01:12,060
OK.

19

00:01:12,120  -->  00:01:14,130
Just to make it easier on us.

20

00:01:14,130  -->  00:01:22,700
All right so let's go back and we are in admen underscore navigation that BHB and that includes filing

21

00:01:22,710  -->  00:01:24,510
at me right in the main folder.

22

00:01:24,540  -->  00:01:31,090
So I just going to copy this link to be honest with you right here just a source.

23

00:01:31,400  -->  00:01:31,950
Here we go.

24

00:01:31,950  -->  00:01:41,190
I'm going to go back to to view all posts inside including admen and then double click it to have it

25

00:01:41,190  -->  00:01:43,280
appear so that I can play around with it.

26

00:01:43,890  -->  00:01:49,550
And I'm going to go to that for me is 85.

27

00:01:50,100  -->  00:01:54,620
And this is where I want to go ahead and paste that piece of coal there right.

28

00:01:54,810  -->  00:01:57,080
You make it bigger for you so you can see where I am.

29

00:01:57,250  -->  00:02:02,670
Sometimes what you can do if you can't find this area right here because we have a lot of cold just

30

00:02:02,820  -->  00:02:07,300
press Command F and that's going to open this window here for you to look for.

31

00:02:07,380  -->  00:02:08,870
So you can look at this document.

32

00:02:09,000  -->  00:02:14,630
So they say I want to find this area I just say you know what this button right here.

33

00:02:15,060  -->  00:02:18,050
Let me go back so I can show you these bone dry years.

34

00:02:18,090  -->  00:02:20,770
It has a value of add Neal right that we added to it.

35

00:02:20,940  -->  00:02:29,040
So I would just press command C F to open the Finder or command or control F for Windows users.

36

00:02:29,070  -->  00:02:30,160
Remember I'm mean a Mac.

37

00:02:30,180  -->  00:02:30,500
OK.

38

00:02:30,510  -->  00:02:33,910
So every time I say command for Windows users it's control.

39

00:02:33,930  -->  00:02:40,230
So press command for control F and then look for that button there for that key word as new as you can

40

00:02:40,230  -->  00:02:43,870
see it highlights a way when we find it.

41

00:02:43,870  -->  00:02:45,290
All right.

42

00:02:45,300  -->  00:02:50,890
So make sure that you pays that you are out right here.

43

00:02:51,140  -->  00:02:51,740
OK.

44

00:02:51,780  -->  00:02:52,500
Save it.

45

00:02:52,500  -->  00:02:55,990
Go back to it and let's check it out to see if it works.

46

00:02:56,200  -->  00:02:58,800
This refresh it and add new.

47

00:02:58,830  -->  00:03:00,280
Perfect.

48

00:03:00,300  -->  00:03:00,590
All right.

49

00:03:00,590  -->  00:03:06,940
Now we have that possibility from that site also besides this functionality right here right.

50

00:03:07,890  -->  00:03:11,910
We also have working out a new polls from there.

51

00:03:11,910  -->  00:03:12,510
Perfect.

52

00:03:12,510  -->  00:03:13,180
All right.

53

00:03:13,320  -->  00:03:14,640
I think we're done with this.

54

00:03:14,640  -->  00:03:17,460
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

55

00:03:17,460  -->  00:03:17,990
Keep it up.

56

00:03:18,000  -->  00:03:19,170
You're doing fine.

57

00:03:19,170  -->  00:03:24,660
Just take it one step at a time and you should be able to learn a lot more in this course.

58

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:25,130
Take care
