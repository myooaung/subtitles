1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,070
All right welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,160
So in the last lecture we had a little difficulty because we were able to see the user or the author

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,300
right here right.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,220
So why do you think the next step is hopefully you were able to fix it.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,090
If not then we'll debug it together and learn how to be better developers.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,570
All right.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,470
So the first thing I think and actually I know is to check to see what's going on in the database right.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,930
So let's go to our post table and let's check the user pulse user column.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,360
We can see that there is nothing here.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,670
If you have a lot of pools make sure that you have this 500 available as you can see actually is.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,610
We do have the idea of the user.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,310
All right so choose me.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,470
We got one and three.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:56,820
So we know that user ID 1 and 3 have been our you know being sort of there but we're not actually displaying

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,990
them here in the view of.

16
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,600
So we need to figure out what's going on.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,840
So this is working our outpolls is working.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,070
Let's find out what's going on here.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,880
All right.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:17,210
So that was we can see here we we're saying if he said The Post alter or or if is not empty then will

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,090
echo outpolls order.

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,550
All right.

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,490
If not we acquired palsy user.

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,800
So let's just double click here and we can see that we are actually pulling out that information.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,400
So the next step would be to test you know any of them.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,760
Let me actually as a matter of fact I think our team is actually working just because sometimes our

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,410
mistakes can be so simple.

28
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:51,290
Let me go ahead and show you our mistakes can be so simple as just to now really looking at information.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,980
Basically you can.

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,410
What I'm trying to say is is that we can make mistakes that really you know are not mistakes.

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:05,970
And let me show you what I think might be the problem so I'm going to go to the polls here and sometimes

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
I was just making sure that it is not nowhere here.

33
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,510
And I can see that there is no user name Rico anywhere.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,470
So I thought that maybe it was showing somewhere else and just because I didn't see here you know.

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,330
But anyway it could be as simple as you are looking at the right information.

36
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,200
All right so sometimes we don't make mistakes and we think we have.

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,290
So anyway I mean you should too much.

38
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:40,920
Let's go ahead and what I'm going to do I'm going to take all this out and let's see if this post user

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,860
is displaying I'm going to save it.

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,330
Come back here and enter.

41
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,530
So we are actually airing the Post's user.

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,720
All right but we're getting the idea of course we need to pull out the name of it right now we need

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,820
to find out why our condition is not working and this is what we're going to be doing is structuring

44
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,830
our condition differently.

45
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,260
So what I did was command Z or control Z.

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,870
All right.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,060
So what we're going to do is I'm going to check to see if we use this condition year if if it works

48
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,820
better.

49
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,270
All right.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,630
If it's 90 Acqui So enter and now we get it.

51
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,390
All right.

52
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,630
So we are actually getting that.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,650
Let's just make sure that we get the name right.

54
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:39,230
So what we need to do is actually insert the name of it instead of the ID right here.

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,290
All right.

56
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,850
We could do this two different ways.

57
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,300
All right.

58
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,390
We send the ID of the user and we pull it out through here with make another query right here.

59
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,690
Right.

60
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,230
Or we could send the user name here.

61
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,320
So you right now super simple

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,270
safe

63
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,430
right now when we add new polls it's not going to show right here on these two and these new ones here.

64
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,210
But we could do it right here.

65
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,130
So let's.

66
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,050
Actually it's from adding in polls.

67
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,610
So let's say tests one Giaours.

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,880
We're going to leave it as Rico publish and choose a file most of and put post here.

69
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:44,310
Key word and content or whatever publish you added more posts as you can see.

70
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:51,520
Right now we are displaying the user right here where I explain everything as it should.

71
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,310
And if it was author then we will be displaying the altar.

72
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,850
Right.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,450
So let's go ahead and check to see if polls.

74
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,060
Let's check to see if the author is actually working right.

75
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,350
So I'm going to go ahead and go to.

76
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,850
I don't know.

77
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,390
This falls right here.

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,380
That's making new polls from actually our polls although he's not going to work anymore.

79
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,400
We are actually now using that functionality.

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,170
All right.

81
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,300
If we make a comment then we can see the author of that comment right here.

82
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,670
All right.

83
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,720
So that would be somebody from outside.

84
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,780
We're not going to be using the polls all through here anymore.

85
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,000
It is going to be user now.

86
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,360
All right.

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,200
So let's change that alter thing that could confuse us the alter keyword and let's change it for user

88
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,770
because only users can make polls.

89
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:45,900
User

90
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,280
safe and now user.

91
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,510
Now one last thing that we need to do is we need to go to our home site right here make sure that we

92
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,920
are displaying the right information.

93
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,830
So let's go ahead and check that out real quick.

94
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,860
Let's go to.

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,160
Let's just minimize all of this stuff here.

96
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,660
Make sure that we go to far in that.

97
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:22,590
And here instead of post alter we're fetching the post user and post user.

98
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,070
You need to of they were whatever you are actually explain the user or using it.

99
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,420
All right.

100
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,560
One good thing of doing it.

101
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:38,580
I mean one good way of doing it would be to do a command F to check for everything that says author

102
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,180
here.

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,200
As you can see we have some information.

104
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,330
They are actually going here said that we need to upgrade.

105
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,080
All right.

106
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,270
So I to do that the next lecture because this is going to take me some time.

107
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,870
Basically this information here if I click on it it's going to take me to all the polls me by Miguel

108
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,570
for example.

109
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,140
All right.

110
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,580
So we need to upgrade that too where he says all the posts made by this specific user.

111
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,040
All right.

112
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,850
So we'll do that in the next lecture.

113
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,750
Take care.
