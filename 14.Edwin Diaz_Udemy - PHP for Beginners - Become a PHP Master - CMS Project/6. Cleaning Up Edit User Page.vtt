00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.380
All right we'll come back with your students.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.110
So in this lecture what I want to do is I want to clean up the code a little more and I also want to

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.110
add a feature where if we don't have a news user here then what we're going to do is we're going to

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.320
redirect back the user back to admin.

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.640
All right.

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.830
Because that's what we want.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.210
All right.

8
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.970
And let's let's check it out.

9
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.310
So let's go to Ed on this core user and we have this condition right here and it ends right here.

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.620
So I'm going to grab this bracket.

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.930
Cut it out and put it all the way down here right below this one.

12
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.590
All right.

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.450
And basically what I'm going to do is create a nail statement here and I mean you can create whatever

14
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.680
condition you want you can create create a Nelse if and check for a couple of dates.

15
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.320
Check if it's empty.

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.380
Or you know in this case we're just going to check the opposite of good user.

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.670
Basically we don't have a ID.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.230
All right a key edit user that we're going to redirect back so to that.

19
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.470
So let's do a head or

20
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.220
and location.

21
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.780
We're going to redirect back to that BHB.

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.380
All right.

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.210
So let's test it out let's see if it works.

24
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.900
So I'll answer as you can see if we get redirected back here.

25
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.500
Right.

26
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.400
So that's one way of doing it.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.930
And let me see something else

28
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.640
connoting is that

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.270
I think right here we have a little bubu.

30
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.350
So we're going to clean that up a little bit because right now what we're doing is we send in the query

31
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.380
and it works.

32
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.110
I mean we're sending this variable here and it works because we are finding Querrey already here.

33
00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.890
Right.

34
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.790
And but we want to have the right one right.

35
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.550
So you have this guy right here.

36
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.270
So basically we didn't even have to get this right we can you send a query right like this here right.

37
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.910
And that's right.

38
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.130
But let's just make it the right way.

39
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.930
That's fine.

40
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.930
All right.

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.290
Hey guys this is different from the future.

42
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.880
I'm just interrupting the lecture here real quick because I want to make sure that you guys you know

43
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.210
are up to date with things.

44
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.520
OK.

45
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.860
So in the profile page and I know you find the user page that's OK.

46
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.870
We're in the profile page.

47
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.030
Make sure that your password feel is not displaying any data.

48
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.010
Also make sure in the edit page for the edit user that you're not displaying any data because if you

49
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.870
are when you click update without touching anything here is going to update the hash password.

50
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.060
We talked a little bit about this before.

51
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.890
I don't know if I said it too fast and you missed it but that's what it is and maybe later on in the

52
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.550
course I will also remind you of that but make sure for those of you that are paying attention that

53
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.830
this is not there.

54
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:16.420
Also make sure that in the profile you don't have select you know select user or anything like that.

55
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.680
OK.

56
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.070
You don't want that there.

57
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.280
So what I'm going to do first of all I'm going to in the edit page let's go to Ed and Page who makes

58
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.680
sure that in the form we don't have a value for the password.

59
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.750
OK let's just take that.

60
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.520
You see that's commented on already so we did that in the course.

61
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.870
Well let's just take that out completely.

62
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.280
And I want to add autocomplete off here just to make sure that when users type in the form and the input

63
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.180
the you know the browser doesn't start filling that information automatically just in case you have

64
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.750
somebody else logging in your same computer in your CMOS.

65
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.100
They don't you don't want them to see that password there.

66
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.410
So that's that as a user that's all we've got to do there.

67
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.260
There's not much to do and just clean this up a little bit maybe OK.

68
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.650
Let's go to the profile.

69
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.430
Make sure you save that and that profile you can take the value out and also make sure you have auto

70
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.220
complete off.

71
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.590
That's a good thing to have.

72
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.730
One thing that I want to do here is I want to take the Select that's checking for admen.

73
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.160
I want to take the whole input out.

74
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.140
OK.

75
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.310
And this is in the profile because right now we don't want it they use it to choose their own profile

76
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.410
write their own roles.

77
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.760
And you know we haven't built that functionality yet in this course just know that we might in the future.

78
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.880
Let's see if I can use to take the whole roll out here.

79
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.280
OK let's come back here let's just take the whole thing out.

80
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.430
And guys I have a lot of space in my code because I'm teaching you.

81
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.930
OK.

82
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.920
But in my regular code in my computer I don't have that much space.

83
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.430
So one thing that I want to take out is this user rule that we are not going to be needing anymore.

84
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.060
OK.

85
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.980
We're not going to get this from the form.

86
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.930
OK.

87
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.720
So wherever you

88
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.830
wherever you have it you can't take it off.

89
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.240
OK because we're not going to be using it.

90
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.310
OK.

91
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:37.010
So take all that off and let's go back to the app lets make sure that we don't have any of those values

92
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.560
are going to press enter or refresh a little bit.

93
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.750
OK.

94
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.580
Make sure that you edit page.

95
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.650
You also have while this disk these user is not an admin.

96
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.580
So you know make sure you're in your database.

97
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.490
You fix that.

98
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.470
OK.

99
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.350
That way you can log in and see the users.

100
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.080
But everything should be good.

101
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.240
Ready to go there.

102
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.180
No select no password showing.

103
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.150
And if you click update it shooting up day anything because we don't have any values.

104
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.100
OK.

105
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.100
So we not all dating any Paschall we're not hashing empty spaces or anything like that.

106
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.330
Anyway thank you so much guys and continued your lecture.

107
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.580
I'm going to take this out of here.

108
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.340
Clean this up a little bit and you can refactor this and make this into a function if you like.

109
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.990
I mean it's up to you.

110
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.930
I'm just showing you the major components here that way.

111
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.780
You can decide what you want to do.

112
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.660
All right.

113
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.390
Indenture your Colletto Ben like this

114
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.620
we can indent this a little bit more that way.

115
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.350
All right.

116
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.480
All right this looks a little better.

117
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.910
Anyway I think that said that so that's all we got to do in this case here.

118
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:21.820
So let's go back to users click on users at it and that we're good here.

119
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.540
All right.

120
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.260
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

121
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.880
Take care.
