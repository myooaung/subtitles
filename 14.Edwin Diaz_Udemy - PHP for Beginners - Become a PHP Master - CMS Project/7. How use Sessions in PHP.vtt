00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.590
I will come back on this video here.

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.360
We are going to be learning of our sessions now just to give you an idea.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.870
Sessions are really a way to get users information.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.670
Now let me compare the two with let me compared with cookies.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.990
You see cookies save information.

6
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.460
We set a cookie in the user's browser right.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.660
And we will set some information there will have actually that limit the amount of information that

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.640
we can set in the browser.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.180
But the idea is that we Sesamum information and when the user comes back to our application we pool

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.640
that information and process it right.

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.720
Well sessions work very similar to that.

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.130
Now what we do is we create a file right by just starting a function.

13
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.420
I'm going to show you the function.

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.020
We create a file in our server to say the users information and then when the user comes in to that

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.850
specific page or application we set a cookie in their browser without reference to the file that we

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.650
have on the server.

17
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.980
So that way they use this information is going to be saved in our server so we can save a lot of information.

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.940
Instead with cookies we can just save a little bit of information because we are saving that information

19
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.490
in the user's browsers not in our server.

20
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.870
So we have more control over storage.

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.000
But anyway let me show you exactly how sessions work.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.360
Let's go ahead and open our coeditor let's do a save as on this blog that BHB and this call is Section

23
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.330
1 right.

24
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.380
So we have it called Session 1 here.

25
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.950
Now the way we start a session right the way we meet we tell you know BHB OK let's let's go ahead and

26
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.850
start doing some things.

27
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.730
Let's start opening making files and doing all this.

28
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.780
All right so we create a session start.

29
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.750
And this is how we started up right here.

30
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.870
Now this is going to tell it's going to go to the browser and make a file.

31
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.750
So when they use it comes here on this page here and then we're going to open it right here is going

32
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.210
to open right now.

33
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.580
Boom that station that is already created and the cookie is set in this browser already.

34
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.250
I'm going to show it to you right now.

35
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.390
So let's go to.

36
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.490
I'm using Chrome by the way.

37
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.940
Let's go to history.

38
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.350
Actually now history I'm sorry.

39
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.950
Now history.

40
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.020
Let's go to settings.

41
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.570
Let's go to show advance settings.

42
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.310
Let's go to content and our cookie site data.

43
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.880
All right.

44
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.360
So you see this locavores this is us and then we click here we got a cookie.

45
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.170
You see that.

46
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.390
And then this cookie has a reference to a session we click on it and this content right here this roll

47
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.090
right here is the reference that we need.

48
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.930
So when.

49
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.230
Right now right this is the reference to the file that we have in the server and we can start putting

50
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.390
data in there.

51
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.000
And then every time the user comes in this case is us every time we come to this page we can reference

52
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.070
that found the server and pull information from there.

53
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:21.660
All right so now that this is created what I want to do is I want to set some values here and these

54
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.570
values that I'm going to set I'm going to save in this session.

55
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.940
I'm going to carry over to another page.

56
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.730
This is what sessions are go for.

57
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.380
If you want to carry values to another page and you want to say you don't want to personalize an application

58
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.380
for example and maybe give the user a message on.

59
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.990
I don't know the thank you page and say Listen thank you for coming in or whatever.

60
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.290
You can use sessions to keep track of that information all over your application.

61
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.790
Well now let's go ahead and do this.

62
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.070
We can also use cookies.

63
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.870
But like I said sessions you can save a lot more data.

64
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.280
Now you really does have disadvantages and advantages but we're not going to go into details right now.

65
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.240
First let's go ahead and create let's create some information in the session and this is how we do it.

66
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.910
Just very similar to the polls and they get.

67
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.590
I'm going to call these greeting reading.

68
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.420
I'm going to send a message to this here saying hello students.

69
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.030
Right.

70
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.570
That's it.

71
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.000
All right.

72
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.840
So now this session here is going to have this value you're going to have a value here.

73
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.540
All right.

74
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.370
We're going to have this associate of a rig greeting here in the valley is going to be hello student.

75
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.890
All right.

76
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.570
Now let's make another page let's make a second page.

77
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.400
All right.

78
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.580
And I'm going to do a Save As and call the session to BHB.

79
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.040
I'm going to save it.

80
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.890
All right.

81
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.370
And then hear what I'm going to do.

82
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.840
School here.

83
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.500
Of course I get a narrow here.

84
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.130
Well let's go to the first one.

85
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.290
It's actually Section 1

86
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.190
and they see the array one section to here.

87
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.150
I want to take this off.

88
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.580
There we go.

89
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.430
And here.

90
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.620
On go into doing the session two is echoing the information that we're going to said on the first session

91
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.430
one.

92
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.610
So let's go to Section 1 and let's find the right here.

93
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.070
All right.

94
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.620
All right.

95
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.330
Now another thing that I want you to keep in mind that this session started needs to be on every page

96
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.650
that you're going to be using sessions on always.

97
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.110
All right.

98
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.430
Because you need to actually tell BHB that you will be using sessions.

99
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.750
Right.

100
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.610
So make sure that this is started always.

101
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.380
So let's go to the first page here I'm going to click enter.

102
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.270
I have a mistake here somewhere.

103
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.620
Since it's on it's practice session the variable in line 3.

104
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.840
Let's make it let's find out what the mistake is here.

105
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.410
There is no mistake.

106
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.850
As a matter of fact is a mistake right here.

107
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.500
We need to put a semicolon there right.

108
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.990
Don't forget that.

109
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.260
All right so now we are on a session one right now if we go.

110
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.850
This session has been this value has been put in there already.

111
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.600
All right so keep that in mind.

112
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.570
We have this in an associate of array already available and we're going to be echoing this stuff here

113
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.730
out.

114
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.840
So let's go to the second page now and the message should be there we click enter.

115
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.510
And of course we need to fix that error or there's a semicolon.

116
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.530
I'm sorry about that guys.

117
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.230
There we go see that.

118
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.200
So that message was transferred over to the right.

119
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.700
So if I come here and I change the message go to the first one here and I say hello students.

120
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.960
This is awesome.

121
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.120
All right.

122
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.890
So I'm just going to refresh this page.

123
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.240
That message is already said again.

124
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.450
And if I go to the second page it gets carry over as you can see here.

125
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.410
You can use this with forms.

126
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:20.580
I mean whatever you want when you submit up information to a database and you want to display a error

127
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.550
or something like that.

128
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.820
You can use this.

129
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.210
This is very useful but anyway I don't want to make this video longer than what it needs to be done.

130
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.390
This is something very simple and I think you get the idea about using sessions is super easy.

131
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.480
You can set any type of value you want.

132
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.470
And you can keep track of users across you application.

133
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.360
Anyway thank you so much for watching this video.

134
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.970
Hopefully that will help you all understand sessions and I'll see you in the next lecture
