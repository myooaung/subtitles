1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,650
All right so we got the edit pose page.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,030
This place on data right.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,030
So we go to the polls.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,170
We can see that if we click on the Edit we are able to go to the edit on the scoreboard that BHP insists

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,320
on data.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,130
Now we're going to be relating this category later on we're going to be put into the category title

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,460
there that this post belongs to later on.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,060
Right right now this is static and we're going to we're going to fix it.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,990
All right.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,810
It's going to be a number on your site and but later on we're going to put a title there right.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,810
But that's and that's a recall that we will be doing.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:46,770
But anyway so we are here and what we need to do now is now that we have all these data here we need

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,010
this button here when we click it we need to send that data from the form to our database to update

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,690
these fields to whatever we want.

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,100
Right so if we want to say this and click Update we want to be able to.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,290
We want to be able to have the data sent to our table.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,090
All right.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:16,680
So let's go to our ad men for Slash includes for Slash at it squirt balls that BHB page or edit on this

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,850
court BHB page.

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,150
We're just going to say edit polls.

21
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,750
Right.

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,680
It's a lot easier now the first thing that I want to do in here is is that I want to make sure that

23
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,840
when I click on this button from the view of polls I want to make sure that I go to this specific post.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,710
Right.

25
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,800
37 in my case.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,450
In your case might be a different number.

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,800
Don't worry about that.

28
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:46,080
It happens and it doesn't it doesn't mean there is bad it just means that you have a different post.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:55,770
All right so where we're going to select from polls where what post ID he calls this board ID that we're

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,150
getting in there you are all right in the GET requests right so now that we have that now we are good

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,100
to go.

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,410
Now the next thing is we want to detect this form when it's submitted.

33
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:14,220
So we need to check for this button right here for the key of day on the score post.

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,930
So we're going to say if it's set right

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,540
and this is going to be a post

36
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,140
if it's set then we're going to do something right.

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,930
You want to make sure they work Celestials or something right

38
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,590
echo high to see if it works refresh.

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,900
Whoops We misspelled his function.

40
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,630
Here we go and let's just click it and we can see that he says hi right there.

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,160
So it is working.

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,890
All right.

43
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:10,010
So what we want to do is we want to grab all the fields in this name actually you right here.

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,010
We want to grabbing that pull super global and copyright here.

45
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,100
We've done that before and I'm just going to copy something that I got in the site and paste it right

46
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,160
here and you can just do the same.

47
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,860
Well you can just copy whatever I have here but just know that all I'm doing is grabbing all the form

48
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:36,480
values from down here in the name of you right here and these values and I am grabbing in this post

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,340
pro-global because that's how we grab it from the form and we are assigning it to a variable.

50
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,380
That's all I'm doing.

51
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,070
All right.

52
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,730
So you're welcome to post his video and copy each of these down for I am also grabbing the images in

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,330
this super global files.

54
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,530
All right.

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,170
Perfect.

56
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,470
Next thing is the move all bloater function we already saw how to do that.

57
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,850
I'm just going to paste it right here.

58
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,860
And all I'm doing right here.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:13,530
Like I explained before is moving the image from the temporary location to a permanent location.

60
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,290
Now using this path right here with the image name right here.

61
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,780
Right.

62
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,410
All right.

63
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,080
So the next thing is to submit this right.

64
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,520
Once this is done we need to go ahead actually.

65
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,830
As a matter of fact once this the post is done all right we need to.

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,860
Well actually there's another update post.

67
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,390
This is just right here is this.

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:49,140
This name is confusing me a little bit but are just going to leave it like this just for demonstration

69
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,070
purposes only but in another case I would probably name it's made or something like that.

70
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,200
I just don't want every foreign to be named met on the same page.

71
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,220
Well we only have one forum here so it really doesn't matter if we change it to submit.

72
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,790
I'm just going to leave it like this.

73
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,540
All right.

74
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,910
But anyways.

75
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,000
All right so now that we have all this information well we need to construct is there update query.

76
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:22,740
And for that I already copy this down and I will show it to you right here as you can see.

77
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:29,720
And now what I'm doing here basically is concatenating all Diskworld because it's super long.

78
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,030
So as you can see here I'm using the same variable over and over again concatenating it with a dot in

79
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,710
the equal symbol.

80
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,240
So basically this square.

81
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,310
All right.

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:50,560
It's one long string and just dividing it just to make it easier for me just like this.

83
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,850
It would be something like.

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,810
Right.

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,220
And they would have a long line like this with a lot of values and I don't want that.

86
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,240
So I'm just cutting it off concatenating it making it look a little nicer that way if I have a mistake

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,580
I can come to one single line and correct it instead of looking through all this one line here.

88
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,020
Right.

89
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,900
So it's better for the bug too.

90
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:27,440
So I'm saying update pose and then I'm updating it once I say that but I'm going to set the post-Idol

91
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,180
which is the column in the table equal to the post title in my form.

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,580
All right.

93
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,940
Remember this is coming from here.

94
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,360
This feels right this value right here is in the variable pulls tighter right now and it pulls categories

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,290
also on that.

96
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,610
On this on this value right here.

97
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,170
Now let's go ahead and check that out real quick.

98
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:59,470
That post category ID is go down to the categories right here.

99
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,360
All right.

100
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:12,650
And if for some reason you have this select from category where category equals cat ID or something

101
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,890
like that just delete it right and just leave it like this.

102
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,910
Select from categories just if some reason I think I did on the last video when we fixed it.

103
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,940
Right just make sure that you have what I have right now.

104
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:34,350
Also make sure that you select right here has post on the score category.

105
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,640
Right.

106
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,330
Very important.

107
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:42,260
So make sure you have that because this is that this is a value that would be submitted.

108
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,280
Every time I select one of these.

109
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:54,470
So if I select this right that's going to have a value and is going to have this is going to carry that

110
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,670
value right.

111
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,430
He's got to do it right here.

112
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:08,110
So we're going to explain the name right here but we are carrying that category ID on that option value.

113
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,590
All right.

114
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,620
And the auction value is going to be carried by this guy right here.

115
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,150
So make sure you have that right now.

116
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,700
When we get this on the form right here is going to be pulls on the score category and we're going to

117
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,200
actually rename it to post on the score category I.D. We're now renaming it we are assigning a variable

118
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,690
that is a little different from this.

119
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:42,470
All right on the score category ID and then we are using that variable right here with the column name

120
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,510
which is the same name.

121
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,750
All right.

122
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,630
So here we are using a function for the date.

123
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,580
This is just going to give us the date for today.

124
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,270
All right.

125
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,200
We don't need cords or anything like that in here.

126
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,870
Just not as I always have cords around my strings the old strings and I always have a space after the

127
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,720
coma.

128
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,330
Make sure you always have a space after the coma and that last one.

129
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,300
Well the one before the last.

130
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:11,780
All right.

131
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,120
I don't have a coma there.

132
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,100
So make sure you don't have a coma there either.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,880
Right because if you put a coma there you are.

134
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,230
This is not going to work that where statement.

135
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,400
So the hole where we failed so take the coma out.

136
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,320
Now if you want to make sure that this worked.

137
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,300
All right.

138
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,110
First we're going to send the Querrey So we're going to use a variable.

139
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,460
We're going to use the function might rely on the score Querrey.

140
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,050
Right.

141
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,270
And then we are going to sign that connection to this.

142
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,720
Perfect.

143
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,810
Now we're going to use a function right that we have confirm Querrey.

144
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,370
This is a function that we may and we're going to make sure that this works.

145
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:07,070
All right so now make sure this function that you have is correct go to functions stop being admin.

146
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,190
All right.

147
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,170
And make sure that we have the same that you have the same name for this function.

148
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,230
All right.

149
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:21,330
I might add spell spelled like this before would I am before and I'm spending it with and now and I

150
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,130
fixed it.

151
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,540
I think I already told you how to fix it but it's not.

152
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:31,560
Just make sure if for some reason this fails this function fails just do the if statement here like

153
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,950
this and just check if not post.

154
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:46,250
Then you die and you know like this you should know how to do that.

155
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,050
Querrey failed might ask you a lie.

156
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm just doing this really quickly so that way you can have a better idea on how this is done right.

157
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,320
But then we pass it in that connection and that's just going to give you the same thing as is confirmed

158
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,980
function.

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,910
If for some reason he fails right mine is working so you should be working too.

160
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,310
All right so this should do it right now.

161
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,870
All right.

162
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,090
There's nothing else we've got to do here.

163
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,860
Everything seems to be in order.

164
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,550
Let's go ahead and check it out.

165
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,150
So I'm going to and click enter there.

166
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,230
My you are how am I going to say guys.

167
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,370
As an update.

168
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,100
And now you saw that picture they were going to fix that in a minute right now.

169
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,630
You saw that disappear.

170
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
And I tell you in a minute why so we go to View polls.

171
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:48,450
We see that we were able to update the older guy but we have a problem with image so let's go and fix

172
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,950
that real quick.

173
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,670
All right.

174
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,900
So the problem with the Minxin going to explain what it is.

175
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:03,990
Right now let's go here is that if I go ahead and choose an image and I choose an image right now like

176
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,830
this.

177
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:11,640
And by the way if you want these images I'm going to get a file on the right or this lecture you can

178
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,320
download a file that is going to have all these images that I'm just going to blow them for you.

179
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,120
That way you don't have to make them all right.

180
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,460
They're going to be 900 by 300.

181
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,660
So on the right to this lecture download those images if you want them.

182
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
I am going to put in there for you.

183
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,750
So if I had this image there right they are right now.

184
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,470
Actually I didn't choose it.

185
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,970
Sorry about that.

186
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,150
And I got it with my computer.

187
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,880
Now for some reason crazy me at once again.

188
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,050
Oops.

189
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,580
Everything just crash.

190
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,630
This just reopened is.

191
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,950
Sorry about that.

192
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,910
I got a lot of things open.

193
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,030
I got like three more monitors on the right hand side on the left.

194
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,910
And of course it's prone to fail.

195
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:13,190
All right so this is cool down to it men you post.

196
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,210
All right.

197
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,630
Don't worry about what you saw there.

198
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:24,210
Sometimes I go back in you know after I make 30 lectures I go back and we do a lecture if I don't like

199
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,500
it.

200
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,490
So don't worry about what you saw there.

201
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,060
I'm probably way ahead of you right now.

202
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,080
You know there are lectures but I go back and fix some of these lectures that I make mistakes on sometimes.

203
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,560
Right.

204
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,910
So I'm always fixing things and things like that but anyway let's go down to it let me explain what

205
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,050
happened with the image so I'm going to choose File.

206
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,620
I want to go to pictures and you see that we have the picture I click update.

207
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:57,060
Now the pictures is fine but if I click Update again we lose that because right now we don't have any

208
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,160
value there.

209
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,990
All right so if I click up they would have no value.

210
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,810
So what we need to do is we need to make sure that this post variable disposed image is not empty and

211
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,960
if it is we need to go get that image somewhere else and that will be in the database.

212
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:22,200
So right now before we make anything now right here before we do any update on this let's make sure

213
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,170
that this post image is not empty if it is.

214
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,060
We go get that image in the database.

215
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,750
All right.

216
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:35,270
So we're going to use another function call empty and we're going to say if the post image and listening

217
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,170
if you are sticking with me all this time Congratulations you're really really really really awesome.

218
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,030
Right now a lot of people can do this.

219
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,240
So anyways I just want to tell you that you are awesome and you got to get very far in life.

220
00:14:51,240 --> 00:15:06,210
So if this post image is empty we've got to go to the database and select all from post where those

221
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,890
ID equals what.

222
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,850
Let's get this idea right here.

223
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,440
Why not right.

224
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,220
Polls ID equals this guy right here

225
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,320
and space there.

226
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:29,010
We're going to call this query select image as a matter of fact that I think I already have written

227
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,250
down somewhere.

228
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,510
Let me see if I find one of my all the money matters.

229
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,010
Yes I have it right here.

230
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,780
So was going to paste it right there.

231
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,680
So we're going to use the miscue like Querrey underscore Querrey to send Querrey we can assign it to

232
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,660
this variable select on the score image.

233
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,760
We're going to use a while loop to loop through that result set right that we get from the database

234
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,120
and we're going to pull out that image again.

235
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,570
All right so that's all I did there.

236
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,740
Gonna save it.

237
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:13,420
And if I go back and click enter there I don't have an image there but a Feigel end of the this and

238
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,840
if I click Update again you see that I get the image again and again.

239
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:24,380
All right so perfect we can let's change the image.

240
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:34,040
I like to change it and of post this click of the pulse again and I get that image.

241
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:34,990
All right.

242
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,550
Perfect.

243
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,410
So I think this lecture was pretty good.

244
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,110
It was a little long but if you stuck with me to the end you are awesome.

245
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,730
You're doing very good and you're going to be a really good BHP developer.

246
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,310
All right.

247
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,350
So anyway thank you so much and I'll see you on the next lecture.
