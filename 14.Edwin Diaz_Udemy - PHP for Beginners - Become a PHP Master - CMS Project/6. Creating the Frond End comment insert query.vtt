00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.970
All right so on the last video we were able to make sure that this forum was working up to a couple

2
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.720
of tries of not having coffee.

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.210
We made this happen.

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.010
All right.

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.690
But anyways so let's go ahead and finish up and try to get some data in our database.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.870
So now that we have some data coming in.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.120
Let's go ahead and the first thing that we need is to get the post.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.140
Actually we need to get this post ID right here.

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.720
Let's get that right here.

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.640
So if we said we need to get that right from the you r l and

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.360
let's do some inserting First we need to get all the post data out.

12
00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.150
So let's go ahead and post and what are the features that we're sending we're sending the full comment.

13
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.650
Walter if I can get it right I got some coffee now so I'm more active for you guys.

14
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.400
So comment out there you see that.

15
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.810
I'm even faster.

16
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.260
Let's get some more let's get some more.

17
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.720
All right.

18
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.150
So

19
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.580
that's so we get a coming order.

20
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.720
The common e-mail comment can't

21
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.590
own this

22
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.610
e-mail and the content.

23
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.000
All right.

24
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.760
So you know exactly what we're doing right.

25
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.330
When we submit this when we click on this button right here.

26
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.620
This summit we're going to get all these data from all of these input fields.

27
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.180
Right.

28
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.150
We got the names right here coming out there.

29
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.660
Come and e-mail come comment content.

30
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.730
We've got to get all that.

31
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.370
Actually three parts of that data and we get into posts ID from day you r l in that get super global.

32
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.780
All right.

33
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.220
That is in there you are l right now.

34
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.290
Next bar is making the Querrey.

35
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.970
So let's do that right now.

36
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.220
So the Querrey that we will be making is an insert insert into Querrey.

37
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.850
Remember that we've got two parts to insert two.

38
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.780
And of course we're going to send it to the database.

39
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.220
But insert into what what is the table number.

40
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.490
You can pause it and think about it.

41
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.260
Comments.

42
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.350
And here we have like a parenthesis like this.

43
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.940
When we got to insert all the columns where we we're going to be starting to say that too.

44
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.720
So the first up column that we will be inserting is comment.

45
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.520
All right.

46
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.170
That's a matter of fact.

47
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.210
Let me see something.

48
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.960
I mean I don't remember the common data impulse ID because I want to relate this to a post.

49
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.660
All right.

50
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.800
So let's do that right now as a matter of fact come and post ID and put all the way to the site so you

51
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.420
can see it.

52
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.310
And I make a little smaller.

53
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.330
So I got a little more room.

54
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.020
You should know what I'm doing right now.

55
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.400
I'm putting all the columns there that we need some information in.

56
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.910
So the comment post ID we are also submitting the comment date

57
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.570
going order by the way.

58
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.710
But I come in post Id come in oh let's going order order or.

59
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.750
Or e-mail content status e-mail content.

60
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.640
And I know I know what I'm doing and status.

61
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.290
All right.

62
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.710
So we're going to add this little thing here because I see I tell you I got my coffee

63
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:19.160
status and date all right.

64
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.540
I am indeed.

65
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.790
All right we're going to submit all this information of course we're not going to be getting all this

66
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.390
information in from here.

67
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.760
All right.

68
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.960
We're now going to be doing that

69
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.010
actually the status Yeah we can we can start it is going to be a static value meaning that there's a

70
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.190
value there's not going to be dynamic from here.

71
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.260
We're going to be able to change it in our database in our in our admin.

72
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.560
All right.

73
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.430
So we're going to do another query and make sure that you concatenate this with a dot notation there

74
00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:02.170
and an assignment operator and this is just going to have the values and these values are coming in

75
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.240
and our corporate folks comment post ID how where are we going to be getting these ID from.

76
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.480
Do you know where from.

77
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.850
Well we got to pull ID right here when I get it from here.

78
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.560
Right.

79
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.130
And we don't even we don't even need to put little

80
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.750
quotes around that.

81
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.720
All right.

82
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.940
Coming up we are getting there from here.

83
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.510
Perfect.

84
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.820
And this one we need to put the chords in the brackets just fine just to distinguish it.

85
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.080
Whoops that was just really bad there.

86
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.960
And I want to make this one too bad so I'm going to try to Hariya guys from this.

87
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.010
E-mail

88
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.570
right there.

89
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.980
It is one out there boom.

90
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:06.070
Let's get the content.

91
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.450
Can

92
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.840
we go get the status and he's going to be static.

93
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:25.650
The start is going to be on a pool on a pool that's going to be the status right there and that's going

94
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.960
to be something that we are sending right now from here in the coming day.

95
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.350
Of course it's going to be the function.

96
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.810
And we sent here the now function.

97
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.190
Yeah that's fine.

98
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.810
All right.

99
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.630
Perfect.

100
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.890
So we don't we're going to cut it off and I'll see you in the next lecture there.

101
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.910
Well we are going to be finishing this off and finally sending some data in.

102
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.400
Right.

103
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.600
Thank you so much for watching.

104
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.700
See you in the next one.
