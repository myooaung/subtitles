1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,980
Walk them back with your students.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,870
So.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:11,340
So now we have this working or composer working or emails being sent we're using character sets here.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,470
I mean we use an prepared statement you got a lot of things going on we have learned a lot in this couple

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,770
of lectures where guys.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,560
Right.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,400
I thought so.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,240
So now what we need is we need to send our code ok into our e-mail with a link.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,940
So when people click here they can go and be varify in our application but we still don't have that

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,500
page where we can send that.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,980
But let's actually before we build a page.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:43,980
Let's actually build the functionality and then once we build the functionality we can build that page

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,140
okay to accept those values.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:55,460
So and to get this functionality this to put the links is super easy is actually right something your

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,320
analysts say

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,450
Please click

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,510
to

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:14,860
the set your password something like that.

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,400
And of course what I want to do is of course I don't want to put that in the H-1

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:40,490
or be BHB and that's going to bring out all the way to the bottom.

21
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,700
Let's actually create a link here.

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,200
And this is close I say click here.

23
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,290
The fact we're going to include the whole

24
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:08,280
link with the code in the anchor desk just because some people don't have the ability to get links on

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,670
their email.

26
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,310
Believe it or not.

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,990
So we have to go to.

28
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,770
Let's say you put the name of a Web site here.

29
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,860
In our case it's just a development server right.

30
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,200
Mine has a port of a C mass.

31
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,430
Yours could be just local host probably and reset.

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,220
The HP is a page.

33
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,430
Remember that we need a parameter for this to work.

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,050
So we got to send the parameter later on but right now

35
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,720
just know that actually let's just do the parameter now.

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,470
This is going to take an e-mail.

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,630
OK this parameter I'm going to cut this off right here.

38
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:04,050
And when I go like this I'm going to concatenate the e-mail variable here OK.

39
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:14,460
And then when ampersand going to put another parameter there come back here real quick.

40
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:27,250
And it's going to be I'm going to concatenate the.

41
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:39,070
Let's do this here real quick and this we'll be talking here like this OK.

42
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,810
That's it.

43
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,290
I mean

44
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,720
so let's.

45
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,490
Actually get the same thing

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,520
here like that that looks good.

47
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,180
OK.

48
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,720
We can test this

49
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,730
going to go to every.

50
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,720
We have not created yet.

51
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,620
So let's actually test this is see if it works.

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,530
Email there.

53
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,950
OK OK.

54
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,070
Let's come back here.

55
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,530
Corteen

56
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,770
OK we're going to take that off.

57
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,580
But you can see here we have the link.

58
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,970
When we click on it we go to a page that does not exist.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,230
The e-mail is now working as you can see.

60
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,340
Well the e-mail here is like is broken

61
00:04:50,990 --> 00:05:01,360
e-mail programmers are not being passed after that email so let's go back and see where the fail so

62
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,990
let's inspect this

63
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,930
actually.

64
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,000
Here

65
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,780
that should be the problem there.

66
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,020
OK.

67
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,380
You got this email

68
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,670
back here.

69
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,130
A quick

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,620
This was good and my editor is not giving me any errors.

71
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,090
Let's come back here let's just put this up here.

72
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,910
Go trying to escape it automatically we can if we want it to escape some of this code and just make

73
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,150
it more readable.

74
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:16,400
So e-mail we can Kartini that then we can cottony this with a code

75
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,920
OK.

76
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,520
We break here.

77
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,340
Finish that.

78
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,750
We start with the one which is a string

79
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,670
OK that looks pretty good to me let's try it again now.

80
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,370
Come back here.

81
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,960
Whoops.

82
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,670
What happened.

83
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,550
Here we go that's working like this.

84
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,870
I got to we got to fix that a minute.

85
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,620
At

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,550
according to

87
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,460
I'm not going to work like that but I was able to get in that page.

88
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,160
So we were able to get in this page.

89
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,810
You were going to face that on the way.

90
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,310
Keep

91
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,620
Oh I see both of them right now.

92
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:44,200
If it is not good or if it's and if it's not he has to be built for this for this to fail.

93
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,610
That's why I have the word right.

94
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:02,020
Jesus guys I really really really really.

95
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,260
So if I make a mistake or one of these this is not set

96
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,700
and you know let's go back here and that's and I said we've got it we've got to come up with a better

97
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:25,250
solution for this so if it's if the method is not set to get met it's not set or this is not forgot.

98
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,660
Then we redirect.

99
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:37,940
The problem is that when we click here this refreshes and it doesn't have this field like this.

100
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,190
OK.

101
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,790
So we got to cancel that.

102
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,260
This is going to take one of these guys out for now.

103
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,820
Later on we come up with a better solution.

104
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,980
I don't like this solution year because of these conditions they don't they don't meet.

105
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,450
We can't find a better one to do it.

106
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,480
All right now.

107
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,550
Just do it like this.

108
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,270
It really dysfunctionality.

109
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,430
It's something that we can work on later on.

110
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,430
Work out with the logic.

111
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,600
I really don't want to mess around with this right now.

112
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,160
We'll we'll get something a lot better later on.

113
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,720
OK.

114
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,630
Well right now let's do it like that.

115
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,700
That way we don't we can play around with our stuff.

116
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,630
OK.

117
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,150
So

118
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:29,480
and follow faculty and this just resend this Gray was sent.

119
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,770
Let's play around with this.

120
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:38,690
And of course was always on the site can be reached where you can see the talking's here and the e-mail

121
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,460
is there.

122
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,960
OK.

123
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,340
So that's working.

124
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,960
My server was down for some reason before.

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,830
Nice working.

126
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,780
OK.

127
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,260
So that's working.

128
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,300
Our link is working.

129
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,660
Now let's on the next lecture let's create the reset page and all of the code that we need for that

130
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,400
page.

131
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,420
Thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you in the next lectures.
