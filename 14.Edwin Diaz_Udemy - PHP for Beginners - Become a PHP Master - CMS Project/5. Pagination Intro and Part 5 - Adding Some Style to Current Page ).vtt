00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.530
All right.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.490
Just because I love my students and I just couldn't help it.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.880
But guys I'm going to help you actually see some styling into these buttons right here.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.520
All right.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.540
We need to actually apply some some colors here so that we can know exactly what pitch we are right

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.290
now we don't know so.

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.180
All right if this section here is pagination system does not serve a five star review.

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.460
Dan I do not know what does.

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.620
All right guys this is awesome stuff right.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
Anyway let's go ahead and do this.

11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.760
So the first thing that we want to do is we want to go to our CSSA right right here in the root directory

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.390
right.

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.060
Let's go to that CSSA folder and we're going to find this CSSA says blog for Slash.

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860
Well hi friend.

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.620
Home.

16
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.810
Yes yes.

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.270
All right.

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.020
And usually what I recommend is for you guys to create a new style sheet.

19
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.760
And of course you know put it right here on the header.

20
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.380
All right.

21
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.630
So something like like this maybe be well let's do it right here and do something like this.

22
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.050
Style styles osseous.

23
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.560
Let's do it the right way right guys.

24
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.140
And let's do a save us on this home.

25
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:31.650
Let's call it styles Ducey SS I'm just going to delete this because this is a style that says now and

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.050
just because the style she's right below the home that's the SS is going to override it.

27
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.530
All right so everything below overwrites was on top.

28
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.960
That's what's called cascading style sheets because it cascades down the right.

29
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.920
So make sure that it's already linked successfully here.

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.580
And we do that by of course coming here and doing page source and clicking on it.

31
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.120
Beautiful.

32
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.320
When this is going on Chrome by the way.

33
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.030
All right so we need to figure out.

34
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.040
And let me just bring this back here how we can apply styles to let's do inspect their on a real quick

35
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.540
and let's find out the style of this.

36
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.180
We could see this pager has a colossal pager and he's targeting the L I and every link inside the arrow.

37
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.060
This is what the greater than symbol means right here every link inside the eye.

38
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.650
All right.

39
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.850
So we're going to do that.

40
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.130
Let's go ahead here to our styles of CSX and we're going to talk to the pager which is a UL.

41
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.270
And we're going to target the eye and we're going to create a class I think is better because then we

42
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.740
target everything else we Targ every link We're going to create a class called active on this cool link.

43
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.450
And I keep doing these parentheses there.

44
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.710
Sorry about that guys.

45
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.830
All right.

46
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.160
Right as well we're going to do is just going to do something simple with the background.

47
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.420
Pound zero zero.

48
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.900
And I'm just going to put in porn just in case here.

49
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.940
This important key word overwrites anything.

50
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.640
All right that is trying to give us some other color.

51
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.960
And I just do that for safety you know for safety issues you know.

52
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.610
Anyway so let's go ahead and actually use this class right here.

53
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.840
Let's go to our that's real quick.

54
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.820
Let's create an if statement here and that when we're going to figure out this is actually the Korean

55
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.910
page right.

56
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.140
Or any page could be the current page but the way we do this is by doing you know what if I we could

57
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.460
be which could be number three or four or five page old timey members getting attached count is equal

58
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.430
to what the virtual page remember.

59
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.040
Page right here.

60
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.030
Right.

61
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.330
This is the this is what's keeping count of everything that's to get requests.

62
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.470
So if it's equal to that get requests then we want to find something into it.

63
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.890
Well that's actually a copy right here of this.

64
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.220
And let's do an else statement here and put this in here because we're going to be doing something right

65
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.130
now.

66
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.650
So I is equal to page which could be the current page wherever the customer is on or the visitors.

67
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.290
Then we going to assign a class to it.

68
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.430
And the class is called you guessed it active on the score link.

69
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.390
Right.

70
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.320
And then if we're not there then we don't want to play anything into it right.

71
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.050
So we've got to leave those links alone.

72
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.270
We save it.

73
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.180
And I think we are golden here right.

74
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.800
I don't think there's nothing else we got to do.

75
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:47.980
Let's go here and make sure this is there enter and look at this page three page three.

76
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.380
Let's go to page 15 page 15 page 15.

77
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.320
Isn't that cool guys.

78
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.010
All right.

79
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.120
Beautiful right.

80
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.410
So I hope you're happy as I am happy of showing you this information and maybe in the next lecture will

81
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.420
create a little feature in the admin.

82
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.840
If you haven't done so already.

83
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.090
Take care my friends and I see you in the next lecture.

84
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.760
Good job
