1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,670
I will come back my student.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,630
So I was playing around with the same mess that we got going on here.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,440
And I notice that we don't have some type of fallback just in case we're not showing a picture.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,980
So I said it will be nice if I feel some type of functionality that does that right we'd still have

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,260
a whole bunch of things that we can add to this and I'm going to keep adding as much as I can.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,090
OK just bear with me.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:32,190
So in that BHB we could if we wanted to come to the deadline where we are displaying the image and we

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:38,160
could write functionalities on top of this if statement or so on so or some type of 10 or every operator

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,980
here to display some type of placeholder maybe from our images folder here.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,390
Just in case we don't have a picture I would say if not both image display is Ayles display the Paul's

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:51,860
image.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,130
Right.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,540
We could write that here.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,640
But then that would defeat the purpose of having reusable code that we can use anywhere else.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,660
So especially in the post page right we're not displaying anything there.

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:14,670
And we seem to have some type of issue there so let's actually right here is the post that is good but

17
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,840
if you go all the way to the bottom my Rowson diverse stuff here and there is no image here either.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:29,240
So let's actually make this a little bit more re-useable by building or creating a helper function right.

19
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,900
That will help us do that.

20
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,350
So I'm going to be using one of these pictures as a placeholder but you're welcome to create your own

21
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:44,300
pictures or use HTP or place hold that it you know does show you how to do that in this course that

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,540
is some type of web site that you can use a placeholder image from their server but I prefer to have

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,920
something here for now.

24
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,550
OK.

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:00,370
So I'm going to go to functions admin right here and I'm going to add that function.

26
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:08,790
So let's just create this and then call this placeholder let's just call this image placeholder.

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,850
So until like that

28
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,200
and

29
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,330
of course this is going to take some type of image.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,640
So I'm just going to say

31
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,410
and I'm going to set this to zero or two.

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,960
No it's just some type of default value here OK.

33
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,440
Just think.

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,630
So that way we don't have any problems.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,980
So we could write in if they move here very simply say if not image

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,540
like that let's just put that not statement there.

37
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,980
Or if not M.H. then we are going to return

38
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,450
I'm going to use a placeholder in images like I said before.

39
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,400
Oh not in doubt one in the

40
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,350
in this file here.

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm just going to say M.H. on this school or for it really doesn't matter.

42
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,970
You can use whatever you want.

43
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,220
Like I said before so I'm going to return that.

44
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,300
And if we do find a name a change is going to return.

45
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,610
Image itself.

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,310
OK it should be good.

47
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,570
So now if I grab this here come back to index and stead of this play.

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:53,050
Echoing that out there I'm just going to echo how the function will occur and I'm going to take the

49
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,020
post image here and then I pass it as a parameter.

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,790
OK so let's go back to the.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,150
So this here make sure that this works.

52
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,360
Let's refresh it oh I have a problem here

53
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,830
of course.

54
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,700
Let's go back here.

55
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,480
Refresh

56
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,080
having some type of difficulty image placeholder we don't need this single currency.

57
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,350
As a matter of fact I just save the file.

58
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,750
It should be good.

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,400
We don't need to make an attack.

60
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,480
We are already inside quotes.

61
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
So let's refresh and there we go.

62
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,190
Now if I go all the way to the bottom you can see that we are displaying this as default.

63
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,900
If I go to this one year of course we are not.

64
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,830
So let's do that.

65
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,060
Let's use our function post aswell.

66
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,530
So I'm going to copy all this out.

67
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,520
And let's go to a post and let's see where that is.

68
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,380
I'm going to do a search here

69
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,330
file here should be.

70
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,400
Oh there we go.

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,640
That was easy to find.

72
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,080
And I'm going to piece that in there.

73
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,650
Let's go here and refresh.

74
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,490
And as you can see that we got we made this a lot more reusable.

75
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,350
Now I'm noticing something here we don't have our comment form.

76
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,960
Let's go back and see what's going on here.

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,960
OK let's look for then tag for that.

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:56,190
This is the where we are getting the idea for the post and an's was in there it's ending here.

79
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,710
I got three

80
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:14,200
oh ok I see what's going on so let's take one of these guys here and I believe this will fix the issue

81
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,200
right here.

82
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,020
So let's come back here.

83
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,610
Let's see this let's go back here and refresh and voila.

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,350
Commenting is good.

85
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,090
OK.

86
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,160
Perfect.

87
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,150
All right.

88
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,100
That would do it for this lecture guys.

89
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,330
Hopefully you know I was able to add something valuable to you to this course and I'll see you in the

90
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,810
next lecture.

91
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,480
Take care.
