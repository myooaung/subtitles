00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.680
I will come back on the last video we were.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.950
We had a lot of fun right.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.710
We we validated some of this information coming from the form down here and we cut it here.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.320
Finding out that the form was submitted we made an array we put some values in there we tested against

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.350
that using a function call in array to see if the user name was present there.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.480
And it was impressive.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
We display a message saying you know sorry you're not allowed if you was we welcome to use Earle or

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.790
whoever was there right to our little application.

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.320
We also tested the value the characters the amount of characters the user name had or that field had

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.170
on the form and if it was lower than five would display a message and was if it was bigger than five

11
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.910
with a splash message here with this SD or lenth function here which counter they use user name characters

12
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.030
which counted the characters of this field right here right whatever we are typing here this function

13
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.630
was able to catch those values in there.

14
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.180
And we tested against that.

15
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.850
All right.

16
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.090
So on this video here what are we going to be doing is we going to be sending this information somewhere

17
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.530
else.

18
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.730
Because this information is kind of messy right here right here right on the same page.

19
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.580
So usually I tell you that we have another page to do this.

20
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.430
We make another page and we value day or form data and then we can reuse that page you know through

21
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.080
our application right.

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.770
So what I want to do is I want to do Aceves because I really don't want to touch this form that ph be

23
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.590
here.

24
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.310
I want to leave this for you so I'm going to do a Save As and call this form external

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.770
save.

26
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.370
Now we have a different form that we can play around with.

27
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.860
Right now you have a form over there and your course that exercise files that you can refer to that

28
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.050
single page validation.

29
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.890
This one is going to be an external because well what I want to do is I want to send all these data

30
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.620
to another form and the form to another page the page is going to be called Form process.

31
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.000
Right.

32
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.110
And we're going to make it right now.

33
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.760
So let's go ahead and open our blank that BHP that do a Save As and let's make this what it was was

34
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.170
a form process that we go up BHB I'm going to take all these mail out of there because it's not going

35
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.000
to take HDMI.

36
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.720
By the way we could put them out but it's not going to do that.

37
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.860
So what we need to do first and we need to go on the browser to this forum.

38
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.870
I think my editor already took me there.

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.610
There we go.

40
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.510
And he took me to form process.

41
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.000
All right.

42
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.700
So if you're not there for some reason make sure that you go to your browser and type it in.

43
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.410
All right.

44
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.150
So when I type in some data here it's going to get sent to the form of this court process and is going

45
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720
to process it right he's going to give us some information.

46
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.380
So this is an external validation form.

47
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.300
So I'm going to say my name is Edwin and this is the password.

48
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.260
I click submit and look at the browser look at the address bar right here where he's going to do submit.

49
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.410
And as you can see it changed the form process here.

50
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.820
All right.

51
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.480
Didn't display anything because some reason is not his plain but we know that it did go there to form

52
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.450
process.

53
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.810
The reason why is not explained because we don't have any of these data there so it's still too soon

54
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.830
to do that.

55
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.250
So let's go ahead and copy all this stuff here.

56
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.540
Let's take it out from this form external let's save it and then let's put it in the form on the score

57
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.890
process right here because it doesn't have anything.

58
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.170
Let's do that right.

59
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.000
There we go.

60
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.110
Now he's doing something right.

61
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.100
Let's take that off.

62
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.870
And by pull my mouse cursor here and just click enter to empty it out.

63
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.370
Let's actually go back here to enter again there and this is empty.

64
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.920
All right so let's type in the name Edwyn and here and click submit and it's going to take me to form

65
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.520
on this court process is going to say sorry you're not allowed.

66
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.420
So you see that we were here in a form on the Scorched-Earth no.

67
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.920
And when I clicked so made it so it send me to the other page to process that information.

68
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.750
So I'm just going to collect some really long name there and submit.

69
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.290
And he says user it cannot be longer than 10.

70
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.080
Sorry you're not allowed processing the data right here.

71
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.940
So this is how you send the data to another form invalidate it.

72
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.210
All right so hopefully you were able to learn how to do this.

73
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.920
And if not just go rewind the video look at it again if you still have any questions call me.

74
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.160
Well not call me but go ahead and e-mail me message me make a discussion then we can resolve your not

75
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.700
understanding this but very simple so hopefully this information was able to give you an open mind about

76
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.070
how data is actually sent to other pages that we can catch it over there and do all the things with

77
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.850
it right.

78
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.540
So anyway thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see you in the next one.

79
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.620
Take care.
