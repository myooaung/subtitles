1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,730
My amazing students.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:09,840
So in this lecture I was thinking that we should add a functionality or just a little bit of color to

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,580
our little feature that we'd learn to do on The Last Lecture right you saw that this display this alert

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,460
from the browser looks pretty ugly right.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,000
Would be nice to have a really nice display with some really cool data or something like that.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,340
Right.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,470
So let me show you how to make this nice.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,050
Okay.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:33,960
So what I found online is let this little library of really cool notification stuff that looks really

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,720
cool.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Looks it sounds.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,040
Well it is actually the name is toast are toast toast ya.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,450
Okay.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,590
If I go there on images you can see all the little nice notification that got a look like this.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,490
That's a lot better.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,970
That would be cool right to have them are.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,620
Oh I see a mass right.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,510
So I'm going to show you how to use it.

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,760
So I went over here and I typed in toasty ya and I found his gay hot page tells me everything about

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,190
it right.

22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,930
How to do it.

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,050
But I'm going to give you a shortcut so he has a let me see right here.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,630
We have a demo.

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,780
OK.

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,440
And if we go to that demo there and I'm going to take those musical to the other one.

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,130
I don't like this one here.

28
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,370
This one's on plonker.

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,340
Perfect.

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:35,340
So if I click here and I click try me you can see the little notifications here that are popping up.

31
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:45,580
OK so it looks here that we need toast the library that's the CFS the Stiles for this and it looks like

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,410
we need.

33
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,410
Well I'm pretty sure we don't need bootstrap but who knows.

34
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,660
Just in case we might need it and it looks like we need fun.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,160
Awesome.

36
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:03,750
No I don't think so either but the main important thing that I see here is the toast CSX and the Toshio

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:11,140
says down here and maybe Jake where we make you can read more about what he needs down here somewhere.

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,470
But anyway let's play a little bit with the OK.

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,140
So I'm going to go ahead and create some type of file here.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,270
Let's go and play around with it.

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,230
So I'm going to create a file called about.

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,740
I'm going to create about this time right.

43
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:39,280
And let's see what we can and if we can do it like this let's go and grab the toast link so I'm going

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,740
to because I want to make sure that it works with a minimal code as possible.

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,030
We don't want to put a lot of stuff in or see a mass or any other project or less we need to.

46
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,360
OK.

47
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,590
And I'm going to come back all the way down here and I want to get this see the end for the tools library

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,650
guys what I suggest you do and I think I recommended this so many times is that you go to each of these

49
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,090
see they see the end addresses on top.

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:14,040
You go there personally I put them on the browser and copy it physically and extract that to a file

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,070
ok like this.

52
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,680
You go there you get all the code.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,640
Copy and paste it in another file and named your file toasty ya angels gather locally in your projects

54
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,610
just in case this thing does not work in the future or maybe they start charging for something.

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,060
OK.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,440
Just always keep it with you.

57
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,150
So what you having in your projects

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,470
if this thing doesn't work for you make sure that you have your DCP addresses here ok like this HDTV

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,690
I think is actually G.P.S. as all of this let's just put that in there.

60
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,080
Now OK if I go there I can see that is HD CBS.

61
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,380
But anyway so it looks like we have a here.

62
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,720
Let's see if we can make something happen already.

63
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,630
I don't know if it's going to work without Jake wary.

64
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:14,130
Let me come where's my body oh the body tag.

65
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:22,080
I got this in the wrong place I got these in the body make sure that this is after the body right here

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:22,970
OK

67
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,740
usually and then you invoke it with some type of function idea down here.

68
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:42,550
So I know for a fact that we use something called toast toast our DOT success or whatever or danger

69
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,600
or.

70
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,180
Aim for that he has a whole bunch of different methods you can read more about it into the communication

71
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,790
of course.

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:59,800
OK on gay hub there is a right here you see that OK so I'm going to say hello.

73
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,770
Let's see this works I don't know if this is gonna work I like to play around with things like that

74
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,180
and then debug it right.

75
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,620
That's that's what I like.

76
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,960
I know some of you don't like that but that's OK

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,610
enter and yeah that is.

78
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,910
Whoops that's not working for me.

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,500
Let me check it out real quick.

80
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,400
Oh let me see

81
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,030
Not that

82
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:42,290
inspect my keys all messed up I'm going to refresh this on my network tab and then I see that everything

83
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,740
looks good but it's just not working we need something else.

84
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,840
OK.

85
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:58,130
So let's go back to this clunker page and let's try to see if he needs Jake wary okay.

86
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,940
Here we go and let's go back here and refresh and there we go.

87
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,550
That's all I need.

88
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,980
Jake where we see that.

89
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,710
That's pretty cool.

90
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:15,310
You know I close this lecture you know and I thought to myself Why didn't I show my students how to

91
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,490
implement this with a class feature that we included in this that section.

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,640
OK so that's what I'm going to do right now.

93
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,080
Let's go ahead and do that would and implement this would push and we know that this looks ugly right

94
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,670
here.

95
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,520
Right.

96
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,940
So let's go ahead implement toast would push you.

97
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:38,310
So let's see what we've got to do first of all in this student up BHP page or we have to do is include

98
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,750
R javascript stuff from toast.

99
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,700
First of all we include the link right.

100
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:56,660
That's the first thing that we do include this link let's go to the top here and put a wry above and

101
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,730
let's include the

102
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,290
scripts.

103
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,790
OK.

104
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,690
So right here

105
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:17,330
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it all the way in the bottom let's see if they work all

106
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:24,550
the way before the body ends and now yep that looks good.

107
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,090
And I'm going to replaces alert ugly alert function

108
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,180
with the toast toasty Ah.

109
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:40,070
That success and let's see if this works.

110
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,570
OK.

111
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,670
So let's go to Pusha yeah let's refresh this.

112
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:52,410
Make sure that we have the new one so refreshing that one and I come back here

113
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,770
it's working but we have no data.

114
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,680
All right.

115
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,400
It's working.

116
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,100
We have no data.

117
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,220
There it's not we.

118
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,440
Our data is now working but that's working you see that.

119
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,530
Come back here.

120
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,410
That's perfect.

121
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,370
Let's see it in real it's something wrong with our data but that's OK.

122
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
Come back here we might have to string ify that data

123
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,220
let's see here.

124
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,720
That's a pusher right there.

125
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,420
Let's come back here refresh

126
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,000
and push right here.

127
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,480
Perfect.

128
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,460
OK so we have to work on that data.

129
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:55,900
Let's see something right here so I'm going to maybe put this in a variable my new data

130
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,010
like that and then maybe use tools for that.

131
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,440
Let's see what happens.

132
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,650
Toast to or that it says

133
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,560
OK my now using that variable there.

134
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Let's use implement some new

135
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:29,090
OK.

136
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,610
There we go.

137
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,680
OK so we know that toast lights strings.

138
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,530
OK.

139
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,390
All right guys hopefully that will help you implement this or maybe use it in your own projects.

140
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,990
And if you like you can give a thumbs up.

141
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,270
Right.

142
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,040
Anyway that with a rating works.

143
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,840
See you in the net select your guys take care.
