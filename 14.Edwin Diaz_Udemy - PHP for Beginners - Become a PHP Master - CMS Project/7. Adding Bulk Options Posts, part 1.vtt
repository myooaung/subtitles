00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.950
Or writes on this lecture we're going to be add in this functionality to our admin for Slash postop.

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.900
We're going to be adding a select with some options A to bunch here to apply whatever options we choose

3
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.340
here.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.650
And and we want to add a new polls.

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.840
We can go to the new post page by clicking this button right now this is just a placeholder.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.620
I'm just going to click enter and you're going to see it's just going to go ahead and disappear.

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.230
Let me just say this.

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.260
Make it disappear.

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.710
There we go see that.

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.350
So now we need to go to the view of polls that BHB page inside including admin and we need to add that

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.450
functionality.

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.970
So first thing that I wanted to do is wrap this whole table around with a tag or form

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.240
and go all the way down to where the table tag ends up again.

14
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.360
And let's just click went to the polls here.

15
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.700
All right.

16
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.220
All right.

17
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.600
So what.

18
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.320
Well let's get after this right here inside this table tag.

19
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.620
We're going to be inserting a couple of things.

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.370
So we're going to have a diff would it class of if I can.

21
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.460
Whoops sorry about that.

22
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:34.030
A div with a class of bulk options container.

23
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.470
And

24
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.120
here.

25
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.440
And I have already cut copy it down in the syle my right hand side.

26
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.510
And I just want to show you exactly what I'm doing.

27
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.470
Then I'm going to paste everything here.

28
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.060
But basically we are just doing a select thing you should be able to know how to do this since you should

29
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.700
know the amount.

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.840
All right.

31
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.220
So it's just a select and this is going to have some options.

32
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.440
All right.

33
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.240
Like this like that and we're going to pass some parameters there.

34
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.530
And if I show you right now it looks like this right.

35
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.200
Right now it looks like this we're going to need to have some classes and we need to add the two buns

36
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.000
right here.

37
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.540
So I already got a copy it down.

38
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.900
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to pasted in here right.

39
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.140
I just wanted to show you that that's what we are doing.

40
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.990
All right so let me just copy paste it right here.

41
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.830
All right.

42
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.830
So I'm just going to move a little bit and make it look ok I guess right there.

43
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.850
All right.

44
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.610
So you see the day that we were out in here with a class of four that's going to make it 33 percent.

45
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.990
And we also have some options here.

46
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.840
We have this select as a class a form control that's going to make it go all the way across.

47
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.690
It's going to make it look nice we use in Bootstrap.

48
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.520
By the way I have a course on that.

49
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.830
You know that if I just go to my courses and you'll see that Bush of course there we also have another

50
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.510
day of for you just to make this 33 percent or so with the with 43 percent I believe 33 percent.

51
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:25.790
And we have an input and we have a anchor tag here that's going to take us to ad pulls out BHB.

52
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.350
But we've got to add another parameter here I believe.

53
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.720
All right.

54
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.170
So if I go ahead and save this and refresh here we see that we have the foresight right here where we

55
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.540
don't how the function ID yet we have kind of a placeholder.

56
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.200
We need to add some functionality to it.

57
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.640
All right.

58
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.240
Right now is not doing anything.

59
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.860
So go ahead and copy this down I'm going to go back to it so you can see it.

60
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.940
All right.

61
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.010
Make sure you wrap everything on the form and just copy this functionality there.

62
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.610
And while this markup and I'll see you in the next lecture right.

63
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.920
Thank you so much for watching.

64
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.790
And you're doing great.

65
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.670
All right.

66
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.120
Take care
