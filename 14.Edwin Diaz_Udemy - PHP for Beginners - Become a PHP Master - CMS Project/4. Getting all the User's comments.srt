1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,750
OK so we're doing a lot of cool stuff here we going to fast because I already went to some of the things

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,380
where you guys in the scores we already know what to do right.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,310
So the next part is we got to jump in to comments.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,290
Let's good to are in.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,120
Go back here we got that taken care of.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,320
We got this post count taken care of.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,630
Let's go and move this

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,090
comeback and move this to the site.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,730
Organized it's a little bit

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,740
OK.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,000
So we got that.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,290
I'm going to press shift command shift tab and that's Should We're back here.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:56,330
Most editors that would go and hopes would go that's that's what I don't like messing around with that

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,760
right.

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,070
They should be.

16
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:17,050
This is the row.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,450
All right.

18
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,510
So

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,040
that is the role I'm going to put this come in here.

20
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,850
That's what that is.

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:37,650
So let's go to the next little box here that has some data here that we want we want to select all the

22
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,110
user's comments.

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,390
OK that's going to be a biggie there.

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,080
OK.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,890
So I'm going to come I'm going to.

26
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,680
Copy it and let's go to that user specific.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,390
Let's see.

28
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,110
Let's put this up a little bit.

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,950
Indication and the user specific.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:14,210
So let's create a function that is going to say get all user comments look how simple that was right.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,410
We know we don't need all this Querrey So we're going to make this easier.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,320
Perfit and this is going to be resold.

33
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,510
Now we're going to think about the querido right.

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,340
What is it.

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:37,160
How is our querido where Kuwaiti where the Kuwaiti that is so Spanish.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,720
All right.

37
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:45,310
So get users get oh user comments.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,320
So how can we achieve this.

39
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:57,200
Well we are going to select we're going to have to basically this is not just a user comments but post

40
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,740
user comments get all posts user comments.

41
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,610
OK.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,220
That's going to be a little bit of you know problem.

43
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,850
But don't worry I got your back on this and just going to take all that off remember that we do have

44
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,480
to count it at the end.

45
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,240
That's fine.

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:23,970
So we're going to have to join the tables here because we want to access the post table.

47
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,440
We're going to have to enter a joint and I did this in the course I didn't do it a lot but I did at

48
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,920
one time.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,810
So you should have an idea.

50
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:40,140
We're going to join these tables the posts and the comments on something they are related to.

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:48,530
Well we know that we have the post ID on the we know other post ID is equal to the comments.

52
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,900
Now when we are talking about specific columns after we join the table we need to the friends she gave

53
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,680
them.

54
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:04,750
Sometimes they do have the same name for the columns so might as well provide to us this syntax here.

55
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,990
Dot post ID OK so we separated by a dot.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,900
Thats how we differentiate some of the columns because sometimes they have the same name.

57
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,790
So the post posts ID is equal to the comments and its print is down a bit.

58
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,350
Well thats

59
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:35,300
the comments that comment on the score ID.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,960
OK.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,590
So we know that in the comments table we have this column right.

62
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,280
Lets double check it though.

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,420
We dont want to make a mistake right.

64
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,400
Well we actually do want to make a mistake when our So Rousse and we can see the comment post.

65
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,440
Id not comment is comment.

66
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,070
So there we go.

67
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,620
But but this is comments because this is the comments table thats the name of the table.

68
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,660
So we were differentiating by the name of the table.

69
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:16,630
Like I mentioned sometimes they do have the same gay the same name same column name.

70
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:22,620
But we have to use a table name first separated by dots with the column names.

71
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,010
So we make sure that we do that.

72
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,170
Let's return this.

73
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,070
Now we're not done yet because we won all the comments.

74
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,760
OK.

75
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,130
But we won the comments for their use of that's a little den.

76
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,200
So we were steaming somewhere right.

77
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,590
So where as my Phylis bring these down.

78
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:06,480
Where the user ID equals and it's actually break this into that they love the end user.

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,650
It's such a handy function right.

80
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,220
We should be getting something if we didn't make a mistake.

81
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,680
So let's go back to the index and what we need to do.

82
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:34,030
Records count records and put that function in there and that should give us while we want.

83
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,330
Now let's look at this from a quick.

84
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,260
Right now we have two comments.

85
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,530
We refresh we have those two comments.

86
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,090
Let's come back here.

87
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,840
Take that away from there.

88
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,510
And let's bring it all the way up right there.

89
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,670
So

90
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,090
but we see the last two comments I use are.

91
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,720
So if we go to comments we only have 2 comments right.

92
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:17,680
But if we gave that comment a no that another poster ID that does not belong to these user issue change.

93
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:26,460
So let's go to browse and we can see that the user only has one pulls and that pulls us to comments.

94
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:35,010
But if you give that comment a different post Id like 140 it should change to one comment for the user.

95
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,560
So 140.

96
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,620
Now go back to comments browse.

97
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,070
And this is give a comment here 140.

98
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,050
Let's go back to our dashboard and let's refresh and you can see that I come in one to one

99
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,160
who says he has three comments here three active.

100
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,070
But we haven't got to that yet.

101
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,180
We are working on this here perfects.

102
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,750
Let's go and jump into the next section.

103
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,320
Next lecture Take care guys how fun.
