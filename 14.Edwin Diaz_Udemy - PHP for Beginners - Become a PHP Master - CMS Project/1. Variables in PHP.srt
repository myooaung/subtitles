1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,780
All right so what is a variable.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,810
A variable is like a container.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,170
Variables are a container placeholder whatever you want to call it elements that we can use to store

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,200
data and then use that data by the variable name.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,150
So we can refer to that data by using the variables name.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:30,040
So let's say for example I make a variable called names inside that variable we put the name.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,550
Let's say for example Edwyn and then we can use a name without variable names to refer to that specific

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,210
name.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,280
Let me show you exactly what a variable is very was a very powerful and they're very very useful.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,570
We are using all kinds of programming languages and that is something that you need to actually use.

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,080
So let me show you an example how we create variables in how we use them.

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,570
So let's say for example I'm I used a blank that BHP and now don't get confused by all the files you

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,010
see here is you have that in your exercise files.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,310
All right so I'm going to use this blank that ph piano to do a Save As and this document and I'm going

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,250
to call these variables.

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,130
Sometimes I have more files than Then you depending on where you are on the lesson.

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,830
But all these files should be in your course.

18
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,620
That's the size files.

19
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,500
Right.

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,880
So I'm going to go ahead and open

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,170
a peach.

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,370
Peter I am going to close it right away.

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,230
So I want to show you exactly how we define variables.

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,890
Variables are defined in a very easy format.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,070
We use a dollar sign with HP.

26
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,450
Any changes in programming languages in some programming languages we use a word var.

27
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,580
But in this one we're going to be using a dollar sign following the name of the variable.

28
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,130
And I just want to name it this.

29
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,390
I can name it whatever I want.

30
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,600
I can even name and number if I want to.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,540
All right.

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,180
So I'm going to name it name and then that's it.

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,310
The variable is done.

34
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,610
Now keep in mind that is very empty.

35
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,150
You're not even using this variable right now.

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,740
Most of the time where you are going to see is that you're going to see the variable and you're going

37
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,770
to see the variable declare here and assign a value right away.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,820
That's what this is the way you want to see the variable.

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,900
It's not you're never going to find it like this because variables we make it for reason we make them

40
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,480
to use and to store data.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,660
So we use something called an assignment operator right here.

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,020
So I assigned the variable name or assign it a value right whatever.

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:41,820
So we want to just assign it right now when we use for strings we know we know we use double quotes

44
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,710
or apostrophes where we can use single quotes to pull strings in there.

45
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,450
All right this is how we write strings or tÃªtes in programming language.

46
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,730
Most of the time we need to put quotes around that this is not in ph B but in many different programming

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:03,120
languages if we want to store numbers in there actually them you just put it in about and make let's

48
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:11,520
make another variable called number and we can go ahead and numbers don't have courts.

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,280
This is how BHB knows is a number.

50
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,550
We don't put quotes around it.

51
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,610
All right so now how can we use these variables how can we use them.

52
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,300
Well let's use a function called Eckel and let's echo this out.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,050
Let's open the browser by clicking on this little like right here and we can see right now that we are

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,610
displaying that name.

55
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,690
Edwin de-value Edwin by using the variable name.

56
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,140
So now we can refer to this data right here by using the variable name and we can do the same thing

57
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,080
with this one.

58
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,400
All right so now how why are the typical use and how we usually write variables.

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,630
Well this is the normal syntax right since that's I mean the way you write it you can write variables

60
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,660
like this.

61
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,830
Capital if you want.

62
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,490
You can put the first capital you can put on the score then you can use name like this however you want.

63
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,040
You can name it you can name however you think it's good for you.

64
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,610
Now the best for best practice is the best way to write is all lowercase.

65
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:28,020
And then if you have a second word you uppercase the first letter and then you finished writing all

66
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,590
lowercase.

67
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,840
This is the first the best format to write variables.

68
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,670
Another format that I use is this one on the score list and then sometimes I overcame this one here.

69
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,160
All right you will see it like this.

70
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,620
OK.

71
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,950
We see it very often like this.

72
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,080
There are many different ways.

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,380
Don't do this.

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,270
These are bad form as a matter of fact I'm going to write them down.

75
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,450
This is OK.

76
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,970
I going to write that all right and this is not OK.

77
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,930
What I'm about to do right now this one here.

78
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,370
Don't write your variables like this.

79
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,560
The reason is because again it can be.

80
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,850
It can get confused by thinking that you are so strapped in something from something.

81
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:24,600
So this is a format you cannot store a variable with a number like this it will not work.

82
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,610
No you see we get an error right here.

83
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:33,350
When I wrote that OK we got an error right here also.

84
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,460
And now we're good.

85
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,670
You see this is bad for man just going to comment it out.

86
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,490
We can also keep in mind that when you write a variable keep in mind that is variable.

87
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,880
And then to write it right here

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,860
this verbal and this very well are different even though they are named the same.

89
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,450
The reason is because it's case sensitive.

90
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:07,490
So any word any letter that you change here will make this variable different from this one.

91
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:16,550
All right so even if you have something like this and you just have this one lower case this is a totally

92
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,510
different variable than this right here.

93
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:20,890
All right.

94
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,510
I mean you can play around with it and find out for yourself there.

95
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,800
All right there are many different ways we can declare variables but make sure they don't have a number

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,830
of them make sure they don't have hyphen in between.

97
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,400
Right.

98
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,720
And always make sure that you write the same variable again if you want to use and make sure that you

99
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,670
write it exactly the same.

100
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,510
If if you are referring to the same variable.

101
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:52,000
Ok so now we can store many different data data types in here and what our data size.

102
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,000
Well we have many different data types in programming.

103
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,590
This is a string data type.

104
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,730
That's right.

105
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,740
We have numbers.

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,930
This is an integer and we could also have a floating point number.

107
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,850
That's what it's called because he has a decimal place right here.

108
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,500
Now this type of numbers in ph B are take more memory right because we have a decimal point so we need

109
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,850
to do.

110
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,000
It will be more processing for this type of numbers.

111
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,270
Keep in mind that was if you enclose these numbers in quotes apostrophe's you change the data type to

112
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,510
a string to what tÃªtes.

113
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,070
All right.

114
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,160
So now ph is going to treat this as a string not a number.

115
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:45,920
So even though BHB will kind of sometimes represent this as a number it with It would think that it

116
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,320
is a string.

117
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,380
Even though you can still add this number distrain with another string mph we would still do it.

118
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,900
But in most cases it would not do it.

119
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,160
So you can not make calculations like you can make with the data number type.

120
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,710
Right.

121
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,340
Because this is a strange BHB is not going to allow that.

122
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,860
In some cases it will in some cases they were not.

123
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,190
So better get used to it when you write in numbers.

124
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,620
Never put quotes around it.

125
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,110
OK I noted that I wanted to talk to you about concatenation.

126
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,050
I'm going to take this moment here to talk to you about that.

127
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,210
The reason because I don't need to make another video is to tell you that you can put data together

128
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,350
in BHB we'd have a dot which is called concatenation.

129
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,010
And for example this variable here it has this value.

130
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,870
I want to put this value Edwyn right which is this value.

131
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,520
I want to put it together with a number 100 so I'm going to copy this variable right here.

132
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,150
I put a dot right here and you're going to copy there as you can see here.

133
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,650
You already printed out your for me because that is a value right here for this variable.

134
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,430
OK.

135
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:05,420
Now even if it's all together we can put a little separation there by concatenating a string and an

136
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,230
empty string as you can see moved up it moved a little bit to the right.

137
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,960
So as you can see this concatenation will smash worst together.

138
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,490
It will put worse.

139
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,100
It would not only put words but any data type that you you know you can.

140
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,770
You want to put together use a dot.

141
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,430
Make sure that you have a dot between this element and the other element right here.

142
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,780
Right.

143
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,850
Right now we have a string in between here so we need another concatenation there to concatenate the

144
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,030
string with a variable.

145
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,560
Ok of course you can.

146
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,260
This is how you put things together.

147
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:44,970
All right.

148
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,860
Just letting you know not nothing that you can do also and I'll probably show you X amount if I always

149
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,200
show you another video here.

150
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,230
I think we are we are good with time here.

151
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,680
So this is it.

152
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,530
This is it.

153
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,580
That said I as a matter of fact let me show you a couple more things actually.

154
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,300
Let me take one minute to do.

155
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:12,110
All right so we know that we with this function we can we can also use I mean just write another variable

156
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,220
here.

157
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,770
We can pool all kinds of data I told you about and we can put the mail in there so we can write something

158
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,200
like this.

159
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,510
Hello.

160
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,630
The next e-mail H-1 talian there enclosed right here.

161
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
All right.

162
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,270
And this is going to do two things.

163
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,620
I'm going to show you what they're going to do right now.

164
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,090
Look at this.

165
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:44,870
So we were able to use a HDMI LTI inside a string and put it aside into this variable right here and

166
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,640
we were able to display below.

167
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,680
So we can assign a simple tax to variables.

168
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
Keep that in mind.

169
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,300
We can assign images to variables we can assign the many different types of data into a variable but

170
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:05,690
always makes Always keep in mind that we can only find one value at a time.

171
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,360
We cannot go ahead and put our coal mine here and put another coalman assign different values like we

172
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,630
can assign.

173
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,300
You know we can assign different values and I will let you know how that works later on when we talk

174
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,790
about race.

175
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,360
All right.

176
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,410
So just keep in mind that you can only assign one value with the variables later on we're going to be

177
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,260
talking about another different type of variable that we can assign multiple values to it.

178
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,050
All right so keep that in mind.

179
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,680
Anyway I hope you were able to get some valuable knowledge out of this lesson and I'll see you in the

180
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,460
next lecture.

181
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,950
Take.
