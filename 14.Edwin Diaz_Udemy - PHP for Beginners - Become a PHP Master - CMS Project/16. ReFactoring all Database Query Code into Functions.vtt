00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.970
All right I made it my choice to actually show you how to do some more refactoring with this little

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.950
couple applications that we have here.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.370
So we are going to be facing some of these things there.

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.770
Well it is called refactoring.

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.780
Once you're done with your application then you want to organize some of the data into modular pieces.

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.350
So let's go ahead and do that.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.360
We have a couple of pieces here that we need to organize and we have inside in my as well for them.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.740
There we have logging create here we will like to put this into a function.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.110
It will be very nice to put into a function so we can't call it from down here.

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.620
So let's go ahead and do that.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.920
Let's go ahead and do that real quick.

12
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:52.230
Then will jump into the read file and make sure that all the files are correctly correct also and put

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.020
into functions.

14
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.790
All right.

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.240
So all right so this one here this is the create.

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.490
So this is automatically every time we go into the form we put something in there and we create something

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.520
for us right.

18
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.280
Well we need to actually put let it let the user know that they are going to be creating something in

19
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.620
this case the user is you.

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:17.940
So we're just going to put a h one here and call this create just to know and a little class here from

21
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.170
Bootstrap called Test Center if I can put this inside that would be nice.

22
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.370
That center is going to center my right my form.

23
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.510
There we go create a we know that that's going to create.

24
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.270
Let's make sure that binds them.

25
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.740
Also that says Create.

26
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.840
Right.

27
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.830
There we go.

28
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.290
So at least we know that.

29
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.320
Now let's go ahead and put all of this into a function.

30
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.400
They just grab it from here.

31
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.310
This is how this whole thing could actually grabbed the whole thing here.

32
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.510
This whole thing even if it's submit we can just grab it there and then put it into the functions and

33
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.670
we can just put these all the way on top

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.930
and let's just make sure that function.

35
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.660
This is going to say create rows.

36
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.790
That's the name of it.

37
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.110
We're going to put this into a function and let's just wrap it up right here and then we can grab the

38
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.690
name of the function and go back to the Create.

39
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.560
Let's first include it right here.

40
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.250
Let's put the function here so we don't lose they lose the losing memory right.

41
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.850
And let's do another include here for functions that BHB

42
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.620
array

43
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.750
and we can just call this here.

44
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.740
All right let's use use another one here and let's just call this

45
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.460
we can call these anywhere we want.

46
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.350
As a matter of fact we can call in the body if we wanted to.

47
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.140
I'm just going to color here.

48
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.080
That's fine with me.

49
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.310
All right.

50
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.210
You just take that off go back to Funches and make sure we save it here and we need to put a variable

51
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.940
global in here.

52
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.710
Hopefully you're not getting lost here OK.

53
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.540
It's very simple stuff fact when you already went through the wars.

54
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.190
All right so let's go back to the create and we're here.

55
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.530
So let's test it out and see if it works OK.

56
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.890
All right.

57
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.740
So let's create as.

58
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.590
Yes let's just make sure there.

59
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.090
And so on password students create perfect.

60
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.820
And let's go back and check.

61
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.430
Perfect.

62
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.540
So that's working in Dallas a lot better doesn't it.

63
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.000
Now I want a massive sheet that will say probably create or something that right every time we submit

64
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.910
this file.

65
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.550
So let's go back to functions and let's do that.

66
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.250
So if submit I submit this goes through.

67
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.710
All right.

68
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.580
I want to create something like this is going to go to so pompon perfect.

69
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.360
I got the query.

70
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.020
Let me just condense this a little bit here right.

71
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.280
Just keep it separated for you.

72
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.370
Actually.

73
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.380
All right.

74
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.910
All right.

75
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.140
So what I want to do if this is submitted.

76
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:06.580
I want to say and he goes through if not resolved if if else just let's just put a message here.

77
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.580
If it went through we're just going to say recreate it right.

78
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:21.150
Record created that would be nice right there.

79
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.430
That's just something that we understand.

80
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.550
Let's go here on the Logan underscore create.

81
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.270
Right.

82
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:38.170
And let's just say really meant for an end is for this.

83
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.070
So you're right it is.

84
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.250
I don't know about this don't write what I'm saying and what I'm writing OK.

85
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.450
And going to create all right create and now we got record created right here.

86
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.830
You can even put a CSSA one here.

87
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.390
OK.

88
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.280
We just want a little feedback saying that the record was created.

89
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.190
All right so hopefully that will help you out when you are creating your little test application if

90
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.390
you want to do that.

91
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:08.380
All right so now let's go to the read page and let's make sure that we have three page.

92
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.210
Don't we just have this showing here.

93
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.790
But you could put this data into a table if you want.

94
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.100
And you can put the idea into one column on the table they use an image to another column.

95
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.620
You can play around with those fields.

96
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.550
We're not going to do much here.

97
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.310
All right.

98
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.420
We're not going to do much here.

99
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.670
So what about the update.

100
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.850
Let's check the update.

101
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.360
All right.

102
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.050
So the other day let's put a title there.

103
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.540
OK.

104
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.920
I think if it looks better if we put a title so let's go to the day one.

105
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.620
All right.

106
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.880
Just make sure we have any working files there.

107
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.960
That's all I was doing.

108
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:56.480
And let's go to the forum here and let's just say each one update.

109
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.150
All right and let's go to the functions and then we have it right here right.

110
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:12.880
And then we're going to put a message just like we did when we created this else and this would be in

111
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.400
the update table right here.

112
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.700
Let's just base that in there and we're going to say record Recker data.

113
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.080
All right.

114
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.930
Let's go to the of the file.

115
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.330
All right.

116
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:37.530
And we're going to be updating number 13 and we're going to say something like I don't know Mr. Mr.

117
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.260
basketball

118
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.940
crazy fast we're here and going to click Update and he's going to say Recker update it.

119
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.440
All right cool.

120
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.540
Well come here refresh us make sure the records update.

121
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.000
Mr. Basketball.

122
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.900
Now let's go to that one.

123
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.980
Let's go up here the.

124
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.370
All right.

125
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.780
So yeah we do need something there.

126
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.200
All right Sunday of day we are good.

127
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.630
Here we go this and we don't need it of say here.

128
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.940
If set we can include in the function the other side.

129
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:20.900
All right so let's first let's go ahead and.

130
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:21.920
All right.

131
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.490
Let's go to the delete one that just fits the delete.

132
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.240
We're going to take this say out of here too.

133
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:34.630
All right so the delete one doesn't say delete so let's make sure he does delete.

134
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.550
And I think the lead.

135
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:47.850
Let's just put a little class there to make it tetch center to make it centered at center.

136
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.940
Perfect.

137
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:57.720
And let's go let's go to functions here.

138
00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.970
We have the elves.

139
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.480
Let's just take it.

140
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.430
Let's go to the delete.

141
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.430
Let's put it right here right here.

142
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.130
Deleted

143
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.660
it.

144
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.720
And let's just get the statement here right.

145
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.500
Let's do that.

146
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.050
Let's get that.

147
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:27.000
If we don't need it here just do it here.

148
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.410
All right.

149
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:34.290
Let's go to the the lead the functions and that was a deadly one right.

150
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.930
Let's just make it here eat right here

151
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.230
OK.

152
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.230
They live here.

153
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:47.750
All right.

154
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.190
Perfect.

155
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.990
So that's working this is the lead.

156
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.770
This record.

157
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.060
Perfect 12 deleted.

158
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.300
All right.

159
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.470
So I mean we're looking good.

160
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.240
We can we can take this off if we wanted to.

161
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.250
All right.

162
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:10.920
Now you can extend the function and just delete whatever records you want to really depending you King

163
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:19.330
the values here if you want by making that function select from users and pick all day key.

164
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.820
I mean you can't stand it and make it really nice.

165
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.120
But anyway we're not going to do that.

166
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.930
That would take a long time on this.

167
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.040
Of course I don't want to take more of your time.

168
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.680
That would be.

169
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.790
That would be probably an advantage BHB tutorial of course.

170
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.780
So I think we are done here.

171
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.830
Let's just do a check of date.

172
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.600
Let's just take this out of here.

173
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.800
Let's just do the same thing we did we deal with the delete.

174
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.710
Take that out.

175
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.140
Saving them come back to functions.

176
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.350
This was the update.

177
00:10:53.350 --> 00:11:00.650
All right let's go to functions and let's do the funk update right here whoops

178
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.010
right there.

179
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.440
Perfect.

180
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.750
Good.

181
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.460
All right.

182
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.160
So we are good to go.

183
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.830
All right so if for those of you that follow this we're factoring great congratulations.

184
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.700
You learn how to refactor some of the data that we got here.

185
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:28.600
And for those of you that want to see more refactoring watch the next video.

186
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:34.150
If not just jump into the next section because you know what I want to do some more refactoring here

187
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.190
in this document could do a lot better than what he's doing right now so if you want more refactoring

188
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.110
keep watching.

189
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:40.660
Thank you
