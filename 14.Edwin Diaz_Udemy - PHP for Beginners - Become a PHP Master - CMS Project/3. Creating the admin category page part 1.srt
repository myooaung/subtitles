1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:09,100
All right so we have done some things here in the admin related meetings and organizing some of the

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:17,160
mail right now it's time for us to make something happen and we have a table called categories in the

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,370
database and we are going to be explained at page right here.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,700
When we click on this link we want to go to our page and we want something to come and display here.

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,160
So we're going to be building the forms that we need.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,690
If you don't remember go back to the lecture where I introduced you to the see a mess and see how that

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,550
looks all right.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,710
So let's go ahead and open our co-editor and say add.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,500
I'm going to close this and say admen fine admin.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,720
I'm going to make a new file inside there.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,890
Do we want to make this includes or do we want to let's just make this right.

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,370
In the end it's categories actually categories of speech.

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,750
You're right.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,820
So let's call these categories at BHB.

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,220
And that's just in the root of the admin folder.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,370
Right.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,170
And here what we want to do is we want some of the data from the in that in here.

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,940
All right so I'm going to and just write

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:26,340
select everything here and I'm going to copy it into the categories right now if you notice here we

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,540
are missing some of we are missing the database.

21
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,220
All right.

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:38,080
So we have the database in includes in here actually.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,590
Is it includes not includes here is and includes right here is where we need to go there and get it.

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,880
But I don't want to keep doing this over and over for every page.

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,400
Right.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:58,680
So what I want to do is include this file into the head or actually of our document and of this file

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,310
just go to admin and do that on the head.

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,630
So let's go into includes And let's go to the head of the admin and we can call this admin Ketterer.

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,340
So you don't get confused we can rename it if you want.

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,670
Let's call these out.

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,050
Well let's just leave it like that.

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,920
But just in case for you so you don't want to get confused.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,250
Make sure that you are in the admin folder and includes added that BHB.

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,070
All right.

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:32,160
So here I want to include that and I'm just going to say BHP is going to write something down here and

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,010
going to include this.

37
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:43,500
So we are going to include this once let's do it once I think this function should do fine with us because

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,730
one can do this once.

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,650
We don't want it to be including this all over the place.

40
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,600
So actually just leave it like this for now and then later on we will actually come and fix our bar

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,670
and secure our data.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,750
But right now we don't need it.

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,510
So we know that this is outside.

44
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,730
So we need to go outside and find a folder called includes the B.

45
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,410
PH be all right because we need to go outside the admin and we need to go to another folder called includes

46
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:12,910
right.

47
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,400
So now let's check it to see if this connection is working.

48
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,390
So let's go to our admen that's.

49
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:28,060
And here I want to check on that connection real quick to see if we got a connection.

50
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:37,440
So let's just say let's open the tag here and let's just check on that connection real quick and let's

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,000
just say if connection

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,390
then we want to display something we don't actually we don't need.

53
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,070
If we were writing just one line we just you say echo something.

54
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,710
Geez if I can get it right that would be nice.

55
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,570
All right Con Are we just going to say con real quick just to see if this is working.

56
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,580
Let's go back to this refresh and we can see right here.

57
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,200
You can see what he's saying is in that black spot right here.

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,080
So we are connected.

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,930
All right.

60
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:21,350
So now that we are connected we need to go to that category speech and includes header categories right

61
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,530
here on the working perfect.

62
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,230
Let's go to the content of the categories.

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Let's build a first form and see we have some time on this.

64
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,110
Build for first forne.

65
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,320
And this one we're going to have a diff

66
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:48,740
shelterless create a div of First we create a diff of call us with this.

67
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:56,310
Actually this is a class Bushrod class and you just get to make our diff half or the page size half

68
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,090
of the screen is a 12 column grid so this is a six column meaning that is half of the screen.

69
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,030
OK.

70
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:14,040
And here what we want to create is a form that we can add some data into our database.

71
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:23,850
All right so now that we have this here and we want to say we have a day off with a class of form group

72
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:37,030
and just trying to gather my thoughts ending input tÃªtes this is going to be cut Title.

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,240
They just put that in there right away.

74
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,980
Make sure that you put this here title.

75
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:51,560
This is where we're going to be put in the title of our categories.

76
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,460
All right.

77
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,080
So we need two forms one on the left and one on the right.

78
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,290
So we have this div form class there is going to make or form look nice.

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:11,390
We also need a nother div for input and this type is going to be set.

80
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:25,680
We are going to have that name change to suit MIT and the value is just going to say category category.

81
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,740
All right.

82
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,410
And that should be enough.

83
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:38,150
And let's just go ahead and make this a little more so I can put something else in here.

84
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,950
What I want to put is a class just to make this look nice.

85
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:50,430
And the class is let me take this out of here where you can see I don't want you to miss anything between

86
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,140
the two classes primary.

87
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,240
All right.

88
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,070
All right.

89
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,250
And this also has a class of

90
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,650
its own.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,230
Let's gather my thoughts with the class.

92
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,600
All right.

93
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,680
So this class is going to be form control and this is going to just going to make things look nice.

94
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,250
All right.

95
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,650
So let's see how that looks for now.

96
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,850
That's the only way we can go in.

97
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,860
Let's go to categories.

98
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,470
You've put a link here to categories.

99
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:33,330
PH B we can see we are getting there and this is this half of the screen like I said before let's put

100
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,300
a label on that and make it look a little nicer.

101
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,380
So let's just make it bigger.

102
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:47,760
Here we go put a little label on this right here and this is for cat type.

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,150
All right.

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:56,430
And just going to put cat title and just a little different there and category title

105
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,510
categories.

106
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,910
I'm just going to put this category there that's fine.

107
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,430
Let's go back to let's see how that looks refresh.

108
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,640
All right.

109
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,530
So we got the first one here right.

110
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,330
I'm going to leave the rest for the next video we're getting in we need to be actually one table here

111
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,490
on the right hand side.

112
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,830
And we need to be another form that we are going to be displaying with some quotes and Javascript.

113
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,610
All right a problem is it won't be hard.

114
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,790
It just takes a little time.

115
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,450
All right.

116
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,830
So anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you on the next lecture.

117
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,410
Take care.
