Hi welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,790
I mean the AD user page here and I just want to you know let you know that we're going to be adding

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,910
a little feature here that will let us know when our users create it.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:19,180
So for example I type in I create a user here and type in subscriber and whatever e-mail.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,320
Right.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,410
And some password add user.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,430
We don't see any message here to let us know that that was successful right.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,950
That's not pretty cool.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,350
Even though the user is being created already we need to make sure that something is there to let us

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,380
know right.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,230
We need to put some notifications that would be nice right.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,940
So let's go ahead and do that.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,270
Let's go to our user page and that we're being admin includes.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,070
And then add underscore user right in here for me is online dirty but I don't know what line is for

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,360
you but this is the form here to the user.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,260
And right below the square with this function confirm Querrey we're going to type in something here.

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:14,700
We're going to Eckl something out and we're going to Eccl. some strings saying something like user created.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,800
Right.

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,140
Then I want to concatenate a link here.

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,520
Space actually.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,050
So it's cutting edge space.

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,850
There we go.

23
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:37,520
And then I want to put a link and it's put a link right here.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,180
This link is going to say something like I'm actually going to take.

25
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,530
It's going to take us back to users that BHP.

26
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,310
So that's always going to do.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,540
And it's just going to say them just put it here.

28
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,190
Let me just close this before I forget.

29
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,180
I'm trying to figure out what he's going to say.

30
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,530
But we can make it say something like new users.

31
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:04,890
All right.

32
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,760
And you can be as creative as you want.

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,260
I think one of the videos we learn how we can put a class here and make this look like a different color

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,860
or something like that.

35
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,720
One of the bull street classes.

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,830
So you like I said I just want to show you that this you know this is good to do.

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,000
You know and how this is done.

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,120
And then you can be creative.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
Let's go ahead and try this.

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,670
Let's make sure that we save it.

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,910
Hope you having a great day today guys.

42
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,880
Is a new day to start something new and to do you 100 percent everything you do.

43
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,700
Why give less.

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,350
You know so let's just call this roll and bow.

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:56,340
Name some user name and some email and password and user and we can see that user is being created and

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,650
then we can click here aved take us to the user page or to the users page.

47
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,140
So I think this is super useful.

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,280
You know you're welcome to play around with it.

49
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,270
And thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

50
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,730
Take care
