1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,860
Or I saw in the last video we modify some of this here.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,670
Let's go ahead and try to display some data now.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,860
Right.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,670
So first thing that we want to do is we want to get everything from users.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,910
There we go.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,660
And we want to change this and we're going to say Sallet users

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,780
as you can see it.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,960
Now most of the time what we're doing now is copying and pasting more refine and doing simple things

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,460
like that.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,350
So super easy to do now right.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,950
So now let's look at our table in the database.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,150
You see the names of it.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,050
I think we name everything users almost users and we need to make sure that data is correct here on

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,560
this site.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,960
So let's put this here.

16
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,060
There we go.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,410
So we got the user their user ID so they get that here user ID.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
What else we got.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,740
User name what else.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,580
User password

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,490
user password.

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,180
What else.

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,880
And after that password we got the first name

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:32,460
and user last name.

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,420
User email

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,270
and user M.H..

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,030
All right what else.

28
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,470
Anything else we want to get out of there

29
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,900
let's just get it out and get everything out.

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,090
User role just because we're not going to use it just because we're not going to use it here visually

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,350
doesn't mean that we're not going to use the end user internally.

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:06,830
All right.

33
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,340
So user username user password user first name I'm just checking all the fields here.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,710
Make sure that we have everything we need.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,340
All right.

36
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,290
Perfect one it's I saw something here that I needed to do but.

37
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,300
OK.

38
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,590
Right here we need to modify this.

39
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,430
So you're going to copy this and put it right here.

40
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:36,810
Make sure you do the same thing is better to copy and paste actually because if you try to do it thinking

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,180
that you're not going to make a mistake believe me.

42
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,620
Super easy to make a mistake.

43
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,840
I hope you are enjoying the course.

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,700
If you pay attention and you do what I'm doing here in the course you would do very good you would succeed

45
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,760
in BHB for sure.

46
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,150
Right.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,630
So.

48
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,240
All right.

49
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,800
So just let's just verify that this is all correct.

50
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,080
We can just double click here.

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:20,010
OK that's fine.

52
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,040
All right.

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,710
Actually that that is Edita had the same feature as another editor that I was using you double clicking

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,590
and we matched the same keyword.

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,850
But I guess if you let me see if you if they are the same.

56
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,430
Now it doesn't have a feature.

57
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,170
Maybe is a plug in somewhere for this but this one doesn't have that.

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,810
So let's go ahead and echo some of this stuff out real quick.

59
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,450
As a matter of fact that in his video is already long enough on the next one we're going to be finishing

60
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,060
this off and displaying some information.

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,760
I think we're we're done with us doing this one here right.

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,710
So in the next lecture we're going to be continuing this and hopefully we'll get it to display some

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,420
data.

64
00:03:59,430 --> 00:03:59,880
Thank you.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,130
And I see you in the next lecture.
