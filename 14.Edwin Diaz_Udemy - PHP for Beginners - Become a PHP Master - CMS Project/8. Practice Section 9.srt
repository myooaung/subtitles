00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,610
Hi welcome back on this section here we are going to be learning about we're now learning more reinforcing

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,430
what we learn about cookie sessions and get super glue right.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,660
We already did the form.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,510
So if you did not learn enough about the form go back and watch it.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,050
But on this one we just got Cookie sessions and they get super global right.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,990
So if you're ready I'm ready.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,480
Let's go ahead and do that.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,090
So we are in Section nine here under practical Apfel are nine dopy.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,370
HB not nine.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,980
The HB.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,340
Right.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,890
That is the file.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,620
So here is just asking us to create a link saying Click here and set the link ref to Bassem parameters

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,670
are used to get super global to see it.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,500
So we know how to do that we know how to put a link them put some parameters in pull the data out of

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,200
the array.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,950
We know how to set a cookie that expires in a week.

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,040
We know how to do that.

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,850
And we also know how to do sessions so go ahead and post this video.

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,810
Go ahead and do that.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,230
If you have any problems go watch out all the video about cookies or GED or whatever you using your

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,730
sessions and make sure that you do it before you come here because we're going to compare a cold and

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,390
make sure don't do the same thing I did on the other villagers do something similar.

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:15,890
All right.

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:16,870
So it a video.

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,620
Go ahead and do it.

27
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,510
All right so hopefully you were able to do it.

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,330
And if not don't worry I got your back right here.

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,080
So let's go going to open our BHB tag.

30
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,180
And what I'm going to do is the first thing is create a link.

31
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:38,650
It's a matter of fact I'm just going to leave this here like this via a little link right here.

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,870
This link is just going to say we're just going to refer to the same page we were on because I want

33
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,660
to display the values here.

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm going to pass on parameters right here.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,260
I'm going to call these ID 100 actually.

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:58,390
I'm going to call this source and just kind of make this sors to be thousand.

37
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,130
Some number there.

38
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,130
Right.

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,860
All right.

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,760
Perfect.

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,270
So I think I'm good here right with the link.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,240
So now what we need to do is we need to check for this because if we don't check we get an error.

43
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,100
We need to check to see if this is set.

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:21,420
So we are going to use this function is set and we're going to check for that super global Get remember

45
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:31,710
that and remember that this is the key in the associative array that is going to bring back.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,120
So I'm just going to check for that key there source if the source is good.

47
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:43,010
I want to echo that source and then call this whole thing right here.

48
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,060
Boom.

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,190
All right so I think we're good here.

50
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,780
Let's check it out.

51
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:57,560
Just refresh refresh again or save it and make sure that we save a refresh.

52
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,770
All right.

53
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,220
We're getting an input here was on.

54
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,620
Oh I forgot to say put the words here.

55
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,030
Click here.

56
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,900
All right.

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,620
Forgot that little detail right.

58
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,610
Can we get it right.

59
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,340
Can we get it right.

60
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,430
Here we go refresh.

61
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,160
And now we're good so we see that when we click on it we get this value right here so we're pulling

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,780
information from the get.

63
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,600
We're sending it and we're putting it right here.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
Perfect.

65
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,230
All right so we did the first part here.

66
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,060
Let's go ahead and do the second part.

67
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:42,250
Let's just first concatenate this and make sure that we have a space cut in a b or tag here.

68
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,540
There we go.

69
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,300
Now what we have when we put the other function we we have some space.

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,850
So now we need to set a cookie.

71
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,810
So you remember how to do that right.

72
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,980
All right so one of the first thing that I go into that going to delete my history of and I'm doing

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,770
this I'm sorry guys and Andrew is in they are doing this you know the monitor because I don't want to

74
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,680
take anything out of here on this site.

75
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,370
Right.

76
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,050
So I did it in my my my cookies and I will delete my

77
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,450
not my browsing data but will delete all my cooking my my browsing data and my cookies.

78
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,140
That's what I'm deleting and the other one.

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,200
If you don't remember that as a matter of fact you bring the page here to this site and show you how

80
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,930
to do that.

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,920
Let me just show you right here.

82
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,240
So you go to your settings.

83
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,910
This is chrome by the way.

84
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,170
I don't like to move my things from here but that's fine settings.

85
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:51,370
And we go to show event settings content settings and this is how we delete the cookies right here or

86
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,070
cookies and we just delete them here.

87
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,360
All right.

88
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,860
And the browsing of course we deleted by history and then we delete all right here.

89
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,070
Clear.

90
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,830
All right.

91
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:12,110
So just a quick demonstration there but now so now we need to create a cookie so how we do that.

92
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:19,790
Take this out of your screen little Cookie Cookie Cookie right here.

93
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,460
And as a matter of fact let's go all the way to the top of the document here and let's create one here.

94
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,970
I don't think it's gonna affect those in any way but it's just going to give us some more space here.

95
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,740
BHB All right.

96
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,390
So the first thing that we hear about we need to pass remember we need to use a function called Set

97
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,680
cookie and we need to pass it a couple of parameters three parameters either a matter of fact and then

98
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,260
we can pass it on any parameters we want.

99
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,920
So we've got three parameters we've got to pass it.

100
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:03,210
All right we need to pass the name so their name here and here we need to pass the values of why the

101
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,630
value is going to be this is the value.

102
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,080
I'm just going to pass this on.

103
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,120
Why not.

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,970
All right.

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,860
All right.

106
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
So and now the expiration.

107
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,020
We're going to pass this on numbers here multiply and this I can make a variable request just to make

108
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,100
it more clear than what.

109
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,330
That's what it is.

110
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,710
And actually expiration that just make it more.

111
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,420
That's the reason.

112
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,670
And I could have just made these variables too but I don't want to do that.

113
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,260
I don't need to.

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,330
So let's use that time function to get all of the seconds from 1972 to now.

115
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,820
Let's add that just like we did on the lecture right.

116
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,700
We're going to add some numbers here to get to seconds get the seconds for the week.

117
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,260
So we're going to multiply.

118
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:03,830
Sixty seconds science 60 Minutes times 24 hours in the day time seven.

119
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,180
All right this would give us all the seconds in one week multiply.

120
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,420
All right.

121
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,820
And then will not multiply but we multiply this and we go to seconds for the whole week.

122
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,530
Let's put that here.

123
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,360
All right so now this was set a cookie for us when we visit this page.

124
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,570
Why did the cookie said that we can look at it right.

125
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,390
So we got.

126
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,550
Just make sure that we have this correct and let's go ahead and visit that page.

127
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,170
Let's go ahead and take this.

128
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,890
All right.

129
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,820
So let's go check it out.

130
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,220
History actually settings

131
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,240
show event settings

132
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,940
constant settings called cookies local's one cookie with click on it the name.

133
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,600
That's it.

134
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,530
You put the name that I gave the cookie and when I click on it you can see that this says this is their

135
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,310
value.

136
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,940
Separated by this plus symbol C means it's a space.

137
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,580
Right so don't get that wrong.

138
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,090
So even the time when it was created.

139
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,420
Right.

140
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,100
Accessible.

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,570
Yes.

142
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,620
It is accessible to a script.

143
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,370
So that means applications can access this.

144
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,120
All right so now that we said the cookie now we see the value.

145
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,760
So let's go down here and let's see the value of your task here just in case.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,450
And let's just check if that's the same function again.

147
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,180
It's set actually this too happy to be tagging you probably saw that radio I had a Ph.

148
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,780
Peter there.

149
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,970
All right so you guys if I'm taking too long with this.

150
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,760
All right so this do cookie because that's the Superguy over there was not really that super glue like

151
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,210
the rest but it is close to right.

152
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,870
And let's just check for the name.

153
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,250
What is the name of this cookie right here.

154
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,390
Perfect.

155
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,280
Let's check for that.

156
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,460
That is set.

157
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,730
Then we do something here.

158
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,760
All right.

159
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,720
So what do we do.

160
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:20,430
We are going to ekal can we echo that cookie dough.

161
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,630
Echo.

162
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,740
Why not right.

163
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,420
Let's take it out and we.

164
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,870
We go there we go so we echo the value of the name or that cookie.

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,840
Perfect.

166
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,370
So we echoing that cookie dough and we can get some more value out of it.

167
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,840
But I don't want to get into that in this sense.

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,650
We got to go and start a session.

169
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,370
All right so how do we start a session.

170
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,910
Do you remember that.

171
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,430
No.

172
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,960
All right.

173
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,960
Let me show you the store Session right here.

174
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,910
So the first thing that we are going to be doing is starting.

175
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:03,320
So we first have to make a function and do you remember the function is called I give you one more chance.

176
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,920
All right.

177
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,000
You got it.

178
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,530
You are totally right.

179
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,740
SESSIONS start is a function right.

180
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,220
Actually sesshin.

181
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,650
There we go.

182
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,750
All right.

183
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,580
So once you put this in the heads right here is going to start a session.

184
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:28,210
And if you go back to it and we refresh this document right here we go back.

185
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:38,450
You already have a session started in one cookie for that last count and settings cookies two cookies

186
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,580
you see that click on it and now we have the session BHB session I click on it.

187
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,910
It tells you that it's done.

188
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:52,740
This is the cookie that is set for that session for our servers for our server because we don't have

189
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,960
servers.

190
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:59,000
All right so how do we see the value of what we do the same thing we did here.

191
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:06,780
All right the same way we check for that so we could say something like If a set

192
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,370
I leave as a homework for you so you can do this.

193
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,320
All right.

194
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,120
So if it's set then we can check it right.

195
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,460
So now we check with we did that but we didn't.

196
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,630
We turned it on we turned on the follow the cookie but we how they actually set of any value to that

197
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,400
session.

198
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,060
We need to set a value for that session so let's go ahead and do that.

199
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,590
I almost forgot.

200
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,230
All right.

201
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,570
SESSIONS We never said anything for it.

202
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,630
So what we need to do is set this value for him.

203
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:53,390
So he's called his message and said it too high student.

204
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,030
How are you.

205
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,770
All right.

206
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,800
And we're going to check for this.

207
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,540
So I'm just going to do it right here.

208
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,290
As a matter of fact I'm going to pay here am going to use this in

209
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,570
for it.

210
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:24,990
And she's pleased with that.

211
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,220
All right.

212
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,260
We're good to go.

213
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,010
What do you think.

214
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,990
Let's just take this out of there good to go.

215
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,500
Good to go.

216
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,260
Good to go.

217
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,130
Good to go.

218
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,240
Yes.

219
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,110
There we go.

220
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,220
As you can see we are displaying it right here.

221
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,070
Hi stewarding How are you.

222
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,020
All right.

223
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:54,660
We can just always put a little concatenation of your tags in there and we refresh.

224
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,410
Whoops.

225
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,340
UPS UPS UPS UPS UPS disclosing.

226
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,410
There we go.

227
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,410
Hi Student How are you.

228
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,920
See that the GET matters right here.

229
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,900
The cookie right here and the center right here.

230
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,430
Perfect.

231
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,930
So hopefully this section here helped you understand reinforce some of that knowledge that you got from

232
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,370
the last lectures and I'm glad that I was able to help you out on that.

233
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,440
So take care and I see the next lecture
