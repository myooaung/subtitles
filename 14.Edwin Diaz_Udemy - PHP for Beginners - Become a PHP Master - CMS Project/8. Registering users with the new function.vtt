00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.340
Well come back to the student in this lecture here we are going to be improving or for each loop and

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.970
we are also going to be making work on making this register user work.

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.330
All right.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.570
So what I want to do here.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.280
It's not much to kind to make this work but I want to put another functionality here.

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.830
First of all let's come in this array so that way we can make this work.

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.690
And what I have in mind is this this is the for each ray here I want to make another statement here.

8
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.310
And I want to see if the empty

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.100
if that if this error is empty then we want to do something here.

10
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.470
And this is what we're going to be re-assuring user or users here.

11
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.870
All right.

12
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.550
And basically what I want to do here.

13
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:10.800
Well we want to do here is making sure before we check these values that we own set will clean it up

14
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.660
a little bit.

15
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.810
So we're going to clean up our empty fields Ray and whatever whatever we have there do we need to use

16
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.550
the key there.

17
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.410
So we got to set that key on that variable.

18
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.590
Right.

19
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.650
All right.

20
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.050
So we're going to go through the rate of errors we can to make sure if they if they're empty.

21
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.080
All right then we're going to unset that key.

22
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.420
So that way we come here and we check for that.

23
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.420
And he's already clean right.

24
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.180
If they are clean they're really empty.

25
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.420
So we want to make sure that he's said before we do this here so this should work.

26
00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.750
Now let's go back to functions at BHP and do we got a couple of things we got to remove here make sure

27
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.200
your function is clean.

28
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.950
We don't really need this here.

29
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.070
We are ready checking for those.

30
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.690
Check that out.

31
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.010
There we go.

32
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.780
All right.

33
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.620
Make sure you have your Global there

34
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.950
and see if we are.

35
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.060
All right.

36
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.260
Let's try to make this work guys.

37
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.520
All right.

38
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.510
You ready.

39
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.880
All right let's.

40
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.620
Let's make this work or try to make it work.

41
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.450
Well we're going to make it work.

42
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.180
All right let's be strong about this.

43
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.590
All right.

44
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.160
So first of all let me clean my database a little bit.

45
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.620
I've got a lot of feuds here that I need to clean.

46
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.760
I said yes you do the same thing right now.

47
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.550
GO TO YOUR be admin and make sure your database is clean 100 percent what not 100 percent but whatever

48
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.010
you have.

49
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.480
They're

50
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.590
clean.

51
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.870
So that way you can test this out.

52
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.930
All right.

53
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.990
So we're going to call this guy Edwin.

54
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.360
Just because.

55
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.520
And

56
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.270
that's re-used for this and it looks like it went through but we don't have no redirection we have no

57
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.100
way of knowing that yet.

58
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.770
We don't have the functionality.

59
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.150
Let's refresh and there we go.

60
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.120
It's working.

61
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.380
All right.

62
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.430
So registration is working what is not doing is logging in the user at all.

63
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.290
And if we go back here we have this function here logging the user is supposed to log in the user and

64
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.240
they have to log in the User ID make sure their users correct.

65
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.770
You know the password everything they restock they use it to admin.

66
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.690
If not it were redirected back to that page.

67
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.010
All right.

68
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.710
So we got to work on this a little bit.

69
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:12.300
So let's go back here to registration and before we get into that let's make sure that all of this is

70
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.540
nicely formatted.

71
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.250
Let's make sure a form is good.

72
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:36.060
I want to check I want to actually change this submit to register and I want to also do change this

73
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:46.680
here to something a little bit better maybe to check to see if we have a post requests on the page.

74
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.070
All right.

75
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.400
Because it just it is it works a lot better.

76
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.220
So the best way that I like to do it it's by checking the server variable.

77
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:09.180
All right so right now we just checked to see if the server variable here has we checked to see the

78
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.270
request met did aved the request met.

79
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.580
That is equal to post.

80
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Then we have a post submission.

81
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.820
All right.

82
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.230
And this is the best way just to avoid a couple of complications out there especially with Internet

83
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.970
Explorer.

84
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:34.440
But anyway so we're good to go here what we're going to be doing is on the next lecture we're going

85
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.660
to make sure that this is working 100 percent we are able now to enter data.

86
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:52.020
All right but we need to make sure there are log in it's working not only that it is working here but

87
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.050
that it is working here as well.
