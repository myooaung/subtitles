1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,660
All right so we got a lot of functionality in our site.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,020
If you go to admen you can see right here we have new polls we can edit the lead.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,470
Do a lot of things on it.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,940
We get categories.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,500
But what we don't have is in the home side right now.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,370
Before we move to another section we need to.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,390
When we click on this post we need to go to that specific content right to that specific post when we

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,120
click on the title or the image or whatever.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,440
Right now we click on it.

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,570
If I wanted to go and see that the rest of the content right now even though we don't got much we don't

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,010
do that.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,640
It just refreshes right.

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,680
So we need to add the functionality and we need to add the functionality of the blog categories there

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,110
that when we click on it goes to that specific category and we show you everything related to that category.

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,850
But we haven't done that yet.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,170
So what we need to do is we have a post page that I want to show you and we did that in the beginning

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,760
if you remember that's like a placeholder page.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,400
It's called pulls up.

19
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,730
And this is what we're going to do use for individual posts.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,460
We want it.

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,660
I want to copy everything from it and put it here since we have the sidebar that says the cyber is the

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,250
same.

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,750
The header and footer are the same and some of this information is the same.

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,040
I'm just going to copy and paste it here but I want to preserve the comments section.

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,300
So we're going to take that off before we do that.

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,680
Copy and paste it and paste.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,920
So let's go to line one or two on the post.

28
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,570
BHB which is in the same root as the index in the home page.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:46,900
And let's go all the way down to divs below that nested comment section right here.

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:55,170
You see this comment that says that nested to this below just command Edzo control at it that's going

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,040
to be all that's the comment section.

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go to a new page.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's face it let's leave it there for now.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,020
Let's go back to that.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,410
Let's select everything.

36
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:11,210
That's copy it go to post select everything and paste it.

37
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,560
So now we have everything here we want to do a couple of things here first we want to

38
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:27,790
detect that you are able to get requests when we click on days we want to send a request to post that

39
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,750
BHB and catch us somewhere so we can detect the specific content from this just like we're been doing

40
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,110
in the back just like we did here in the View Post.

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,830
We click here we send a request here and we display some information we got sent in there and we're

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,930
going to be detecting this I.D. right here of this specific post or whatever post.

43
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,870
Right.

44
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,800
So before we do that let's go back to that title which is that section of the common that we are holding

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:05,220
let's assume command or control a and select everything and go back to post below the loop right here.

46
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,790
Let's just base this whole thing in there make sure we have that.

47
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,190
All right.

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,190
Perfect.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,360
So here we want to display everything but we need to catch that somewhere.

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,500
So first let's go to end it.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,040
I don't know what I'm talking about.

52
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,520
It's got to end this and let me show you what I'm talking about right here.

53
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,090
Here we need to get the idea from this from all the polls.

54
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,670
Right.

55
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:43,520
So right now we're getting all the titles that get all the IDs right here and post I.D. right here and

56
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,210
all here on the tide what I want to do is I want to make a link to postop DHB and I want to pass a parameter

57
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:58,810
that parameter that I'm going to pass is that P on the score ID and that is the key of the array of

58
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,840
that get super global for the IDs right.

59
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,570
And then I say equals and it's going to be this pause ID variable right.

60
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,900
So remember what I'm what we're doing here.

61
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,600
But as a matter of fact before we do that before we put this variable here we need to have a let's just

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,340
take that off a BHB right there.

63
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,360
BHB tag.

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,540
And we need to echo with the polls ID.

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,350
All right.

66
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,790
Make sure that you Agway because if you don't actually it doesn't work.

67
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,370
All right.

68
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,030
So hopefully you know what we are doing.

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,660
All right.

70
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,350
We are sending when people click on this title.

71
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,620
It's going to be right here actually on the front of the Web site.

72
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,140
We're going to set a parameter in there you are.

73
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,840
And that parameter is going to be the P on the score I.D. equals the idea of the post.

74
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,380
And that's the same I.D. that we got right here.

75
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,440
When we click on it you see this idea right here that's the ID of the post.

76
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,160
That's exactly what we are doing right now.

77
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,350
Every time somebody clicks there.

78
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,620
Right.

79
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,980
So we need to catch this before we even make it work.

80
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,270
So let's go ahead and catch it in the side real quick.

81
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,010
Let's go to the polls that BHP and let's catch it right here.

82
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:28,260
So we're going to say if set what is set can you guess before I put it in here.

83
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,490
What are we checking for again.

84
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:37,050
And remember the key of one of this array right on this score what the.

85
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,260
Remember that.

86
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,890
Don't forget.

87
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,910
And we are going to convert.

88
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:48,030
This is the key you remember and we were referencing the value of each of the polls when it's clicked.

89
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,030
Don't get confused.

90
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,910
Remember you are in the loop.

91
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,510
So post ID.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,910
This is very easy to get confuse.

93
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,680
In the end it's because you are here in the loop.

94
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,560
All right let me show you.

95
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,040
Remember here.

96
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,380
This is the looping It's right here.

97
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,020
So this is looping through all the data in our post table.

98
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:22,410
And every time he looks around he grasps one of the ids from that specific post and he will sign it

99
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,460
to whatever element we use.

100
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:33,570
So let's say the first time it runs through e-zines they I.D. to one post and then when we click on

101
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:40,020
that here and on the front page they say for example here it was signed the I.D. to this content right

102
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,980
here because that's where it is at the moment.

103
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,620
All right.

104
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,520
So right now the first go around is going to be on that say Edwin Diaz Posetti 28.

105
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,750
The image black whatever the first time around it will be on my post the second time around.

106
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,630
It would be who says Post.

107
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
And the idea would be different.

108
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,590
The Post order would be different that they would be different or the image would be different.

109
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,050
Right.

110
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,310
Every time I go around all these content changes to a different post.

111
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,670
Remember it's a loop.

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,530
Remember we have the wild looping here right so get that straight.

113
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,720
So let's go to that post up here B.

114
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,820
And we are catching it right here but we need to make a condition right here because we are displaying

115
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,500
all the polls right here on this page just like we do in the end it's well we don't want to do that.

116
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:36,900
We want to say where post ID which is the column in our table equals what he calls the ID we are catching

117
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,230
in the L right here.

118
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,470
OK.

119
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,540
There we go.

120
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,540
And we can actually name it differently so that way we know what's going on.

121
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,760
The post ID.

122
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,910
All right.

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,570
And Seven Corners here actually in the second corner with us to ask you.

124
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,160
Perfect.

125
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,740
All right so let's see if it works.

126
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,770
Let's see if our invention works right.

127
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,950
So less refreshing clicking and we click on it and we get that page right here.

128
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,530
You see the switch but you don't see it.

129
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,220
If I click on it post up BHB I.D. And let me show you that it works.

130
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,190
I'm going to go to another one that is different.

131
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:23,040
And then right now you see we are on the home page if I scroll up and down with my mouse I get all the

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,650
posts.

133
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:31,200
If I click on this you go to it goes to the 31 if I scroll down we get the comments section.

134
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,710
So we are displaying individual posts now.

135
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,290
Right.

136
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,870
And we at the same function I add to the picture the functionality to the picture.

137
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,980
All right if you wanted to we can create a link.

138
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:49,740
We can go to edit and create a link around that picture and send it to that post.

139
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,950
Very easy to do.

140
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,540
As a matter of fact if you want to do it go ahead and do it.

141
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,420
I'm going to leave it there just to make it simple.

142
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,150
And for some reason you have any problems watch this video again.

143
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,560
Make sure you get it.

144
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,250
All right.

145
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,720
Thank you so much for watching.

146
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,820
See you in the next lecture
