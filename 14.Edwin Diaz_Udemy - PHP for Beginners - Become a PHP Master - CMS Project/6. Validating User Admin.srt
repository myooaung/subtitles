1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,380
All right so in the last lecture we saw how we can go ahead and log in.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,110
Right.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:14,910
And how this admin is already receiving data from that special user by using sessions like we did right

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,600
here we are echoing that section session and we are sending it right.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:28,760
So we are using the logon to set sessions and we use in the admin header to receive it.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,820
Now there is a big problem here is that actually in that here.

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,300
But of course we are we see we are turning it on by using the admin header.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,920
By the way just that's what I meant.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,810
Now we have a big problem here.

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:51,010
It's if we go I mean here or this is where we are turning it on right now again again if we are we are

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,090
Logan in every user here that is a big problem.

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,140
We don't want just every user that has a subscriber role or admin role to log in.

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,160
We just one the admin to log in.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,630
So we need to check for that.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:13,470
So let's go to the admin Hetter go to admin head or inciting admen includes And we're going to be doing

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,640
some checking right here.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,470
All right.

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,720
So let's go ahead and do that right here.

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:30,010
Let's open up the HP tag and let's check if the user rule is admitting or subscribing if it's admin

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,380
We of course will send it to the admin and if it's not we send it back to the inn.

21
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,880
It's that BHB.

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,360
But in the future what we might want to do is actually limit some of these user if they uses as described

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,160
We're going to limit them into not maybe adding passwords or adding users anything like that we can

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,740
limit them so that that would be an advance probably cause or events lectures right now we got to.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,070
I want to show you about the rules how can we prevent some Surt certain users from getting into the

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,640
admin.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,120
All right.

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:12,810
So let's do this let's do this let's do something like this if set and we're going to check for a session

29
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,660
and we are sending a session actually is called use.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,660
If you remember from the logon.

31
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,080
So if we set we're going to do something with it right.

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:40,560
So if it's said we want to convert this rule it said we want to say let's do another Estaban right here.

33
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,030
All right.

34
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,740
So if it's said let's do if

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,090
Israel equals to

36
00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:05,150
admen actually subscriber because that's the only one that we are concerned with.

37
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:14,490
Then we can say header and you can put this logic however you want you can say if it's not equal to

38
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,530
two men or right here if it makes more sense to you like this.

39
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:25,650
It is however makes more sense to you if is not equal to admen then you can redirect them somewhere

40
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:25,920
else.

41
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,210
Let's redirect them to.

42
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,300
And it's right.

43
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:38,340
And let's just get this out of here that BHB something like that.

44
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,120
All right.

45
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:50,770
So if we say Rico here and 2:59 submit you can see that we can't log in anymore Rico and we can't see

46
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,340
it but it is refreshing to see that you can see right here he just does so quickly.

47
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,050
So right now he's not equal right to admin.

48
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,980
Let's go ahead and make Rico out and see if he can if he if he's able to logon so adman.

49
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,390
Actually I'm not able to log in either.

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,030
So what we need to do is we need to go to a database and check another user that is adamant we can actually

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,330
convert it into admin right.

52
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,580
He if he wanted to.

53
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,160
So let's go ahead and do that is let's just make recal let's use refresher here may require admin because

54
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,080
we are unable to log in anymore.

55
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,360
So let's go ahead and change into admin right here admin go.

56
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,360
All right.

57
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,170
So now we change our user to admin and see what happens because we are locked down out of our own CMF

58
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,310
do you believe it.

59
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,920
So Rico want to three submit.

60
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,610
Ah that feels so good.

61
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,610
Now we are able to log in to see him as right.

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,620
So again let's just recap a little bit on what we did here and I'm going to recap on everything.

63
00:04:51,630 --> 00:05:01,200
But right now let's see we're checking the user role that we are sending from the log in form and right

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,740
here.

65
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,820
See that these are all we are checking to see right now the user always getting the value out of the

66
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:16,710
database and depending on what values he has on the database that is where values gets transferred to

67
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:24,460
this session right here and then that session we are using it in the admin header right here.

68
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,930
So right now the value for Rico is admin.

69
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,180
So that's a valid is going to be right here.

70
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,810
So he's saying if he's not equal to admin the admin value then redirect into that if it is then he's

71
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,560
going to let him go.

72
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,800
All right.

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,710
So this is how we can we can check on that.

74
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,950
Now another thing I want to recap real quick is Logan.

75
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,120
Just in case for some reason you guys did not understand what we did.

76
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,470
Exactly.

77
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,070
All right.

78
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,860
So perfect.

79
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,900
Let's do that right now.

80
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,170
So we are starting sessions because we are going to be using a we've got the database connection of

81
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,220
course.

82
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,310
So we're getting all this information from the log in form right.

83
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,270
So we say we are receiving information from the local form.

84
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,070
We receive the username password we're going to assign it to variables we can clean it up and we can

85
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,630
assign it to the same variables again.

86
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,100
Right.

87
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,280
Because you can change the variables values over and over again as many times as you want.

88
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:24,300
Then we using we are doing a query to go to the users table where the user name in the database is equal

89
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,480
to that user name that we are getting from the form right here.

90
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,060
All right here now.

91
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,790
And then once we have all that information from the user that is equal to the user name we are sending

92
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,940
in the select query Well this is the one we select when we use this function then we get all those resource

93
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,260
backing here and these variable we are assigning it to these variable then we are testing here.

94
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:54,510
If it's not if the query is not true then we do this if it is that goes in and we do a while loop.

95
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,330
Then we look to that result right here.

96
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,130
You see that variable.

97
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,600
We look through it and we check all the values we look through all the values and we pull them out like

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,090
an array.

99
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,700
Right because it is an array and we assign it to each of these valuables values to a variable once we

100
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,240
assign is values.

101
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,130
Each of these in that is right in this array two variables then we are checking it right here.

102
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:29,490
So we are checking if the user name that we're getting from this forum right here is the same as the

103
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,730
one inside the database.

104
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,610
And if the user name is not the same from the from the forms on the same as the the one from the database

105
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,020
and if the past was not the same as the one from the database then we're going to redirect the user

106
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,800
back to it if it is the same.

107
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,520
Then we get to signing sessions right.

108
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,680
And these sessions are going to have the user names they're going to have the values from the database.

109
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,000
So right now this is Rico is going to have the RICO name right here.

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,650
We're going to sign it to this session right here.

111
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,350
This is just like another placeholder basically like a variable if you want to use say like that.

112
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,990
All right.

113
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,600
It shows that it works different like cookies.

114
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:20,100
So then once we have it right here in the session then every time we turn on the session with this function

115
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,680
here we can access that value anywhere.

116
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,000
All right.

117
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,750
And then we redirect and once we assign those values values to these sessions we redirect them to admin

118
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:38,980
and the thing admin We are catching those values in the admin header and we are displaying right here.

119
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,690
All right.

120
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,220
So hopefully that recap helped you understand better for some of you that were confused if.

121
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,350
All right.

122
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,590
If you do have any problems you know where to find me.

123
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,140
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and you're doing really awesome.

124
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,640
All right.

125
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,030
Awesome awesome awesome.

126
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,450
Don't ever give up.

127
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,630
Keep doing it right.

128
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,210
I see it.

129
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,020
And that's lecture.

130
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,470
Good job
