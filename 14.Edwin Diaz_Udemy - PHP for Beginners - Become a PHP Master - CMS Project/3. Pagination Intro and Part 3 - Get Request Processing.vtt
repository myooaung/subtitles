00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:02.230
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02.250  -->  00:00:07.340
So it's time for us to start doing a little bit more process and we are pagination system right.

3

00:00:07.350  -->  00:00:11.380
We are sending that request with this link that we created here with the loop.

4

00:00:11.550  -->  00:00:12.130
All right.

5

00:00:12.300  -->  00:00:17.300
And we are also processing the count and doing some really really cool stuff here.

6

00:00:17.310  -->  00:00:21.360
But now it's time for us to not leave the request by itself.

7

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:24.360
We can't just leave the poor request by itself.

8

00:00:24.360  -->  00:00:26.830
We need to catch you and do something with it right.

9

00:00:27.060  -->  00:00:30.130
So anyway let's do some processing with I get requests.

10

00:00:30.150  -->  00:00:37.590
So first we want to check to see if we are getting a request because basically let me just show you

11

00:00:37.590  -->  00:00:45.060
right now basically what we're going to be doing right now is that we are going to be limiting this

12

00:00:45.060  -->  00:00:49.140
right here let's say for example limit 0 5.

13

00:00:49.170  -->  00:00:50.080
Right.

14

00:00:50.640  -->  00:00:56.230
So now if I go here Enter you're going to have five pages right here.

15

00:00:56.460  -->  00:00:58.270
Five pools.

16

00:00:58.390  -->  00:00:59.080
All right.

17

00:00:59.220  -->  00:01:02.470
But I need to send this page requests.

18

00:01:02.580  -->  00:01:04.070
Let's see if I send three.

19

00:01:04.170  -->  00:01:07.000
I want it I want to be my excuse.

20

00:01:07.020  -->  00:01:07.500
All right.

21

00:01:07.510  -->  00:01:11.010
Give me the next results the next five.

22

00:01:11.010  -->  00:01:11.470
All right.

23

00:01:11.550  -->  00:01:14.640
So basically we're going to be sending a request here.

24

00:01:14.860  -->  00:01:19.710
All right we are a site we're going to sign a variable we assign it to a variable and then we're going

25

00:01:19.710  -->  00:01:27.730
to use that variable right here to actually limit the amount of posts we get per page.

26

00:01:27.730  -->  00:01:28.260
All right.

27

00:01:28.410  -->  00:01:31.030
So let's go ahead hopefully you understand.

28

00:01:31.070  -->  00:01:33.660
Now don't worry I'll explain everything at the end.

29

00:01:33.660  -->  00:01:37.560
So now explain Soam some Zagel.

30

00:01:38.010  -->  00:01:44.590
Let's go ahead and check for a Ged's request right with his set function in an IF statement.

31

00:01:45.120  -->  00:01:47.820
So we don't get a problem.

32

00:01:47.820  -->  00:01:49.280
We don't get on the fine.

33

00:01:49.410  -->  00:01:52.070
And it's you know our error in our speech.

34

00:01:52.110  -->  00:01:54.870
If you get on on the fire and that's that's what it is.

35

00:01:54.870  -->  00:02:06.480
So if we have a get request name page right we'd at key of page we're going to sign that to a variable

36

00:02:06.480  -->  00:02:08.980
called page if for some.

37

00:02:09.060  -->  00:02:10.680
It's not set.

38

00:02:10.680  -->  00:02:11.820
We don't want to leave it alone.

39

00:02:11.820  -->  00:02:12.480
Right.

40

00:02:12.750  -->  00:02:15.530
Which is going to sign an empty string to it.

41

00:02:16.380  -->  00:02:19.910
All right so now let's find out what page one is.

42

00:02:20.010  -->  00:02:27.360
So let's go and see if our get requests which is now Page equal to an empty string and it's just to

43

00:02:27.410  -->  00:02:36.930
hear us fine or is equal to one then we know hold whole page right when we wanted to do something.

44

00:02:36.960  -->  00:02:42.070
Well we're going to sign a new variable called Page 1 2 0.

45

00:02:42.180  -->  00:02:43.740
That's how we find out page 1.

46

00:02:43.770  -->  00:02:44.390
Right.

47

00:02:44.760  -->  00:02:46.830
And this is how we find out.

48

00:02:46.860  -->  00:02:48.990
I get requests.

49

00:02:49.380  -->  00:02:49.720
All right.

50

00:02:49.740  -->  00:02:50.880
Perfect.

51

00:02:50.880  -->  00:03:01.140
So now if for some reason we're not on page 1 or is you know not empty on top right which basically

52

00:03:01.140  -->  00:03:03.240
that's what he means his own index.

53

00:03:03.270  -->  00:03:06.280
BHB if we are on page two for example.

54

00:03:06.360  -->  00:03:10.650
So let's do one else here because that means we are somewhere else right.

55

00:03:10.650  -->  00:03:13.480
We got to sign the same variable some other values.

56

00:03:13.530  -->  00:03:18.420
Basically what we're going to be doing is some processing here we're going to do some math and I won

57

00:03:18.420  -->  00:03:22.040
my math the first declaration that I'm going to put in this parenthesis to go first.

58

00:03:22.050  -->  00:03:23.630
And that's how we tell it.

59

00:03:23.640  -->  00:03:24.120
All right.

60

00:03:24.300  -->  00:03:26.060
We do that just like regular math.

61

00:03:26.250  -->  00:03:33.100
We use parentheses and we say we Dwarka collation in this case is going to be tiny 5.

62

00:03:33.110  -->  00:03:33.700
All right.

63

00:03:34.080  -->  00:03:39.590
So if we are on page one there's going to be zero and zero times 4 is five.

64

00:03:39.600  -->  00:03:45.430
All right who's going to give was five then what we want to do is we want to actually minus it.

65

00:03:45.480  -->  00:03:54.840
So let's say we are on page 2 and we say page times page two times five is ten minus five is five fold

66

00:03:54.840  -->  00:03:57.790
the page two we're going to have five results.

67

00:03:57.820  -->  00:03:58.580
All right.

68

00:03:58.680  -->  00:04:01.620
So you can see how this goes awry.

69

00:04:01.620  -->  00:04:02.170
All right.

70

00:04:02.310  -->  00:04:05.340
So what is the next step after this.

71

00:04:05.340  -->  00:04:05.610
All right.

72

00:04:05.610  -->  00:04:13.080
Well right now we could if we wanted to grab our page one and assign it to our limits right here and

73

00:04:13.080  -->  00:04:14.150
save it.

74

00:04:14.390  -->  00:04:16.880
Come here and see what's going on.

75

00:04:17.630  -->  00:04:18.610
All right.

76

00:04:19.470  -->  00:04:19.870
Enter

77

00:04:22.420  -->  00:04:25.740
1 2 3 4 and 5 right.

78

00:04:26.400  -->  00:04:27.860
Second page.

79

00:04:27.940  -->  00:04:28.440
All right.

80

00:04:28.480  -->  00:04:33.410
One two and I don't know if you see it but it is it is different.

81

00:04:33.520  -->  00:04:39.780
Now let me show you right now you see this just because I have the same names and the same placeholder

82

00:04:39.780  -->  00:04:41.520
for each individual post.

83

00:04:41.550  -->  00:04:43.830
That's why you can't really see exactly.

84

00:04:43.830  -->  00:04:50.220
So let's go to page 1 real quick and I'll show you if I click here you can see that ID for these polls

85

00:04:50.300  -->  00:04:52.020
is 64.

86

00:04:52.050  -->  00:04:54.340
Let's go back and go to page 2.

87

00:04:55.050  -->  00:04:58.290
If I click here again you can see the IDs 72.

88

00:04:58.290  -->  00:05:03.470
Let's go back and let's do page 5 so that we can see the big difference.

89

00:05:03.480  -->  00:05:05.010
It was 72 before a full clip.

90

00:05:05.010  -->  00:05:07.000
Now you can see 87.

91

00:05:07.080  -->  00:05:12.620
So he's giving us the resorts it's giving us five by five on each page.

92

00:05:12.620  -->  00:05:13.250
All right.

93

00:05:13.410  -->  00:05:19.530
So anyway on the next lecture We'll continue with this and hopefully you having some fun and I'll see

94

00:05:19.530  -->  00:05:20.430
you in the next lecture.

95

00:05:20.430  -->  00:05:21.340
Take care.
