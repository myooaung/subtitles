1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,450
All right let's go back to

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,500
this right here.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,310
All right approved and subscriber.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,070
OK.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:21,120
We don't need subscriber right because we don't have that anymore but we do have an approved and approved

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,700
comments we should actually have a line for that.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,900
Yeah we don't have it.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,170
That would be nice to have.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,870
But we also missing comments right.

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,060
We do have comments already.

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,470
It's so up there coming count.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,600
So a proof and want a proof.

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,410
Nice.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,210
What are we doing for.

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,250
We don't have a proof.

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,200
I was going to Mansouri myself.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,990
Guys I'm asking myself.

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:57,790
So after comments we should say a proof so let's make a variable here.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:08,700
Proved comment count because we want to prove.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,910
So that's going to be very similar to what we got here.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,980
I'm just going to leave that for reference.

22
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,080
Go back here and let's see how we're going to do this.

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,150
So get all user approved

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,630
comments off post comments

25
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,360
and let's make another copy here.

26
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,870
And this one will be on the pool.

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,180
All right.

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,050
We're going to have to do some adjoining tables again to make this better.

29
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,230
I'm going to copy all this from here.

30
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:09,220
Just because I don't want to type Control key my key word to delete all this stuff oh

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,190
any Anyway let's just paste it.

32
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,820
Let's just paste it right here.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,560
So to do approve comments Garrow user comments.

34
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:28,590
We are going to join these two tables and we're going to say and comment

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
status

36
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,230
should be approved.

37
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:47,530
And that's it for that I'm not even going to copy it would go.

38
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,250
And this should be a proof that can not be so simple guys right.

39
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,670
That cannot be so simple to do something like that.

40
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,970
That's why you guys.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,560
Some of you love me because I know some of you hate me for some reason.

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,890
I don't know why.

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:11,650
Let's go and say get this to account for us some records and let's to get user

44
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,720
approve comments or let's make sure that this is approved here.

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:36,130
And not in that I forgot to make sure that here after spending comments we have approved comments hoops

46
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,670
and I forgot.

47
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,410
Approved comments.

48
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,350
I'm going to give you an idea here real quick guys every time you have done something with is make sure

49
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,050
that you also all day you loop here that should be serving I believe.

50
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,790
Let's go back and take this all the way to the top.

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:06,330
And for some reason this one is not working says undefined function get 0 user draft polls.

52
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,160
Oh really.

53
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,150
I deleted the posts.

54
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,470
Whoops.

55
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,430
Yeah looks like I did.

56
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,670
OK

57
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,810
I don't even notice.

58
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,310
Make sure you don't.

59
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,440
All right.

60
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,790
So let's go back.

61
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,030
It's why I love my ID.

62
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,590
Right.

63
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,280
There is refresh here.

64
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:46,390
And yeah it looks like we have categories count here but there's two categories.

65
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,780
Let's go back to categories real quick and let's see what we got.

66
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,110
We had two categories for their use.

67
00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:00,490
Let's make it one and let's go to approve comments and comments it looks like we have no comments for

68
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,550
the user OK.

69
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,090
Well they're not approved.

70
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,180
They won't improve comments so they should be pending we should have a pending come here.

71
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,330
We don't have it.

72
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,670
So to do that or to approve come and count get us right here

73
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,180
refresh.

74
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,690
And while we have wow we have work in the world.

75
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,850
I didn't know we had winds over each

76
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,170
images make it five year.

77
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,200
I'm curious to know

78
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,780
yeah we all have one.

79
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,420
Want one of each.

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:47,970
Yeah.

81
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,270
Was that one up or even the guy super nervous.

82
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,150
I was like why did I do so.

83
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,300
That looks about right.

84
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,860
Let's change some here to make.

85
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,240
So that is Elise

86
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,280
go.

87
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,890
That should be taught in a pool of comments just to make things a little better.

88
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,750
Fresh two pending two comments.

89
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,370
OK.

90
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,040
That's awesome.

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,480
All right that's looking a lot better.

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,310
I think we're done with this one.

93
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,410
A Come impending come it looks great guys.

94
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,490
I don't know why you guys think we're done with this dashboard.

95
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:34,190
Maybe in another section we'll jump into creating more personalized pages in other parts of the mess

96
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,640
like the view will pose categories and so on.

97
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,740
They should be really easy already because I am showing you how to do it with a dashboard which is basically

98
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,360
almost the same thing.

99
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,380
All right thank you so much and I'll see you on then that's lecture's enjoy you guys.

100
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,130
Take care.
