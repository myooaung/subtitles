00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:01.040
All right.

2

00:00:01.080  -->  00:00:01.750
Perfect.

3

00:00:01.860  -->  00:00:06.030
So now we are displaying some dynamic data in our home page.

4

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:09.490
We have our polls complete almost there.

5

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:17.520
We have the image titled alter the time contacting all that great stuff we have the categories right

6

00:00:17.520  -->  00:00:20.870
now let's jump into the sidebar and let's do some stuff here.

7

00:00:21.030  -->  00:00:23.460
Let's build our costumes search engine.

8

00:00:23.610  -->  00:00:26.610
Let's go to the categories after that and let's go to the widget.

9

00:00:26.610  -->  00:00:28.660
We're going to display some categories here too.

10

00:00:28.700  -->  00:00:34.290
So just for you to know that so let's go ahead and bill that we need to go to a database to actually

11

00:00:34.290  -->  00:00:39.900
find out when the user types something here we need to search the database to see if we can find some

12

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:41.730
of the content they're looking for.

13

00:00:41.820  -->  00:00:42.930
Right.

14

00:00:42.930  -->  00:00:44.200
So if they type here.

15

00:00:44.210  -->  00:00:46.870
Hello we go to the database.

16

00:00:46.950  -->  00:00:51.880
Get this field in the database and say you know what database do you have this field somewhere.

17

00:00:52.020  -->  00:00:54.470
And then if we do then we display it.

18

00:00:54.470  -->  00:00:54.950
Right.

19

00:00:55.110  -->  00:01:00.100
So it is like I have two or three parts or because there are some steps that we need to follow.

20

00:01:00.270  -->  00:01:04.560
And I'm afraid some of the steps could be too long if I put it in one lecture.

21

00:01:04.560  -->  00:01:08.450
So it's not really hard is actually easy it just takes a little bit of time to do.

22

00:01:08.460  -->  00:01:17.640
So what we want to do is go to the sidebar and here the sidebar we need to find the blog search.

23

00:01:17.670  -->  00:01:24.490
Well make sure that you find that separate a little bit as you can see there.

24

00:01:24.720  -->  00:01:26.430
Perfect.

25

00:01:26.430  -->  00:01:34.410
We need a form to submit some post data so that way to the field to that to our database.

26

00:01:34.410  -->  00:01:42.420
All right so let's create a form right under here and it's called this form

27

00:01:48.000  -->  00:01:49.730
and it's put it right below.

28

00:01:49.800  -->  00:02:00.740
Is there a here do a little comment here and just see form search form.

29

00:02:00.740  -->  00:02:06.230
All right just so that we know that's the end and the actual And I'll leave it that way.

30

00:02:06.570  -->  00:02:11.100
And I'm just going to say method just for you information for live action like this.

31

00:02:11.130  -->  00:02:14.970
We're not submitted anywhere else we just submitted to the same page.

32

00:02:15.030  -->  00:02:18.710
So the polls here will be the matter with the post.

33

00:02:18.750  -->  00:02:22.190
We need to send some information via these buttons here.

34

00:02:22.200  -->  00:02:25.140
So we need that name actually you there.

35

00:02:25.290  -->  00:02:27.950
And I'm just going to name it submit.

36

00:02:28.200  -->  00:02:29.200
Make sure that you change it.

37

00:02:29.200  -->  00:02:31.310
But there are two types of Mitt.

38

00:02:31.310  -->  00:02:39.400
Also if I work in the mind is a little bit of the way is in order.

39

00:02:39.460  -->  00:02:49.530
We go and this textfield here we need to also for a little review there and then to make sure it is

40

00:02:50.160  -->  00:02:55.610
search because we are going to be using this information.

41

00:02:55.610  -->  00:02:59.930
It is getting too big and I don't like the way it looks when it gets to be this way.

42

00:03:00.120  -->  00:03:02.670
But I want you to keep seeing this anyway.

43

00:03:02.850  -->  00:03:07.920
So now that we have this form here we need to catch the data somewhere and we're going to catch it real

44

00:03:07.920  -->  00:03:09.180
quick just to show you.

45

00:03:09.360  -->  00:03:11.930
Well just to find out if it's working.

46

00:03:11.980  -->  00:03:12.560
Right.

47

00:03:12.840  -->  00:03:14.580
So let's catch them right here.

48

00:03:14.600  -->  00:03:17.690
Well let's not forget a BHP tax.

49

00:03:18.000  -->  00:03:27.850
Actually we're not catching it via get we catching the post Super global ph taxing here let's take this

50

00:03:27.880  -->  00:03:31.970
out from here and put it down here.

51

00:03:32.000  -->  00:03:33.680
All right.

52

00:03:34.710  -->  00:03:35.720
Perfect.

53

00:03:35.760  -->  00:03:41.240
I just click on press on tabel my key word will do that for me real quick.

54

00:03:41.250  -->  00:03:44.360
All right so let's see if that works out.

55

00:03:45.240  -->  00:03:46.330
We got to get at.

56

00:03:46.560  -->  00:03:48.950
But I'll show you in a minute.

57

00:03:48.960  -->  00:03:55.650
So we get his error here because he's on the fine is actually trying to do something but right now he's

58

00:03:55.680  -->  00:03:58.030
not going to do anything anyway because we now echoing.

59

00:03:58.050  -->  00:04:00.230
So let's make sure we echo that.

60

00:04:01.470  -->  00:04:11.090
And if we do this and that we get some of this field here halo display here as you can see.

61

00:04:11.100  -->  00:04:12.150
So he's working.

62

00:04:12.330  -->  00:04:13.980
We are submitting data there.

63

00:04:14.000  -->  00:04:14.790
Perfect.

64

00:04:14.970  -->  00:04:20.820
So now that we know he's working less actually if we go ahead and do this here and put our cursor here

65

00:04:20.820  -->  00:04:26.630
and click on Enter this is we've got these arrow here we avoid that by actually checking for this first

66

00:04:26.670  -->  00:04:29.880
check in for that search or for submission.

67

00:04:30.120  -->  00:04:31.620
So let's do that.

68

00:04:32.310  -->  00:04:34.190
So let's do that with an if statement.

69

00:04:34.220  -->  00:04:36.020
And let's just use some.

70

00:04:36.130  -->  00:04:38.640
Let's use something like the set function

71

00:04:41.210  -->  00:04:48.520
and let's check for each submission false statement.

72

00:04:48.730  -->  00:04:50.510
Right.

73

00:04:51.930  -->  00:04:59.970
And then if we find that submission then we want to also search for this and actually assign it to a

74

00:04:59.970  -->  00:05:04.880
variable the variable that we will be using is called search.

75

00:05:05.700  -->  00:05:14.130
All right so now and this just echo the whole thing out just to check it out by now you see and we don't

76

00:05:14.130  -->  00:05:16.490
get that arrow when we click enter on top here.

77

00:05:16.670  -->  00:05:23.610
But if I type something here and I click on the search we see that we get something out of there.

78

00:05:23.610  -->  00:05:25.730
Perfect.

79

00:05:25.730  -->  00:05:27.690
All right so we know that's working now.

80

00:05:28.110  -->  00:05:29.630
So what do we want to do.

81

00:05:29.650  -->  00:05:35.760
Well when people click on submit what we've said that we want to search our database right so that's

82

00:05:35.760  -->  00:05:38.190
exactly what we need to do right now.

83

00:05:38.190  -->  00:05:43.950
We need to search our database to find some information about what the user wants to find.

84

00:05:43.950  -->  00:05:49.840
I want to display some information to the user so we have a forum here all set up.

85

00:05:49.980  -->  00:05:55.560
And I was thinking about making this thing and then another lecture sensed this already took a little

86

00:05:55.560  -->  00:05:56.700
bit of time.

87

00:05:56.700  -->  00:05:59.730
So let's leave it for another lecture on the next lecture.

88

00:05:59.730  -->  00:06:06.990
I will show you how to go inside the database and do the search for whatever the user types in in our

89

00:06:06.990  -->  00:06:11.600
search engine and find that information displayed to the user right.

90

00:06:11.640  -->  00:06:13.620
So that's why we want to do.

91

00:06:13.620  -->  00:06:18.880
We also want to validate if you know no information comes out of the database.

92

00:06:18.990  -->  00:06:21.780
So I'm going to show you that in their collection just to make our lectures a little shorter.

93

00:06:21.780  -->  00:06:25.470
That way you can do all the things take a break and come back.

94

00:06:25.470  -->  00:06:26.070
Right.

95

00:06:26.070  -->  00:06:28.850
So anyway thank you so much and I'll see your next lecture.

96

00:06:28.860  -->  00:06:29.500
Take care.
