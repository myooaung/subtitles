1

00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:06,600
All right so now we've got the form now we need to get that data out there and submit it to our database

2

00:00:06,600  -->  00:00:07,970
and do or queries with it.

3

00:00:07,970  -->  00:00:08,440
Right.

4

00:00:08,610  -->  00:00:14,010
So now that first before we go on let me just say congratulations you're doing really good if you are

5

00:00:14,010  -->  00:00:19,770
in this section right here you are one of the few that have made it this far and you should pat yourself

6

00:00:19,770  -->  00:00:25,490
in the back right now and say you know what I am really really good.

7

00:00:25,560  -->  00:00:28,840
I'm a dedicated person and I will complete this.

8

00:00:28,900  -->  00:00:29,970
All right.

9

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:31,310
I'm telling you doing great.

10

00:00:31,330  -->  00:00:34,300
I am really really proud of you.

11

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:34,710
All right.

12

00:00:34,710  -->  00:00:39,720
So now let's go ahead and continue with this course here.

13

00:00:40,020  -->  00:00:44,150
What we want to do is we want to create that page and we're going to create it.

14

00:00:44,150  -->  00:00:48,930
We're going to do a Save As and let's go to that includes sidebar and we're going to do a Save As we

15

00:00:48,930  -->  00:00:54,930
don't really need to do a save as we can just go ahead and right click on includes and create a new

16

00:00:54,930  -->  00:01:04,140
file there and this includes the includes inside the inside the root directory.

17

00:01:04,140  -->  00:01:06,520
OK this is not the wanting admin.

18

00:01:06,600  -->  00:01:08,090
This is the one inside.

19

00:01:08,100  -->  00:01:10,710
They include the root directory.

20

00:01:10,710  -->  00:01:15,830
Let me just show you real quick CMOS and then this includes right here.

21

00:01:16,000  -->  00:01:16,320
Right.

22

00:01:16,320  -->  00:01:18,090
So we created that lawyer right now.

23

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:18,960
Perfect.

24

00:01:18,960  -->  00:01:22,680
Now we need to include something here so we need to so we can make it work.

25

00:01:22,710  -->  00:01:25,080
The first thing that we need to include here is the

26

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:29,830
database.

27

00:01:29,830  -->  00:01:30,360
All right.

28

00:01:30,510  -->  00:01:32,540
And we already have this database right here.

29

00:01:32,540  -->  00:01:37,440
As a matter of fact inside the same folder right here on the left side.

30

00:01:37,510  -->  00:01:38,700
See it.

31

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:39,530
All right.

32

00:01:40,080  -->  00:01:41,930
Because we're going to be using this database here.

33

00:01:42,020  -->  00:01:46,260
Now the first thing that we need to make sure is that we are receiving some data from the data from

34

00:01:46,260  -->  00:01:48,380
the form right from that site.

35

00:01:48,390  -->  00:01:51,840
Our long form that we have right here.

36

00:01:52,390  -->  00:01:53,010
All right.

37

00:01:53,130  -->  00:01:57,450
We need to make sure that we are receiving it by checking this value right here.

38

00:01:57,450  -->  00:02:00,150
And of course we can check all the rest of the values too.

39

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:09,830
So let's go back to Logan that PH BE Let's open our BHB tags and super happy that you're here and you're

40

00:02:09,870  -->  00:02:13,470
still you know doing this course.

41

00:02:13,470  -->  00:02:20,860
So we're going to say if is set equal to underscore post re what are we checking here.

42

00:02:20,880  -->  00:02:22,610
Remember that Logan.

43

00:02:22,720  -->  00:02:23,480
Right.

44

00:02:23,940  -->  00:02:29,500
And if we find that we're going to do something with it we find that we're going to just like we've

45

00:02:29,510  -->  00:02:33,120
found it for now and then we're going to do the rest.

46

00:02:33,120  -->  00:02:36,420
But right now let's just make sure that that's working.

47

00:02:36,420  -->  00:02:41,490
So I'm just going to put my cursor they click enter for refreshing click submit and we could see that

48

00:02:41,490  -->  00:02:43,030
it says found perfect.

49

00:02:43,050  -->  00:02:45,500
So we're getting some data out of it.

50

00:02:45,540  -->  00:02:50,050
All right so now what we need to do is get the rest of the.

51

00:02:50,190  -->  00:02:57,180
If you go back to where we got some name you've got this password value here and we got this user and

52

00:02:57,170  -->  00:03:00,350
we need to pull that out of there so that way we can use it.

53

00:03:00,510  -->  00:03:06,190
So let's go to Logan and this copy this post here.

54

00:03:06,320  -->  00:03:07,800
Let's do a couple of times.

55

00:03:08,040  -->  00:03:09,610
Let's close it.

56

00:03:10,020  -->  00:03:13,880
Let's change a value and size for the first one is user.

57

00:03:13,920  -->  00:03:18,360
The second one is password perfect.

58

00:03:18,520  -->  00:03:22,680
Let's change it to variables and it's called this user name.

59

00:03:22,680  -->  00:03:27,590
That way we can use a way other things array than password.

60

00:03:27,980  -->  00:03:32,860
Let's equitable to make sure that we are getting those those values there.

61

00:03:34,110  -->  00:03:34,520
Right.

62

00:03:34,530  -->  00:03:38,790
Once we test this out and we can continue with the rest of the form.

63

00:03:38,790  -->  00:03:39,420
Right.

64

00:03:39,780  -->  00:03:45,800
So let's just say Edwins here and I'm just going to say pass here.

65

00:03:46,860  -->  00:03:47,630
All right.

66

00:03:47,670  -->  00:03:50,940
I suggest you never use this password DHing password.

67

00:03:50,960  -->  00:03:52,690
All right enter.

68

00:03:52,740  -->  00:03:55,070
You can see that addling and then passwords.

69

00:03:55,110  -->  00:03:56,570
Perfect.

70

00:03:56,580  -->  00:04:01,340
All right so it is working now that we are getting some data we got to continue cleaning up the data

71

00:04:01,350  -->  00:04:02,580
before we put it in the database.

72

00:04:02,580  -->  00:04:05,310
I'm going to show you in the next lecture how we do that.

73

00:04:05,340  -->  00:04:05,800
All right.

74

00:04:05,820  -->  00:04:10,160
So thank you so much for watching this lecture I we're going to make a short and sweet and I see it

75

00:04:10,170  -->  00:04:12,350
and that's one take here.
