00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.420
Welcome back my dear student in this lecture here we are going to be encrypting the password field here

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.910
that we get from the registration form so that way we can have and we can get this and the password

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.390
in a different format.

4
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.140
So hackers cannot get into our database or see a mess right.

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.090
So let's go ahead and do that right now so we know the is actually go down.

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.130
We know that we are getting this record this field from the database this column right here around Sa'ad

7
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.030
we're getting that value right here right.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.790
Well let's do something with it let's go ahead and play some of that security feature that we we learned

9
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.960
in the course when encrypted password.

10
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.050
If you don't remember you need to go back and watch you OK because I'm going to go more in detail in

11
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.260
a lecture about encrypted passwords.

12
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.250
But anyway so here I go.

13
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.260
I'm assuming that you already watched the video.

14
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:08.540
I'm not going to explain too much about it so I'm going to actually write down the password.

15
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.070
I'm going to rewrite the password from up here.

16
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.700
All right.

17
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.760
I'm going to put this variable.

18
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.820
I'm going to sign these variable a function called crypt.

19
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.510
All right.

20
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.480
So the crypt is going to take two parameters.

21
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.890
First is going to take the original password that we got up there and the second is going to be the

22
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.670
salt.

23
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
All right which is going to be this guy right here.

24
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.450
All right.

25
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.380
So I know that.

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.030
So that value the big value they use on the database is going to go there.

27
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.590
Here and then here this is the password so he's going to put them both together combine them do whatever

28
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.800
they usually whatever he does right and then that's encrypted for us.

29
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.090
All right.

30
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.210
If you want more details about it you can go to that BHB and watch my mother lecture about it.

31
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.790
Right.

32
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:11.490
But anyway so now that this is done now if we submit a user Let's go ahead and do this now and just

33
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.110
submit some guy here called Swaby.

34
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.720
Right from Rico Suave and register the registration has been submitted Let's go back and look at it

35
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.990
actually right here.

36
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.650
Go users.

37
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.440
We got a new user right here.

38
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.440
Let's go to our database and see if we got some of that encrypted password.

39
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.360
Feels good to go.

40
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.780
As you can see here the user password is encrypted.

41
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.020
Right here you see that different combination than this right.

42
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.060
Very different.

43
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.860
A whole bunch of different numbers here.

44
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.060
So now this is encrypted now.

45
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.680
Nobody will be able to hack our application especially they won't be able to get these fields and they

46
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.310
won't be able to get this user information right.

47
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.440
So anyway thank you so much.

48
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.580
And that's the next lecture We're also going to be doing some more modifications and and some more features.

49
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.490
All right adding some more features.

50
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.160
Thank you so much for watching and I see you.

51
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.250
And that's like you guys.

52
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.820
Take care.
