1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,680
Welcome my dear student.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,390
So this is as from the future.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,340
I came back to update the course.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,610
I'm gonna show you how to send e-mail with a nice package.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,870
We got called BHP Mailer now BHP Mailer House change just.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,070
They made a slight change in the way they use their code.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,460
So that's going to reflect on our projects.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,270
So that's why I came back to to fix this or show you the right way or the updated way of implementing

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:27,860
this package.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:34,770
Now Edwin from the past is going to show you how to implement this in your project but I'm going to

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,360
show you how to implement it anywhere.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,050
OK.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,550
So one thing that you need to have and I want you to have is male trap.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,010
OK just in case you guys don't have it.

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:55,390
This is really cool for testing male is it's like a fake male server but if your males are being delivered

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,490
here.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,130
OK.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,790
In your inbox then your code is good.

19
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,540
OK.

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,830
Now you know if they don't work with another provider out there it's something is going on with your

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,680
credentials but something is going on with your code.

22
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,160
OK.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,910
But but right now if they work with this here if your code to work with this you know that your code

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,380
is good and you're providing might be the problem OK.

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,370
But anyway.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,910
So we are going to be implementing GHB Mailer just like this and it's very simple.

27
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,260
OK.

28
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,030
Or we have to download the package.

29
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,470
So I'm going to go back here you guys already know how to use composer right.

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,300
So I'm going to update this.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,390
And while that's downloading well now update but I'm going to download it and well does downloading

32
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,960
I'm going to create a file here to show you this example.

33
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,760
OK.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,930
All right so OK so that's downloaded there.

35
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:07,470
We can see that that is six points something OK always go to their gay hub page to check on their changes.

36
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,620
OK.

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,840
That's how I get my information so to use this is super simple.

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,090
I'm just going to copy this whole thing to be honest with you.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,250
I'm going to copy this whole thing so that I can show you what you need and what you don't need.

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,910
OK.

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,610
So I'm going to go to my end it's going to open some BHP tags like this and paste that in there.

42
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,590
Let's come back here OK

43
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,870
and of course I have a lot of stuff that that dongle here

44
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,050
OK.

45
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:53,680
Just like that fitting all this stuff BHP Mailer exceptions.

46
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,110
There we go now.

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,090
I'm going to leave this the way it is.

48
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,870
I'm not going to make any other changes other than the settings here for the S.A. server.

49
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,390
OK.

50
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,770
So I'm going to grab twenty five.

51
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,590
Twenty five is the point that has worked for me OK so I'm going to change that right here.

52
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,630
Twenty five twenty five.

53
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,660
I'm going to change.

54
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,400
Let me see.

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,350
The host of course is this guy so let's start from the top.

56
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,520
Right here.

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,210
Change that

58
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,960
and username and password we need.

59
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,820
OK.

60
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:43,320
So I'm going to grab that from mousetrap user name and then password.

61
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,780
OK

62
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,180
you see right here I'm not going to do anything else here.

63
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,280
Let me just put my credentials even though it don't really matter.

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,510
This is just for show.

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,090
So I'm just gonna put Edwin Diaz at Edwin Diaz.

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,720
Let me just put Edwin at coding faculty.

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,650
That's my Web site.

68
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,130
You guys know that right.

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:21,080
Dot com I'm just gonna put here cooling faculty guys in for some of you they're looking for discounts

70
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,120
and things like that if you can't find it on bonus lectures that I create at the end sometimes the platforms

71
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,300
they change the way they the coupons work or the discounts and they stop working just go to my blog

72
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,910
and Diaz our common and you're gonna be able to find some discounts there OK.

73
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:48,710
Anyway so that's already done there what if I just hit this and see what happens could not access Well

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,310
we have this attachment that really don't go where our servers right.

75
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,770
We don't have anything there.

76
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:04,470
Let's go and try this again refresh and it looks like he has been sent where you think let's go here

77
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,820
Look we got something already that's cool.

78
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,180
Look at that.

79
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,650
I didn't do anything other than change this and maybe change some of these credentials that really no

80
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,410
matter here OK.

81
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,920
I could have left everything the same and just remove these two lines and everything would work OK so

82
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,830
now every from the past in the next lecture or the next lectures he's going to show you how to implement

83
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,360
this into your project but the issue here that you are going to have if you don't implement that hopefully

84
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,750
I will edit our lecture is that this needs to be on top.

85
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,880
OK.

86
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,840
So yeah they're order law is there and we can overload load classes.

87
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,040
We'll make sure that you're putting all this well.

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,590
Especially this guy here on the top of your files all the way to the top.

89
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,300
OK.

90
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,960
Make sure that that date's there.

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,950
OK.

92
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:03,130
So now you are able to send emails any type of e-mails to your users by using as A.P..

93
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,420
So if you're using Google you know you can google as A.P. Google server makes sure that you gave your

94
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,400
Google Apps some type of permissions because I think Google requires that and some of the providers

95
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,410
out there.

96
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,110
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

97
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,380
This is Edwin from the future.

98
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
And right back at Edwin from the past.

99
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,870
See you in the medicine extra guys.

100
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,410
Take care.
