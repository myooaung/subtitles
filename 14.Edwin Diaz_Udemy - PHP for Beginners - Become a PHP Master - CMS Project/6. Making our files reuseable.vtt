WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.770
All right so we have our database connection set up already so we can connect to the database.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.720
Now we need to make our files of our own or see a mass or a template actually reusable.

3
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.030
All right so we're going to be using a function called includes to do that and we could use it some

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.420
other functions but right now we're going to be using that.

5
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.760
So if you go to our local host and we'll be in local CMOS

6
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.760
right.

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.400
This is our home page.

8
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.870
We're going to be able to do what we want to do is put that table that we made called category up here

9
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.400
displaying some data.

10
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.970
All right some categories.

11
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:53.040
Now let me show you something we have a lot of the mail in here and we need to get rid of some we need

12
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.650
to make our code our files a little bit more usable look all the data here.

13
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.150
That is a lot of HD mail and that's very confusing imagining having let me just make this smaller so

14
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.810
that what you can see imagine having BHP also in bettering here that would make this unreadable.

15
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.720
All right.

16
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.050
So let's make this a little bit more usable by taking it off and including it.

17
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.330
Here is a clue for the right so let's make let's go to that includes folder and it's created two new

18
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.830
files.

19
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.760
Then call this header that BHB and then right click again I'm going to create another one called footer

20
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.590
that Ph.

21
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.560
All right.

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.020
I'm going to nail Pierce so I can work with them.

23
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.400
Let's go back to in there and let's just take this out from the body take it out and let's go back to

24
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.190
Hetter and paste it there.

25
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.940
Let's go back and save it.

26
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.850
I am clicking every time I'm with one of these pages here.

27
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520
I'm actually commencing everything.

28
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.070
And if you are in the Windows machine you can control s so to save it so you can come here and save

29
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.170
it.

30
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.080
But I think controllers would do the trick for you.

31
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.120
Fine.

32
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.220
So we have that let's include this go to and it's and it's use include.

33
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.350
Let's use that command and let's include it.

34
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.830
So let's open will be tags on so used to type in using my older editor every time I type BHB moderator

35
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.870
like this.

36
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.410
And I press on the tab it will make the tax for me so that's why every time you see me going like this

37
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.750
and deleting it that's what it is.

38
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.340
I'm actually thinking that this is going to do it for me but we need to find a probably a plug in for

39
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.860
this editor to do that.

40
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.800
So but right now it doesn't really matter let's just get used to doing it like this.

41
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:53.190
So this also use a function called includes include this.

42
00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.260
All right so what we want to include is a file called Hetter that HP and remember that's actually in

43
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.580
another folder called include includes includes right here.

44
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.000
Right.

45
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.770
So that should do the trick.

46
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.860
Let's go ahead and see that fresh Let's see what data correctly that we got.

47
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.650
So it's working let's just make a mistake here and see what happens.

48
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.170
All right.

49
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.500
Well make a mistake and everything fails.

50
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.070
All right so we are good.

51
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.500
Just fix that up again.

52
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.970
Perfect.

53
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.600
All right so let's do the same thing for the footer.

54
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.980
Let's go ahead and take out a lot of things from the footless make sure this is for that and that's

55
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.100
for that.

56
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.130
So we need that and this is for here we need a roll.

57
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.240
So there and this is the food right here.

58
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.600
So this just take of the food right here.

59
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.150
Everything on the footer stick it out.

60
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.620
And it's called the footer.

61
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.280
They sit in there save it as you can see it's just saving the food there and go back to it's included.

62
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.650
Now I'm going to just copy and paste this actually let me make this bigger for you.

63
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.380
I totally forgot that I zoom

64
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.430
this command or control.

65
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.870
Plus and that would make it bigger.

66
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.370
So that way you can see a little bit more clear what I'm doing.

67
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.210
All right.

68
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.960
I think that's clear enough.

69
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.060
Let's also pitch pretax down here.

70
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.330
All right.

71
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.350
We can make this a little neater by putting the page betakes right there.

72
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.240
Right I think we're good.

73
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.600
Go back to it and we can see that we are in fact good include actually no we're not.

74
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.310
We don't see the foot on the left side.

75
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.720
We just do it right here.

76
00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.150
There we go.

77
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.410
Now we see the footer.

78
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.310
Perfect right.

79
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.910
That's looking nice.

80
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.400
And let's also take out we have a bunch of all the data here leches and Malim Zumo little bit of pressing

81
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.650
command minus.

82
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.130
Let's take all the navigation.

83
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.890
How about that.

84
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.900
Let's take that out of the mission we have page Konting there also but this take other navigation and

85
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.100
just leave that come in there so that we know these navigation and this go to includes making a file

86
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.410
called navigation duppy H-P.

87
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.420
There you go.

88
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.250
And to save it right here it takes me right to that far when I say it.

89
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.550
When I click on enter and then I go back to the index and then include it right here so I'm going to

90
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:59.360
use this also to include it I make this a little neater again loops so that where you can see what I'm

91
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.670
doing.

92
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.420
All right.

93
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.810
All right so copy this.

94
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:14.650
Put it into navigation right here into the navigation comment Nivea patient.

95
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.360
Whoops.

96
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.110
All right.

97
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.700
So back to it and we can see the sidebar is there is it.

98
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.730
There we go.

99
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:32.140
There we make a mistake and our Sohrab are still there.

100
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.100
But.

101
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.980
Well that was an obligation on top I believe.

102
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:44.730
Let's go back to it and we can see that something's going on there.

103
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:53.340
It's actually telling me in these patients that we go there we go.

104
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.960
Nice work.

105
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:06.170
So what do we have here in this file is a actually what we had in this file was was not a sidebar I'm

106
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.420
sorry it was I was confused is with the navigation.

107
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.220
This is the navigation I'm sorry.

108
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.870
So that's what we had in the last fall.

109
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:21.630
And I was confusing with a sidebar Sometimes I go ahead of myself when I'm in my head.

110
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.960
So that's way.

111
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.660
So if I go here and I save this I make a mistake refresh this.

112
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.390
You could see that we don't have an obligation there.

113
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.360
So that's the problem.

114
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.400
We'll fix it again.

115
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.100
We were fresh.

116
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.310
We got the navigation.

117
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.420
Now let's get the sidebar out of here.

118
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.350
All right we want to make this house more reusable as possible.

119
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.280
We want to clean this up a little bit.

120
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.480
So where is navigation is somehow a sold.

121
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.650
I see it.

122
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.800
So where I hear it says blogsite Bart.

123
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.140
Yeah we can see the navigation right here.

124
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.270
So I'm going to click on this and all of this is navigation.

125
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.450
I mean the sidebar I'm sorry the sidebar.

126
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.240
All right.

127
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:16.120
So I'm just going to take that out and just make sure that that's the one it is.

128
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:27.900
So take it out and then go create a new file and it's called this sidebar that BHP enter.

129
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:36.260
Let's save it in here to space and save it come back to and it's let's do a include it also in here.

130
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.710
And we're going to include the sidebar.

131
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.950
All right.

132
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.980
Let me make this a little bigger for you so you can see what I'm doing.

133
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.230
All right.

134
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.990
Perfect.

135
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.720
That's looking great isn't it.

136
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.250
All right so all we have left is content.

137
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:06.260
Right here we have a lot of content here that you know it's think it's good to actually take this content

138
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.040
also out of here and put it somewhere else.

139
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.090
I think there's a lot of data here that we don't need but for simplicity and just kind of leave it for

140
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.470
now as a matter of fact let's just take it out and Dave we need a lead on.

141
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.330
I will bring it back.

142
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:20.960
OK.

143
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:27.770
Right now we we see here that Konting is actually taking a lot of space there and we could

144
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.120
reuse it somewhere else.

145
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.180
Let's just make sure that's the one.

146
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.780
Right.

147
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.950
So we got a pager right here.

148
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.130
We got the third posting.

149
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:50.270
All right so what we need to do is we need to clean some of this out because we have a couple of posts

150
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.170
there that we're not going to be using.

151
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.030
So we see the header of the polls.

152
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.320
This is the first poll right here and right here.

153
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.740
So this is all we going to need.

154
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:08.840
Actually that title the blog post the blog post titled The page heading.

155
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:10.390
All right.

156
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.260
So we're just going to need one of these because we're going to make some dynamic stuff going on so

157
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.090
let's just take it out of here.

158
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.350
Meanwhile we hear so let's just take this out.

159
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.380
Take this out and we don't even need a pager.

160
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.470
We can take the pager out.

161
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.970
All right.

162
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.710
So let's save it.

163
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:35.690
Let's come back to that file should be saved already for us.

164
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.430
All right.

165
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.340
Just refresh.

166
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:37.760
Actually

167
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.540
I can see something happening right here.

168
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:53.730
Our navigation is going to this guy and it's a good reason why he's doing that.

169
00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:00.480
We take on selling point stuff that we should not take in now and then going to fix it up in a minute.

170
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:07.850
So yeah and that's the one that we took off that we should not have taken off and let's do that right

171
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.680
now.

172
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.730
I used to got a death that makes this column eight here.

173
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.330
I'm going to put a comment right there on that page right now.

174
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.950
Let's go back to refresh it and you can see now everything is working fine now.

175
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.190
All right.

176
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.070
We're going to see only one of these and the reason is because later on we're going to make this dynamic

177
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.320
and he's going to have many of these automatically right.

178
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.940
So anyway I think we're done with this restructuring this year.

179
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.630
All right.

180
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.460
So we restructure the home page right now.

181
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:43.460
All right.

182
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.440
So take care I see you the next lecture
