Welcome back my dear students in this lecture here we're going to be adding a new feature to see a mess.

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.090
And it's a feature that when we click on the name of the author is going to take us to a page we're

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.100
going to show us all the posts related to this author right here.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.090
I think this is a really cool feature.

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.050
I'm not going to be a very complex thing but you could actually extend it and make it your way.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.410
All right.

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.710
I'm just going to give you like a big idea how this is done.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.530
I should I'm going to show you how this is done.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.980
And then you can apply it to whatever you want in your project.

10
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.560
All right.

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.880
So let's go ahead and start doing this.

12
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.900
I'm going to use this co-editor right here.

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.760
So the first thing is that we need to do is we need to send the request right here on this link to another

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.930
page.

15
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.270
All right first we need to create another page because we don't have another page for specific users

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.880
right.

17
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.200
So let's create the page first.

18
00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.970
And I think the best place to use the best template to use is post up DHB sense when we click on post

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.350
on the title we get specific polls for this idea right here.

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.970
Right.

21
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.590
So let's use something similar.

22
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.460
So post up THP.

23
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.670
I went to the Aceves and got a call this altar's alter polls.

24
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.720
All right.

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.680
That BHB.

26
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.670
There we go.

27
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.600
Now of course we need to change a couple of things here but that's something that we will do later.

28
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.930
But right now we need to get Daguerre request link going.

29
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.670
All right.

30
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.650
So what we need to do is we have the link right here that is placeholder or door.

31
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.890
So we need to send this to all your posts.

32
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.550
All right.

33
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.460
So that page.

34
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.060
And we need to send a request with it.

35
00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.380
So the request is just going to be alter here equals what we're here.

36
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.800
We got it right here.

37
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.020
Right.

38
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.300
And then we're going to send another parameter parameter and we're going to put an ampersand there and

39
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.410
then we're going to set P on this score ID equals and then you're going to pay the same thing again

40
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.270
here and mortified a little bit and send the post ID with it.

41
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.170
So let's go back and let's see what we got.

42
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.760
All right.

43
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.910
So if I go back to see a mess front with my mouse over it you can see in the bottom of my page here

44
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.040
you can see the two parameters the author and post ID.

45
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.150
Right.

46
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.850
All right.

47
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.540
So the next thing is here because we have this page right here right that we have created.

48
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.780
But if we click on it right we get this right here.

49
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.090
All right.

50
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.890
So we are getting something but we are not getting the specific polls for this user.

51
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.210
All right for example this is done by Edwyn.

52
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.920
If I go down to say this is this is going to show me the post ID falls in but it's not going to show

53
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.900
me the rest of the post.

54
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.340
All right.

55
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.500
So yeah we can go in and find out the polls.

56
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.910
We can go and find the specific polls but now polls specifically for these user.

57
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.420
All right.

58
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.710
So in the next lecture I'm going to cut this off on the next election going to show you how to bring

59
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.920
all that together.

60
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.360
Thank you so much for watching the lectures and I see you in the next one
