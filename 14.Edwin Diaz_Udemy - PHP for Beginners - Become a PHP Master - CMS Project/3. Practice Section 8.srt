00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,500
I Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,100
Welcome to Section 8 congratulations.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,270
This is awesome.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,970
I mean I'm really happy that you made it this far and you should be learning a lot on this section here.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,590
We're going to be doing password encryption.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:21,510
All right so let's go ahead and go to our document to our file and we're going to be on practical app

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,840
on the practical app ate that BHB.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,710
All right so here just asking us to use the crypt function to display a encrypted password right so

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,380
we need a variable with some values and then we need to put a variable inside the crypt function and

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,660
just play some random crazy encrypted password right.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,710
So go ahead and do that pause a video.

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,380
If you don't know how to do that we'll watch the video again.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,300
The encryption password video lecture and learn all right.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,530
So I will be waiting right here.

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,560
Don't cheat.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:55,800
All right.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,490
Perfect.

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,380
So now that you did that let's go ahead and let me do it with you so that that way we can compare code.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,420
Right.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,280
So let's go to PH B.

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,950
All righty then.

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,440
And the first thing that we need is a password right.

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:20,700
So we need to create a password and we just we can say something like my secret password don't users

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,110
by the way.

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,130
This is a I mean don't use it in their life application.

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,340
And here we need to create a crypt function.

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,140
And we're going to pass this parameter.

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:51,270
Now I'm going to do something here and I'm just going to put this in a variable right now fast or encrypted.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,630
Now I want to explain something to you we are aft before a certain version of BHB which was the old

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,830
version you've got to look it up on PH BE THAT net.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,860
I think it was before 5.3

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,050
we used the this used to work the way it is here.

33
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:15,210
Now we get a warning when we use this since we were now using an extra parameter with some more characters

34
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,970
that I show you about in the lecture which were which was the salt.

35
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:28,620
The salt is a extra string of value 0 8 going to 22 characters that we use as a parameter making them

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,130
stronger.

37
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,700
So right now we run this like this we get a warning from BHB telling us that we shouldn't we shouldn't

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,590
use that.

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,750
So let me just show you that

40
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,740
right here.

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,120
All right.

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,220
So this should work fine the way it is.

43
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:54,630
But this shows you see this Nasaw parameter was specified you must use a Randol generates holding a

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,120
strong hash function to produce a secure hash.

45
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:05,870
Right we still we still got the encryption here but he gave he gives us a warning and noticed.

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,650
All right.

47
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:15,650
So we could use a strong hash function to produce a secure hash something that will randomly generate

48
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,220
But let's go ahead and use assault.

49
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,610
Right.

50
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,210
So let's do it the right way.

51
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,160
Let's use a sword.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,370
We could leave it like this if we wanted to but this is just assault.

53
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,120
And let's just pull some strings into there.

54
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,510
And this just say something like.

55
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:46,880
To do that to do something like I use I use crazy some crazy strings some crazy strings to end it too.

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,200
I think we're equal to 22 characters.

57
00:03:50,270 --> 00:04:00,920
It's closer and it's Bazin spouse in this sort way those and gives us a dozen and gifts a notice that

58
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,530
should work fine now refresh.

59
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,700
And now we got that.

60
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:11,190
But as you can see here we didn't get a big big encryption here like we did on the lecture right.

61
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,760
Remember on the lecture how we did it right.

62
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,310
We use another parameter which the house format.

63
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,660
Right.

64
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,010
So we use that.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,900
All right so anyway we're not going to do that here.

66
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,560
I just wanted to show you that you can easily come in and just encrypt a password really quick.

67
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,900
Right so I wanted to reinforce that knowledge of that lecture.

68
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,950
But if you are curious about the lecture go back and look at it.

69
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:42,600
Anyway thank you so much for watching this video here and hopefully gave you some more knowledge about

70
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,660
encryption password encryption.

71
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,350
Take care and see your next lecture.
