1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,530
Around this video we want to display some more information we get is placed on draft pools some pending

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,130
comments or comments or sceptre accepted.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,580
So maybe subscriber users and other extra data since this is too plain I think right.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,840
So let's go ahead and do that.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,010
For that we're going to have to make some queries.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,320
So let's go to admin for Shlash in that step BHB.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,690
All right.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,800
So we've been working here.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,660
And right before the javascript right here I'm going to open my ph VTX and we're going to be doing some

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,180
queries.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,690
All right.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:47,190
And let's make this a little bigger so you can see what I'm going to do is that.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,950
Let me just put my.

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,490
All right.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,220
I'm going to grab all the way from the top the squares from the poles and one to gravid and on to PACER

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,550
right there.

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,610
There we go.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,110
This is going to be a little different here.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:20,530
What I'm going to do is I'm going to say select from polls where For starters if you remember that as

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,210
the column there post-Arab equals to your raft.

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,350
So I'm going to pool my draft in there I'm going to say here the named is variable select all draft

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,040
balls

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:48,810
and I changed the name of that here and here and then post draft count that's going to be the variable

24
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,510
that's going to have that number.

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,690
All right.

26
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,160
Now to test this real quick what we need to do is come back down here.

27
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,910
We're going to increment the load to 5 because we're going to go all around again one more time with

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,950
a little coma here.

29
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,030
We're going to insert that

30
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:15,130
tetes draft pools and make these a little smaller so you can see what I'm doing.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,810
There we go.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,010
And we're going to put a little coma here.

33
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,760
That's a coma not on line where I couldn't see my coma there.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,470
And I just kind of pace pause underscore draft count.

35
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,640
Perfect.

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,100
All right so let's go ahead and check to see how that looks.

37
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,550
Let's play there and we can see that we have one draft post right here.

38
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,340
Perfect.

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,580
So we're going to keep doing the same thing for comments and for the rest of this.

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,750
So if you want to go ahead and do that you can.

41
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,060
All you have to do is make a couple more queries right here right

42
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,150
right here.

43
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,180
And then we need one more question right there.

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,690
So the next one is comments right.

45
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:16,380
So we're going to select from where comments where comments that is I think it is equals what.

46
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,830
Let's check it out.

47
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,530
I think he's on to prove comments.

48
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,810
The status is on the proof right here right.

49
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,880
They both approve.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,140
So there we go.

51
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,650
Perfect.

52
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,950
Right.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:49,770
And select all on approved comments and that's a really long I'm just going to name this on a pool of

54
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,260
comments.

55
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,180
That was a really long variable there.

56
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:03,310
Kohary this is still a little long comment.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,820
I'm just going to call this on improve count come and count.

58
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,610
That's still long but whatever.

59
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,020
I make sure that you change it here too.

60
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,780
All right.

61
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,680
And here selects from where what's the next one.

62
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,840
Let's go to dashboard for right here.

63
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,240
Is users we don't have any for categories anything that's pending or anything like that.

64
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,900
So users is and that's one we're going to settle it from users

65
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:53,080
where user is or is a role one of these flaid subscribers subscribers.

66
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,700
All right.

67
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:02,370
And select all you know what this is going to this could be easier.

68
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,420
Subscriber

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,150
subscribers and we're going to change that right here also.

70
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,830
And we're going to just say subscriber count

71
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,210
count right there.

72
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:23,600
All right.

73
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,230
I think we did good here less we made a mistake on this come and start there.

74
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,030
So let's do the first one right here and we already have the first one actually post-draft count.

75
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,080
Let's do the second one on a pool of common count.

76
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,770
All right let's go here and let's increment the loop a little bit more.

77
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,890
Two sets is the one at a time OK.

78
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,420
I don't want you to go too crazy on that.

79
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,720
So we're going to call this one pending comments re

80
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,290
comments.

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,920
All right.

82
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:13,260
And make this a little smaller there and right here after coming count and going a full coma and pool

83
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,690
on a common count.

84
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:23,700
All right let's go here and let's refresh it and we can see pending comments right here.

85
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,350
Perfit Let's go ahead and do the next one.

86
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,590
All right if you want you can do it yourself.

87
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,290
And this one is going to be subscriber count and we're going to increment the loop a little more to

88
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,670
7.

89
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:49,500
Let's go ahead and put that value right there right after users put a coma two quotes single quotes

90
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:58,170
or apostrophes whatever you want to call it and let's call this subscribers.

91
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,390
Subscribers are going to make this a little smaller again.

92
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:14,140
If I can get it right right there and after user account put a coma and subscriber on the score account

93
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,020
right.

94
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,600
That's what I put a camera here with scriber account right there.

95
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,380
All right so let's go ahead and do that.

96
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,150
Let's check it out.

97
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,900
All right subscribers we don't have any right now.

98
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,320
Let's check it out.

99
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:42,720
We are users and we have one subscribe right here but it's not really getting it right so we have a

100
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,430
problem there somehow.

101
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,480
So we have a subscriber is not detecting it.

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,840
Let's check out our Querrey user roll subscribers.

103
00:07:52,950 --> 00:08:02,460
Let's take that as they're safe let's refresh this go to dashboard and we see that we got one subscriber

104
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,830
right here.

105
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,490
All right.

106
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,120
So all we had to do was take that s out.

107
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,870
So I think we did pretty good on this one here and I think this should be should be enough for this

108
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,040
section right here.

109
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,110
We don't have to do anything else.

110
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,050
If I do have to do something else and I forgot something.

111
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:27,990
You guys can remind me but I think we did pretty well here and now our CMAG looking great.

112
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,390
All right.

113
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,590
So we're probably going to be creating a section here just fixing issues on the mass that we may encounter

114
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,840
later on or just to extra features like IBM mentioning over and over again.

115
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,610
So don't worry this is something that's going to keep going on and on.

116
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,270
They're going to keep making new lectures for you so you keep learning.

117
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,030
I like to always give more to my students always.

118
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,410
All right.

119
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,900
So anyway thank you so much for watching this.

120
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,980
And I'll see you in the next lecture.

121
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,400
All right.

122
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,540
Take care.
