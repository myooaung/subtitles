00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.650
Welcome back my student in the last lecture we were able to send two parameters.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.690
We created a page altar's underscore put it up.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.760
All right.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.970
And we're sending two parameters here but we only see one specific pose for this user.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.430
We're now seeing all of them.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.220
All right.

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.460
So let's go ahead and use this data in this page and see what we can accomplish.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.100
All right.

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.120
So I mean author underscore posts that BHB and we are getting two parameters where we only getting one.

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.560
Here we are we are only using one.

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.290
So we want what we want to do is use the second one.

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.880
Right.

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680
So very simple.

14
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.950
The second one is going to be named Paul's alter.

15
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.140
It would go like this.

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.880
And what we're passing in is the altar.

17
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.800
That's the key that we got.

18
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.810
All right.

19
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.950
So how are we going to do this.

20
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.700
Select all from polls where we're very simple.

21
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.730
We're polls all too old for Walter.

22
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.720
I got problems mentioning using that word author.

23
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.370
There we go.

24
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.670
I think that's on the better.

25
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.350
All right.

26
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.730
So we're both equals the polls although we got there way.

27
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.670
Whoops there we go.

28
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.920
All

29
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.120
right.

30
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.380
How about that.

31
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.140
Do you think that will work.

32
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.210
Well let's see if it does.

33
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.290
We've got to go on different variables.

34
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.730
Probably the bottom of the page put it if I click on the name here then we get nothing.

35
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.710
All right.

36
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.670
So let's go ahead and find out what's going on.

37
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.980
So we're not getting any data.

38
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.140
We're not getting any errors.

39
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.060
All right.

40
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.370
So select from.

41
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.660
All right let's make sure this is in the right place.

42
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.100
All right.

43
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.120
Let's go into it again.

44
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.500
There we go.

45
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.900
Now we are getting something that we're getting all the polls for that order right.

46
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.690
Beautiful.

47
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.830
So let's go to the CMAs front again and let's check for Jose.

48
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.660
Now we're getting everything about as you see that only has two.

49
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.170
But we're getting this coming thing here we don't need that.

50
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.130
All right so let's get this get that comment out comment part out.

51
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.160
All right.

52
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.830
So this is for Welse.

53
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.800
I'm just going to delete all this right here.

54
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.640
We should delete it.

55
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.730
This to me using that stuff.

56
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.740
Here we go.

57
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.980
Make sure this is the same one there Anders's.

58
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.700
Whoops I think I deleted something extra there.

59
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.500
All right.

60
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.320
Hopefully we don't get any errors there.

61
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.010
But there we go.

62
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.790
All right.

63
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.920
Perfect.

64
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.530
So that's how you do it.

65
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.970
All right.

66
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.580
So you can implement this to whatever you want in your project.

67
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.190
You can use it we users I think is a better option than just allowing any name to be typing here.

68
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.670
When they are when you have users.

69
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.080
So when you have users Let's go to admen.

70
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.520
Right.

71
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.150
It's I think it's better that you actually display whatever the users post is.

72
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.520
You can modify this to higher you want I'm just giving you a general idea on how this is done.

73
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.750
But now you can see that you can pass all parameters catch it in another page and use them however you

74
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.610
like and we are using the right here.

75
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.220
All right to the tech the author and the post ID.

76
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.520
Perfect.

77
00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.840
All right.

78
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.230
So now the next thing here will be that when there is another link here somewhere right here.

79
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.730
All right.

80
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.020
So this is the post title and this is a post on it or here.

81
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.260
You really don't want nothing showing here.

82
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.620
All right you probably want something like this and you say POWs or all POWs by.

83
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.420
All right.

84
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.820
So no link here.

85
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.340
Take that link off.

86
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.060
Come back to the page.

87
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.430
Let's go to the front.

88
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.060
Click on the name and you can see old posts by Edwin D.S..

89
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.110
That way they can click on it any more because they are on the page that they need to be.

90
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.490
All right.

91
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.880
So anyway I think this will help you.

92
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.030
Thank you so much and I'll see you in another lecture
