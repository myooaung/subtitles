1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,020
Oh right.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,460
Welcome back my dear students I hope that most of you were able to instill composure.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,890
Or maybe you already had it.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,550
I don't know but if you have any issues please post it in discussions.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,120
OK so we can help you but at least try to solve it yourself a little boy for a little while OK.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,890
That way you learn a little more so what is the next step.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,060
Well let's go back here.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,630
This the packages page is where you can find a whole bunch of packages for BHP.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,380
OK.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,230
So here you can look for let's say mail enter and you'll find a whole bunch of packages.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,270
This just has autocomplete here.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,500
So you see you just click on the package and even tells you how to install it.

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,980
And it tells you what it is.

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,300
How many people how many installs.

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,200
OK so that's that.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,480
Let's go ahead and find out how to actually get this working right.

17
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,150
So we got the minimum installation.

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,560
We see that we need to require a file.

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,830
This is the order low file for BHP Mailer OK.

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,820
This is the file that we need to require to make sure that we have all these objects available this

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,910
week instantiate the object the class.

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,500
Right.

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,660
It's B mailer.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,680
And then we can use that to set it up and send email.

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,900
There's a bunch of things that we can do as you can see here you can set the set from address we gave

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,600
and send more addresses we can put the name of that dress out in the receipt here reply.

27
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,220
We can do attachment.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:40,680
We can even send the email of course the subject the body and even the art just in case you got planes

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,870
that don't have the email.

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,420
And then of course you can confirm the email was sent.

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,130
Super super easy.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,530
Well before we do that what I want to do is create a class.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,750
Classes file to actually save up configurations because it's not a good idea to actually have this configuration

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,040
line around there.

35
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,510
So I'm gonna create a let's create a folder here on end by the way guys.

36
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,870
This is a procedural cause I showed you how to deal with objects and that's why I was very hesitant

37
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:20,110
to show you how to send email but I had to say show you how to do this even though this is object oriented.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,380
Okay just because this is the right way of doing it let's create a directory let's call these classes

39
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:40,710
and he'd say here let's create another file called config that BHP has opened some BHP tags and let's

40
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:47,440
create a class name it config as well.

41
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,550
Great.

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,800
So what are we going to do.

43
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,680
We are going to create some costings and I show you how to create costings with a defined function before.

44
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,400
Now there is something a little newer this core concept and it's being around you can create a constant

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,030
just like this.

46
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,510
Been around for a little bit for a couple versions.

47
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,780
I'm using BHP seven but I always keep O'Grady my map installation and one of my BHP to the latest version.

48
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,620
OK.

49
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,530
Because he's not gonna break our application.

50
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,890
I got to make sure that whatever if anything breaks in the future we change it but we can use any BHP

51
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,050
version as of this video and nothing's gonna break.

52
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:34,480
So what's the difference between the defined function to define a constant and the the declaration cost.

53
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,030
Well the defined function is a little bit more flexible in certain aspects.

54
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,190
OK.

55
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,760
We don't have a lot of flexibility with this but as new versions come in we get a lot more things like

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,980
for example we were now able to do a raise here before.

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,860
Okay.

58
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,710
Let's just say so Marie.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,570
But now with his version of BHP seven I believe that's when they were introduced.

60
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,280
If I'm not mistaking or BHP sets or something like that I forgot.

61
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,960
But anyway so with a defined function there's a bunch we can we can include expressions and I believe

62
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,080
we cost you were not able to before and now you're able to sell cos he is getting up there but with

63
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,870
any five function there's a bunch of things that we can't do with cost which I'm not gonna get into.

64
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,640
Now you can look it up do a google search for the differences between cause and define.

65
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,440
But anyway so we're going to use this variable declaration we're gonna set up some constants here.

66
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:49,630
S.M. T.P. host and female trap that we are going to be using cold as same actually as MTBE dot male

67
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:49,980
trap

68
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:53,850
IO

69
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,660
is doing not cost

70
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:11,370
and this is for it I mean for the port board for that I believe is twenty five twenty five for no mistaking

71
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,530
an S empty MCP for the user

72
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:35,110
said to be user I don't know which one that is yet I have to look it up in my male trap and the password

73
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,710
OK let's go to male Trevor a quick

74
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,330
and I'm going to guys I'm going to get those settings change.

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,650
OK.

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,480
So it's up to you if you want to cut waste your time trying to log into my account.

77
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,560
Let's go to Settings real quick and I'm gonna be cupping everything from the other monitor.

78
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,790
So this is a user and we have the password here as well

79
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:34,740
let's go and require that Mailer OK class that's here somewhere OK so let's go to the file that we are

80
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:44,280
going to be using that on which is the figure up right here and let's write a little come in here

81
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,720
OK

82
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,490
we're going to configure

83
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,910
BHP Major

84
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,880
let's first include it up here somewhere.

85
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,200
So

86
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,540
let's see.

87
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:25,880
So

88
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,690
I'll have to open up whole BHP tag for that can just do it right here.

89
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,670
So what I still require

90
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,370
we noise in this directory.

91
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,940
So that's why we put dot when we are requiring files.

92
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,580
We put dot forward slash that's required stuff in the same level two dots is to get out of that level

93
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,360
go to the next one.

94
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,660
Right.

95
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:10,240
So vendor and it's called BHP Mailer BHP Mailer and then we got a hook into that class BHP mail order

96
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:10,670
load.

97
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,170
OK.

98
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,520
That's going to overload all those classes that we need.

99
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:25,100
And let's do another require and what I want to do so I need to require that classes that configuration

100
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,260
so that for and

101
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,010
why did I put that class is the same level as atom in their

102
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,940
we go is upper uppercase for some reason I got it for their upper case

103
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,960
is actually the lower case on that folder

104
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,740
name

105
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,460
and let's do the config.

106
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,100
OK.

107
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,000
So once we require that we come down here we can start using it.

108
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:26,480
So first things first male new BHP Mailer.

109
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,710
This is Edwin from the future.

110
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,150
OK.

111
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,200
So I came back to warn you about this.

112
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,220
So we're going to have the BHP Mailer instance down here.

113
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,230
Make sure that all above your code right here OK right above your code.

114
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,540
You include the mailer.

115
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,570
That's the new thing for.

116
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:52,520
OK for BHP Mailer now OK you have to make sure that this class is included all all the way on the top

117
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,150
not inside any other functions.

118
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,500
OK.

119
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,590
So put it all the wind at topping should work anyways.

120
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,110
Thank you so much for watching guys.

121
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,380
And continue your lecture with Adam from the past.

122
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,790
Take care.

123
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,140
Now we need to figure out if this class exists so how can we do that.

124
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,310
How can we make sure that this appears working.

125
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,250
And that's very simple

126
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:29,290
function right here to try to get this class we get a narrow depending on the under if we can get it

127
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,690
or not.

128
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,520
So let's go here.

129
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,710
So we use this function to get class and we just passing the object.

130
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,060
Simple as that.

131
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,850
So let's see that works.

132
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,430
And

133
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:58,460
let's go back to our code real quick and of course we have to do a whole bunch of things here to make

134
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,180
this work.

135
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,450
Let's actually take these out for me here

136
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,140
let's just comment on this

137
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,070
let's just do it here.

138
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,290
OK before we do anything

139
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,330
let's go back here.

140
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,260
And as you can see works.

141
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,670
OK so we are connected.

142
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,020
Great.

143
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,460
Make sure you undo all that

144
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,970
OK so we know that is working and we know that the object is available.

145
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,210
Now we need to start setting it up.

146
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,970
OK so let's go back to that github page real quick and let's copy some of these settings because I just

147
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,620
don't want to write all this stuff

148
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,180
go back and a base sitting here.

149
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:26,710
You can leave this comment if you like.

150
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,180
We have a host right.

151
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,680
So our host is our class config.

152
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,520
And as you can see with these two little dots we can access the class that we want.

153
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,200
OK.

154
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,550
Because we already requiring that up there.

155
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,730
So we just type in the name of that constant and that's it.

156
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,360
Let's actually do that sending

157
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,930
this for this here.

158
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:18,850
This is I believe user name or user and SNCC cure password.

159
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,460
OK.

160
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,490
So let's see what we got.

161
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,100
We got there.

162
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:34,950
And I always like to put this somewhere else and take all these out is in my way like I say if you want

163
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,670
to leave it leave it

164
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,840
anyway.

165
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,470
Great.

166
00:13:48,210 --> 00:14:00,020
So I've got the hosts I got what we're missing is the port right here and I like to have this hose they

167
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,190
use a password and the port somewhere they're

168
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,380
OK.

169
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,810
What else do we need.

170
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,700
So we have the hose.

171
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:32,370
We have we have the port number the port.

172
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,960
We are missing.

173
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,250
Well let's bring back our Sam

174
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:44,960
true.

175
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,130
Let's bring that back.

176
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,450
Let's see if Melcher works fine with it user password port.

177
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,400
I think we're good to go and if we want to send so much the email which we will.

178
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:12,460
Let's do this to true OK now it's time for us to see if this works let's try to send some type of email.

179
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:25,260
So we're going to set from and whatever address we want according faculty

180
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:39,240
and we can pass in a name if we want to as a second parameter if we want that to show let's actually

181
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,660
add an address

182
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,880
email.

183
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,640
OK.

184
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:55,070
Whatever email we type in the form and we're gonna get that email variable from up here remember OK

185
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:03,480
from the get requests OK let's actually make sure we have some type of subject

186
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,600
uppercase.

187
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,950
It's hard to remember all this.

188
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,100
That's why I always have some type of framework that I work that has all this included.

189
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:24,450
But when you're starting out it's good to actually learn the core version of BHP OK.

190
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,210
So actually this is

191
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:42,570
this is a property and we are going to say this is test email.

192
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:43,670
OK.

193
00:16:48,880 --> 00:17:00,850
Now the next one would be the body so the bodies also that and an e-mail female body.

194
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,050
I'm just gonna put that idea like this.

195
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,020
Let's go ahead and send the e-mail ready right.

196
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:15,510
Let's put this in an even if statement and we're going to say well if the mail was send or sent I don't

197
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,800
have the t there they should it put the T there but that's fine if mail is true then we're going to

198
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,950
say he was sent or something

199
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:31,730
OK

200
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,770
else

201
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,310
not

202
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,010
OK

203
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,730
OK let's check this out to see if it works.

204
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,330
Oh of course.

205
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:19,600
Make sure that we have our configuration file ready here Yeah that looks like it it is let's test this

206
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:19,870
out

207
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,130
OK so

208
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,300
so you know it says we're going to update the database we are going to configure a setup put our settings

209
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:50,920
in this object or instantiate this class of course we all the settings and send the e-mail right.

210
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,390
So let's see if that works

211
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,290
let's go here and it should send an e-mail.

212
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:10,710
Remember that the e-mail that you are put in this input has to be the e-mail you have in the database.

213
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,830
I didn't like the way that actually was.

214
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:15,480
Huh.

215
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:22,520
Oh I think I know why that is right here

216
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:30,860
no coding faculty enter.

217
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,600
And that's taking a little bit giving me a good sign.

218
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,700
And he says he was sent.

219
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:44,680
So let's go to our mail trap and as you can see we have the e-mail right here.

220
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,740
Email body.

221
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,680
And of course you can send the HMO you can test it out yourself if you make this false or if you take

222
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,080
it off you won't be able to send HDMI like this

223
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:10,020
embedded in here if you send that already you're gonna see that this will be in big here and would be

224
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,530
bolded.

225
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:10,930
OK.

226
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,820
So you are able to send HMO with that.

227
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,120
We've got it.

228
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,090
We brought you gonna do that later on.

229
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,410
So there you have it.

230
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:26,240
Now you know how to send emails OK correctly to any e-mail bots out there to any inbox bots or inbox.

231
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,720
Thank you so much guys.

232
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,620
I'll see you in the Ned's lecture.
