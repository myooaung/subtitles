00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,790
I welcome back on this video here.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,050
We're going to be learning how to check how to validate some of the data coming from the forms.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,250
We can just take any data that the U.S. sends us from this form here right.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,690
We can just take whatever they send as a command here that will not interfere with some of the functions

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,490
in our Web site or application.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,280
So we got to check for things like that.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,230
So let's go ahead and do that.

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,340
Right now we have what we are doing just echoing things out.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,010
So what I really want to do is I'm just going to do a simple validation here simple checking on the

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,730
user name.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,680
So I going to say if they use a name

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:48,220
if the user name and to find out how we're going to use a function here to find out the character and

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:54,910
numbers because I want to find out the uses is very short so I'm going to use a function call SDR length

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,150
and if I pass this parameter to this function here this function is going to let me know the amount

15
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,760
of character.

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,510
So this function right here is going to be worth the amount of character that I type in here when I

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,560
submit my form.

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,660
If you don't understand don't worry I will explain it a little bit more in detail.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:25,080
We finish so if the user name is less than 5 for example 5 characters I want to echo something I want

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:34,790
to say user name has to be longer than

21
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,360
right and they will say five right there.

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,540
So let's test this see what happens if we submit this for like this.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,460
Let's go ahead and do that.

24
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:51,770
Right.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,190
And then we're going to say one two and three characters submitted and use and it has to be longer than

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,780
five you see that.

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,010
The one where you want to do is to style this and make a read or make borders around when you display

28
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,020
it.

29
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:14,280
Now of course you can or you can do a demo right here and put the class on your C Ss and when the class

30
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:22,020
when this displays they display that color ok or that it would display those styles so we can also do

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,170
what we can do is set a minimum here mean the moon

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,770
Phyfe and then we can just take this off here and make it a variable.

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,250
That way we can have access to that in a more dynamic way.

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,710
Right.

35
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,000
And we can say this could do the same thing here.

36
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,540
And that was incentive right.

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,520
We could do that and we can also set a maximum if we wanted to.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,830
All right.

39
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,070
What I really want to check is a maxim When you can do it yourself.

40
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
Maximun.

41
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:06,350
And we can say 10 and if we change this for the Matsumura or we got to save the username is more right.

42
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,410
Well on this scale was less we're making more than this.

43
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:23,010
You know we can say something else or what we could do is we can make another statement I should make

44
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,320
another statement right here.

45
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,010
We checked for maximum instead a check for both.

46
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:42,970
Here isn't a has to be long can not cannot be longer than 10 carats and not going to write correct.

47
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,940
So if we make or use a name it's just right here.

48
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:54,840
I made a mistake somewhere probably forgot a semi-colon or something I thought was going to see the

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,350
mistake.

50
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,680
Right from here.

51
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,510
But you see there we go.

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,750
I saw it all right.

53
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,920
OK.

54
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,640
Right here so let's make or use an in really long submit is and then can that be longer than 10.

55
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,500
And if I make a really short one two and three is and it has to be longer than five.

56
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,370
You see that how we can start testing things out once we have this into variables they are a lot easier

57
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,390
to manage.

58
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,170
OK.

59
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,770
So let's check out something else too.

60
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:36,900
Let's say if all right let's do another if statement here and let's check to see if the user name is

61
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,250
included in.

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:38,880
First.

63
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,140
As a matter of fact let's create an array.

64
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,290
Let's make an array right here.

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,630
This is going to be fun let's say names and this an array.

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:58,080
He would some names and that's create a name of the first name of course is going to be one your instructor

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,350
your name here would be a student.

68
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,650
Well that's not your name but that could be your name.

69
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,210
Let's say Peter is your name.

70
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,020
What about

71
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,850
Southmead or something.

72
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,810
I don't know.

73
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:27,750
What about Mohammed or Mary or Jane or Tom.

74
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,530
All right.

75
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,050
So.

76
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,600
So we have this array here is pretty is going to be pretty fun right.

77
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,710
So we have this array and what we want to check to see if when we submit the username that user name

78
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,180
is inside our array.

79
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,010
Usually will be a database it would be you know we have this in a database or something like that.

80
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,610
And then we would look to the database to find out if that user name is there and if it's that we would

81
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,620
let the user log in to the application.

82
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,390
But in this case we got to make like this since we're not making databases on this one here on this

83
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,190
lecture.

84
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:08,360
So we're going to be using on a function here that we check to see if the user is inside an array.

85
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,420
It's really easier to do this just this function is going to call in array array.

86
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,580
And what we get a pass is two parameters.

87
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:29,750
We get a pass of the user name right and we get to pass it the name of the array right here.

88
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,290
All right.

89
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,590
So right there.

90
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:40,760
So if the user name is in the array let's say if it's not let's use it not.

91
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,690
That way you can get some practice with that if the user is not in the array and is in in disarray right.

92
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:57,290
We're going to say sorry you cannot log in.

93
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,300
Sorry.

94
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,900
You you are not allowed to do that sorry.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,400
You are not allowed.

96
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,120
We go and else we could just say welcome.

97
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,180
Or something like that I don't know.

98
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,490
Walk

99
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,320
walk.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,210
All righty then.

101
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,850
So we have a couple names here.

102
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:35,730
So I'm just going to put some other names there let's just put Marcello.

103
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,940
I go with Spanish needs anyway anyway is type an address and submit.

104
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,030
Sorry you're not allowed.

105
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,670
Oh we'll it didn't let us in.

106
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,660
All right.

107
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,710
What happened.

108
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,460
Well he didn't let us in.

109
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,160
Let's say let's type in zone something like 1 2 and 3.

110
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,140
Use as we learn the five Sorry you're now allow.

111
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,310
So we are intriguing in a couple of different validations.

112
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,710
There you see that we try again the 1 2 and 3 1.

113
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,400
Let's try again something else.

114
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,320
Submit user can be longer than ten.

115
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,350
That's a first one because it was too many.

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,020
And then sorry you're not allowed either.

117
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,350
Right.

118
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,240
Well it doesn't say either but that's what it what it is.

119
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,660
So now let's let's do something that's there inside the array Edwin is there right.

120
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,770
And let's put a password here and submit.

121
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:33,410
While we were able to log in and look at that nice right and then we will catch the users information

122
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,220
with a cookie and do something else with it right.

123
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,280
Well we could do that.

124
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,420
We can catch the users information with a sesh or something like that but we'll probably talk about

125
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,710
that more later.

126
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,750
All right.

127
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:54,710
Right now concentrate on getting this done so practice this lecture here that I'm showing you right

128
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,870
now because this is very interesting right so if you don't understand it go back and rewind it.

129
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,030
But in the last year and the last part here what we did was we created an array right here with some

130
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:13,120
names and then here we are checking to see that value is the user name is there in their own code name.

131
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,960
And if it's not there we're going to say so you're not allowed if we're going to welcome to use and

132
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,370
let a log again.

133
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,690
All right.

134
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,100
So anyway hopefully you were able to understand.

135
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,650
Can we do a little simple validation and make sure that it is there how we can make sure that the data

136
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,540
is equal to the minimum values that we set it to or the maximum values.

137
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,850
All right.

138
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,270
So hopefully he gave an idea on how we can do this and how things are done.

139
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:39,670
All right.

140
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,320
So I mean there are a lot more validations.

141
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,310
This is not the only validation the validations will probably take up two or three pages of this file

142
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:56,420
here and it would take up many lines of code maybe 100 lies and codes or more to do a really cool validation

143
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,800
function program right because validations of a really important BHB you need to make sure that the

144
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:09,020
information that is being sent from here is sanitized meaning that it's clear he's not going to mess

145
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,800
up your programs anyways.

146
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,590
Thank you so much for watching this video here and I'll see you the next one.

147
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,800
Take care.
