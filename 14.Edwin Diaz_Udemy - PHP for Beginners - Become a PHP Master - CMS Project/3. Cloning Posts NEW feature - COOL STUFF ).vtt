00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.860
Welcome back my the student in this lecture here we are going to be adding a feature that we will be

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.040
able to clone our posts.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.550
All right so we're going to select the pose and we're going to come here and we're going to find the

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.790
key word that's going to say clone.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.470
We're going to select the key word when we hit apply.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.020
He's going to clone whatever post we won.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
And the reason why we want to create something like that is just when you are trying things out in you

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.860
know you make a post or two posts and you don't want to keep creating the post manually and you want

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.050
to allow you a lot of content.

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.270
Well you've got to have this clone feature when you have selected let's say Tripos and you keep cloning

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.510
you keep applying applying apply or you keep cloning the same ideas over and over again and you're going

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.660
to have a lot of content very soon.

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.910
So this feature is going to be very lovely.

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.400
Anyway I want to take the time to say thank you for those of you that take the time to leave such nice

15
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.310
reviews out there such nice comments into discussions of war.

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.050
I am blessed to have students like you and for that.

17
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.350
Keep making lectures I keep getting motivated to wake up in the morning and see them and know that there

18
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.290
are people out there that actually care about instructors just like them start to care about their students

19
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.250
just like I care about you guys.

20
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.040
Thank you so much.

21
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.570
But anyway let's go ahead and do that.

22
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.260
Lex is going to be pretty fast.

23
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.430
So pay very close attention and rewind the video as much as you want.

24
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.030
All right.

25
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.150
That's a great thing about watching this video.

26
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.080
So now let's go ahead and let's get down to business.

27
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.500
So I got the view all posts page open right here.

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.710
View on the score on the score posts.

29
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490
So I'm going to go to a line here.

30
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.090
Let me see if I can.

31
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.530
The first thing that we need to do is we need to add the option right here.

32
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.900
So let's go ahead and do that.

33
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.870
Let's add that option.

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.790
So right here in the select on top I'm going to copy this and paste it right there.

35
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.030
And I'm going to change the value to clone and the delete key word to clone.

36
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.940
There we go.

37
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.960
All right so when I come back here whoops what am I doing.

38
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.360
There we go.

39
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.520
Now we have clone right here so now we get to that with that the next the next thing that we need to

40
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.280
do is that we have a switch statement somewhere here.

41
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.080
I need to find that we need to find it because you you're with me you see right here.

42
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.340
The last one we guys did the lead in this state in this case the lead and right below the break I can

43
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.920
add another case right.

44
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:54.380
This case is going to be called clone like this and then colon and semi-colon colon.

45
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.860
Right.

46
00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.780
It's a matter of fact just going to copy things down so that way and then we explain as I go OK.

47
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.040
I think it would be a lot easier for me to do that.

48
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.120
That way you don't have to wait 30 minutes for me to write it down.

49
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.820
All right.

50
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.330
So I'm going to I just based on that call that we need.

51
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.080
All right so we make a new case.

52
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.730
All right we start with a key case.

53
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.410
And then of course we are checking against klong and that's the select.

54
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.560
All right.

55
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.850
Right here.

56
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.640
So when we find that then we're going to be doing something right.

57
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.710
So what are we doing.

58
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:36.220
We are going inside the table searching for POWs were post ID equals the value coming from that option.

59
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.760
All right.

60
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.950
So we are selecting the pool side related to that.

61
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.030
All right just like we do end up here representing that we're doing up here.

62
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.810
And then once we check that against his post value which is right here or I remember that we are looping

63
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.500
through this array all right which is this one here.

64
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.580
All right every time I click there that value gets transmitted to that array and that's where we are

65
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.930
checking that.

66
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.100
All right just to make sure that that's the post that we want right.

67
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.430
So now we're checking against that.

68
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.160
We make the connection then we pool these values from that specific post.

69
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.780
All right.

70
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.440
And then all we do here is insert those values.

71
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.470
We make an insert and then we get the values up there into that table right here just like we've done

72
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.120
before with the Outpost.

73
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.980
Very similar to this.

74
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.580
All right if you go to an add on Scorpio's very similar.

75
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.570
As a matter of fact this is the same or I just modify this a little bit.

76
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.760
All right so once we make the insert We check here to see if a is good and if it's good then we keep

77
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.120
going.

78
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.250
If it's not we're going to make it die right here and then we break it because we need to break out

79
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.570
of that switch statement.

80
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.650
All right.

81
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.000
Simple as that.

82
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.470
So now let me just save and come back here and refresh.

83
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.090
Now we got the clone right here.

84
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.610
Now let's let let's do some cloning.

85
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.900
I'm going to put this smaller here.

86
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.210
Let's do some cloning and then select the purple and the blue array and that's going to be right below

87
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.480
here.

88
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.870
So I get a click apply and you can see the blue and purple right here.

89
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.610
All right that's news.

90
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.790
Seventy 75 and seventy six letters to two more apply.

91
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.920
I think we have.

92
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.340
And you see if I do it again 75 76.

93
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.930
There we go.

94
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.270
All right.

95
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.200
So you see those three more right here and I can do that a lot more.

96
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.620
I'm going to show you another feature that don't go anywhere.

97
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.860
I'm going to show you how to do something else.

98
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.040
All right so we got more contemn beautiful right.

99
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.330
So now you can see that everything is appearing down here.

100
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.030
Right.

101
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.890
I would like everything to appear up here.

102
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.670
The new polls to be up here so let's going fix that real quick right.

103
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.350
So we are in Pual posts.

104
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.780
Let's go down to where our loop is that we are actually displaying order or information on that page.

105
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.720
So we are selecting everything from polls.

106
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:17.170
Let's do a little skew Well here to make sure that we post just the newest I.D. on top.

107
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.200
So we're going to select everything from polls.

108
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:30.120
By Order array of actually let's make this by capital here by order

109
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.550
false ID.

110
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.460
Maybe enough again forgetting something I'm not.

111
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.730
Let me see.

112
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.990
All right.

113
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:48.190
Select all from post by order post ID descending.

114
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.200
This doesn't look right.

115
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.830
Supposed to be this supposed to change in my browser here.

116
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.590
Some Reason I think it might be right.

117
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.580
I'm just so used to my browser changing things I don't know my browser my editor.

118
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.890
Sorry about that.

119
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.260
You see I had a I have a problem there.

120
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.000
Boolean giving 1:51.

121
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.140
I knew something was and look right.

122
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.240
I order order polls by polls order

123
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.920
select from polls

124
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.570
order by.

125
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.560
There we go.

126
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.090
Sorry about that guys.

127
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.350
I don't know how I missed that.

128
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.710
I need some coffee.

129
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.370
All right so you can see everything on top.

130
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.030
Now you can see the IDs are starting the news IDs from the top.

131
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.170
All right.

132
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.510
So they were cloned again apply.

133
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.220
We can see all the new ones here.

134
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.800
Beautiful right.

135
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.990
You've got a lot of content here and you know I mean you can select everything you want is crazy right.

136
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.480
And look at this apply.

137
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.130
And now look at all the content you got right so you can play around with it.

138
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:05.970
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture for being my students are really happy and I'll see

139
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.830
you in the course or I see you there.

140
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.310
Thank you again and see you in the next lectures.
