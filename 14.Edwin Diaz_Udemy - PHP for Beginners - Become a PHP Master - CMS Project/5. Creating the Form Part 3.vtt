00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.910
All right guys so let's make sure that this is working 100 percent now.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.490
OK so let's play a little bit with this what I want to do is I want to make sure that these data right

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:22.490
here this English not these data but the selected functionality when we click it when we send information.

4
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.700
If I say English I want it to stay there in English and select that English and be that selection there

5
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.620
you know.

6
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.010
So we have to achieve you call selected that we need to include in his value option element in his option

7
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.030
element.

8
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:48.360
So we need to use BHP to detect the data and then assign some type of value accordingly.

9
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.280
OK so let's play a little bit with this.

10
00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.270
I'm going to be using one of these guys here because I want to check to see if the session said that

11
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.290
we can use temporary operations here it is easier but I'm just gonna keep l school and and keep this

12
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.700
simple.

13
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.930
So if the session is set lang session and do this

14
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:37.210
the session Lang is equal to English he and then we want to echo select it just like that OK.

15
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.880
That's exactly what we're gonna do for the other one.

16
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:51.350
Simple as that and I'm gonna take this in BHP stuff code and stuff and it's gonna place it right there

17
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.700
and I say yes and

18
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.490
that looks like about right OK.

19
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.250
So I know my form is sending the right data we have the action field empty.

20
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.230
So that's good because we are submitting data to this page so we got to make sure that everything is

21
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:27.240
working let's just refresh a here and when I click Spanish then we are getting some refresh problems

22
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.820
there let's start debugging this a little bit.

23
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.120
OK.

24
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:40.140
So right now I'm checking to see you know what whoops.

25
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.610
I think I'm missing something that I had here for some reason.

26
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.990
Let's just do this check.

27
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.640
I think I deleted this by mistake.

28
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.500
Make sure that this is not empty

29
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.070
actually.

30
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:09.190
It's to get OK let's make sure that that's not empty and if he said

31
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.820
here we're gonna change our logic a little bit.

32
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.560
Actually a lot because we are saying here in the session Lang is set an essential line is equal to Lang.

33
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.300
No we don't want it to be equal to Lang if it's not equal to Lang we need to refresh it because we don't.

34
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.640
If Izzy already equals equal to Spanish we don't want a refresher.

35
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.920
But if he's not equal to Spanish if he's equal to English we want to refresh it.

36
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.090
So our real values can actually you know be there are other values.

37
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.920
Let me explain to you what's happening right here.

38
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.880
So if I click English I won this English there to test to be there.

39
00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.130
Okay.

40
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.600
He's already selected those we already included that functionality but right here is not going to refresh

41
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.990
if I click English again.

42
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.830
Okay.

43
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.240
So that's exactly what we're doing right now.

44
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.730
If I click something else he's going to refresh.

45
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.060
Okay.

46
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.170
So that's exactly the same function I do that I got right here.

47
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.040
Now the problem with this is that let me see.

48
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.400
We need to include that inside.

49
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.110
And this is one of the reasons why my team might not be working.

50
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.190
This needs to be in its own if statement and this needs to be in its own means.

51
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.070
If statement.

52
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:42.650
One of the reasons.

53
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.550
Let's check the files okay.

54
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.400
Let's go back to registration now we need to start changing things in registration to make it work.

55
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.300
Let's go back here to register and right now.

56
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.100
Just some BHP tags

57
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.070
OK.

58
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.100
And we are going to echo the register.

59
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.800
There we go.

60
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.010
Now refresh if I can put this in Spanish.

61
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.410
You can see that he changed to Spanish.

62
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.430
He's trapped.

63
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.680
And I don't I'm not even sure if I'm spending it right.

64
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.990
All right.

65
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:34.810
Let's change a place holders instead of the labels because the labels is only working if it's another

66
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.630
device.

67
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:43.900
Right now let's just change this and the PSP echo and this would be their user name right.

68
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:55.300
So on the score username I'm going to do this for all of them all the place holders we got their I'm

69
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.180
going to recap in a minute if you guys they now understand what's going on.

70
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:09.540
Okay let's just put email here and we got one last one which is password a password

71
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.860
and we go Oh and we've got the button here I think this here

72
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.170
we can use the register there we go.

73
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.390
So there you go.

74
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:34.220
If I click English you can see now that says register enter your username your e-mail and your password.

75
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.000
Spanish he said that that number you swipe it to quarter to clothing and he used that there right here.

76
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.770
Awesome.

77
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.210
Right.

78
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.230
So a little a quick recap on our functionalities here.

79
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.140
OK.

80
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.820
So let's start from the form.

81
00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:03.870
This is the form right here and here when we change when we select something else we are going to trigger

82
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.850
his own change event handler here.

83
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:15.370
This own change is going this javascript code is going to you know do something for us.

84
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.750
Right.

85
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:22.240
And in this case is going to execute this function called Change language right here.

86
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.950
Whatever is inside its function is going to be executed.

87
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.650
Right now we're getting the form and we are submitting.

88
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.700
That's all we're doing.

89
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:37.850
Every time we change a value in this select right here element we are executing we are submitting the

90
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.790
form.

91
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:45.980
And when we submit the form get data is going to be submitted and get data.

92
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.460
If you don't remember get data is going to be right here under your url.

93
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.070
So that's why you always going to see some values here.

94
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.580
Because by default the method get get data is going to be in the URL.

95
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.320
OK.

96
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.250
What is that.

97
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.520
Get Data.

98
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:08.600
Well I get data is included inside this value right here in the option element right now is going to

99
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:15.170
be either N E N or E S depending on the selection that I have here.

100
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:23.690
So if I select e n which would be the first option if I selected then these data E N is going to be

101
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:29.070
submitted to r d very well right here.

102
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.050
Basically it's going to be equal right here.

103
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:32.100
OK.

104
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.100
Get Lang.

105
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.130
That's what e end would be.

106
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.210
That's where we would be.

107
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.410
So if he said we're good and if he's not empty we are good.

108
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:45.040
And then once we have that data we are going to be assigning it to a session now.

109
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.120
They e n is going to be held in this session.

110
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.560
And now what we're doing is we're checking to see if we set.

111
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.850
Because if he said everything is good right.

112
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.220
And if it's not equal to Lang right.

113
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.280
To what it's currently on the Select element then we are going to refresh it.

114
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:12.120
So if it's not equal to Spanish if it's equal to English right like this we are going to refresh us

115
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.740
or our new data will pop up.

116
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.790
Right.

117
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.240
And then here once all this is done right we've got another.

118
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.540
If said or if statement you're saying listen if the session Lang is set OK in this case is e n right.

119
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:35.760
Because that's what we got right here then we are going to include that file dynamically the session

120
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.280
has the e end and then we are completing that with that BHP so that's going to be the name of the file

121
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.840
which is including our languages directory.

122
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.360
OK.

123
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:55.510
But if it's not said then we are including a default file which is in in small words the English file.

124
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:55.820
Right.

125
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.700
IAN OK super simple.

126
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:07.460
So we are including data from another file depending on the values of this get request that we are setting

127
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.660
right here.

128
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.070
Simple as that.

129
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.370
OK.

130
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:17.250
And then we are refreshing the page so that way we can see the new values super simple guys.

131
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:23.040
I hope this was a very very good data for you a very good knowledge.

132
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:28.520
I hope you take advantage of a and you translate some parts of your site or maybe a whole site.

133
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.040
And you know I hope you enjoy it.

134
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.740
