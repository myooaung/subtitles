00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.120
High we finally finish this section here.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.720
Congratulations you did a great job if you win all the way now.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.320
At the end of the section here I told you that we will be practicing so we will be using this app here

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.860
that I may for you guys.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.440
So that way and when I say you guys I mean ladies too I know that some ladies are taking the course

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.670
so this is this practical app here is found if you've seen a folder on your practical app exercise firewalling

7
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:36.120
you of course exercise files called Inside the Demel folder right here practical app this is your practical

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.620
app right here.

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.930
All right if you want to find the best way to do that it would be on your local whoas.

10
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.200
Them all on the score practical iPhone app and I put it on the score there just to put these folders

11
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.710
on top.

12
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.140
Here's what I wish you could see it because if I don't pull on the score it will probably do alphabetically

13
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.360
and it will be something right in the middle somewhere.

14
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.520
So I want you to find them so that's why I put it on the score on the beginning of the file so that

15
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.260
way we'll put it all the way on the top.

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.720
OK.

17
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.860
So we're using this app here to do some exercise.

18
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920
Now how do we start using this.

19
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.460
All right.

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.960
So I'm going to go here to our coeditor and I'm going to open this

21
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.870
as a matter of fact I think I already have it opened here somewhere right here.

22
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.270
OK.

23
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.710
So all you have to do is if you have not actually I think just by opening the hold them for that you

24
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.440
have access to these two folders right here so you can see right once you drag them on to your code.

25
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.650
Or you should have access to it.

26
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.020
If not just go to the first page here on the score practical app and just click here and you are there

27
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.460
actually your home would take it to the home page once you get typing like this practical app and click

28
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.980
it in your home page right now.

29
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.770
We will be doing this.

30
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.600
All right so how do we start using it.

31
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.800
Really simple.

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.820
Let's go to the practical app.

33
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.530
Click here on the first one that BHP which is the first section there.

34
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.960
All right here we have the code for the page of course with other functions.

35
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.410
These are files that you don't need to be concerned about.

36
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:24.420
This is Files that I'm using for the application but here on the steps here on the content on the meta

37
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.780
of the lecture here the file here you need to be concerned about is the steps I laid out the steps here.

38
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.840
Step one use the echo function to say hello we H.T. mail H-1 tags embedded inside BHB.

39
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.270
All right.

40
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.020
So this looks like this here because I'm having a little resolution but anyway instead to write a comment

41
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.690
above the function so this is a really simple function going to show you how to do that.

42
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.280
Now as a matter of fact you should know how to do that.

43
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.330
Pause the video and start doing it.

44
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.540
And then if you have any problems then I will go ahead and help people post a video now and do it all

45
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.740
right.

46
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.610
Hopefully you were able to pause the video and did it yourself.

47
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.560
If not you only hurting yourself so make sure that you do it.

48
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.510
Well you can learn more.

49
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.870
All right.

50
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.240
So let's go ahead and do it ourselves now.

51
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:24.240
So what I'm going to do is says the way eco function and I do an eco functions here and I just to say

52
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.330
hello I'm actually the morning say no right.

53
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.760
And I say I'm going to say hello

54
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.350
H-1.

55
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.650
Right.

56
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.310
Here we go.

57
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.730
And then we need to put a comment on top of this.

58
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.900
And the come would be something like I'm going to do a one line comment for was for Slash and it's going

59
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.670
to say this function says hello.

60
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.290
That's it.

61
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.670
That's all I want you to do there I want you to get in the habit of doing that and save and come back

62
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.310
here.

63
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.250
Let's go to Section 1 and see what's going on.

64
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.360
There we go.

65
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.580
A function saying hello.

66
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.220
All right.

67
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.810
So this is it for this section here.

68
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.860
Now go to the next practice session.

69
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.860
And while I see you the next practice session once you finish all the lectures on there.

70
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.010
All right thank you so much and hopefully you are enjoying this and I see you then
