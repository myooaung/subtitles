00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:07.720
Welcome back a student in this section here I'm going to show you how to build a functionality that

2

00:00:07.800  -->  00:00:14.470
is going to keep track of how many users your current CMS has on line.

3

00:00:14.490  -->  00:00:16.580
At one point of time.

4

00:00:16.650  -->  00:00:19.230
So let me show you exactly what we're going to be doing.

5

00:00:19.230  -->  00:00:24.570
So let's go to admin real quick and I'm sure you right now you see here on this link right here it says

6

00:00:24.570  -->  00:00:27.180
user users on line 1.

7

00:00:27.180  -->  00:00:27.750
All right.

8

00:00:27.810  -->  00:00:31.140
So keep keep a really close eye on this.

9

00:00:31.190  -->  00:00:31.740
Right.

10

00:00:31.980  -->  00:00:38.810
I'm going to show you I'm going to open another tab somewhere in the admin and now I'm going to refresh

11

00:00:38.810  -->  00:00:40.720
here.

12

00:00:40.980  -->  00:00:43.220
Actually it made me look really bad.

13

00:00:43.220  -->  00:00:46.000
And that's just because I have the same browser.

14

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:47.880
But I need to go to another browser.

15

00:00:47.880  -->  00:00:49.150
Sorry about that.

16

00:00:49.350  -->  00:00:50.820
Let's go to another browser.

17

00:00:50.820  -->  00:00:54.230
Let's go to crawl of Firefox.

18

00:00:54.230  -->  00:01:00.120
I'm going to refresh my Firefox right here and I'm going to refresh here and you can see now that it

19

00:01:00.120  -->  00:01:01.380
says users too.

20

00:01:01.500  -->  00:01:06.640
So now I'm going to go to another browser Let's go to safari Safari right here.

21

00:01:06.810  -->  00:01:10.110
Open the same page I'm going to refresh.

22

00:01:10.420  -->  00:01:12.390
And now if I come here and refresh.

23

00:01:12.390  -->  00:01:14.490
You can see that I've got use history.

24

00:01:14.490  -->  00:01:20.430
Now I'm going to actually turn my close this window.

25

00:01:20.430  -->  00:01:21.300
All right.

26

00:01:21.660  -->  00:01:26.760
So now after a couple of seconds this is actually going to stay users too.

27

00:01:26.760  -->  00:01:32.240
All right so we're going to keep track of how many seconds these users have been on you know logged

28

00:01:32.300  -->  00:01:38.250
down into this page right here and depending on those seconds we're going to say you know what these

29

00:01:38.250  -->  00:01:39.510
users are not online anymore.

30

00:01:39.510  -->  00:01:43.800
And every time they come back we can say OK he's on line.

31

00:01:43.830  -->  00:01:45.200
All right so that's what we're going to be building.

32

00:01:45.210  -->  00:01:45.540
Let me see.

33

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:46.960
Let me refresh now.

34

00:01:47.220  -->  00:01:48.820
Still counting.

35

00:01:48.810  -->  00:01:49.800
All right.

36

00:01:49.860  -->  00:01:56.070
So anyway that's going to be a function I think for that we need to go to our BHB admin and build a

37

00:01:56.070  -->  00:01:56.860
table for it.

38

00:01:56.880  -->  00:01:57.210
All right.

39

00:01:57.210  -->  00:02:01.420
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

40

00:02:01.590  -->  00:02:04.260
We're going to be our table is going to be called users on line.

41

00:02:04.260  -->  00:02:06.490
Let me refresh your IT AGAIN see what happened.

42

00:02:06.630  -->  00:02:07.130
All right.

43

00:02:07.130  -->  00:02:10.790
There you see now these users on line street too.

44

00:02:10.920  -->  00:02:13.780
That's because we closed that window.

45

00:02:13.920  -->  00:02:20.790
So let's go to our CMOS to BHP oddment and build a table.

46

00:02:20.790  -->  00:02:21.510
All right.

47

00:02:22.020  -->  00:02:31.230
So let me just bring my window here let's build a table called the users own line and we're going to

48

00:02:31.230  -->  00:02:34.380
have three fields here.

49

00:02:34.380  -->  00:02:39.870
First field is going to be the ID of course and this functionality can be extended to you know even

50

00:02:40.170  -->  00:02:45.260
look at the first time the user ever logged then and the last time and things like that.

51

00:02:45.260  -->  00:02:49.440
All right but we're going to just we're just going to build this functionality so you can get an idea

52

00:02:49.440  -->  00:02:50.480
how this works.

53

00:02:50.820  -->  00:02:57.240
So let's go to a primary here in autoincrement of course we want to have an idea that incremental automatically

54

00:02:57.240  -->  00:03:03.930
so we can keep track and then we're going to have a session field in a time field.

55

00:03:03.930  -->  00:03:08.510
So let's do our car for session and time to do 11.

56

00:03:09.010  -->  00:03:14.700
I think we're good here 55 session 11 var coring it.

57

00:03:14.730  -->  00:03:16.590
Okay we're good to go.

58

00:03:16.590  -->  00:03:17.310
All right.

59

00:03:17.310  -->  00:03:22.980
So now that we have this now we need to start building the cold BHB functionality so in the next lecture

60

00:03:23.310  -->  00:03:25.130
we're going to start building that.

61

00:03:25.260  -->  00:03:27.450
Thank you and I see you in the next lecture
