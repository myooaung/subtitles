1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,990
Or write perfect song the last video we were finally able to of day stuff from the database.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,520
Right.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,130
So we we did some creation and we did some updating now.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,580
It's time for us to delete stuff from our database that there are certain things that we don't want

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,380
so let's go ahead and create something actually first.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,050
And we're going to log in on the score create.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,210
And I'm just going to say something like maybe

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:38,180
Quest men and if you ask me where I get his name don't I just I don't know.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,770
Right.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,240
Instead of when we clicked so me here instead and that create log and create we can have something like

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,220
Recker creator or something like that if we wanted to.

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,640
All right.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:57,630
So we can come here and as a matter of fact that's what this is doing is something right here we are

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,900
connected right.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:09,840
So we could actually right here used to include to include the databasing here instead array.

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,240
And let's just bring to the be here the B that BHB.

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,720
Right.

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,640
So let's just bring it here and let's just take this connect connection here.

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,440
So two to two connection right here is take it out of there.

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,200
We don't need it.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,110
We can use include it.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,310
All right.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,650
So we could refactor all this and make sure that we as a matter of fact.

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,680
Let me show you how to delete stuff for us and then the end.

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,030
Just do some more refactoring.

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,550
Right.

27
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,240
So anyways so what we want to do is go to log in on the score update and we are going to be creating

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,720
a function to delete this with a query from the database.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,020
All right.

30
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:03,390
So let's do some Save As and delete on the score delete save.

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,100
Now this is going to be very similar.

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,280
All right very similar.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,210
Now another thing very similar to the update function that we have in here

34
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:21,500
functions this update right here so that's exactly what we are going to do.

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,720
But before we do that before I forget let's just change the form here because if we don't change it

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,590
we're going to have all kinds of problems.

37
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,760
Let's change the actions.

38
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:37,090
Action page is going to be the lead now.

39
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,610
So that when that's a mess say nothing of the stuff.

40
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,030
Again I wouldn't want to update things.

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,750
And let's go to functions now.

42
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,640
Actually right here I don't have to go here this is my working for us but I'm still learning with this

43
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,190
new coeditor how to do things.

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,930
So I'm going to copy this update table I'm going to bring it down.

45
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,390
I'm going to call this delete delete rows.

46
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,460
All right.

47
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,850
And what I want to change here.

48
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,250
Well we want to change the query because right now we're not going to be updating stuff we are going

49
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,130
to be deleting.

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,940
So I'm going to delete this is going to be really simple by the way.

51
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,990
Delete from users.

52
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,850
That's it.

53
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,250
That's what we need here.

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,860
We don't even need this deleted.

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:34,110
We don't even need the whole form with other the sideboard we're just going to keep her right and that's

56
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,530
about it.

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,300
That's all we need here.

58
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,280
Let's go to the live form and check it out.

59
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,150
Oh and we need to go to functions and make sure that we are calling that function from another site.

60
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,480
Delete.

61
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,190
And if we click on Delete we just cannot take that out.

62
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,900
We're not going to be updating we're going to be deleting.

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,840
All right so I think we're done with this.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,950
Let's just check it out.

65
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,480
We have a couple of ideas here that we want to get rid of so we refresh here.

66
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,820
We got some stuff here going on some quest men Kwasman.

67
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Oh yeah.

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,160
Out of ideas that we creating here let's just delete it.

69
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,530
Eleven actually.

70
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,050
Hold on

71
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,560
hold on hold on.

72
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,360
Hold on.

73
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:43,460
So we have a problem in the functions that's created is so the Live from users where Id Cool's ID and

74
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,460
we're bringing everything down.

75
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,300
OK.

76
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,170
Does this look good here.

77
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:57,330
But I'm just saving here make sure that we are calling the right.

78
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:05,870
Let's go to delete a post made then I want to have this restore check again.

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:13,280
I just saved some of it delete save and save.

80
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:22,400
They said to me I have a mistake on the query but I don't know about that.

81
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,450
Let's check it again.

82
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:30,150
The lead 10 update now of days going out to change that buntu you have an error in US you check the

83
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,880
manual near ID 10 line 1.

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,080
That was usually a coma on there that we were.

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,300
That's where we had a problem so let's go down to functions.

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,050
Let's go to the lead and see where the problem is.

87
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,070
The lead from users we need to put that space here.

88
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,850
Remember that.

89
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,660
Right.

90
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,880
So this can actually trip you off man.

91
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,290
It can just really be a problem.

92
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,490
So let's go to the form now.

93
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,480
Now we can delete right.

94
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,930
And we can see that that is not there.

95
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:14,610
That's just take the form and make sure that the value is delete right here.

96
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,670
Perfect.

97
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,100
All right so let's delete another one.

98
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,020
11 delete nine delete.

99
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,890
Come here.

100
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,580
Check it.

101
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,060
Now we only have two of them.

102
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,270
So now let me recap what we did.

103
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,560
All right.

104
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,870
So that way you can have a better idea.

105
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,660
All right so let's go to functions actually.

106
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,530
And all I did was copy this.

107
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,310
You see we're using the same query.

108
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:54,240
We're using a query variable and we are also using that variable there to pass it to the database with

109
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,670
this function right here.

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,820
Just I hope you got the general idea on this right.

111
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,260
This is all one query this is on one string together put together and we're using my ask you ally the

112
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,820
score query to pass it in with a connection and with a string which is in this case equal to his variable

113
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,120
rate here it is I just concatenations for this query.

114
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,010
Basically there is one query all put together.

115
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,450
All right.

116
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,950
So when we pass it in we pass it in and this connection here this query here is equal.

117
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,000
We make it equal to the variable result.

118
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,000
OK.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,730
And then here we just saying if we have a problem and this is for's if the result is not good or they're

120
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,900
Querrey right then we have a problem like we saw there.

121
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,160
It's very useful.

122
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,980
So that's all we're saying here what you said in the query straight to the database and right here this

123
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,990
is all database askew language.

124
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,720
Ok this is a sentence you were writing there.

125
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,530
Well you were right.

126
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,850
They used a set you will go to the command line right this and you are right on data into as well which

127
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,090
is using BHB to do it with his function right here.

128
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,660
Right.

129
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,710
So I just basically copy this whole thing and came here and wrote another Querrey and I sent another

130
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,310
query to the database and this query was deleted from users.

131
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,870
Remember this is as well.

132
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,520
Don't get confused is not BHB right.

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,310
So hopefully you understand this concept.

134
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:27,510
As you can see here we win clauses in two functions and we were able to call it here on this file right

135
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,320
here.

136
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,550
We have includes here.

137
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,450
This function will include a file from another place into this file here.

138
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,720
So it would be the same thing as having the DVH would be the same thing as having this day be on the

139
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,720
file.

140
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:44,970
All right.

141
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,790
This this whole thing is getting included on top here like he was here basically.

142
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,360
Right.

143
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,910
Hopefully you can understand that.

144
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,640
Right.

145
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,650
So if you want to keep watching some more refactoring I will be doing it on after this course this tutorial.

146
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,400
Video.

147
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,120
But if you don't want to watch it on more refractory when you're done you can just jump into the other

148
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
section.

149
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,390
All right.

150
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,880
So anyway thank you so much for watching this video here and hopefully I see the next one.

151
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,330
Thank you
