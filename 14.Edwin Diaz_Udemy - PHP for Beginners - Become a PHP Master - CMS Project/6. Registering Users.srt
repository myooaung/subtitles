00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,730
Welcome back my students in this lecture here we're going to be learning a lot.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,940
All right so pay very close attention anyway.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,050
For those of you that are really excited about the PH be object oriented programming course that I have

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,000
coming up I'm just going to tell you that I'm getting it ready just take it a little bit more time than

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,800
I thought.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,430
Well don't worry it will come.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,670
And you got to love it.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,660
All right.

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:32,250
So anyways let's go ahead and do what I want to do in this lecture here first of all is that I want

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,060
to put a link here for registration that PH BE ph.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,460
And I also want to go to and this is where I am right now.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,740
Go to your navigation BHB that should be under your CMOS and inside your includes.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,790
All right.

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,160
Here.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,900
Go there.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,790
That's your navigation.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,410
And then we're going to be adding a link here so I'm just going to copy this.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,880
That's the first thing that we are going to be doing.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,040
And then I called this registration

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,130
and copy the same word is we don't have to write it again.

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,790
Paste that BHB.

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,860
All right.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,560
So let's go back and see how the if is working good and click on it and it takes us to BHB right to

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,010
the registration page.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,870
All right.

26
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,700
Perfect.

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,670
Second thing that I want to do is go to your registration that BHP.

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,670
All right.

29
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:45,350
And that should be under admin and then in St. colludes actually is not and includes the restrictions

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:52,160
actually outside on the CMOS folder and actually on the route on the asphalt and that's it that's where

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,280
registration is.

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,170
All right.

33
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,660
So anyway so one of the things that I want to do is I want to take this Wildblue loop body here.

34
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,360
All right.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,810
The reason is because we don't need to loop through the whole table to get its value out.

36
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,770
We can just get the first value.

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:18,530
All right the first value of the database of the end of the table right of this first value and we get

38
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,440
it out and that's it and we're done with it.

39
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,360
But we don't need to go around.

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,310
So let me show you another way of doing this or this is Neal you probably have not seen this right.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,800
I just cannot take that off.

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,070
And that's it done.

43
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,100
We don't need to do anything out there.

44
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,310
We were doing that for demonstration purposes only.

45
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,440
So now what we want to do is we want to start making the Querrey to go into the inside the database.

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,710
All right.

47
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,490
So let's go ahead and do this.

48
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:59,420
I actually have something already that I want to copy and paste here so that way we don't take 20 minutes

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,950
writing this stuff.

50
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,370
All right so you're going to piece this in here.

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,160
All right.

52
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,050
All right so what do we got.

53
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,120
Here we got a Querrey.

54
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,330
We've got a variable holding our query like we've done so many times.

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:19,490
We're going to insert this into users a user the user name e-mail password and access.

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,750
All right.

57
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,380
That's going to be.

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,290
Let me just go back to our BHB make sure that we have that there.

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,200
We have to see if we have that Culham the array HP my admin.

60
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,020
Then we go to see a mass users and see if we have access.

61
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,920
We don't have we have a user role.

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,200
All right so that would be user role right instead of at.

63
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:55,010
So we would change this to the user actually use or underscore role.

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,890
All right perfect.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,270
Then we have we are concatenating here we continue industry down here and then we are inserting the

66
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:11,240
user name the email the password and then the last one to make sure it is user rule.

67
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,090
And when I do my file we are going to be hard coding something here we're going to just name it.

68
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,220
So Stryver make sure that you Harcourt is.

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,500
So this is going to be a string.

70
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,280
OK.

71
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,670
By default that that's what's going to be subscriber then that means we change it right now.

72
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,480
Then we send the Querrey right with a connection in Querrey we've done this many times.

73
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,670
If the square was successful is not successful then we get this error.

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,320
Right.

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,140
All right.

76
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
That looks like we're good there right.

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,090
All right let's save it and check it out to see if it works right.

78
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,240
So let's go back here.

79
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,410
And this just make sure that we just put whatever here.

80
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,280
I don't know Demel 3000.

81
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,770
I know I come out with some strange names right.

82
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:14,770
I guess another creative and I don't know Sanjay passwords there and register then we have a long name.

83
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,380
All right so we have a feel that it's not the same a column field.

84
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,050
So let's make sure that yeah I remember now.

85
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,820
All right.

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,770
Email user e-mail everything Here's user and not doing that in my query.

87
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,020
Ooh not good not good user user name user email.

88
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,000
Make sure that you do that.

89
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,740
OK.

90
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,630
That's why it's always good to have those errors displayed.

91
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,310
User password and user role.

92
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,910
All right.

93
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,240
OK let's let's check it out let's see.

94
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,140
Let's see if it works.

95
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,050
Now what kind of error we get back.

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,600
I haven't really tested this before I showed it to you.

97
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:10,560
I like to do like this freestyle Demel 3000 4000 to 4000 now and G.M. and re-used.

98
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,660
There we go.

99
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,420
Looks like you want to do.

100
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,690
Now let's check it out.

101
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,600
Refresh.

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:15,930
All right.

103
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,880
So we went through we got the demo and we got the user password.

104
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,270
We got the username password ID and even e-mail.

105
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,470
All right we can check it out we can go to admen users.

106
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,960
We can see that we have this guy right here.

107
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,350
Damn 4000.

108
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:39,250
We have some information that person can come here and edit and enter their remaining information if

109
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,020
they want to.

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,490
And that's it.

111
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,360
That's it for that the user come back here and now everything's updated.

112
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,150
All right.

113
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,370
So the next lecture we're going to be doing some more modifications to this registration page because

114
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,090
what I want to show I want to show some validation.

115
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,570
You know I want to be able to for some reason the user or those not clicks here right now if we click

116
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,900
here I think it makes any record if we go back and check we make a new empty record so we want to stop

117
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,440
this function from happening.

118
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,800
And we had the sense I want to give the users some feedback saying you know this cannot be empty and

119
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,720
you need to fill it up right.

120
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,410
So on the next lecture we're going to be playing around with a little bit.

121
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,600
And so you know that's one take care.

122
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,330
Thank you.
