00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,590
Hi welcome back the students on this video here we are going to find out how to collect data from forms.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,540
This is actually really exciting.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,870
BHP was meant to do a lot of things in this.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,880
This is one of the things that be so great doing the right.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,070
So let's go ahead and start doing that.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,170
So the first thing that we got to do is do Aceves of course and that blank that BHB and I'm going to

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,910
explain a couple of things to you before we get started.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:33,940
So I just going to make a file called form ph be right and get it ready on the browser there.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,200
All right.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,380
Perfect.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,160
So now what's going on with this collecting data.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,040
With a super global cold very post well post is a.

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:56,160
Like I said super verbal super global variable and is called Pulse non-global and this will pick up

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,210
the data that we send it to.

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,930
We send it using forms.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,930
So we pick up data from form in a post format.

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,670
So I don't know if you've seen forms.

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,750
If you are a developer you probably seen forms before there and you've seen the data inside but you

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,080
don't know how it worked.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,860
I want to show you in this video how it works.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,800
So let's make a forum for it first and let's find out the ins and outs of the form.

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,050
So I'm just going to create a forum with some inputs and I'm going to explain in a minute what is key

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,100
word here is what he means.

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,690
And I just going to have a couple of inputs here.

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,420
This one is going to be full password.

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,270
The first one is going to be for names and this one is going to be just a submit button and put a B

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,940
or tag right here.

28
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,030
All right so we have a data form.

29
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,990
What's the matter.

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,950
Let's do some placeholders so that way the user knows why they have to type in there.

31
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:04,440
So placeholder and then she's going to say enter name or user name is user name usually is a user name

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,880
and password and has just finished a placeholder typed here.

33
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,730
Come back here.

34
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,440
There should be enough.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,790
Right.

36
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,600
There we go.

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:30,010
As a matter of fact we are missing this a password right now right password not peace.

38
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,730
Word Perfect.

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,430
So we have this forum here right now.

40
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,760
This key word is key word does.

41
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,350
It sends this data to another page.

42
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,880
Usually we send the data to a function that BHB or foreign that BHB to process.

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,860
Right now we want this data to be sent to this form here.

44
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,510
This page form that BHB.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,030
Right because we are going to be processing the data right here on this form.

46
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:04,470
We're going to be picking it up and the way census data is with this out you here called post with post

47
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,070
information post data pull data is usually usually for forms.

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,590
Jesus if I can get this right that would be nice.

49
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,380
That would go right.

50
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,430
So we are telling whoever is big in this form whoever is process in this form that the data here is

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,140
post.

52
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:32,010
So we got to we've got to extract the user name out of here we've got to extract the password values

53
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,000
out of there.

54
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,100
Ambil right now before we do we before we do this we need to find out.

55
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,130
This form was submitted because if we check for values and this form was not submitted we we're going

56
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,880
to get a narrow mph BHP is going to try to find the values is going to say to us Well something went

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,290
wrong.

58
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,580
I can't find this value is going to give us an error.

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,770
So now we say that we are going to pick up this information we're going to send it via polls.

60
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,790
And for that we need to receive it and we're going to receive it to the variable post this super global

61
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:11,260
is actually fine like this in this super global We are going to be saving all the post data from forms.

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,910
So let's go ahead and put a BHB taxing here and use the super global to get that data.

63
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,670
As a matter of fact what we're going to be getting is it's finding out this phone was submitted so I'm

64
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,050
going to show you how to do that.

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,340
So we're going to create an if statement here and we're going to find out if polls but you've got to

66
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,240
also keep in mind that when this form gets admitted not only does We've made this right we made the

67
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,050
first input.

68
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,050
Remember it's a super global and a super global works a little different than a super global variable

69
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,780
works a little different than the regular variable.

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,080
As a matter of fact this information gets turned into an associative array.

71
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,050
So this user here becomes the value.

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,150
All right.

73
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:06,390
Because I'll show you right now in a minute but this post here we'll pick up the value that we send

74
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,580
it to and we are going to show you another key that we use here to send that value to the polls to the

75
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,060
associative array which is a super global variable.

76
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,580
And it could be a little confusing but if you see I'm going to show you exactly what it is right now

77
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,130
so please don't get confused.

78
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,270
So we're going to use a function call is set right inside this if statement and we're going to find

79
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:35,550
out if the post variable super global right variable is available but we say that it gets turned into

80
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,050
an associate of array What do we want to check when we check for associative array we have to check

81
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,130
for what's inside what value is right.

82
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,430
So this would be the associative array post-ride would be the array.

83
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,420
And what are we checking for.

84
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,800
Well there's another key that we use code name and you're going to see that in the forums with without

85
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,460
this key word you can't send data to the super Global Post.

86
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,810
Right.

87
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,820
So we are going to be what do we want to send.

88
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,460
This is going to turn into that value right here.

89
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,770
We want to send this submit right we pull whatever we want in here.

90
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,970
But I just want to call it something because that's what it is.

91
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:27,120
So we're going to check this mid value here is set.

92
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,610
So this is this.

93
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,900
Remember this is this elmet been here actually right here.

94
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,010
This is the summit.

95
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,870
And the only way this value gets submitted is when we click it when we click it.

96
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,710
All right.

97
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:49,460
This guy is going to send the information to form that BHB room and we're going to pick it up because

98
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,690
information information's imposed via a format in post format.

99
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,610
We're going to pick it up right here.

100
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,000
We're going to.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,300
The first thing that we're going to become is this BHB right because we are in the header of that document.

102
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,270
So and this is a Ph.D. So Apache is going to be looking for information.

103
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:14,870
So he runs this and says oh I got to stay here and he runs the State me he says is a set post.

104
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,860
So admit they don't want you to do this so he's going to run this BHB called before anything else on

105
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,850
that page when he gets a minute when he this action here get sent sends the data to that form ph B which

106
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,820
is this form via post.

107
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,890
Hopefully you understand is not the word we're going to recap at the end.

108
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,110
So I just going to say echo if the submit button was pressed.

109
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,180
All right yes he works

110
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,690
works.

111
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,170
There we go.

112
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,370
So we're going to come here we're going to click submit.

113
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,450
Yes it works.

114
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:55,320
You see that we got the data we got this M-ID value from down here when we clicked on submit and we

115
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,600
were able to do something with it.

116
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,240
All right.

117
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,070
So very simple again.

118
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,600
Let me recap a little bit here what we did.

119
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,840
We know that this is the form.

120
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:04,700
Right.

121
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,690
And we know that this action was going to send the data to this page here and we're going to see later

122
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:17,040
on how we can send it to another page but right now we are sending it here via post format right.

123
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,860
And then we've got well what are we sending right now.

124
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,270
The only thing we are sending is this input's right here because we're using this name keyword right

125
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,350
now and leave it up to you if you want to do it before you watch the next video how you can send the

126
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,000
rest of the information to the post right here.

127
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,170
Don't check for it for it if you want to check for it go ahead and use the other the other inputs and

128
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,190
check for that data and then say you know echo I found a user name.

129
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,980
I found the password.

130
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,290
So if you want to go ahead and do this to hear yourself do try to do it and then watch all the video

131
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,200
and see if you know your my answers is the same as yours.

132
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,760
All right so anyways I leave that up to you if you want to do that.

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,820
Remember that this gets turned into an associate array here and we'll be doing is checking for the value

134
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,680
here and his name matchable here.

135
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,920
So that's what this is why I get sent.

136
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,860
Anyway thank you for watching this video and the next video we're going to be extracting the rest of

137
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,540
this information.

138
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,220
All right we're going to be turning into variables and we're going to be able to process that information.

139
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,710
Right.

140
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,410
So anyway thank you so much for watching.

141
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,220
I'll see you in the next one
