Hi welcome back on this lecture here I'm going to show you how to build a functionality that will take

2

00:00:07,680  -->  00:00:09,210
us to a different page.

3

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:09,650
All right.

4

00:00:09,650  -->  00:00:15,090
Where for example when we click on this number here we want to create a link here that when we click

5

00:00:15,090  -->  00:00:20,250
it is going to take us to a page where we're going to have all the comments related to this specific

6

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:23,780
post or any other specific polls right.

7

00:00:24,090  -->  00:00:26,610
So let's go ahead and build that right now.

8

00:00:26,790  -->  00:00:29,710
So the first thing is go to your view or post page.

9

00:00:29,720  -->  00:00:31,670
Let's create a link right here right.

10

00:00:31,890  -->  00:00:36,050
We'll put each ref close it down.

11

00:00:36,180  -->  00:00:38,340
Make sure that you close down your anchor tag.

12

00:00:38,750  -->  00:00:42,780
And if you come back here and refresh you can see that you have links now.

13

00:00:42,820  -->  00:00:43,560
Right.

14

00:00:43,650  -->  00:00:48,740
So now the next step is because we want to take a DE.

15

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:55,930
They use it to another page but on that page we want to pool pooled information from this specific pools

16

00:00:55,950  -->  00:00:58,160
rifle pool the comment.

17

00:00:58,260  -->  00:01:04,530
So we need a GET request to you know say hey listen this is the common idea right here.

18

00:01:04,710  -->  00:01:07,400
I want you to pool the comments related to this post.

19

00:01:07,410  -->  00:01:08,030
All right.

20

00:01:08,190  -->  00:01:09,880
So don't use me.

21

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:13,750
Some of you already understand what I'm trying to say here right.

22

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:18,960
So on the next page we're going to pool all the comments for any of these specific folks.

23

00:01:18,960  -->  00:01:19,530
All right.

24

00:01:19,530  -->  00:01:21,060
I think I just said it better like that.

25

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:21,520
Right.

26

00:01:21,660  -->  00:01:27,090
So what we need to do here is we need to create a loop in.

27

00:01:27,090  -->  00:01:27,640
Right.

28

00:01:27,660  -->  00:01:33,770
We need to loop through that table and pull out all the comments related to this post right here.

29

00:01:34,080  -->  00:01:34,320
Right.

30

00:01:34,320  -->  00:01:45,510
So we'll see in my ask you apply fetch a right and we'll fetch the results right here.

31

00:01:45,510  -->  00:01:53,130
And then what we need to do is we'll pulao that Id become an ID for that specific comment right.

32

00:01:53,160  -->  00:02:01,050
All right with a semicolon there make sure that you create another variable here so that way you can

33

00:02:01,050  -->  00:02:03,150
put it somewhere down there.

34

00:02:03,180  -->  00:02:10,160
So we're going to create a page called comment that BHB in a minute we're going to pass in a parameter

35

00:02:10,230  -->  00:02:15,250
like say ID for example and we'll put in this common ID there.

36

00:02:15,330  -->  00:02:19,800
So that way we have our requests so that we come here after we save it.

37

00:02:19,870  -->  00:02:22,000
We click on this and if we click.

38

00:02:22,020  -->  00:02:27,150
You see that it takes us to this page comment that BHB ID 7.

39

00:02:27,140  -->  00:02:27,980
All right.

40

00:02:28,200  -->  00:02:36,800
So so now we got to create this comment page.

41

00:02:36,810  -->  00:02:42,330
All right so we got to do a next lecture make sure that you got this on the control that you got this

42

00:02:42,480  -->  00:02:43,500
down pack too.

43

00:02:43,510  -->  00:02:43,910
Right.

44

00:02:43,920  -->  00:02:47,790
So anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
