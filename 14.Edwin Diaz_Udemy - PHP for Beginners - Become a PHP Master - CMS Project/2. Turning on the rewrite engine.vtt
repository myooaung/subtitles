00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.490
I Welcome back to the students.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:07.320
So let's start to make our application a lot better than what it is by friction this year or else.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.540
Well first of all I need to tell you that we are going to be using regular expressions if you don't

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.860
know regular expressions don't worry you don't need to understand it to apply in this couple of lectures.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.830
Now if you want to understand that which I recommend that you do because every developer out there needs

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.530
regular expressions I have a pretty good course that you can pick up right now just because you're taking

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.820
this course from me for a really low discount for 10 bucks.

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.800
And if you type in the discount coupon regift Dash 1 0 Dash 1 0.

9
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.720
So rejects hyphen 10 high and 10 you're going to get a discount.

10
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.920
When you're going to get it for 10 bucks.

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.980
OK just because you're taking this course.

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.340
So go ahead and save that coupon in a test file and then you can apply to that course is pretty good.

13
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.370
I's really easy to understand so for those of you that struggle struggling regular expressions before

14
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.730
I'm going to make it a breeze to understand it in that course.

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.690
But anyway.

16
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.770
So let's get to alecks.

17
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.330
First of all we need to make sure that we have mold rewrite on Apache OK.

18
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.990
So I'm using ma'am and Imanpa.

19
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.700
I believe we can find the configuration right here.

20
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.270
This guy right here so if I drop that in I'm going to drop it in my editor.

21
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.030
You can see that it's going to be a file like this.

22
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.340
OK.

23
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.240
So whatever you are using infusing them.

24
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.390
Make sure you find your configuration files for Apache and then you want to edit that well.

25
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.160
Some of you may already have it on.

26
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.270
You might want to check.

27
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:50.240
So I'm going to do what I control f command F here on my editor to find mode underscore rewrite actually

28
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.130
like this

29
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.560
for some reason I don't know why it's now finding a

30
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.490
he's now finding those modules.

31
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.980
That's not misspelling it.

32
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.870
Sorry about that.

33
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.390
And we go and read right in as you can see.

34
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.130
You're going to find one instance of it mode rewrite that as.

35
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.530
Oh OK.

36
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:32.550
Now if you have a high hash like this that means that this is a comment that I was not going to work

37
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.350
so make sure you take that off.

38
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.460
Save the file and go to your map application or you zap application and restart your services.

39
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.160
OK.

40
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.070
And when you start your services you should have more G-Ride on OK if you don't know the location of

41
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.780
this file H.T. TPD dot com which is a configuration for map for Apache I mean make sure you go with

42
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.050
it.

43
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.820
OK.

44
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.490
And just in case you don't know if your environment should be under the Apache folder whatever environment

45
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.470
you're using and for using Apache and this is only done in Apache by the way this is what we are doing

46
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.860
today on this on this section it's with Apache.

47
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.990
OK.

48
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.820
So anyway once it's on then we can start working on this.

49
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.640
So let's go and mine it was already on.

50
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.630
I was just showing you.

51
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.810
So the first thing that we need to do is right here in the root of the CMOS for that we are to create

52
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.150
another file.

53
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.280
And I believe I showed you this before and like one lecture I just gave you a quick example how to make

54
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.970
a pretty u r l but I'm going to show you how to do it 100 percent in this one.

55
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.270
So DA H.T. access to CS into Wes's and we save our file

56
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.090
OK.

57
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.680
We use this one.

58
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.110
And as you can see the file is right there.

59
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.540
OK.

60
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.690
Now all we have to do here which is super simple guys.

61
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.420
I don't don't think this is very hard.

62
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.120
It's just going to be a little complicated to understand if you don't know regular expressions but you

63
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.260
can still apply it.

64
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.520
So we're going to put a cap uppercase R and we're going to say well we're going to rewrite.

65
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.180
We want that rewrite engine and we've got the uppercase e right here.

66
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:25.950
You can see two words rewrite engine space on like this.

67
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.890
Simple as that.

68
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.900
And that's all.

69
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.620
OK.

70
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.040
Now in the next lecture we're going to start writing rules and these rules are going to be using regular

71
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:42.300
expressions and they are going to be trying to match whatever we're typing here and replacing that with

72
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.990
whatever we want you know in the next lecture we're going to start replacing tÃªtes or you or else you're

73
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.810
making it pretty.

74
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.350
OK.

75
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.030
Thank you so much.

76
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.170
I'll see you on the next lecture.
