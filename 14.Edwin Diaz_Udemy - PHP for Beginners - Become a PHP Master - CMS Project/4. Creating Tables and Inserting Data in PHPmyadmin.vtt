1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.260
The last video we created a database.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.330
Now this video we will create a table for this database.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.660
So on the logging app here on the left side this is the database that we created on the last one on

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.490
the last video.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.780
So let's go ahead and create click here and create a table for you.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.430
The table will be called users.

7
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.390
We're going to have three fields there three columns actually.

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:29.060
And we're going to go these three columns here are going to be named this one is going to be name ID.

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.890
This is going to be name user name.

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.190
This one will be named password for the ID column.

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.900
We will set it to integer that we would leave in the same set of for 11 characters long.

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.270
This way I hear auto increment we need to set it to autoincrement meaning that every time we create

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.710
a row on this column it will auto increment the number right here.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:02.050
This integer whatever integer that is should be ID number one the first row and in that primary.

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.620
All right.

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.910
Because it is the primary and that's where we can look up things a lot faster.

17
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.050
Now the user name make sure that is data type Barcott meaning characters

18
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.180
variable's characters meaning tÃªtes.

19
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.890
Right.

20
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.980
So 32 characters password and we make it of our car.

21
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.170
Tony to now this whole this all these data types have it's definition.

22
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.160
A definition in the web site so you can go and visit my admen or BHB that name will give you some information

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.680
about how these data types are if you want to find out more.

24
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.770
So now we are done here actually there is nothing else we got to do and just let's just click safe.

25
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.890
All right so now that we have the table right here we can insert some data into it.

26
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.030
So we click on it as a matter of fact we click here insert then we have this one is ignore because he's

27
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.860
already giving me an option to create more data into this table.

28
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.340
Right now I'm just going to leave it ignore just leave it checked.

29
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.740
Don't worry about it and let's create some data into this.

30
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.620
All right so I'm not going to put any good idea because it does it automatically for me.

31
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.870
Are you going to put a user name here.

32
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.840
Right.

33
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:23.310
And they use and then would be probably like my name and probably like Superman for a password and I'm

34
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.500
going to click go.

35
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.300
Right now we can go back and browse this.

36
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.490
You can check here and we can see that we indeed have some data into it.

37
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.020
We have the I.D. which we did not set.

38
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.660
He did it automatically without autoincrement and then we have the user name right here which it was

39
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.000
it was my name and the past was Superman.

40
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.830
All right.

41
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.410
So now we can go back here we can delete all these data if we wanted to we can just click here delete

42
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.590
this row right here.

43
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.440
All right we're not going to delete the table we are deleting the row.

44
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.690
Remember the number of rows right here.

45
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.160
So we are in the roll side if you want to delete the table.

46
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.580
Or do you need to go back to logging app and then you see that table right here.

47
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.700
Check here.

48
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.010
Select from here and drop it if you wanted to but I'm not going to do that since we need that table

49
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.470
and we need that data in there to do other things right.

50
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.650
So now we created a table we create a database first of all we create a table and we create some data

51
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.050
inside that table.

52
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.180
Now we are ready to do the next phase which is communicate with BHB.

53
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.980
All right so the next lecture we will discuss more about this.

54
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.360
Thank you
