00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:05,700
Bore right welcome back my students in this lecture right here I'm going to show you how to add the

2

00:00:05,700  -->  00:00:11,390
functionality of past encrypting and blogging and all that good stuff to our user page.

3

00:00:11,390  -->  00:00:11,810
All right.

4

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:17,520
Well maybe now they're logging in but the actual functionality of password hashing where I need a simple

5

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:18,450
system.

6

00:00:18,450  -->  00:00:19,620
So let's go ahead and do that.

7

00:00:19,620  -->  00:00:22,950
Some of you got lazy and didn't do it.

8

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:24,870
I'm now very proud of you right now.

9

00:00:24,870  -->  00:00:25,380
All right.

10

00:00:25,500  -->  00:00:30,010
So if you want to make me proud stop this video and go do it yourself.

11

00:00:30,090  -->  00:00:32,010
Don't watch me do it anyway.

12

00:00:32,030  -->  00:00:36,390
I'm just taking some of these comments out of here because I'm not using it.

13

00:00:36,490  -->  00:00:37,020
All right.

14

00:00:37,130  -->  00:00:41,580
And I've been playing around with a lot of you know you guys have a lot of files and they just come

15

00:00:41,580  -->  00:00:46,630
here and paste it and test it out to see if it works with mine and I leave a lot of stuff around some

16

00:00:46,630  -->  00:00:47,060
time.

17

00:00:47,060  -->  00:00:50,670
So you're going to see some different data sometimes.

18

00:00:50,700  -->  00:00:51,740
So that's what I do.

19

00:00:51,750  -->  00:00:53,590
I just deleted some stuff that was there.

20

00:00:53,730  -->  00:01:00,350
But anyway go to your registration page and all you have to do is space here.

21

00:01:00,690  -->  00:01:01,200
Right.

22

00:01:01,380  -->  00:01:10,380
And then we update this here and we have the is here and now I'm going to make my costs a little lower

23

00:01:10,440  -->  00:01:14,020
because I don't need this to be slowing psi.

24

00:01:14,190  -->  00:01:18,340
I don't need this to be checking to you know just to do it.

25

00:01:18,390  -->  00:01:24,270
So slowing side because we are in say Azmin come on if day the hacker gets inside our admin.

26

00:01:24,270  -->  00:01:25,500
That's crazy right.

27

00:01:25,520  -->  00:01:29,760
Our system is a super secure getting site.

28

00:01:30,360  -->  00:01:33,400
We need to you know we need to implement a new system right.

29

00:01:33,480  -->  00:01:36,120
So this doesn't matter much here.

30

00:01:36,120  -->  00:01:37,960
So we just kind of leave it like that safe.

31

00:01:37,980  -->  00:01:40,370
And now let's make a new user.

32

00:01:40,370  -->  00:01:42,000
Let's go and refresh.

33

00:01:42,210  -->  00:01:48,690
Let's call this user Pete William flower's name admen Let's make him an admin right away this guy gets

34

00:01:48,690  -->  00:01:50,930
promoted to our admin system.

35

00:01:51,120  -->  00:01:53,570
Let's call him Pat.

36

00:01:53,640  -->  00:01:54,710
You know what Petey.

37

00:01:54,870  -->  00:02:00,200
Just to make him not a pet and pet a G-mail Hajis.

38

00:02:00,440  -->  00:02:01,760
That's called empathy.

39

00:02:01,860  -->  00:02:03,990
And one two three four and five.

40

00:02:04,020  -->  00:02:06,390
As a user we have added a user.

41

00:02:06,390  -->  00:02:07,790
Let's go look at it.

42

00:02:07,800  -->  00:02:08,280
Pity.

43

00:02:08,290  -->  00:02:09,120
Pity pet.

44

00:02:09,120  -->  00:02:13,420
William is anatman can we look again with this guy.

45

00:02:13,490  -->  00:02:15,000
What was his password by the way.

46

00:02:15,000  -->  00:02:15,940
I don't remember.

47

00:02:16,260  -->  00:02:18,410
But anyway let's go to our users.

48

00:02:18,420  -->  00:02:19,790
Let's refresh.

49

00:02:19,830  -->  00:02:26,040
Now we see this new guy right here with a very simple password one two three four and he's already hashed

50

00:02:26,340  -->  00:02:28,230
and created.

51

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:29,230
Look at that beautiful.

52

00:02:29,370  -->  00:02:32,500
So let's go ahead and turn to a little game with this guy.

53

00:02:32,520  -->  00:02:41,320
Beatty's is using them and get a copy it because that's a complicated use any logo based 1 2 three and

54

00:02:41,340  -->  00:02:43,210
four somet.

55

00:02:43,500  -->  00:02:45,890
I think we gave him some of the password guys.

56

00:02:45,950  -->  00:02:48,050
Seriously.

57

00:02:48,600  -->  00:02:51,380
One two three four and five.

58

00:02:51,390  -->  00:02:51,930
Here we go.

59

00:02:51,930  -->  00:02:52,670
That's impossible.

60

00:02:52,670  -->  00:02:53,520
We gave it.

61

00:02:53,700  -->  00:02:56,240
And now team is logged in in our set.

62

00:02:56,280  -->  00:02:58,470
Simple system is ready to go.

63

00:02:58,470  -->  00:03:00,660
Hopefully you appreciate that very much.

64

00:03:00,870  -->  00:03:01,590
All right.

65

00:03:01,590  -->  00:03:05,460
So Tom stay up for your instructor and see you in the next lecture.

66

00:03:05,460  -->  00:03:06,600
Have fun guys.

67

00:03:06,660  -->  00:03:07,110
Take care
