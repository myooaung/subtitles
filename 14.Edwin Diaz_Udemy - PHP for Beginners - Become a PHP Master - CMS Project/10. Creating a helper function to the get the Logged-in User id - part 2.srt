1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,640
So how you guys did you guys did it right.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,640
And one of the reasons I let you do your things also is because I when I don't want you guys to be forgetting.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,810
OK.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,920
So let's go ahead and do this.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,450
I want to fetch.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,550
So I'm going to fetch a resoled which is going to be that probably that user's right.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:36,230
So users like that and I actually do my ask you a lie fetch re And I'm just going to get the Resul here.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:44,780
So that's going to be users or the user like that because we're not looping through this like we're

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,230
not you know we just won one resoled back.

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:01:01,220
OK so if we can use my obscure lie number those we pass in the result and we say if you find more than

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:15,330
one than or equal than one we want to return something what is it that we want to return exactly the

12
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,280
user ID.

13
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,550
Simple that.

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,520
So user id OK.

15
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,750
So let's test this and let's return false here

16
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,060
OK.

17
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,730
Make sure that we return falls.

18
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,600
Just in case this is natural.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,260
We don't get the user ID

20
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,680
right.

21
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,570
So how can we test this.

22
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:55,830
Well instead of testing the whole speech we can create another file here I'm going to create a BHP file.

23
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:04,490
I'm going to call this terse and I'm going to put this function right here.

24
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:11,270
But before we do that I need the header and the include for the database.

25
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,560
Actually I don't need a database but I don't think I do include that

26
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,200
right here.

27
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,500
And

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,500
that function is going to return either.

29
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,850
Actually my fax we can just echo this out

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,340
and call like that in.

31
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,310
Tests.

32
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,050
So I am already logged in.

33
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,110
I think let's see yeah.

34
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:02,750
So if I go to just up HP it says Can Starcastle in your head is already being send this because I got

35
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,100
spaces right here.

36
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,730
So make sure you've got no spaces.

37
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,210
We go and you can see that the logged in user is twenty six.

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:21,940
OK don't believe me we go to the 26 ID there.

39
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,250
OK.

40
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,920
That's the long user.

41
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,520
So as you can see we are getting that which is really awesome.

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,340
Now if we now know Dan

43
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:47,130
OK let's go back to or see a mess Ogowe and let's school again BHB.

44
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,530
We don't get nothing OK just because it's false.

45
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,950
OK.

46
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,520
So you can put some type of condition we're going to use later on.

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,840
So that's it we're done.

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,320
See you in the next lecture and where we are going to be detecting.

49
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,270
And you know changing a lot of the cool things in the link.

50
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,920
See you then.
