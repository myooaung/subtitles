1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,420
All right I think we have come very far on some of the things here and we will come back later on for

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,420
the comments when we make the comments section.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,330
But right now I want to see how things look right.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,180
We want to go ahead and let's first let's go to our polls and let's create one polls here and I'm going

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,210
to go online actually and I'm going to go to Loring Ibsen

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:33,150
and then I get some some information out of here some dummy tests.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,710
And the reason why I'm doing this because I want to show you.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,070
But you can easily Gricean dummy tests in your data Ed..

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,860
I'll show you in a minute but right now we're going to get in touch for this right here.

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,530
So right there.

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,260
All right.

12
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:59,910
So post title would be something like Bess Bess BHP course

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,420
ever.

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,290
Right.

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,650
And the category of course we need to display that information here so that way we can add it.

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,570
So that's one of the things that we need to add.

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,370
But right now we're just going to say category 40 or something like that.

18
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,500
We might get a narrow sense when we can display that on the PSI.

19
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,060
Let's just say it and D.S. post status draft is when you check something out before we go ahead and

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,800
continue to check how things look outside on the blocks section.

21
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,340
Right.

22
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:50,820
So that's what we're going to be doing PH BE AND BEST something like that plus polish.

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:58,350
Let's go to the site let's look at it and you can see here we do have some polls showing already we

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,340
have the title here which doesn't go anywhere.

25
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,740
We're going to make that go somewhere.

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,580
But that's going to be after we finish all this administration in the bag.

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,220
It's going to be adding some of these features.

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,560
All right.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,130
The most important thing is getting the crowd ready.

30
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,660
Create read of they indeed ready on the a mess once we get that ready then we start adding little features

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,470
like clicking on the titles going into that specific post showing the comments those nice graphs that

32
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,300
I show you in the beginning.

33
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,250
Like go into a profile when you click on certain things.

34
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,700
I mean those things are extra features and we're going to be adding them.

35
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,730
We need to also truncate this.

36
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,730
Make it smaller because we don't want to show all the content right here right.

37
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,550
I said in my file we can do that right now.

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,560
Let's go and do that.

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,410
As a matter of fact actually will do that in the next video right now.

40
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,330
I want to worry about something else right here.

41
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,300
So we see down the pole section right here on the ad post.

42
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,650
We have this category here.

43
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:10,530
Let's make this display the category title here so that we can submit it with it right.

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,560
We can't submit it.

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,960
We can see it here when we edit it.

46
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,590
That's fine we can see it but we need to add some functionality on the other side when we add it.

47
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,020
So let's go ahead and do that.

48
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,550
First of all what we need to do is copy basically what we got there right.

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,880
So I think we have it here on the edit and right here right.

50
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,860
We select the categories.

51
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,750
We have a selection right here.

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,400
Copy this whole thing even with a form group that would be nice right.

53
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,800
We can get all these functionality working there on the View or post page.

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,870
All right so we have that in categories that is not view.

55
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,480
We need to get it on the index.

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:57,030
Let's go to the index of the Web site and what we've got on the it's displaying all this information

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,540
here.

58
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,310
Hold on.

59
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:01,990
No.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,790
All we were doing is that truncate and we're not doing that.

61
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,130
All right.

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,270
We're not doing that.

63
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,890
We are fixing this go to admen.

64
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,160
We're facing this at polls so we need to go to the post page.

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,480
Sorry about that.

66
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:25,540
Let's go to that and we got that in and including admen folder in includes We got the post.

67
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,270
All right.

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,670
And we have it right here.

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,050
So we are going to be pasting that right there with a whole day.

70
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,840
You saw that and then at dawn do we have this this group already selected and we just pasted there.

71
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,330
All right.

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:56,150
So now right here is post category needs to go in there when we check it right here create post.

73
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,380
We need to find the right here somewhere.

74
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,450
Post category right here.

75
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,740
Take that out.

76
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,700
And that's all I'm going to take.

77
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,440
I'll leave it at the same.

78
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:06,980
All right.

79
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,160
So that field value is going to go in there let's make sure the value is fine.

80
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,220
We've got a cat ID here.

81
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,750
Do we have the kind of weeb displaying the categories here.

82
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,060
We are not displaying the categories so we've got to be careful with that.

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,100
So what value are we going to be sending to for this.

84
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,850
We don't have the category we need to to get that.

85
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,180
I mean she got tired actually we have it right here.

86
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,030
Sorry guys cut Title.

87
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,550
All right.

88
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,810
We're going to send it with that.

89
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,260
And we need to send that in the insert.

90
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:51,800
So in the end sir we need to change that category title values.

91
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,010
Let's get the polls come in count right here.

92
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,280
So actually that the whole thing is going in there that's perfect.

93
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,150
We were good.

94
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,630
We're good.

95
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,040
Actually we don't need to do anything.

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,610
All right.

97
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,530
So let's check it out.

98
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,040
Perfect is making you post.

99
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,870
How about that.

100
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:18,170
All right so example post number 1000 because no one was imposing it ready.

101
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:30,220
Let's do it in Java and let's say the name of the alter is James and Paul status is to draft a published

102
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,640
White Way drafted let's just make this published right here.

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,360
We have all those keywords right here.

104
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,240
Those image issues make another great image.

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,100
What about how black my name right there.

106
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,150
Nice.

107
00:06:45,990 --> 00:07:01,820
And false tags doing the ads and content some content from as windy as in big bold letters.

108
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,690
You don't have to write that.

109
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,150
By the way publish.

110
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,470
Let's look at it on the front refresh and we've got it right here.

111
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,250
See that perfit.

112
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,600
And let's see in the back to see we got the categories too.

113
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,370
Let's go back to the back of the website admin right here.

114
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,480
Let's check it out.

115
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:28,980
You post and we have the Java category let's going update that and change it to something else.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:41,560
Two procedural actually to assemble category change the image here and draft.

117
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,030
Remember the simple polls number one doesn't update.

118
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,160
Come back here and Zambo category right there.

119
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,990
We updated that and we update of the category.

120
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:03,320
Let's make one last pause and that said it zestful post 200.

121
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,180
Let's put opii object oriented programming.

122
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,330
Really cool subject.

123
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,390
We probably were going to be touching on that.

124
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,830
Maybe the next course that I make We're going to be doing something totally object oriented programming

125
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,680
which is cool.

126
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,340
All right.

127
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:26,560
So the polls there will be maybe a mate and pull status would be publish

128
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,470
right and

129
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,880
see who's strap.

130
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,730
I'm just I just don't have any more pictures guys.

131
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,410
All right so if you might get some more pictures but this is just placeholders right.

132
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:57,350
This is a P course with with with full strap.

133
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,750
All right.

134
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,950
Update.

135
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,400
All right.

136
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,560
Send it in and perfit.

137
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,440
Look at that.

138
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,540
Oh.

139
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,770
We are in.

140
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,320
We are worth a lot.

141
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,910
Right now my friend.

142
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,680
So if you were able if you are able to do this right now and you are working in a job related to web

143
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,850
development that should raise your salary.

144
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,980
If you're now working you should be able to find a job very easily in what about a mallees entry level.

145
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,650
If you've got this far and you know how to do this if you don't know how to do is do it a thousand times

146
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,540
until you get it right.

147
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,420
All right.

148
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,810
Be motivated because this is big time.

149
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,250
You're building I see a mess right now so keep that in mind.

150
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,870
We even got the day we got everything here right.

151
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,500
We're going to be continuing our lecture and the next video and hopefully you are feeling good about

152
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,000
yourself.

153
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,360
All right.

154
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,430
Thank you so much and see you in the next one.
