00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.710
All right so last time I tell you that we were going to be fixing this right now if I go to a regular

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.670
user that we have made after the pass when scription lecture we can say we can see that it does have

3
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.460
a different password.

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.630
He has an encrypted path we're showing right here because these are long characters Anyways we don't

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.420
see it there but I know that it is like that because I meet those users.

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.150
So I'm just going to show you right here in the Users table you can see that the password here the images

7
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.960
make the user actually I raised them.

8
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:53.310
So if I go ahead and go to the page right here every user any user for example Demel 2000 or 2000 G-mail

9
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.980
and register.

10
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.720
Right.

11
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.720
Then we go to admin.

12
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.060
Actually we got to go here refresh we can see that it does have a big password right.

13
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.360
Well if we go to users and check on the user there we gonna see that it does have that password showing

14
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.860
there.

15
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.010
We don't one this password here we want the password that's coming from the form but at the same time

16
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.410
we also want to encrypt it.

17
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.100
Right.

18
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.070
Because right now if I go and change this to 2:59 that passwords not being encrypted.

19
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.530
All right.

20
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.400
And we can see that here if I refresh.

21
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.870
All right.

22
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.520
So when we made that change about the password encryption we need to kind of update our system to you

23
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.060
know.

24
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210
So let's go ahead and do that.

25
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.180
Now we've got to go to add EDID user and that's going to be inside the Azman includes.

26
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.250
All right.

27
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.710
So here what we want to do is that we want to go ahead and use that.

28
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.520
All right.

29
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.140
Use encryption right here.

30
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.430
So we want to go in the inside the database.

31
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.130
We want to make a trip inside of data.

32
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.150
First pool pulao that this field right here if you want to go ahead and do the pulao these Rand column

33
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.240
or field or rec whatever you want to call it.

34
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.150
And once we pull it out then we need to use that function crypt.

35
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.220
All right.

36
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.850
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

37
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.240
I got it already done for us.

38
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.700
So I'm just going to go ahead and paste here right here.

39
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.360
All right.

40
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.520
I'm going to explain it right now.

41
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.110
All right.

42
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.010
So before I make this query to update the user I mean this page right here right before I make the query

43
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.620
to the database I make another query and on this query here what I'm doing is I'm going inside the users

44
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.320
and I'm pulling out all.

45
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.480
So mean for me I'm going to pull out some information.

46
00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.440
So once I check that everything go with a query I'm going to go to the database right now.

47
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.190
All right.

48
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.590
Right here.

49
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.970
So now this is going to go inside the database.

50
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.380
All right.

51
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.250
It's going to get the result back.

52
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.330
And I just going assign it to a row and then I'm going to take that sort out the value out in sight

53
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.220
into these variable salt.

54
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.710
All right.

55
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.890
Then I got to use the crypt function to grab the user password and the password right now is this one

56
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.590
here user password right.

57
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.960
So I put the password here because it takes two takes two parameters and then I put it together with

58
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.130
the salt.

59
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.850
All right.

60
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.190
Now one field here that I need to change is this field right here because this is going to be our new

61
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.470
encrypted password already.

62
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.280
So I'm just going to copy this and put it right here.

63
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:05.150
Paste it right now it don't get confused about this right here because what I usually do is I do a while

64
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.580
loop right.

65
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.700
I do a while loop and I have this inside the while loop like this.

66
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.900
And then I have all this in the middle here.

67
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.250
What I did was is that because we only have one resoled coming back I really don't need to loop through

68
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:29.990
the I really don't need to look through the table to get everything I just need one one result back.

69
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.570
All right.

70
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.400
So if you do the loop if you do the while loop it gets all of them.

71
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.690
I just need one.

72
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.550
He's got to take the first one he finds to this specific user.

73
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.340
The first one he finds on the table and of course we're going to be just looking for one only.

74
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.280
All right.

75
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.460
The first one.

76
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.450
So anyways so now that we do this we're good to go.

77
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.580
All right there's nothing else we got to do here.

78
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.590
As a matter of fact there is.

79
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.520
All right.

80
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.550
There is.

81
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.470
And that will be on the form right here.

82
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.200
We don't actually know.

83
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.940
That's fine.

84
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.570
You see now this is going to echo the user password the old one the one that's coming from the forum

85
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.720
right here.

86
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.800
All right.

87
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.430
That's the one that's going to be echoing down there.

88
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.300
So we're good to go.

89
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.690
Actually let's go ahead and try that now.

90
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.600
All right.

91
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:34.800
So let's go to users and I don't think we have any we are right but if we go ahead and do this day user.

92
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.340
All right.

93
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.430
That should encrypt the password but he's not doing it is because I'm missing something here.

94
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.060
Hash password and.

95
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.530
Yeah actually I'm not missing anything doing it but we're not see any here.

96
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.900
So let's go to the database right here.

97
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.630
All right.

98
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.570
So let's go ahead and refresh.

99
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.460
And now we can see it is actually encrypting it.

100
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.930
All right I lost myself there for a moment.

101
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.180
Times when you have a lot of code in front of you it could happen.

102
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.540
Right.

103
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.190
Especially when you call it all day.

104
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.630
Like I just did today.

105
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.890
Really tiring.

106
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.000
But anyway let's go ahead and make an user and see this in action.

107
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.840
All right.

108
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:30.120
Let's go ahead and create a new user right from here and let's just call this Demo 2000 automated actually

109
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:40.190
100 going to far right and G-mail and going back to G-mail password.

110
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.440
Actually let's make a really small will want to register.

111
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.750
Let's go back let's look at what we got.

112
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.940
We got this password right here at it and we can see that.

113
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.330
I want to turn into a big password.

114
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.820
Let's make it one two again.

115
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.690
UPDATE we can see that we only have that showing.

116
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.520
And when we go inside the database refresh we can see the big long PP-ASEL right here.

117
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:06.570
Right.

118
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.170
Actually yep yep that's it.

119
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.020
I thought it was Demo 2000.

120
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.430
I need my coffee guys.

121
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.090
But anyway we're done with this one here and on and that's when we're going to be working more on users

122
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.010
when we add a new user.

123
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:26.330
We want to go ahead and and maybe do some more notifications here.

124
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.390
But I think I think that we're good for now.

125
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.240
We might add another functionality here because if we are to use a unit like this it's going to add

126
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.060
the subscriber automatically even though they are a Add me for example.

127
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:49.680
I come here instead of the user I end if I come back to the user of your users come back here again

128
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.410
and I click again is going to go to subscribers.

129
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.980
All right we don't want that to happen so we are going to face down and Netflix
