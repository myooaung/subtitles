00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.530
All right.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.780
So we got this going actually on the last video here we were with two of they and do some things here

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.960
really cool right.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.660
So the next step is we need to display the categories here the titles dynamically.

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.800
All right we need to display it related to this post.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.740
So every category related to this post will be displayed right here right.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.820
And then later on we will be displaying the comments made to this specific post.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.160
All right now let's do the category titles first the comments will come after we have to build a commons

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.850
for us to comment functions and all that first before we do.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.510
We feel we put it right here so let's go ahead to the code and let's build that category information

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.900
right here.

12
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540
And for that we need to do another query.

13
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.320
We need to find out all of the categories again and I feel like making a function about finding categories

14
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.870
because we've already been doing it so much right.

15
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.750
So we are in the edit edit on the score ph post-up ph right.

16
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.260
And we need to find the categories that we're not finding any categories here.

17
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.270
We don't have any Kohary that would help us out right here.

18
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.390
So we need to actually go to the categories and find some information about that.

19
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.170
Actually I think we are.

20
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.480
And we need to go to update cat on the score categories.

21
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.530
You know what.

22
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.420
Right here.

23
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.010
There we go.

24
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.630
That's that's what we want.

25
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.670
Let's get over this.

26
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.310
All right.

27
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.690
And let's take it over there.

28
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.350
Let's take it to the editor on the score post and where we want to put that actually.

29
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.100
I'm sorry we don't need to go to the exit polls.

30
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.820
We are.

31
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.120
We have a form there we need to go and we'll fix all this or this later on when we are in security.

32
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.080
We need to go to the security area to fix all that section.

33
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.210
We're going to be making some tutorials on security later.

34
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.820
But anyways let's go to the view of polls actually this is where we want the query for the categories.

35
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.660
So we are displaying categories right here.

36
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.690
And if I put some data here like for example like this I'm going to put this here this brackets here.

37
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.500
So I'm going to do this.

38
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.020
And let's go here and check it out.

39
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.380
You will post then we have undefined variable connection there we need to fix all that stuff.

40
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.880
But right now let's go and check this out.

41
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.610
You see that D.

42
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.960
All right.

43
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:47.100
So let's go ahead and make that Querrey they're perfect.

44
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.500
So separate this right now.

45
00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:02.670
That's why we need to do and let's make the list right up here right here and close it.

46
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.900
We need to actually we don't we don't actually need to do that since we are in ph already.

47
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.660
I was going to separate it but we don't have to we can just put the query right here.

48
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.860
I'm going to piece that query that we got from the page and we're going to say select all from categories

49
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:28.400
where category ID and this time the category ID needs to be equal to something else to the post ID.

50
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.700
That's what we need right here actually.

51
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.690
Now this one this one here sorry post category ID.

52
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.020
There we go.

53
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.890
There we go.

54
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.640
And that's the field I'm sure you feel right now.

55
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:53.040
If you go to the admin I think somewhere here we go this post categories right here and that's what

56
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.770
we're going to be using to relate the other table with this table.

57
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.420
All right.

58
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.900
It's called relational tables.

59
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.640
Go to the polls right now.

60
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.270
All right.

61
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.520
So let's let's check this out.

62
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.260
So we got a Querrey right here and we're going to display everything that has to do with that.

63
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.530
We're going to get the I.D. and we're going to get the title The cat title and then we're going to echo

64
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.150
it.

65
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.250
And we already have that don't we.

66
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.130
No but we need to call this thing.

67
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.700
This guy right here all right.

68
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.800
That's what we need to be going.

69
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.530
Let's put a bracket on there.

70
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.720
All right so I think that should work.

71
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.980
Now just the way it is.

72
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:46.370
Make sure you close your this out and check it out.

73
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.010
Let's check it out.

74
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.500
Let's check it out.

75
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.610
There we go.

76
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.960
Category Java.

77
00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:00.890
Let's change a category and see if that works let's change it to procedural BHB Shinsho picture here.

78
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:10.180
And Java plus Java right.

79
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.960
I'm just changing some of the things here so that way we look at it we'll look at it and different published

80
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.360
and I don't know Ron.

81
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.350
Whoops sorry.

82
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.210
Update.

83
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.130
Let's look at it.

84
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.490
You post procedural H-P So it is working here.

85
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.370
Perfect.

86
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.990
So we got that going we're going to cut that tutorial right here and I'll see you in the next lecture

87
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.640
I think we're doing a pretty good job with this.

88
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.950
All right.

89
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.470
What do you think anyway.

90
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.780
I'll see you in the next one.

91
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.260
All right.

92
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.220
Take care.
