00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.870
Pi the students will come back on this section here.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:12.360
I'm going to help you design a better nailgun system a simpler logging system a system that we can use

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.350
very easily and very secure.

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.260
A couple years ago I introduced it to something called the crypt function.

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.970
All right.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.110
And you know some of you are having issues since it's a little complicated to use.

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.350
So sometimes it doesn't work the way we want to because we don't understand it.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.560
But this section here I'm going to give you I want to show you how to do it in an easier way.

9
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.200
And if you hear me it'll be out of breath just because my spaghetti were actually burning.

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.110
Yeah I'm cooking so my spaghetti is downstairs and they were burning.

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.900
Yeah that's what happens if you see me out of breath.

12
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.130
If you hear me out of breath.

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.490
Well anyway.

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.880
Let me show you in the peach bit on that Web site where I'm talking about this patchwork bass We're

15
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.230
hashing right.

16
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.320
Basically this is a function he's going to take three parameters.

17
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.910
He's going to take the password the original password that we're going to pass in.

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.970
He's also going to take the algorithm all right and it's going to take some options.

19
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.280
All right.

20
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.390
So this is just a brief summary what it is.

21
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.310
So this is the first algorithm.

22
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.730
All right.

23
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.430
And this is the default algorithm is called Password underscore default.

24
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.660
You can read all about it.

25
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.380
All right.

26
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.310
In this web site here then we've got the options and you begin to see how we can pass options to these

27
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.180
functions.

28
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.470
I'm not going to go into a lot of details about it because all information is right here in the PSP

29
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.260
on their website just going to show you how to use it.

30
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.970
How do implementing your CMOS.

31
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.250
So let's get right to it.

32
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.900
All right.

33
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.820
So first let me just show you how it works really cool really quickly.

34
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.350
All right.

35
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.300
So I'm just going to create a page right here my CIMS and just kind of call it test that BHB.

36
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.060
All right you need to understand a little bit of it just to make it work.

37
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.700
Good.

38
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.520
All right.

39
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:11.040
So for example let's say let's just echo here you use the function right away and call it pass word

40
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.330
cache.

41
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.850
All right this is the function.

42
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.240
All right.

43
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.140
You need to have ph be firing over to make it work OK.

44
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.330
And doesn't have a dollar sign.

45
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.320
Sorry about that.

46
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.860
All right so if you want to check if you have BHB firing over all you have to do is put the HP in for

47
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.770
here.

48
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.900
All right just like I show you in the beginning and then you can go to your CMOS and them just go right

49
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.460
here.

50
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.210
All right.

51
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.480
And then to test to whatever page you made my case I just made this page test and you can see that I'm

52
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.250
in BHB 5 and over.

53
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.670
All right.

54
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.500
We're now working under BHB 5.

55
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.600
So make sure that you updated.

56
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.080
All right.

57
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.420
So let's just use a function real quick and show you how it works.

58
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.940
So let's say for example I have this password that I pass and this is the first parameter which is going

59
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.680
to be the password.

60
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.170
All right.

61
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.260
And the second parameter is going to be the algorithm.

62
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:25.950
In this case I'm just going to use the algorithm default the full array I think I'm spelling it correctly

63
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.450
and it's basically a constant.

64
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:37.590
If you see it right here you see and then we can pass in an array of options an array and this array

65
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.150
could be a set to be an associate of array and it could be the salt.

66
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.750
And for those of you that don't remember the old it's just a string of characters a lot of characters

67
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.040
around 22 characters but we don't have to this will produce a hash.

68
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.050
I strained character by itself or right by default.

69
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.540
And you know that's the way we want it we don't want to be producing our own salt if we don't have to

70
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.320
right.

71
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.340
So we could say that parameter that I want in passing is the cause.

72
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.470
And I'm going to explain how that works.

73
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:20.130
So the cost basically is the amount of time it takes this function to give you a new Hash basically

74
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.860
it's just going to make your server delay more the password hashing.

75
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.900
All right so the bigger This number is the slower dysfunction were work.

76
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.600
All right and that makes it very good because imagine that you have the software and the software is

77
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.630
scanning is inputting in your application thousands of passwords every second every two seconds.

78
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.570
If this is really low it's just going to take that software maybe two or three years instead of one

79
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.990
week.

80
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.820
If you make it lower if you make it this is going to be too fast.

81
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.480
Now you don't want to make it too large because then your server will be processing too much.

82
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.320
All right so let's make it 10 right now.

83
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.270
Let's just see how that looks right now.

84
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.540
Let's go to our test page answer if I refresh.

85
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.790
You can see how fast that changes right.

86
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.150
You see so here we have some parameters and you can look a bit on their Web site and you can see that

87
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.080
each of this is a friend who has a different name.

88
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.790
All right so we have the password.

89
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.720
The hash is sold.

90
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.030
The cost.

91
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.650
This is the cost is number 10 right here.

92
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.570
All right.

93
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.510
They have they have a lot of information in it that you can you know read a body again I'm going to

94
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.940
go into detail about it right now.

95
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:53.640
So if I make that cost bigger let's say make it 14 save enter refresh.

96
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.820
I mean you could see that he changed to 14 that was a cost right there.

97
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.610
And you saw how long it takes refresh again.

98
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.380
You see that he takes a lot longer.

99
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.930
All right.

100
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.680
This just going to make your this take longer to process.

101
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.690
All right we're going to keep it around 12:00.

102
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.150
That's what we want.

103
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.750
All right.

104
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.710
So I just want to show you how that works.

105
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.560
We're going to be using the algorithm called the crypt array.

106
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:30.980
And let's go back here and you can do control tools to find it correct.

107
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.440
I believe that.

108
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.680
Right there.

109
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.470
All right.

110
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.910
You see that.

111
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.870
So basically the crypt is just going to use the Blowfish algorithm which is why we were using before

112
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.130
that to why dollar sign whatever.

113
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.000
Right here with an identifier.

114
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.550
That's what we're going to be using for now one.

115
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.960
All right.

116
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.020
Basically is a really strong algorithm.

117
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.690
So that's what we're going to be using.

118
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.120
So now that I show you how this works let's go ahead and apply real quick.

119
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.030
All right and we're going to start it right here in the registration that BHP page used to give you

120
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.720
an example.

121
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.510
All right we're using a lot of stuff here that we don't need.

122
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.210
Right.

123
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.830
Because we are we we don't need to see this sold in the database anymore in the table.

124
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:29.310
So let's go to our HP admin right and delete this salt because we're not going to need it anymore guys

125
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.350
or less you just want to learn.

126
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.240
Watch what I'm doing.

127
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.500
If you've got it working already if you've got your Logan working don't worry about it.

128
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.760
You can leave it that way it is.

129
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.340
Put it if you want to learn it easier way and a better way.

130
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.250
Keep watching and do what I do.

131
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.800
So let's go to the CMAs users.

132
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:54.420
And here you can see that we have the user password where we are saving their Rand salt right here.

133
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.280
All right we're not going to be doing that anymore.

134
00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.950
We're going to be actually putting everything right here use a password straight there.

135
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.670
All right.

136
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:10.470
So this is the way we're going to be starting it password.

137
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.200
All right.

138
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.470
And we're going to sign one.

139
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.640
Let's go back here and let's just take all this.

140
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.920
Put it right there.

141
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.000
And you're going to put it right here.

142
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.540
There we go.

143
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.150
Right.

144
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.730
You don't have to put it in court if you don't want to.

145
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.700
Beautiful.

146
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.980
So now when we register a user that's going to go and take it in there.

147
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:47.370
Now let's go ahead and we don't mean this and we don't need this either.

148
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.370
All right.

149
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.910
Perfect.

150
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.540
So now let's go ahead and try this and see what we get.

151
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.380
Let's go to or see a.

152
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.500
Right.

153
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:11.300
Let's go to the registration page and let's just put a name new user on the square usery.

154
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.060
And I just kind of put my e-mail address.

155
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:22.510
Not afraid to give it because you know what guys do in school of code.

156
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:31.680
Come Edwin's school of course that come and password secret register registration has been submitted.

157
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.280
Go and check it out.

158
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.520
Users.

159
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:42.750
Now you can see that the new user has a new password encrypted already.

160
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.420
All right so now this is saved in the database.

161
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.400
In the next lecture I'm going to show you how to verify this password here.

162
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.820
All right.

163
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.610
And in log in a user right.

164
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.250
Perfect.

165
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.780
So we get to all day our system with this new password system which is going to be easier for you guys

166
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.860
to make it work.

167
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.200
It's going to be a lot more secure than anything you have ever done because you can change the cost

168
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.210
here as big as you want.

169
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:12.680
Right.
