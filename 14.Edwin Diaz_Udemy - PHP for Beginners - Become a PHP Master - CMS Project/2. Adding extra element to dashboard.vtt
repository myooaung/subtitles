00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:02.700
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:02.700  -->  00:00:04.350
I hope you're having a great day.

3

00:00:04.350  -->  00:00:05.850
I'm having an awesome day.

4

00:00:05.970  -->  00:00:08.010
Is a new day a good to breathe.

5

00:00:08.040  -->  00:00:09.210
I get to touch my hands.

6

00:00:09.210  -->  00:00:10.170
I have two hands.

7

00:00:10.170  -->  00:00:12.990
I got two legs and I'm healthy.

8

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:13.570
All right.

9

00:00:13.740  -->  00:00:19.440
I don't know what your situation is but if you are watching this in a computer you are very lucky.

10

00:00:19.440  -->  00:00:25.530
A lot of people cannot do that so thank God or thank the universe whoever you think is responsible for

11

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:27.360
that and just be grateful.

12

00:00:27.360  -->  00:00:27.790
All right.

13

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:33.780
But anyway today we are going to be adding on a little extra functionality to the dashboard right.

14

00:00:34.260  -->  00:00:37.440
So let's logon to our CMOS.

15

00:00:37.450  -->  00:00:38.660
All right.

16

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:46.380
And what I want to do is I want to add to all the posts right here and they actually polls the polls

17

00:00:46.380  -->  00:00:49.520
that are published in the draft so I'm going to change just a little bit.

18

00:00:49.530  -->  00:00:50.080
Right.

19

00:00:50.160  -->  00:00:54.540
So we're going to go to the index for admin there right now.

20

00:00:54.540  -->  00:00:58.830
As a matter of fact ad for Shlash in that stopped BHB.

21

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:02.020
So right now we have a query right here for draft's.

22

00:01:02.100  -->  00:01:05.490
Let's make another query here for published.

23

00:01:05.500  -->  00:01:05.970
All right.

24

00:01:06.030  -->  00:01:11.300
Because we already have the query for all posts and I will be all the way above.

25

00:01:11.360  -->  00:01:15.960
Are going to show you right now in a minute but let's just change this to publish

26

00:01:18.510  -->  00:01:20.100
right here.

27

00:01:20.110  -->  00:01:21.140
All right.

28

00:01:21.870  -->  00:01:27.190
And I'm just going to change these words here and I'm just going to have the same.

29

00:01:27.270  -->  00:01:29.780
I was going to copy and paste this one here.

30

00:01:29.910  -->  00:01:31.960
Polls Paul.

31

00:01:32.250  -->  00:01:33.420
There we go.

32

00:01:34.110  -->  00:01:39.440
And that's the same dance Dansco change the draft here also.

33

00:01:39.710  -->  00:01:40.240
All right.

34

00:01:40.620  -->  00:01:41.390
So that's about it.

35

00:01:41.410  -->  00:01:43.000
That's what I need for this.

36

00:01:43.080  -->  00:01:47.580
So now I'm going to come down here and I'm going to change this a little bit.

37

00:01:47.580  -->  00:01:53.410
So I'm going to I'm just going to add something here as a matter of fact.

38

00:01:53.450  -->  00:01:53.850
Come on.

39

00:01:53.850  -->  00:01:56.400
They're going to add polls.

40

00:01:56.400  -->  00:02:00.810
I'm just going to say all polls right there.

41

00:02:00.910  -->  00:02:08.490
I'm going to add one more to our loop because we're going to add another element and I need to get it

42

00:02:08.490  -->  00:02:13.370
right here in the second array and then just doing this.

43

00:02:13.370  -->  00:02:15.330
I wish I could see what I'm doing.

44

00:02:15.810  -->  00:02:20.300
So we have the post count starting the day right here.

45

00:02:20.490  -->  00:02:23.850
That's going to have all the polls right here right.

46

00:02:24.030  -->  00:02:31.350
So the new one that actually is polls publish count.

47

00:02:31.350  -->  00:02:31.710
All right.

48

00:02:31.710  -->  00:02:36.680
And that would be the second polls right here.

49

00:02:36.700  -->  00:02:38.670
So call here.

50

00:02:38.790  -->  00:02:45.360
The second element and that that should do it.

51

00:02:45.690  -->  00:02:47.000
Let's go ahead and check it out.

52

00:02:47.000  -->  00:02:48.030
All right.

53

00:02:48.630  -->  00:02:49.020
All right.

54

00:02:49.020  -->  00:02:50.690
So refresh.

55

00:02:51.510  -->  00:02:56.410
All right so we see that we have all polls one Active Force One.

56

00:02:56.430  -->  00:02:57.010
All right.

57

00:02:57.270  -->  00:03:03.570
So if I add another polls and we're going to go ahead and do that right now I'm just going to say just

58

00:03:03.630  -->  00:03:14.130
another polls and just going to put straw there and polls alter of course is me Boss status publish

Angeles hello.

61

00:03:25.590  -->  00:03:31.530
It's going to be a key were I know that doesn't sound right but just some content

62

00:03:35.600  -->  00:03:37.840
content.

63

00:03:37.860  -->  00:03:38.380
All right.

64

00:03:38.580  -->  00:03:40.270
Let's go to polls.

65

00:03:40.320  -->  00:03:41.360
We see we are another one.

And you can see there we got one active posts and one draft.

75

00:04:09.230  -->  00:04:09.590
All right.

76

00:04:09.600  -->  00:04:15.880
And if I make both of them draft and let's see what that does right.

77

00:04:16.350  -->  00:04:18.140
The polls ask for.
