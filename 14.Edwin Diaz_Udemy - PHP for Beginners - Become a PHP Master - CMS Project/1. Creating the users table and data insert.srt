1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,410
Oh right perfect we have done a lot of things in this year so far but we still have a lot more to go.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,080
All right.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,520
So don't get frustrated or don't get.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,290
You know get excited get very excited because you're learning a lot.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,480
All right so we're going to keep going don't give up.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,150
And so we started from the top post.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,430
Got to go comments.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,090
The next thing is users.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,390
Before we do anything in the user space because we don't have any right now if I click on it you'll

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,500
see that we have we have a pound sign right.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,890
So let's go ahead and go to localhost.

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,360
All right localhost

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,700
right.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,120
And then we're going to go to the actually local hoes be H-P we need to go to BHB my admin.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:01:01,530
So get there and let's fill up page well not page that table we can build a page yet because we need

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,650
a table right.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,180
So let's go see a mass.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,870
And I'm just going to say new table here and I actually should have just click on see a mess and they

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,220
I can pull many columns I won here.

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,870
Well let's call these table users and let's give it.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:26,440
Geez that's given nine places because we are going to be adding a lot of things for the users.

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,540
So the first thing that we need to add is a user ID.

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:38,340
We know how to do that into your list to set it to three characters in that primary and auto increment

24
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,420
Nanse is username.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,180
OK.

26
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,380
Password.

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,960
First name first name right.

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,770
Almost forgot to spell that for a minute there.

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,410
At this hour we should say just roll I guess.

30
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,020
And later on we're going to I'm just going to do it right now.

31
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:19,050
Rant solt laid on probably when we add new features we might use uses role here to do the same password

32
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,390
encryption but not right now.

33
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,900
All right.

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,860
That's extra.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,960
So we want to actually have this last.

36
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,980
It's not that important.

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,650
Right.

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,880
And this is not that important.

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,810
Well it is.

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:41,550
But last name e-mail and what else.

41
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,410
User image.

42
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,090
Right.

43
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,770
And we should just say user everything right.

44
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,080
Use your last name.

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,220
Why not.

46
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,940
Is easier.

47
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:04,190
Now we know user password that when we know the evidence it just says user and username.

48
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,390
All right.

49
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,030
And we should just leave this one like this.

50
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:09,910
OK.

51
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,570
I think it is very descriptive.

52
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:18,560
The only thing that doesn't have anything in front of it is just this one here.

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,650
It doesn't have the underscore but everything else it does.

54
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,310
Right.

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,500
And user user role.

56
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,760
All right so here is going to be of our car.

57
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,600
It's going to be tets remember that 2:55.

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,790
You don't have to put two find one of them.

59
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,740
They're not going to be 255 characters.

60
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,270
But I like to do that and I'm just going to touch on that one.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,640
Our car a roll to 55.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:04,250
And this one of our cars to 55 right now only one integer only integers this one right here.

63
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,100
Perfect.

64
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,350
So let's go ahead and click safe and we are done.

65
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,360
All right so now let's go ahead and show some data right away since we are here right.

66
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,400
User name is going to call this guy Rico password.

67
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,110
One two three.

68
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,790
First name.

69
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,670
What can we call this guy.

70
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,730
Rico first name right there.

71
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,820
Last name Swaby.

72
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,890
And then e-mail Ricos Soie the G.M. that come.

73
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:37,950
Hope you like the last name and some image we don't have any image right now roll would be Stryver

74
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:48,360
or admin make maker admin because you know it's just admin right now and then here we're not to worry

75
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,260
about that right now.

76
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,780
And they just click go.

77
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,650
Let me just make sure everything is perfect.

78
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,320
Well not perfect but good to go.

79
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,100
All right.

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,410
So we have added that users stable and we have added inserting some content into it.

81
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,380
So the next video we're going to continue on.

82
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,810
All right.

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,200
Thank you so much for watching and see your next lecture
