1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,840
Read before I start this lecture here you remember when we cancel when we come into Post.com and count

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:15,020
and we also took it out from here from the values make sure that you also take it out from here.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
All right.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,670
Because then we are inserting something that is not there and you're going to get an error just like

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,200
this I'm going to show you right now like that.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,190
All right I try inserting a comment too at polls and you're going to get that error if you don't remove

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:29,910
that.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:39,060
So make sure that you remove common count from the insert here and from the values here and from here

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,590
let's just remove that also there.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,590
All right so that way you don't get this error here.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,490
All right let's try to do that again.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,470
Try adding a post.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,950
All right.

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,280
And make sure that it works.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,110
I haven't tested it right now and I'm going to do it live.

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,850
All right.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:04,350
And it's going to put anything there and Javascript and some content.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:04,890
All right.

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,670
Post that we went through.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,350
OK.

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,750
So it works.

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
Make sure you remove that right.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,840
So now anyways now that we can start the lecture what I really want to do is I want to be able to see

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
the polls depending on the status in the home page.

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,170
So if I go to the home page right here I can see the polls you see on draft of right still can't see

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,660
it.

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,530
So I don't want to display things there.

28
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,790
There our own draft.

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,110
All right so let's go ahead and get that feature now.

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,810
And we want to do is one to go to end it.

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,390
Actually

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,470
we've got to come back here any way too because we know we want to also make sure that nothing gets

33
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,910
done here.

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,610
This played all night in the insert.

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,080
But in the post section.

36
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,740
But anyway let's go to the inn that's on the root of those or the site right here in the case of BHP

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,190
and here when he says select from polls.

38
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:22,420
I want to say select from polls where status right is up for starters I believe is equal to what published.

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,280
All right.

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,330
So if we go to our let's go to our local polls BHP my admin.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,710
Check out our column real quick.

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,520
See a mass post structure poll status.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,120
All right.

44
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,780
So we go to this home site right now.

45
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,840
We don't see anything.

46
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,530
The post is not there anymore because we are filtering.

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,250
All right.

48
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,780
So what we need to do is have a back up there like if we can find this if it's not in status.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,970
I want you to display something right.

50
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,830
I want you to display no polls here or something like that.

51
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,310
Right.

52
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,690
So let's think about how we can make that happen.

53
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,580
So right now we are picking up everything there.

54
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,300
And we're just displaying whatever's on Polish right we're not selling anything else.

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,230
But how can we test this.

56
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,630
You know if we don't have that information so why not just display everything from post and then when

57
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:25,470
we get this information down here and let's bring it down let's bring it out of the database.

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,440
And they say I don't mind if I let's just put it all the way in the end here so that we can look at

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,310
it better once we get it here for status

60
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,720
and for status right there.

61
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,920
Once we get this information here why don't we do a test and then display everything down there right.

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,500
And depending on that.

63
00:03:49,770 --> 00:04:00,000
So we could say something like this once we are in the and this statement here and say if false status

64
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:12,400
is equal to or equal to may be published then I want you to go ahead and do the rest.

65
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,520
Right.

66
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,720
Or if it's

67
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:26,800
not equal to publish then do this echo something like maybe I don't know go

68
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,000
no post here sorry.

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,850
All right.

70
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,630
Like this and then else.

71
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,910
You know you do something else right.

72
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,250
So as we do the rest.

73
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,980
So we've got to put this else somewhere.

74
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,160
Let's go ahead and do that right now.

75
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,390
Let's do it right here.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,670
Well this is we are inside the loop so whatever is just same thing basically here one belongs to the

77
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,430
if statement else.

78
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,710
So we've got esteeming right here.

79
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,210
And then the L's and then the loop here.

80
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,200
All right let's check that out and see how that works out.

81
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,650
There we go.

82
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,890
See no polls.

83
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,880
So now you can format this however you want.

84
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,250
You can Center it.

85
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,520
And as a matter of fact let's do it right now real quick.

86
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:49,410
It is really easy to do it when you have to use a class here like that center with his framework you

87
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,340
can use this class.

88
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,720
I think he will do it automatically for us.

89
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,950
There we go.

90
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,290
All right.

91
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,830
No polls.

92
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,210
Sorry.

93
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,800
So we can do that.

94
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,940
Or I just I just want to show you a good technique there.

95
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:08,730
So now let's go to AD may actually go to admin and let's change the status of this and it's changed

96
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,010
to published.

97
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,170
Now we of course want to make this dynamic there and bring it in from the from the database.

98
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,850
That way we don't have to be typing it all the time.

99
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,100
It's annoying right.

100
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,100
Let's go to the home site.

101
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,160
All the published polls started should be published now.

102
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:39,470
All right so the problem here is if is not equal to published then do it else display it.

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,430
All right.

104
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,910
So of course we don't fly we don't have the image here.

105
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,160
Let's get the image going there.

106
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,670
All right.

107
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:58,020
We we still have to do a couple of things to to see a mess and that will be probably in India.

108
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,820
There you go.

109
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,590
That would be an extra features OK.

110
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:07,290
So right now we're just concerned about building to see a mass later on Wistar you know making it better

111
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,400
fixing anything that's wrong with them.

112
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,330
Because when you're writing applications online before you deploy it you need to make sure that everything

113
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,780
is fixed that all the books are out of it and everything's working perfectly basically you know.

114
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,580
And then even though after you publish your content you see a mess out there on the Web you're still

115
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,370
going to find some errors and you still have to go back and fix it.

116
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,890
So this is an ongoing process of getting to you're him as better and better every single day.

117
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,400
All right.

118
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,590
And just you know extending it so hopefully you are enjoying the class and I'll see you in the next

119
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,120
lecture.

120
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,570
Take care
