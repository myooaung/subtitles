00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.360
All right so we got a lot of functionality in this page in the categories that BHB we can bring in some

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.830
data we can Asam data that we can even well see some of the data here but we need to do lot more work

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.550
done.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.920
We can update some of these data here if we make the code for it.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.530
So we're going to be doing that now.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.960
It's made the code so that when we click here we can come here and update the field.

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.020
Right now it's not going to be doing anything well is going to be adding because it's going to be doing

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.590
the sent in this is doing.

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.340
But remember that we copy and paste it from here to here so we've got to send folks an idea right here

10
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.910
so let's go ahead and change that and make it update instead of adding stuff.

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.180
All right.

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:55.110
So what we want to do is right here below let's write another page tag and we are going to be actually

13
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.450
we can copy some of this stuff from here.

14
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.840
I know it's going to be very similar even though we're going to have to modify some things.

15
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.850
And when you are modifying sometimes you might miss one or two things.

16
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.440
All right.

17
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.730
So keep that in mind this closes so we don't forget this is not going to be a get.

18
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:21.710
This is going to be a post since when we submit to the the form we want to get a value from this.

19
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.900
And that's right here.

20
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.140
So the cat tied.

21
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.030
All right.

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.200
Make sure that you change this put right here also that ways different of day.

23
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:41.010
Let's just call the update of the category and let's just copy it because we're going to be detecting

24
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.480
this right here.

25
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.720
Perfect.

26
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.120
They just make a little common you say of the Querrey.

27
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.810
All right put it right there and put as many as you like does fine.

28
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.260
So we're going to update the category we're going to update is this get request to post and we're going

29
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.600
to take this out here and make sure that we are two in the title.

30
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:22.380
Take the lead out of there and let's also make sure is that title that we are getting from feel on top.

31
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.980
And we're going to change things from Delete to update categories

32
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.880
and then set.

33
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.310
Right.

34
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.600
Make sure is one spacier said Cat title which is in the database.

35
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.570
That's a column there in the table to ecord to discuss title right here.

36
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.460
That's what we're getting from the forum member that we're going to do some quotes actually.

37
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.650
Let's put this there.

38
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.290
And where ID equals what.

39
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.200
Well we don't have this.

40
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.040
We're not catching anything yet but we should be catching something right now because we should be doing.

41
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.510
But I'll get to that later.

42
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.390
Right now let's just change a couple of things and I'll get to this idea later.

43
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.820
Let's just say this update query.

44
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.210
All right.

45
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.430
So what I really want to do with this form is I want to make it so it comes from another page that way

46
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.060
we don't see anything that's here.

47
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.010
We don't see anything here when we click on this.

48
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.640
We include it from another placing our CMOS and then we can do some updating there.

49
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.420
That's that's still the goal that I want to accomplish here.

50
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.020
So let's just make sure that record is good here.

51
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:51.730
Cat tied all equals to this were cat ID equal to what cat ID.

52
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.320
Let's just make sure that this is just you name it cat ID.

53
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.600
All right.

54
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.060
So how do we get all these formats here.

55
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.670
As a matter of fact let's just check.

56
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.160
Let's do a quick checking for this of the query to see if it's good.

57
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.520
That way we'll make a mistake.

58
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.160
We know where it is coming from on the query.

59
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.020
It's always good to do that.

60
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.650
We and I echo.

61
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:26.250
We're just going to die everything and course failed.

62
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.020
I think I already have that somewhere.

63
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.630
Let's see.

64
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.790
I should be having that all over the place but we're going to make a function there where you failed

65
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.140
later on.

66
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.550
All right.

67
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.410
Function later on my ask you will.

68
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:53.430
I am error and misspells in the connection.

69
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.360
Perfect.

70
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.000
All right.

71
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.440
I think we're good here.

72
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:07.700
So let's go ahead and you know what let's get all these for Maadi here.

73
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.620
I want to get this for Marty here.

74
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.080
Let's just comment Etsy or control it.

75
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.160
Whatever you want to call it and let's create a it.

76
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.600
I already have edit here but

77
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.090
I'm going to the lead.

78
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.160
So just to show you.

79
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.030
But right they don't you don't have to delete anything I just had that from something that I was doing

80
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:39.240
before just right click on the includes in the admin and create new file and it's called is the update

81
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.330
of the categories

82
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.380
that it should be.

83
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.810
All right.

84
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.830
And here we're going to paste our form that we just took from there.

85
00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.470
We got a lot of stuff here that is going to be included from the categories here and to include it we

86
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.810
need to actually write some code about that.

87
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.090
So how do we include this form.

88
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.090
Well we need to write a little condition here to include it.

89
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.430
So we're going to say first we need to write that ph pretax here.

90
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.020
All right.

91
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.730
All right.

92
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:30.630
So we're going to say if set this function so use for right get we're going to check for that link right

93
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.310
here.

94
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:41.700
So if that's set which is the edit key in the array the the key in the end at it right here and see

95
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.710
that that's going to be that key right there.

96
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.470
And make sure that your super blow was actually written well.

97
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.390
All right.

98
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.170
A fifth set.

99
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.640
We're going to make sure that we have a camera idea because we are getting that in the other side.

100
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.700
Show you right now actually we have him right here.

101
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:09.010
We're not right here cat ID.

102
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.200
All right.

103
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.780
All right.

104
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.580
So let's turn that into the right there.

105
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.380
All right.

106
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.420
So

107
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.290
that's good.

108
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.770
That's good.

109
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.330
So I think we're good here now.

110
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:33.810
Next thing is to include follow that we've got and make sure that we have our path correctly so includes

111
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:42.180
for Shlash What is the name of date of this file right here of day categories.

112
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.360
Let's see right here.

113
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.310
PH BE GOOD.

114
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.430
All right I think we're good to go.

115
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.880
All right let's check it to see if we have any errors.

116
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.930
Let's make sure

117
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.540
we click it perfect we have it working now.

118
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.720
All right click it and let's update it.

119
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.260
Let's see if it happens.

120
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.290
There we go.

121
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.250
He's updating.

122
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.730
Of course we want it the right name on it.

123
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.920
Let's add another one let's use add.

124
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.040
Actually let's end this because we already have something there.

125
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:26.610
Vostro Let's call the Java Java.

126
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.700
Let's add another one called or P

127
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.240
and let's add another one called

128
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.990
procedural.

129
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.150
And this is why we are doing and by the way procedural PH BE

130
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.040
PERFECT.

131
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.320
Right click on it working at it we can edit it.

132
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:56.510
So we are done with this as a matter of fact and let's continue with our course.

133
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.960
We are CMOS system right.

134
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.060
So anyways I'll see you in the next lecture.

135
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.080
If you were able to do this fully with me.

136
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.660
Great congratulation if not just rewind the video and watch it again and get it done.

137
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.470
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video.

138
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.160
Take care.
