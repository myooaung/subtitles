00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.430
All right so this lecture here I want to fix a couple of links on the site so that we can move around

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.560
a little easier.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.160
So this link right here is taking us to the home page.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.940
If I click on this link anywhere I am it going to take me to the home page too.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.750
But we need to change the name.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.390
And I also need to change this link here and this link here.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.250
Right so we need to change those.

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.300
So let's go to category we're just fixing up a little bit here.

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.420
So the first thing is to go to the navigation and we have Star boosters right here.

10
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.300
Let's just change this to see a mess front.

11
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.100
For example we don't have to be that specific.

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.680
Right.

13
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.170
And here the CMS admin is taking between that step actually a mousehole I am on admin includes admin

14
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.910
underscored navigation that BHB and we're going to change this too.

15
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.240
And that's the and it's BHB we have another link

16
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.910
right.

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.320
So let's check on that real quick.

18
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.700
Admen then we have this dashboard that we need to fix.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.210
So this one this fits that for the one that fits.

20
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.120
So that would be an obligation somewhere here.

21
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.300
Dashboard we can also look at if we can find it for some reason is right here in that stuff BHB.

22
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.950
So let's check that out.

23
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.790
Oops that's for.

24
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.290
That's all right.

25
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.730
All right.

26
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.480
So everything is looking good here.

27
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.610
Perfect.

28
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.220
All right.

29
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.240
So another thing that I want to do also is that we want to check this here.

30
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.870
We want to do that syrup on this kind of description right here.

31
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.220
So let's do it at the end it's and let's do a net search on the category page.

32
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.160
And when I say serve I mean like we're going to truncate that tets right now is too long right here

33
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.090
to show this an A in that right.

34
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.160
Like we need to show just a little bit of content.

35
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:27.300
So let's go ahead and do have a little function here and we're going to go to where is it and it's and

36
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.070
here and this is of course the home page right.

37
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.000
So we're going to do a little function here it's called substring sup.

38
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.680
This is a string function so string of SDR.

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.630
And we are going to be closing everything there all this content here.

40
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.200
And then we are going to separate is a little bit and we're going to say we want the stream to be separated

41
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.890
from 0 characters to 50.

42
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.310
So that's going to make this a little bit smaller as you can see right here.

43
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.890
Asias minimize it to 50.

44
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.230
We could say probably a little more from 0 to 100.

45
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.010
And that will help it out.

46
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.960
All right.

47
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.970
That will help this out.

48
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.650
Actually let's check out some more current and let's see if.

49
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.270
All right.

50
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.240
Right here you see that it just cut the lowering ipsum there to 100 characters.

51
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.540
All right.

52
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.710
Perfect.

53
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.320
So now we got to get the same function we're going to do this to the category page.

54
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:44.500
This is go in and do it in the category in the category which is right here on the CMOS and up here.

55
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.520
Let's just Baystate and perfect category page done.

56
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.340
All right.

57
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.960
So we click on it.

58
00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.210
We get this everything is truncated to you see that perfit.

59
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.520
So anyway thank you so much for watching and hopefully you're able to do this with me and hopefully

60
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.580
keep you keep enjoying the course.

61
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.220
All right.

62
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.940
So take care and I see you in the next lecture
