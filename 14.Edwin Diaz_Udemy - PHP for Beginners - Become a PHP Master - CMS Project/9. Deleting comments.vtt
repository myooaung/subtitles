00:00:00.800  -->  00:00:06.760
All right so we were able to relate our common to posts here.

2

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:11.700
So what we want to do next is first of all fits this little column right here.

3

00:00:11.940  -->  00:00:17.000
And then we want to be able to do that the lead cross crud from this window here.

4

00:00:17.010  -->  00:00:20.760
So when we click on this link we want to be able to delete the Comet just like we did with the polls

5

00:00:20.760  -->  00:00:22.140
right here.

6

00:00:22.140  -->  00:00:22.920
All right.

7

00:00:22.920  -->  00:00:24.830
So let's go in and fix that first.

8

00:00:24.960  -->  00:00:27.180
And then also take this class out of here.

9

00:00:27.390  -->  00:00:31.600
That's a class on the comments link there but that's going to fix this column first.

10

00:00:31.620  -->  00:00:36.020
And we're going to go to admin includes view or comments that BHB.

11

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:41.100
And here we're going to take this edit out of there since we're not going to be editing comments as

12

00:00:41.190  -->  00:00:43.350
go back refresh.

13

00:00:43.610  -->  00:00:44.220
That's Fit.

14

00:00:44.250  -->  00:00:48.940
Let's go to the navigation fix that real quick before we make that crud.

15

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:53.510
And I want to go in to add me navigation.

16

00:00:53.590  -->  00:00:55.050
Let's look for

17

00:00:57.450  -->  00:01:04.460
comments that we can see far fast.

18

00:01:04.830  -->  00:01:07.050
So any comment is down here somewhere.

19

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:07.810
There we go.

20

00:01:08.010  -->  00:01:12.450
And it shows how a class of active let's just go ahead and take that off because that's confusing us

21

00:01:12.450  -->  00:01:14.540
right now.

22

00:01:14.550  -->  00:01:14.810
All right.

23

00:01:14.810  -->  00:01:16.140
Perfect.

24

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:16.550
All right.

25

00:01:16.770  -->  00:01:25.230
So let's go to the view or common area code in the source page and the source code view or comments

26

00:01:25.230  -->  00:01:31.110
that BHB and let's add the functionality to matter of fact this page already has the functionality we

27

00:01:31.110  -->  00:01:33.630
just have to kind of modify it a little bit.

28

00:01:33.630  -->  00:01:38.580
As you can see here if you go all the way to the bottom says we copy this from the view of Polsce that

29

00:01:38.580  -->  00:01:41.580
BHP page we got some of that functionality here too.

30

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:49.120
So we just got to change a couple of things and we're just going to say the comment Id that's fine.

31

00:01:49.800  -->  00:01:59.320
And change you hear Make sure you change it and we are going to be the leading from comments where come

32

00:01:59.330  -->  00:02:00.790
in ID.

33

00:02:00.870  -->  00:02:06.240
And that's going to be in a column in the table comment.

34

00:02:06.370  -->  00:02:12.050
He calls this idea that we're going to be picking up from the get requests.

35

00:02:12.090  -->  00:02:18.830
We are going to be making when we click on this link just like we did in the View Post page.

36

00:02:18.840  -->  00:02:19.690
Right.

37

00:02:19.710  -->  00:02:21.270
So I think we're good here.

38

00:02:21.270  -->  00:02:22.230
Let's check it out.

39

00:02:22.230  -->  00:02:31.830
Let's go up to here and let's change this two comments.

40

00:02:31.830  -->  00:02:32.800
All right.

41

00:02:33.240  -->  00:02:39.990
Comments that BHP we're going to send the same parameter delete and the only thing is that we are going

42

00:02:39.990  -->  00:02:41.160
to be changing.

43

00:02:41.190  -->  00:02:48.700
We're going to be put in an I.D. here and we are going to be using these I.D. right here.

44

00:02:48.700  -->  00:02:49.710
All right.

45

00:02:50.160  -->  00:02:56.560
So I know that and here we've got to come and put this here.

46

00:02:57.000  -->  00:02:57.780
Perfect.

47

00:02:57.960  -->  00:03:04.080
So now that when we go there one more thing that we need to do is we need to reload this every time

48

00:03:04.680  -->  00:03:06.910
is submitted.

49

00:03:06.930  -->  00:03:07.320
All right.

50

00:03:07.320  -->  00:03:13.340
So that way we can refresh the page and we can see the action happening right away.

51

00:03:13.350  -->  00:03:15.550
Comment up ph.

52

00:03:15.570  -->  00:03:21.600
So we know it basically we send this query after we are done with this then we send the page again to

53

00:03:21.650  -->  00:03:24.840
comments just to do like a little refresh.

54

00:03:24.840  -->  00:03:25.410
All right.

55

00:03:25.620  -->  00:03:27.330
So let's check it out real quick.

56

00:03:27.330  -->  00:03:28.610
We click on delete.

57

00:03:28.830  -->  00:03:29.450
Done.

58

00:03:29.490  -->  00:03:30.040
Beautiful.

59

00:03:30.060  -->  00:03:32.310
So now our crowd is actually working it.

60

00:03:32.340  -->  00:03:34.010
Let's do it one more time.

61

00:03:34.260  -->  00:03:35.370
And we got no comment.

62

00:03:35.370  -->  00:03:36.990
Now we have to make some comments.

63

00:03:36.990  -->  00:03:37.500
All right.

64

00:03:37.530  -->  00:03:44.760
So while I take a coffee break why don't you go ahead and click on any post and make a couple of comments

65

00:03:44.850  -->  00:03:46.760
so we can have it there and do some more.

66

00:03:46.790  -->  00:03:47.510
All right.

67

00:03:47.850  -->  00:03:50.240
So when I come back we're going to be doing some more crud.

68

00:03:50.350  -->  00:03:57.950
I think we're going to be doing the edit and edit and approve and their own approve.

69

00:03:57.960  -->  00:03:59.100
OK.

70

00:03:59.100  -->  00:04:02.460
So anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

71

00:04:02.460  -->  00:04:03.120
Take care.
