1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,910
So we know that every time we visit a Web site or an application that application could be setting up

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,110
a cookie into our browser it could be putting information into our browser so that every time we visit

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,520
a Web site where application back they can pull that information and know who we are.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:27,170
That way they can personalize the application other Web sites and give us a better experience right.

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,880
How do we do the same thing they are doing.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,080
How do we make an application that could actually set a cookie for a user and then read the data back

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,660
and do things without data.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,810
Well on this video I'm going to show you how to do that.

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,360
This is going to be awesome awesome awesome lecture.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,850
All right.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,830
So let's go ahead and we'll bring our co-editor.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,910
The first thing that we got to do and the second thing is always almost a second thing and that is saving

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:02,970
as this blank that BHB and we are going to call this cookies that BHP and here on the doctype declaration

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,020
above that we are going to open a BHB tag.

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,210
OK.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,630
Now know that the cookies how we set cookies is would a function called Set cookie.

17
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:28,660
We also got to know that the information of the cookie of the user is saved in a super global cold cookie.

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,220
All right.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,500
So this is going to be all the information is going to be saved in the super global here and it's going

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,250
to be in a associative array.

21
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,860
OK just know that this is variable.

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,500
All right underscore cookie.

23
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,600
Now don't get confused about associative a rating.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,390
Know that BHB handles that in the back.

25
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,650
It's already set for us meaning that we can call this set this cookie.

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,200
So pro-global anywhere in our application any page and we don't need to let BHB know that diet is a

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,340
global BHB already has a defined for us and has all the methods attached to this.

28
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,820
In the back end when I say methods I mean functions right.

29
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,400
There's a bunch of things happening in the background that we don't know about that BHB takes care.

30
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,320
OK.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,810
And of course with the Apache server.

32
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,470
So now first of all let's go ahead and set the cookie and then I'll show you how to read it.

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:30,460
Right so right now let's let's go ahead and set the cookie we're going to use a function call said cookie.

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,360
All right.

35
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,450
And we know this is how we declare this is what we call function with the name of the function and the

36
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,980
parentheses and know that this function is already set for us in ph B is a pre-build function.

37
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,440
So eaks going to take three parameters.

38
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,900
All right.

39
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,290
Know that it takes three parameters the three parameters the first one right here is going to be the

40
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,670
name.

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,170
So I'm just going to say name and she's going to say some name right.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,340
You know how descriptive I am with names.

43
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,140
That was actually being ironic right.

44
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,240
The second is going to be the value of that.

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,780
All right.

46
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,350
So the value would be I don't know let's say the 100 that would be the value could be anything you want

47
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,580
really doesn't matter.

48
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,600
And the third parameter that is going to take its exploration.

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,460
When do we want this cookie to expire next week two weeks from now let's see.

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,360
Let me just write this three years from now when do you want that cookie to speired.

51
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:40,830
The great thing about this is that it's real if you think about it we can go ahead and take control

52
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,080
of the set of values into a user's browser.

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,550
Right.

54
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,480
And then we can set the value there for years and when they come back we would know who they are again

55
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,860
and then we can just say listen last time you were watching this now I want you to watch this.

56
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,040
Watch this.

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,040
I mean it's unbelievable if you think about arrives really awesome.

58
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:10,050
So anyways let's go ahead and for inspiration we're going to use a time function this time function

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:18,750
and most of the functions with time related to time they are done with seconds.

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,600
So this time functioned the way it is going to give me all the seconds from 1970 and you can reference

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,850
this time function in the PH BE that net if you want to check it out.

62
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,490
But basically it's going to give me all the seconds from 1970 to now.

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,380
Well we need to do is because we have all the seconds here.

64
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,960
Right.

65
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:43,440
Coring seconds but when it's what we want to do is add an expiration date.

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,690
So for him to say I want to add something here.

67
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,280
And the way I do that is I'm going to use 60 seconds right.

68
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,020
Then we know in 60 seconds.

69
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,150
So we use 60.

70
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,160
Remember this is going to be seconds here.

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,450
So you know in 60 seconds we'll have a minute 60 minutes we have an hour.

72
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,150
All right.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,810
And then and then in 24 we have 20.

74
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,910
We have 24 hours we are what we're doing is we're multiplying seconds science minutes times days.

75
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,610
All right.

76
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,150
Right here 7:00.

77
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:24,900
OK.

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,790
This basically this translates into a week ahead.

79
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,780
Right now we're adding a week to it.

80
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,580
So we're doing seconds times minutes times hours.

81
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,440
OK.

82
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:46,650
We know that 60 Minutes equals one hour right right here times 24 that's 24 hours 24 hours time seven

83
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,200
that equals a week.

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,800
All right.

85
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,710
Just keep that in mind these are seconds that we are multiplying.

86
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,420
So we have a week in advance here so we're setting this cookie to expire in a week.

87
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,120
Let's actually set it to expire in a later time.

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,190
What about we wanted to do expire later in three years from now.

89
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,480
So we need to make that calculation right here.

90
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm not going to go into details about that just know that this is a week from now.

91
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:16,380
And let's let this video already running a little late so let's go ahead and set this right now so let's

92
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,380
first start with the name.

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,510
Let's do the value here.

94
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:22,920
Right.

95
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,790
And expiration it's duration.

96
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,720
I'm going to do a copy right here here.

97
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,880
All right.

98
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,510
So now all right this cookie is going to be set into the browser every time they visit or our applications

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,150
so we have to they have to visit cookies that BHP this is going to be set automatically.

100
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,810
All right.

101
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:53,210
So let's go ahead and do that and then we'll find out what how we would see if it was set.

102
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,820
All right.

103
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:01,410
So let's go and click here and he's going to go to the document right now the cook is supposed to be

104
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,340
set because we visit that this page right here.

105
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,460
So let's go to Crome and let's find out.

106
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,250
Let's go to settings.

107
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:17,650
Let's go to short advance settings content settings and should say something about localhost.

108
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,780
All right.

109
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,830
So let's look for software here.

110
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,520
Site locally.

111
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,750
Let's see if we can find it without spending too much time on it.

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,500
So this site should be localized.

113
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:42,870
You've probably seen it already right here locals and you see right here there's some name price value

114
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,290
right there.

115
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,860
So let's click on it and see what information we get.

116
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,190
So we got the name some name we gather value content that domains loco's.

117
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,220
It gave us some extra information.

118
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,330
The forward slash send from any kind of connection the system will yes create it right now.

119
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,500
And in a week it's going to be expired.

120
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,400
Right seven days from now at 9:00 is the.

121
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,810
Right there.

122
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,390
Again we can remove it right here.

123
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,250
So there's video here I show you how to set up a cookie.

124
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,730
Now every time now we can go ahead and test this out if we wanted to.

125
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,530
All right.

126
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,100
So we can find out.

127
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,970
We can send this information in the user's computer.

128
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,010
And then when they come back we can do things depending on this information.

129
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,990
We can say if name is this a value is this or if the user did this and that we do this and that.

130
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,730
I mean I'm not going to go into details right now but just know that we can do things depending on the

131
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,370
user on this cookie cookies values.

132
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:47,720
Right.

133
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,130
Well then that's me and I'm going to show you how to read this value.

134
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,640
All right.

135
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,400
And how to do things that pending on that value Anyways thank you so much for watching this lecture.

136
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,250
I see you the next one
