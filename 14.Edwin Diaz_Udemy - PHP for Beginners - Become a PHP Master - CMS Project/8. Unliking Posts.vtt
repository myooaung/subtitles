1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:11.310
OK so to create the functionality to like the pools we need a but another boat and now we're going to

2
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.130
make this a little bit more dynamic later on.

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.320
But right now I'm just going to create another bond here just for the time being so we can build this

4
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.470
feature because this other feature right here is going to take a little bit more time creating a dynamic

5
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.910
link that's going to change the class depending if it was liked or not.

6
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.910
We're going to create some help or functions and that's going to help us with that.

7
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.380
All right.

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.090
Now I want to create a own like button.

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.060
OK.

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.670
So let's call this on like

11
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.350
and let's just name it on like right here.

12
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.010
Like OK and let's just put a thumbs down it's like that.

13
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.890
A class.

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.310
And I'm going to change this class to be the link to be on like OK.

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.790
And if we go here and refresh we should see that one like button right there.

16
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.160
OK.

17
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.770
Now the thumbs down looks like it's not working because I misspelled it.

18
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.750
You know how I do it.

19
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.450
There we go.

20
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.480
All right.

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.250
So we'll do something very similar to how we did it down here in Dan in the javascript so I'm going

22
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.190
to copy this and I'm going to comment this code right here.

23
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.680
And the like.

24
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.300
And you're going to quit liking in here and you're going to call it own liking.

25
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.540
I'm going to pace out there and when I change this class because we did that in the barn there and we're

26
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.900
going to be sending a request with the same type of information there is nothing here that we need to

27
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.280
change to be honest with you.

28
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.980
Well this here when I make sure that is that we are detecting this only liked poles variable everything

29
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.000
else is the same.

30
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.580
OK.

31
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.190
So let's go back here.

32
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.170
This should be easier now.

33
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.610
OK.

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.200
And I'm just going to copy this whole thing like that.

35
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.430
Copy.

36
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.030
I'm going to paste it now with a couple of different things that we need to do here to make things work

37
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.700
OK.

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.830
First of all we need to the tech to make sure that we are detecting their own light poles here.

39
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.890
So let's come and all this out.

40
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:51.240
And at call like like like this the first thing OK and let's refresh Let's open our console developer

41
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.400
tools and let's make sure that when we click on like that we are getting something OK.

42
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.870
So I remember that network make sure that we have that

43
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.960
here to this like let's click it and if we click this we can see that it says on light so we are actually

44
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.170
detecting but in their functionality.

45
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.920
So that's working.

46
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.290
That's a first step.

47
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.050
So now let's write down our steps that we.

48
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.530
So that was the first step was to test and I should have rolled up before.

49
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.280
OK.

50
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.450
First step to test here.

51
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.910
So a couple of things that we need we need this IDs OK.

52
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.070
We need those.

53
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.300
Now the next step to do here would be we need to Querrey.

54
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.930
So let's come in this hour here instead of that which is going to make sure that this is step number

55
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.890
two would be to Querrey fetch our likes.

56
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.780
OK.

57
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.960
So fetching the likes it's a matter of fact let me see we have that

58
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.710
as a matter of fact.

59
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.210
No we need to do the same thing.

60
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.380
Let me just come back here and we need to fetch our pulse.

61
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.060
So we were there we were there and we were doing.

62
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.090
I knew it was very similar to that.

63
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.180
It's just that we have the wrong numbers here.

64
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.540
Because the first step was to actually test but that's OK.

65
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.190
We can we can live without it right.

66
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.230
And ashers take that off just to make things uniform so fetching that pulls says first thing then.

67
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.750
OK.

68
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.870
This is going to change a little bit.

69
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:49.080
We need a delete functionality because we need to delete the lights every time we own like a post.

70
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.400
OK.

71
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.120
That's the way we're going to detect this.

72
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.090
So we need to delete

73
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.510
likes or decrement the likes.

74
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.840
Right.

75
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.030
Well we need to really likes actually first of all and then we need to.

76
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.630
They are opposed to the comment they're like OK so delete likes justice.

77
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.780
And then here would be something like decrement or update

78
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.100
update

79
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.380
the comment likes

80
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.710
Santa like that.

81
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:38.750
And I should have put here what we're creating like here all day pulse or incrementing likes

82
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:51.610
noncredit man doing what he likes maintain.

83
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.820
Right right right.

84
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.080
So let's open up this

85
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.300
here so we are now instead of incrementing here we're just going to decrement.

86
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.530
OK that's all we're doing here we're going to we're going to make a different Querrey here though.

87
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.740
Let's copy this guy here and that space out there.

88
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.980
And we are going to delete

89
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.390
and you know what.

90
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.410
You don't have to always select everything.

91
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.580
So we got to delete likes.

92
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.910
OK.

93
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.080
Where posts whose ID equals a post ID that I won.

94
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.530
As a matter of fact I already had it here.

95
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:56.200
So we had to delete from likes where posts ID equals a post ID.

96
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:05.630
OK that's the first thing and maybe we also want to make sure that we delete that we make sure that

97
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.830
a user id OK does the right like that we are going to be deleting right.

98
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.720
So that would be the user ID.

99
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.330
Yeah we have that there something like.

100
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.650
Ok maybe later on we'll refactor this a little bit more or think about it a little more but I wanted

101
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.680
to show you guys this.

102
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.950
I was so excited because you know I left this for you or I put on the backburner and I was like I'm

103
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.470
going to teach that later.

104
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.300
But you guys are making a lot of requests and I just want to start you know making sure that you guys

105
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:48.670
are happy and OK so once we delete the likes then we update our posts with decrementing like OK.

106
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.190
And that's all we do here.

107
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.740
We don't need this of course but you know it would be nice to

108
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.270
make make make sure that maybe we'll edge it out here just to make sure that our application is working

109
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.840
a little better.

110
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.500
We don't need it BHB will detect it.

111
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.660
So I think we are good to go.

112
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.830
I think this is going to work.

113
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.400
Let's test this out to see if it works.

114
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.930
If it doesn't we'll fix it.

115
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:20.720
OK so let's go back here and we like this poll.

116
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.160
And this is

117
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.210
like the one time.

118
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:39.370
So now if I go back to that pose and I click on like cross your fingers and there is fresh and you can

119
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:47.850
see that we have 1 0 likes and if we go back we have no likes table guys.

120
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.720
Great job.

121
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.880
If you made it work the first time.

122
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:52.760
OK.

123
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.930
Awesome.

124
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:59.160
So we are finally liking and own liking posts.

125
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:06.250
Ok now we're going to have more posts to test this and make sure that we are liking the pipe pools and

126
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.170
with the right user.

127
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.180
But we've got a couple of more steps to finish this off.

128
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.970
Now of course it can get a lot better.

129
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.520
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
