00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.980
Welcome back my students in this lecture young want to show you a really great day and going to show

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.190
you how to make this more secure.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.300
A couple of days ago from this video here one of my students actually told me that a friend of his or

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.750
I think her or his.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.910
I don't know.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.360
Found a blog and I was very happy and in my head I was like wow.

7
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.640
Varg beautiful let's go fix it right.

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
That's my attitude towards bugs because they make me better.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.150
Write books.

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.480
If you get stuck in a thing for a cold for many days you know in the pursuit of finding the answer you

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.100
try so many different ways that actually made you write the code more so now you got more practice and

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.760
actually show you new ways of actually doing things right.

13
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.670
So maybe you better don't get frustrated don't get angry with me.

14
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.440
I'm trying to show you help you become better.

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.570
So anyway what is a problem for us.

16
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.220
Let's make some users so that when we can see the problem I'm going to make a user call them a wife

17
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.860
with some crazy password and that's going to make another user here with jibberish information because

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.200
I type fast like that.

19
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.710
And now we got to use his ID number 39 and 40.

20
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.290
All right.

21
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.190
So what's going on is that we can go ahead and delete this user from out here.

22
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.130
Thirty nine answer enter now if we go back here the user is the lead it.

23
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.910
How can we avoid such a thing.

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.570
Right.

25
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.500
If we put this on now only the way it is users can be deleted.

26
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.270
Right.

27
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.060
So in order for us to fix this we've got to go.

28
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.480
And some of you already found the answer because we all the information I've given you.

29
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.090
That's easy for you to do but I want to show you for those of you that have not actually done it yet

30
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.690
so you underscore all users right that's the page we are on and we are all the way to the bottom.

31
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.140
All right.

32
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.890
This is a page right here.

33
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.330
We are showing other users right here.

34
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.820
This is the page and this is the coldest performance.

35
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.530
We grabbing that get requests and then we are executing the miscue o statement right.

36
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.600
So the first thing that we need to do is valy they are cold here.

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.420
So we value their code and I show you this code before I show you how to implement this here.

38
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.150
All right.

39
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.780
So not only do you have to clean the code where you need to validate it.

40
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.410
All right.

41
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.900
So we see if the user role is set then we can execute the code down here.

42
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.030
All right but this means that a subscriber can actually come and delete this stuff.

43
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.480
Right.

44
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:42.100
Let's do something else let's do if let's just put this here and what we've got.

45
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.020
We're going to say if the user role is admin then we can secure this code.

46
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.080
All right this will work the way it is.

47
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.290
But now let's do a little bit something else let's talk let's clean it up a little bit with my Eskew.

48
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.730
Escape string.

49
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.330
All right.

50
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.720
From now on we all were always cleaning data up and I show you how to do this in lecture 50 something

51
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.560
I believe.

52
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.990
If I'm not mistaken would pass in the connection with my school string the two parameters connection

53
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.730
and that get in to get requests.

54
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.800
Now this code is perfectly right.

55
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.120
It's not 100 percent perfect but it would prevent anybody from coming into your L and trying to execute

56
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.900
that code.

57
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.230
So now we come here make sure that we have no errors by refreshing that page.

58
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.670
We see that we have an error here on line 1:26.

59
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.620
So make sure that we don't have that let's check it out.

60
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:45.110
So we're missing a branch this is here and you might be thinking How in the world he find us all fast.

61
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.350
Well that bugs so many mistakes over the years made me a professional in finding our books and that

62
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.000
makes you more valuable.

63
00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.700
Now if you come back here and you try to delete the user ID number 40 admin users.

64
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.210
Look what happens.

65
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.550
Enter Rico.

66
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.470
One two and three.

67
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.670
Come back here.

68
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.970
The code is still there.

69
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.230
They use to see you there now before you go I want to tell you for some of you out there that need some

70
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.030
type of income e-mail me because I can help you.

71
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.730
You see many of you are recommending my courses for free because you love my course and you're telling

72
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.770
your friends that you should take this course for Medwin.

73
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.610
Yes he's awesome and all this.

74
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.740
Thank you so much.

75
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.640
But I was thinking I know some of you need some type of income while you become a developer if you want

76
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.640
what you can do is you can recommend my course and I can give you a commission of the course that interest

77
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.130
you.

78
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.570
All right.

79
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.960
I'm always trying to find ways to help you guys out.

80
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.480
And this is the only way that I can help you all besides teaching you all the stuff that I'm teaching

81
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.370
you in this course I hope to you.

82
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.420
I told you that I was going to help you make money in this course even with a title this course and

83
00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.430
this is my problem it's not only by teaching you Ph.D. but by actually allowing you to you know to recommend

84
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.900
my course and still make a commission.

85
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.920
You don't have to do it for free if you don't want to.

86
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.970
And you know if you want to you can go ahead and do it.

87
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.490
But if you want to leave something out of it.

88
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.110
Email me to support at ideas or come.

89
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.220
Very simple.

90
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.840
All right.

91
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.220
This is my e-mail right here and you can message me right here support as soon as I come right there.

92
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.150
Very big.

93
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.720
Easy.

94
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.180
All right.

95
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.000
E-mail me.

96
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.340
We can work something out.

97
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.120
All right.

98
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.610
I'm here to help you.

99
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.150
And I'm always thinking how to help my students.

100
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.850
Why.

101
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.880
Because I know by helping you I help myself not only do I become a better person and does my pursue

102
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.460
every single day to become better.

103
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.410
Everything I do.

104
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.950
But I also want to help you.

105
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.150
I want to help my students.

106
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.800
I want to help people and this is the whole reason why I teach.

107
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.760
Thank you so much for being such a great student and I'll see you in the course.
