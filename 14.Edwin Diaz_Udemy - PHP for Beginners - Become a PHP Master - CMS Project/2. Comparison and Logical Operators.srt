00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:08,090
High on this video I want us to learn a little bit more about comparison operators and logical operators.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,310
We have used them without knowing what they really are.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,440
And I want to introduce you to them.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,290
So let's go ahead and let's open our coeditor.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,680
I think it's a lot easier for me to show you visually what they are.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,990
So let's grab the blank that be and then do a Save As and call this comparison

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,480
operators.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,900
Even though I'm going to show you two kinds of logical ones and the ones that we use for comparison.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,640
I said matter of fact I just made a page here that was useless.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,160
There's two of those save as I'm going to call this comparison because we need to add the PH P to the

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,360
end of the page.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,870
If not this does not work.

13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,270
Comparison of paraders that Ph.

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,200
There we go.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,650
And I'm just going to delete this.

16
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,640
All right.

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,850
Let's go back to the file.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,440
All right so let's open our BHB tags here.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,070
And of course I need to include that.

20
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,690
OK.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:24,780
Well our comparison operators are right so I already did a little bit of a stack of mail here that I

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,980
want you to have in your exercise files and you will have this file.

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,300
Is going to be called comparison operators of course.

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,110
I'm going to comment this.

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,230
So you could see it on the browser.

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,700
So I'm going.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,410
I'm going to explain it to you right now.

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,930
So these are a comparison operators right.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,680
We have the equal we have the identical right.

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,820
So we would say if something is equal to or identical to we would compare it.

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:02,850
For example we say this is greater than less than greater than or equal than less than or equal to or

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,920
less than or greater than.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,450
Right.

34
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,320
This is not with exclamation not equal to.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,540
And this is not identical.

36
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:13,890
All right.

37
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,710
We already use this.

38
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,580
Here we have not used any of the other ones.

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,900
So I just want to show you a couple here.

40
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,010
So now now that we have that let me show you the logical operators real quick before I show you the

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,170
example.

42
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,040
All right.

43
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,240
So let's just take these comments here.

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,800
Let's come back here fresh from.

45
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,330
You don't need to refresh with brackets.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,640
All right so the logical operators are very simple.

47
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,410
We use it and this is to compare two conditions and I'll touch on that right now and then or I'm going

48
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,560
to show you that with an if statement and they're not right.

49
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,840
So it's going to jump into the cold and show you how they work.

50
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,640
First let's start with the comparison operators.

51
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,260
You're going to use them in loops you and I use them in many different parts of your code.

52
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:19,220
Let's go ahead and comment on this because I won my BHB to be on the top line there.

53
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,830
Actually I'm going to go all the way down there so that we don't have that.

54
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,110
There we go.

55
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,670
Remember that space really doesn't matter.

56
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,530
MP It should be all right.

57
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,920
Some programming languages might complain but this BHB does not.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,250
So let's write in this statement.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,410
All right now that we know how to write in this statement and let's compare something let's compare

60
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,280
two numbers.

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,250
Very simple if four is less than four.

62
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,550
I want you to call this out.

63
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,080
It is true.

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,350
All right.

65
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,860
Very simple.

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,530
So let's go to the browser refresh is not going to execute because four is now less than four.

67
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,320
What about if four is less than or equal than four.

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,660
Now is executing because it is equal then also right.

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,770
So what about if 4 is

70
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,840
the same.

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,370
Is equal to four.

72
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,940
This execute it is equal to four.

73
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,240
All right what about if it's bigger.

74
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,800
No.

75
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,390
If this moner No.

76
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,780
What about if it's not equal to of course is not executing because it is equal to.

77
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:52,300
All right but if I change this to five then now we know that four is not equal to five.

78
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,030
All right.

79
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,180
Now what about the identical

80
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,210
same right now for a.

81
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,540
Here it is identical four and four is identical.

82
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,710
But what about when I put it I make it around the string.

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,970
Now it's telling me it's not identical Why.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,750
Because this is a data type of string tetes and this is a number and integer.

85
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,240
So they are not identical right here.

86
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,620
They are the same BHB looks at and say OK you have a string here would have four inside that school.

87
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,390
That's the same.

88
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,580
But if I say identical BHB says no no no no no no.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,520
This is not identical because this is the string and this is a number.

90
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,320
Right.

91
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,870
So always keep that in mind.

92
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,840
Now let's talk about the logical operators.

93
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,120
So right now this is not executing because it's not identical.

94
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,400
Let's have a different opinion right here.

95
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,870
So a different choice or so we can test with with these two lines.

96
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:07,840
Here is a means or so if four is identical to four or five is less than 10 that's a cue.

97
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,120
All right.

98
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,160
So if this doesn't get SECU this or a key what key we're here was not here.

99
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,080
But you see it with this symbol is saying if this does not work then we can try this one out because

100
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,880
it says if four is not identical to four or five this is less than 10 then it's AQ this.

101
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,960
Now the end is a different animal.

102
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,450
And it's like this.

103
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,960
Now both for this condition have to to be true in order for this to.

104
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,370
Therefore has to be identical to four and it fires to be less than 10 to execute.

105
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:58,830
So if I make this like this for now I was executing right now because Foy's identical to four and five

106
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,580
less than 10.

107
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,660
So did both of these conditions are true.

108
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,820
We executed caught him right in between there right.

109
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,760
So keep that in mind that's the way you write it down.

110
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,320
I'm going to leave this house here for you in the course exercise files and I will you can have kind

111
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,810
of a reference here I want to come back and check this out.

112
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,370
All right.

113
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,630
I'm going to probably write out a couple more statements below just to show you those examples that

114
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,830
we did.

115
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:29,160
And when we're done here so hopefully you were able to learn a lot on this lesson here and for some

116
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,170
reason suntanned not using understand that 100 percent don't worry.

117
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:39,540
We're going to be practicing there's an implication that we made for this course and it's going to be

118
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:39,870
fun.

119
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,110
Right.

120
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,270
So take care and I'll see you in the next life lesson.

121
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:43,780
My
