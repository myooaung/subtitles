00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.249
<v ->Welcome to the final exercise for part one</v>

2
00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:07.416
of this course which is called the Save Money Checklist.

3
00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:12.141
In this exercise I want you to please go to exercise

4
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:14.712
number six called Save Money Checklist.

5
00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:16.832
You can see the tab there for this video.

6
00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:21.560
Then please click on the boxes next to the savings tips

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.584
that we talked about in this section that you think

8
00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:28.571
you can save money on, on a monthly basis.

9
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:30.841
Then what I want you to do is this.

10
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.906
I want you to type in the monthly savings you can realize

11
00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:36.904
with each of them if applicable.

12
00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.273
Skip the items that do not apply to you please.

13
00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:44.363
Feel free to enter in an optional comment or strategy

14
00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:47.654
thought on how to implement each savings item

15
00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:51.821
on the right side here in the white comment boxes.

16
00:00:52.737 --> 00:00:55.328
Then once you've completed this final checklist,

17
00:00:55.328 --> 00:00:57.441
at the bottom you're going to see how much money

18
00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:00.995
all the checked boxes that you selected will be worth

19
00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.848
in 30 years at an interest rate of 10%.

20
00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:07.928
I think you will see that you might be able to save

21
00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:11.747
literally millions of dollars by the end of this exercise

22
00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:14.646
and by the end of this course.

23
00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:17.754
You can also change the assumptions of the number of years

24
00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:19.921
from 30 to another number.

25
00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:23.619
You can also change the interest rate too,

26
00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.266
as they're in white boxes at the bottom here.

27
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.516
Please enjoy this exercise.

28
00:01:29.768 --> 00:01:33.897
Again please change the yearly and percent assumptions

29
00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:35.226
if you want.

30
00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:39.370
Take your time with this as saving money is actually fun.

31
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.417
It lowers your stress and it makes you much happier.

32
00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:46.904
Your bottom line savings message will automatically

33
00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:50.682

34
