00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.259
<v Instructor>Welcome to exercise number 23.</v>

2
00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:03.797
We're almost there.

3
00:00:03.797 --> 00:00:07.877
And you'll notice that this house icon is highlighted

4
00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:09.059
because if you click on that,

5
00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.138
that's the same thing as this exercise,

6
00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:14.857
which here is exercise numbers 22, mortgage calculator.

7
00:00:14.857 --> 00:00:17.128
Okay, so I've switched it to a different currency.

8
00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:19.128
I'm trying to be global in this course.

9
00:00:19.128 --> 00:00:21.392
So we're looking at the Philippine peso in this case.

10
00:00:21.392 --> 00:00:23.197
It doesn't matter what currency it is.

11
00:00:23.197 --> 00:00:25.907
If you're dollar based,

12
00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:28.099
just think of this as dollars, this exercise.

13
00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.056
If you're yen based, yen, et cetera,

14
00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:31.037
and you can get the idea.

15
00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:33.334
If you wanna change your country and currency,

16
00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:34.565
just click on here

17
00:00:34.565 --> 00:00:35.925
or click on the settings.

18
00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.347
Okay, let's get this started.

19
00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:39.445
How does a mortgage work?

20
00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:40.720
So like always for this course,

21
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.805
we only answer stuff in the white cells, okay?

22
00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:44.475
And then the green is determined for us,

23
00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:46.915
and then English is created here

24
00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:48.835
to explain what happened there.

25
00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:51.611
So let's enter in the stuff here, okay?

26
00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:55.707
If you bought a house for 400,000 Philippine pesos, okay?

27
00:00:55.707 --> 00:00:58.995
And you finance half of that with a mortgage.

28
00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:00.774
So half that is, what, 200,000, right?

29
00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:03.416
Okay, so I have to add in 200.

30
00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:04.249
Okay.

31
00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:07.374
Half of that with a mortgage

32
00:01:07.374 --> 00:01:10.277
that had an interest rate of 5%.

33
00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:11.110
Five.

34
00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:14.437
And the life of the mortgage is 30 years,

35
00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:18.488
then what would the size be of each of the monthly payments?

36
00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:19.321
Thirty.

37
00:01:20.287 --> 00:01:21.370
There you go,

38
00:01:22.317 --> 00:01:23.848
and it tells you the answer here.

39
00:01:23.848 --> 00:01:26.197
So it basically tells you that your monthly payments

40
00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:27.912
will be 1074.

41
00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:31.116
And play around with this, too, if you want, as well,

42
00:01:31.116 --> 00:01:33.246
before you take on a mortgage

43
00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:35.339
or before you think about buying a house

44
00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:38.459
or before you get pre-approved for a mortgage, as well.

45
00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:39.757
Okay, next question.

46
00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:41.299
Number two.

47
00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.099
Now, let's assume that we did not read the fine print

48
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.819
on question one,

49
00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.728
the mortgage documents in question one, okay?

50
00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:49.357
And the interest rate on our mortgage jumped

51
00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:51.547
from five to 8%, okay?

52
00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:52.636
That's a big jump.

53
00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:55.277
Please calculate what our new monthly payment will be.

54
00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:56.179
And for simplicity,

55
00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.659
I said just assume that the length of the mortgage

56
00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.877
is still 30 years

57
00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:01.099
and we have not made a single payment yet.

58
00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.266
Okay, so the mortgage size is still the same, 200,000.

59
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.854
The interest rate goes from five to eight,

60
00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:10.867
and it's still 30 years.

61
00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:11.700
Plug and play.

62
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.885
Easy, fun.

63
00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:14.624
Okay, great.

64
00:02:14.624 --> 00:02:19.317
So now it tells us that our payment will be that much, okay?

65
00:02:19.317 --> 00:02:20.560
So how does that compare?

66
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.645
That's a lot higher.

67
00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:23.547
That's, like, close to 40% higher.

68
00:02:23.547 --> 00:02:24.380
Wow.

69
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.445
Isn't that crazy, dude?

70
00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.781
So for a 3% increase from five to eight,

71
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:32.032
you're getting close to a 40% increase in payments.

72
00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:34.187
So that 3% can be misleading.

73
00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.448
Okay, number three.

74
00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:39.376
Let's assume we got the exact same scenario as number one,

75
00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:40.427
meaning 20,000,

76
00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:43.010
$200,000, 30 years, at 5%.

77
00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:45.629
One month after we sign the mortgage,

78
00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.739
our broker called us

79
00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.288
and said that interest rates dropped by 1%

80
00:02:50.288 --> 00:02:54.989
and recommends that we refinance from 5% to 4%, okay?

81
00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.577
Then the mortgage broker tells you

82
00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:57.808
that he can do all the paperwork

83
00:02:57.808 --> 00:03:01.883
and get you that 1% lower rate for a fee of $1000, okay?

84
00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:03.149
So he's gonna charge a grand.

85
00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.309
Should you do it or why?

86
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.109
And explain in details the new proposed mortgage

87
00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:07.997
in the white boxes below.

88
00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:11.243
Okay, so mortgage size is still 200,000.

89
00:03:11.243 --> 00:03:14.385
Let's pretend we haven't made a payment yet.

90
00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:17.336
The interest rate goes from five to four.

91
00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:19.128
So before I enter that in,

92
00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:21.727
we were paying 1074, okay.

93
00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:23.237
Five to four.

94
00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:26.947
And it's still, let's just say 30 years.

95
00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:29.528
And he wants to charge 1000 bucks.

96
00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:31.284
Okay, so if we refinanced it.

97
00:03:31.284 --> 00:03:33.144
Before I look down there.

98
00:03:33.144 --> 00:03:37.699
Then the monthly, the new payment would be 955, okay?

99
00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.403
Versus that, that's about 125 or so higher, right?

100
00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:43.968
And you're like, well, it's 1000 bucks.

101
00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:45.728
You should definitely do it, okay?

102
00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:46.848
You should definitely do it.

103
00:03:46.848 --> 00:03:49.747
Because what happens is the difference of 125,

104
00:03:49.747 --> 00:03:51.336
whatever it was,

105
00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:53.134
will take you less than a year to break even

106
00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:55.673
on the 1000 mortgage refinance fee.
