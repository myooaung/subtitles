00:00:00.784 --> 00:00:03.520
<v ->You can invest in commodities by buying the commodity,</v>

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.896
like gold itself, or investing in stocks of companies

3
00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:10.628
that make the underlying commodity, like oil companies,

4
00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:13.366
or you can invest in my preferred option,

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:17.901
which is a commodity ETF, which you can also monitor

6
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:20.999
on your investment portfolio management system.

7
00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.322
We will do an exercise on this in the next lesson

8
00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:26.979
but before we do it, before we get there,

9
00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:29.984
I want to talk about why investing in commodities

10
00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:34.151
can be a great addition to your diversified portfolio.

11
00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:39.918
There's a scarcity value when it comes to commodities.

12
00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:41.989
Because of this scarcity value,

13
00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.042
the value of most commodities will be higher

14
00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:47.649
in 20 or 30 years from now, okay,

15
00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.042
and years ago, I met with the CFO

16
00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:54.209
of a company called the United Technologies, ticker UTX,

17
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:57.995
and United Technologies is a company

18
00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:00.740
that makes the Otis elevators, okay, and they have lots

19
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.592
of other subsidiaries as well, and the CFO of UTX,

20
00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:08.325
when I met with him, he said to me that

21
00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:12.477
in the next five years, more buildings are going to be built

22
00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:17.127
in China than the cumulative total of all buildings

23
00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:20.234
that have ever been built in every country

24
00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:22.848
since the beginning of time.

25
00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.046
Amazing, amazing.

26
00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:26.566
Another statistic I heard about China was that

27
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.124
every single year,

28
00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:30.878
the equivalent electricity grid infrastructure

29
00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:34.555
of the United Kingdom is built in China.

30
00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:38.975
I mean, we certainly live in interesting times.

31
00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:41.592
And so knowing something like that

32
00:01:41.592 --> 00:01:44.161
would make you want to invest in commodities

33
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:48.983
that go into buildings, right, like copper, or iron ore

34
00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.338
for steel, that sort of thing, okay.

35
00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:54.363
And so the easiest way to understand

36
00:01:54.363 --> 00:01:57.611
most commodity price changes is that

37
00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:00.043
if most of the larger economies in the world

38
00:02:00.043 --> 00:02:04.868
see their GDP growing, then the price of most commodities

39
00:02:04.868 --> 00:02:08.719
should rise, as commodities like oil and copper

40
00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:12.256
and iron ore, which goes into steel, and others,

41
00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:16.998
will be used to make more products and buildings, etc.

42
00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:21.165
However, some commodities can be seen as a fear investment,

43
00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:26.265
okay, for example, gold, which has an ETF, ticker GLD

44
00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:31.441
for gold, and GLD, the ticker, can go up a lot in price

45
00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:35.475
if many of the larger countries in the world

46
00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:39.440
are in a deep, deep recession, and gold can rise in price

47
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.969
in times of incredibly uncertain economic

48
00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.287
and geopolitical times because people have less faith

49
00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:49.953
in governments and currencies and they think that

50
00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:53.953
gold will hold its value better, and so in 2008,

51
00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:59.610
rough year man, but in 2008, when the global economies

52
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.087
were within 24 hours of bank machines not working,

53
00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:06.837
literally, it was hard to find gold anywhere,

54
00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:10.443
and the same thing can be said about safes,

55
00:03:10.443 --> 00:03:12.576
as they were sold out everywhere.

56
00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:17.125
People were buying gold with cash here in San Francisco

57
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:21.415
from Chinatown, and people were putting gold in safes

58
00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:25.582
at their houses in case the global economy really collapsed.

59
00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:28.433
Okay, I know that's really out there,

60
00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:32.065
and maybe people that buy gold with cash later sell gold

61
00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:35.003
for cash so that they don't have to pay taxes,

62
00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:37.607
which is illegal of course.

63
00:03:37.607 --> 00:03:40.540
And silver is somewhat similar to gold.

64
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.323
I love silver.

65
00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:43.642
I'm not telling you to buy silver.

66
00:03:43.642 --> 00:03:45.124
Do your own research please.

67
00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.981
But silver is somewhat similar to gold

68
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.398
except it is a big input into

69
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:56.956
many different industrial products, okay, so it's,

70
00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:59.449
although it has kind of a flight-to-quality look and feel

71
00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.080
to it at times because it is thought of as being similar

72
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.472
to gold, a lot of it is based on

73
00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:08.186
input into industrial products, right?

74
00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:10.231
A lot of products use silver, okay?

75
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:14.148
And the ticker for the silver ETF is SLV, okay.

76
00:04:15.707 --> 00:04:18.912
And there's many, many, many ways to invest in oil

77
00:04:18.912 --> 00:04:23.308
as it's basically the largest input into many products.

78
00:04:23.308 --> 00:04:25.954
So instead of buying a barrel of gold,

79
00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:29.010
we can buy many different types of ETFs,

80
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.512
like the ticker USO, which invests in oil in Oklahoma

81
00:04:33.512 --> 00:04:35.809
here in the United States.

82
00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.650
And if you want to invest in natural gas,

83
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.231
you can buy the index that has the ticker UNG,

84
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:44.395
N as in Nancy, U-N-G.

85
00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:47.474
And if you wanted to invest in agriculture-related products,

86
00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:51.057
check out ticker DBA, David, Brian, Arthur,

87
00:04:52.472 --> 00:04:56.436
which invests in soybean, cattle, corn sugar, cocoa,

88
00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:57.736
etc, okay?

89
00:04:57.736 --> 00:04:59.381
And if you want to invest in copper,

90
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:02.823
just look at ticker JJC, etc., okay?

91
00:05:02.823 --> 00:05:04.878
And so here's a helpful link to a website

92
00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:08.358
that tracks more than 150 commodity tickers

93
00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:10.691
from a website called ETFDB,

94
00:05:11.837 --> 00:05:15.420
which means Exchange-Traded Funds Database.

95
00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.751
Many companies that have to buy a lot of commodities

96
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:23.703
will try to hedge their exposure to risks

97
00:05:23.703 --> 00:05:25.236
and price fluctuations.

98
00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:29.340
Okay, let me give you a fascinating example.

99
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.969
Southwest Airlines, which has the ticker LUV.

100
00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.289
Why LUV?

101
00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.956
Because Dallas Love Field is the name of the airport

102
00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:38.602
that Southwests operates out of.

103
00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:39.561
Okay, sorry.

104
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:42.570
But guess what the largest commodity is

105
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.595
that Southwest and all the airlines use?

106
00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:48.513
Of course, it's oil, okay,

107
00:05:48.513 --> 00:05:52.167
and that's why Boeing's new amazing 787 Dreamliner

108
00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:56.218
is selling well, as it's a much lighter airplane

109
00:05:56.218 --> 00:05:58.374
versus the older ones, so it uses less,

110
00:05:58.374 --> 00:06:01.195
obviously less oil to put that bird in the sky.

111
00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:05.348
So Southwest Airlines, ticker LUV, spends a fortune

112
00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:08.163
on oil every year, just like all airlines do.

113
00:06:08.163 --> 00:06:10.696
But what happened last decade was fascinating.

114
00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:13.316
The management of Southwest, they're brilliant, by the way,

115
00:06:13.316 --> 00:06:15.636
but the management of Southwest decided

116
00:06:15.636 --> 00:06:18.502
that since they spend so much money on oil,

117
00:06:18.502 --> 00:06:22.128
it would be smart to lock in the price of oil

118
00:06:22.128 --> 00:06:25.345
that they would pay in the future, at about 30 bucks

119
00:06:25.345 --> 00:06:28.065
many years in the future, and then what happened was this.

120
00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:31.195
After they locked in the price of oil at about 30 bucks

121
00:06:31.195 --> 00:06:35.795
a barrel for years, oil prices rose materially.

122
00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:39.130
Oil prices rose to $100 last decade,

123
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.008
and almost all of Southwest's US competitors

124
00:06:43.008 --> 00:06:46.012
had to increase prices of their tickets by a lot,

125
00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:48.568
just given the massive increase in the price of oil.

126
00:06:48.568 --> 00:06:51.326
Well, what Southwest did was predatory.

127
00:06:51.326 --> 00:06:54.691
They kept the prices the same and even cut the prices

128
00:06:54.691 --> 00:06:58.258
in some markets, and this and other reasons

129
00:06:58.258 --> 00:07:02.643
almost caused every major US airline to go bankrupt,

130
00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:06.836
almost, okay, and Southwest had the foresight to invest

131
00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:11.235
in options, okay, and in what are called futures, right,

132
00:07:11.235 --> 00:07:13.755
to lock in the future price of oil.

133
00:07:13.755 --> 00:07:17.084
Now I don't suggest that you and I invest in options

134
00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:21.251
or futures, but if you go to finance.yahoo.com/commodities,

135
00:07:22.646 --> 00:07:26.284
you can see what the future markets are pricing in

136
00:07:26.284 --> 00:07:28.924
for many different commodity prices,

137
00:07:28.924 --> 00:07:30.924
and if you scroll down a bit on this webpage,

138
00:07:30.924 --> 00:07:33.754
you'll see that this is a great resource

139
00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:36.759
for news on commodity prices.

140
00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.941
Okay, and let me warn you though, please.

141
00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:42.431
If you read these news stories, every now and then,

142
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:45.163
you will, although you will get a better understanding

143
00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:47.381
of how commodity prices move and down,

144
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:50.063
sometimes you'll see sponsored stories, okay?

145
00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:53.328
Don't click on sponsored stories because there's a bias

146
00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:55.598
in those stories to make you, I don't know,

147
00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:57.804
buy a certain product, whatever it might be, okay?

148
00:07:57.804 --> 00:07:59.563
Just a little side note there, but I care.

149
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:02.396
Okay, so in the next exercise,

150
00:08:02.396 --> 00:08:04.124
we're going to add commodities

151
00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:06.370
to our investment portfolio management system

152
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.075
in a very similar fashion to what we already did

153
00:08:10.075 --> 00:08:14.158
for stocks and bonds in exercises 18, 19, and 20.
