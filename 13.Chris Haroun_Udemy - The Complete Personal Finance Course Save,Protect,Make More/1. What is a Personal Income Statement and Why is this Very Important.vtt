00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:04.077
<v ->Now that we understand the time value of money</v>

2
00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:05.731
and the importance of small savings

3
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.704
leading to massive wealth generation later in life,

4
00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:11.125
let's now talk about what you make

5
00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.836
and what you spend on a monthly basis,

6
00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:17.014
so we can focus on increasing your income

7
00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:18.708
after all expenses,

8
00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:22.225
and of course, so we can focus on saving much more money.

9
00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:25.772
Now, companies analyze their spending habits

10
00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:27.802
by making what's called an income statement,

11
00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:31.309
which explains money in and money out.

12
00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.022
We're gonna do the same thing here

13
00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:35.861
by creating and materially improving

14
00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:38.575
your personal income statement,

15
00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:39.965
and what we're gonna do is this,

16
00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.170
we're gonna calculate where your money is going,

17
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.548
okay, and we're gonna do this exercise two times, okay?

18
00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:48.404
And this will make a lot more sense very soon.

19
00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:50.422
We're gonna start with creating your

20
00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:53.233
current income statement,

21
00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:55.510
then we're gonna learn about more than

22
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.677
100 ways to save or reduce expenses, I should say,

23
00:01:00.614 --> 00:01:03.108
and save more money so we can create your

24
00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:06.486
new and improved income statements, okay,

25
00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:10.719
and if you find just one or two or three ways

26
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.548
to cut back on expenses out of the 100 plus ways

27
00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:16.186
we're gonna discuss, then this could lead to

28
00:01:16.186 --> 00:01:19.608
literally over a million dollars more

29
00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:22.560
in your pockets in the long run, okay?

30
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.712
And I know that sounds ambitious,

31
00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:27.612
but please remember the first exercise in this course

32
00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:30.833
and when we discussed very small changes in spending

33
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:33.470
like spending less daily on a coffee or a tea,

34
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.619
and how much more money you'll save in the long run.

35
00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.111
And so, if you end up using more than a few

36
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:43.272
of the 100 ways that we're gonna discuss

37
00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:46.956
to reduce your spending, then your financial future

38
00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:49.725
will start looking like your dream life.

39
00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:50.684
There's no limits.

40
00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:52.073
Let's do this.

41
00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:56.191
Okay, we can save money and have fun doing these exercises.

42
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.934
And so the next step is to please

43
00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:01.499
watch the next lesson so we can document

44
00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.566
your current income statement.

45
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:04.399
Thank you.
