00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:13.483
<v ->Food and drinks expense tip number one:</v>

2
00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:15.742
bottle and bring your own water.

3
00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:18.020
You will save a fortune in the long run.

4
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.651
As we discussed, buying water actually costs more than

5
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:22.898
buying gasoline in many countries.

6
00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:24.722
It's also better for the environment, of course.

7
00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:27.685
And actually, here in the city of San Francisco,

8
00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:31.176
they recently banned the sale of bottled water

9
00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:32.773
on city property.

10
00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:34.933
And I know that sounds out there,

11
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.573
but I think this will be the norm in many places,

12
00:00:37.573 --> 00:00:41.225
just like you can't smoke in bars or in restaurants now

13
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:44.227
in many countries, thank God.

14
00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:47.157
Separately, places like McDonald's make a fortune

15
00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:48.605
off of selling us drinks.

16
00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:53.022
In fact, those places only make money on drinks

17
00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:55.304
and a small amount on fries,

18
00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:58.037
which is why, at McDonald's, they always ask us,

19
00:00:58.037 --> 00:00:59.659
"Do you want a Coke with that?

20
00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.100
"Do you want fries with that?"

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.691
And so, food is a loss leader for many restaurants,

22
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.808
and drinks are where the massive profit margins

23
00:01:06.808 --> 00:01:08.827
and markups are made,

24
00:01:08.827 --> 00:01:10.571
and it's ridiculous that we spend

25
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.211
so much money on drinks when we go out.

26
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:15.696
We can just have them at home for much, much cheaper.

27
00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:18.396
I don't know why people do that,

28
00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:21.483
why they buy drinks at expensive restaurants,

29
00:01:21.483 --> 00:01:23.198
or any restaurants, for that matter.

30
00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:27.365
And even my kids, whenever we go to a fast food restaurant,

31
00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:31.022
we'll go to Walgreens, which is the drug store here,

32
00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:33.743
and we'll buy some drinks first.

33
00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:35.959
You know, it all adds up.

34
00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.493
Expense tip number two: bring your own grocery bags tip.

35
00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:41.802
So, if you bring your own grocery bags,

36
00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:43.551
you'll save money in the long run,

37
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:44.699
because they actually charge us,

38
00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:47.173
at least where I live here, for bags.

39
00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:50.371
And back in Canada, they charge as well.

40
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.373
And it's also better for the environment too,

41
00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:54.999
'cause we're all in this together.

42
00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:58.650
Tip number three: buy a coffee machine.

43
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.463
So, buy a coffee machine instead of

44
00:02:00.463 --> 00:02:03.211
buying from a Starbucks or other coffee shops.

45
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:06.237
And please revisit the first example in the course,

46
00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:08.352
the first exercise as well,

47
00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:09.820
on how you can save literally

48
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.891
hundreds of thousands of dollars,

49
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:14.092
and maybe over a million dollars in your lifetime

50
00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.868
by making your own coffee

51
00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.459
or your own tea at home.

52
00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.709
It all adds up.

53
00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:23.733
Expense tip number four: don't boil using the stove tip.

54
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.348
This one's out there again.

55
00:02:26.348 --> 00:02:29.599
But what I recommend is boil water using a microwave,

56
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.287
if you have one, instead of the stove,

57
00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:34.758
as it's a lot faster and it's actually cheaper

58
00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:37.459
to heat stuff in the microwave, even water.

59
00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.824
Also, if your kids, I shouldn't go there, but I will,

60
00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:44.869
if your kids love those Cup of Noodles items,

61
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:48.721
have them use your Keurig or coffee machine to

62
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:52.477
pour in the hot water, as it can heat the water faster.

63
00:02:52.477 --> 00:02:54.465
It's cheaper and safer too.

64
00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:56.484
No MSG in that stuff.

65
00:02:56.484 --> 00:02:58.644
Okay, expense tip number five:

66
00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.397
eat what you have first tip.

67
00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:03.299
Eat what you already have in the freezer or pantry

68
00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.055
instead of buying more stuff.

69
00:03:05.055 --> 00:03:07.261
We all waste so much money by letting stuff

70
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:09.751
pile up in the pantry, or in the freezer,

71
00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:12.916
or perishables that go bad in the fridge.

72
00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:15.504
And I know it sounds kinda silly,

73
00:03:15.504 --> 00:03:19.518
but we all let so much stuff expire and waste

74
00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:21.783
when we can just give it to the poor instead.

75
00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:23.911
And there's actually a pretty cool website called

76
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.661
MyFridgeFood.com, which tells you

77
00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:31.748
what to make based on what you already have

78
00:03:31.748 --> 00:03:34.498
in your fridge or in your pantry.

79
00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.750
Expense tip number six: freeze it tip.

80
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.565
Freeze leftovers, and bread,

81
00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:43.508
and consume it later if you prefer.

82
00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:47.037
And when I buy bread, Christine, my wife,

83
00:03:47.037 --> 00:03:49.349
she always puts it in the freezer

84
00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.284
and we toast bread frozen.

85
00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:53.214
It works for us, and you save

86
00:03:53.214 --> 00:03:54.705
a lot of money in the long run

87
00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:56.122
this way as well.

88
00:03:57.021 --> 00:04:00.093
Food and drinks expense tip number seven:

89
00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:01.843
grocery shopping tip.

90
00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:05.745
Don't shop for groceries more than one time per week.

91
00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.508
You can save the three dollars,

92
00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:10.653
or whatever it might be, in gasoline.

93
00:04:10.653 --> 00:04:13.986
And if you have an ODB port on your car,

94
00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.551
which I'm sure you do, as all cars

95
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:18.938
since 1996 have them,

96
00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:21.811
you can actually put in a product

97
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:23.539
from a company called Automatic.com

98
00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.566
that will tell you how much money you're spending

99
00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.399
in travel fees as well.

100
00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:31.014
And the pricing point for the ODB port add-ins

101
00:04:31.014 --> 00:04:32.906
from Automatic.com and other companies

102
00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.419
is getting a lot cheaper as well.

103
00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.081
We covered that earlier.

104
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:40.438
Expense tip number eight: grow it yourself tip.

105
00:04:40.438 --> 00:04:44.305
Grow your own food and do your own landscaping.

106
00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:47.005
It's healthy, it's fun to do, and it's relaxing, man.

107
00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:48.851
It's like yoga.

108
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:50.277
Make a garden.

109
00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:54.558
And avoid using anything from Monsanto, any seeds.

110
00:04:54.558 --> 00:04:56.616
A little off topic, but it's not good for you.

111
00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:59.232
Grow your own food, as it is organic,

112
00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.670
and it's cheaper, and therapeutic too.

113
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.262
Just try it out.

114
00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:05.059
And tell the kids about it as well,

115
00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.674
'cause it's a great way to save money and eat healthier

116
00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.508
while bonding with the family.

117
00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:13.341
And my dad, when he got back from the hospital

118
00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.767
after his heart attack, he went right into the backyard

119
00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:19.712
and started gardening.

120
00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:22.471
It's so peaceful and relaxing,

121
00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:24.835
and you can save on healthcare bills

122
00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:26.835
in the long run as well.

123
00:05:27.738 --> 00:05:30.007
Tip number nine: make and pack

124
00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:32.192
all of your meals tip.

125
00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:33.843
Make your own lunch, your own breakfast.

126
00:05:33.843 --> 00:05:34.963
Yes, you do have the time.

127
00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:37.111
I promise you, you do.

128
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:39.139
Sunday afternoons, for many years,

129
00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.547
I now make seven of these things, right?

130
00:05:42.547 --> 00:05:44.768
It's got everything I need in it,

131
00:05:44.768 --> 00:05:48.018
antioxidants, kale, ginger, aloe water,

132
00:05:49.712 --> 00:05:52.506
whey protein, that sorta thing.

133
00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:55.271
And so, I make them in my blender,

134
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.914
and it's basically a greatest hits

135
00:05:56.914 --> 00:05:59.616
of everything I need to hopefully make it

136
00:05:59.616 --> 00:06:01.199
till 150 years old.

137
00:06:03.341 --> 00:06:06.850
And I'm currently 21, as you can tell.

138
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.853
Just kidding about living to 150 years.

139
00:06:09.853 --> 00:06:13.859
Also, I pack five lunches, which saves me a fortune,

140
00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:16.522
and it doesn't really take that much time,

141
00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:18.259
as I prepare everything at once

142
00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.840
and put everything in the fridge.

143
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.133
And if you prepare everything at once for the whole week,

144
00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.863
it's a lot faster than doing it every single day, right?

145
00:06:25.863 --> 00:06:29.946
It's like the Ford plant, it's a production line.

146
00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:33.655
This not only keeps you healthier,

147
00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:35.981
which is the best investment you'll ever make,

148
00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:38.066
but it actually saves you a lot of time

149
00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:40.582
because you don't have to leave your desk,

150
00:06:40.582 --> 00:06:43.789
and of course, you save a lot of money.

151
00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.253
Tip number 10: only shop from a grocery list tip.

152
00:06:48.253 --> 00:06:50.246
Make your grocery list, and do not buy

153
00:06:50.246 --> 00:06:52.209
anything not on that list.

154
00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:54.616
And never shop when you're hungry either.

155
00:06:54.616 --> 00:06:58.583
And use those coupons, and use a free online app,

156
00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:00.522
like this one here that I've been using

157
00:07:00.522 --> 00:07:03.594
for several years now with Christine, my wife,

158
00:07:03.594 --> 00:07:04.890
called OurGroceries.

159
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.544
And it's free, it's awesome because

160
00:07:07.544 --> 00:07:10.202
it actually makes creating a shared grocery list

161
00:07:10.202 --> 00:07:11.857
really, really easy to do,

162
00:07:11.857 --> 00:07:14.004
and it remembers what you bought in the past,

163
00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:16.072
so you can just add more items to it.

164
00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:18.469
And anyways, it's a lot faster.

165
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:23.028
Tip number 11: order appetizers or kid's meals tip.

166
00:07:23.028 --> 00:07:25.597
So, I like to order two appetizers

167
00:07:25.597 --> 00:07:29.285
and skip the main course, or share dishes,

168
00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:32.488
or be a vegetarian, as it's cheaper and healthier.

169
00:07:32.488 --> 00:07:34.957
And main courses, I think, are a ripoff,

170
00:07:34.957 --> 00:07:37.991
as you end up paying for side orders of stuff

171
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:39.886
that you didn't even order to begin with.

172
00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:42.754
And my wife Christine and I,

173
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:46.033
we used to order kid's meals for ourselves

174
00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:48.913
at some fast food restaurants like Chipotle,

175
00:07:48.913 --> 00:07:50.632
which is a great Mexican restaurant,

176
00:07:50.632 --> 00:07:52.590
as it was just much cheaper,

177
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.427
and there was a lot of food

178
00:07:54.427 --> 00:07:56.581
in the kids' orders anyway.

179
00:07:56.581 --> 00:08:00.469
And it all adds up, and sometimes, I won't order

180
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:02.435
when I take the kids out,

181
00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:04.947
as a lot of times, they won't finish their meals,

182
00:08:04.947 --> 00:08:08.332
especially my youngest one, Dylan.

183
00:08:08.332 --> 00:08:11.151
Food expense tip number 12: receipt tip.

184
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:13.865
Please, read the receipt closely,

185
00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:15.711
especially when you go out to dinner,

186
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:19.324
as I find at least one in 10 times when we go out,

187
00:08:19.324 --> 00:08:22.231
that we are overcharged for something.

188
00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:26.398
Food and drinks expense tip number 13: unhealthy habit tip.

189
00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.769
If you have a bad habit like smoking

190
00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:32.278
or drinking too much, then please open up

191
00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.447
exercise number one in the course

192
00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:38.374
and look at the first exercise on coffee expenses.

193
00:08:38.374 --> 00:08:41.754
And type into that exercise number one

194
00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:46.112
how much you spend daily on that bad habit,

195
00:08:46.112 --> 00:08:49.232
and look how much money you're gonna save in the long run

196
00:08:49.232 --> 00:08:50.757
if you kick that habit.

197
00:08:50.757 --> 00:08:55.005
And for those of us with substance abuse issues,

198
00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:58.659
and people really close to my family have had issues,

199
00:08:58.659 --> 00:09:03.597
it's actually easier to stop a habit 100% of the time

200
00:09:03.597 --> 00:09:05.646
than 98% of the time,

201
00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:07.770
and I think you know what I mean.

202
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.086
The same thing can be said

203
00:09:10.086 --> 00:09:12.594
when it comes to our mentality of saving.

204
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:15.757
We need to be in this saving zone

205
00:09:15.757 --> 00:09:19.065
100% of the time, and not 98% of the time because

206
00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:23.148
that 2% binge spending, or impulse shopping,

207
00:09:24.357 --> 00:09:26.495
or spending mistake by us can cost us

208
00:09:26.495 --> 00:09:28.751
thousands or millions of dollars

209
00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:31.332
in lost savings in the long run.
