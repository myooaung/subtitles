00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.285
<v ->This next question, number eight,</v>

2
00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:13.973
is my favorite question in this exercise.

3
00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:18.097
My in-class university students would say, "That's dope."

4
00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:20.064
So the question is basically saying

5
00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:24.876
that some people think that Europeans purchased Manhattan,

6
00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:27.369
which is the island that New York City is on.

7
00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.417
They bought it for $24 in 1626.

8
00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:32.551
And if you take that $24,

9
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:36.218
and if they put it in the bank back in 1626,

10
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.919
at an interest rate of 9.5%,

11
00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:40.495
what would that be worth today?

12
00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:43.495
A lot of people think, "My goodness,

13
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.558
"one party got shafted there.

14
00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:48.449
"The other party did not get shafted.

15
00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.341
"Which party is it?"

16
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.483
We don't know. We don't know.

17
00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.150
But if we take every single item

18
00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.137
on the island of Manhattan, every building,

19
00:00:57.137 --> 00:00:59.290
and we add up all the property values

20
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.528
of all the buildings in Manhattan as of today,

21
00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.361
you get $1.4 trillion.

22
00:01:05.324 --> 00:01:09.730
I saw it online in print, so it must be true. (laughs)

23
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.897
So what is the future value of $24 back then, today?

24
00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:16.674
Is it more than this or less than this?

25
00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:18.098
So what do you think the answer's gonna be?

26
00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:18.931
Let's see.

27
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.931
Okay, so, let's see, it was actually

28
00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:27.180
just a one-time saving, rather than, say, annual saving.

29
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.024
One-time saving.

30
00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:31.091
Okay, and, actually gonna change that.

31
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.008
One-time saving amount.

32
00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.071
There you go.

33
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:38.961
Number of years, well we know it's...

34
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:41.794
What are we now, 2017, right, 2017

35
00:01:43.317 --> 00:01:46.567
minus 1626, that's the number of years.

36
00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.516
The annual interest rate is 9.5, okay.

37
00:01:53.597 --> 00:01:55.699
And let's calculate this.

38
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:56.855
I want to do it myself.

39
00:01:56.855 --> 00:02:01.022
So what we're gonna do is, because it's a one-time amount,

40
00:02:01.893 --> 00:02:04.816
we're gonna calculate the future value of that $24.

41
00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:07.512
So we're gonna take $24, and we're gonna multiply it

42
00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:10.118
by one plus the interest rate,

43
00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:12.095
in this case, 9.5%.

44
00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:13.284
It's annual, so you don't have to worry about

45
00:02:13.284 --> 00:02:16.029
dividing by 12 or multiplying by 12.

46
00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.382
To the power of how many years?

47
00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:20.601
Do my little chapeau here.

48
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:22.242
That's French for "hat," I think.

49
00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.140
And then we'll do number of years here.

50
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.998
So watch this. Wait for it, wait for it.

51
00:02:26.998 --> 00:02:28.757
There we go.

52
00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:30.474
That is a huge number.

53
00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:33.366
What is that, that's billions, trill--

54
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:34.843
Oh my god.

55
00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.343
Wow. Wow. That is astonishing.

56
00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.732
That is astonishing.

57
00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:41.838
Pretty amazing, eh?

58
00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:43.268
Moving on to question number nine,

59
00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:45.636
and this is actually how I explain future value

60
00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:48.009
of money to my kids.

61
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.731
So, one of my kids absolutely loves playing

62
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:53.631
Clash of Clans.

63
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:58.329
And if, hypothetically, I told him not to spend

64
00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.768
₣10 monthly, which he certainly doesn't,

65
00:03:00.768 --> 00:03:01.784
I won't allow that.

66
00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:04.155
But let's say that instead of spending

67
00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:07.072
₣10 every month to buy virtual gems

68
00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:12.506
in Clash of Clans, he put that money in an investment

69
00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:14.839
that made 12% annually.

70
00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:20.615
So he would save ₣10 every single month,

71
00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:23.843
instead of spending it on Clash of Clans

72
00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:27.341
to buy a PEKKA, or whatever he calls those characters.

73
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.767
So what's he gonna have?

74
00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:31.267
So here's what we're gonna do.

75
00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:36.013
Right here, monthly savings is ₣10.

76
00:03:36.013 --> 00:03:37.458
The number of years is 42.

77
00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:39.458
That's 50 minus his age.

78
00:03:40.927 --> 00:03:43.105
And then we've got 12.5% here,

79
00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:44.488
so what's the value gonna be?

80
00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:45.321
Well he's doing it monthly,

81
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:46.721
so I'm not gonna do the same formula

82
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:51.432
that I did last time, which was a one-time payment here.

83
00:03:51.432 --> 00:03:55.182
I'm gonna use the Excel future value formula.

84
00:03:56.978 --> 00:03:58.699
So watch this.

85
00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.699
Equals minus one times future value,

86
00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:06.031
and the rates, we know it's over 12 months,

87
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:07.828
divide by 12, comma,

88
00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:10.495
number of years is 42, times 12,

89
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.458
that's 12 payments per year.

90
00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:16.041
Comma, monthly savings is that.

91
00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:19.640
There we go. ₣177,000.

92
00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:25.530
And you can explain to him or your daughter if you have one

93
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.835
that with this amount of money you can buy

94
00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.002
a ridiculously badass car.

95
00:04:32.013 --> 00:04:34.797
Let's talk about the last question here.

96
00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:37.984
And I have you fill out all the items here.

97
00:04:37.984 --> 00:04:40.144
So let's say your 13-year-old son,

98
00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:42.439
who thinks that money grows on trees,

99
00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.496
oh, and by the way, my son, Andrew, who is 13,

100
00:04:46.496 --> 00:04:47.990
I said, "Money doesn't grow on trees" to him.

101
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.777
He says, "Actually, Dad, they do. It's made out of paper."

102
00:04:50.777 --> 00:04:52.252
I sent him to his room immediately.

103
00:04:52.252 --> 00:04:53.971
Just kidding. Sort of.

104
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:57.971
So he wants to spend ₣4 every month on a hot dog

105
00:04:59.203 --> 00:05:02.534
when he goes to the movie, ₣2 on a soda,

106
00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:03.776
that's six so far.

107
00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:05.276
₣3 on candy, nine,

108
00:05:06.185 --> 00:05:07.940
and ₣10 on a movie ticket.

109
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.301
That's 19.

110
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:11.276
So he wants to spend ₣19 every single month

111
00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:12.882
for the next 30 years.

112
00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:14.898
Instead of eating at home for free,

113
00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.181
which I put in quotes there.

114
00:05:17.181 --> 00:05:20.317
So we have to calculate how much money he's gonna save

115
00:05:20.317 --> 00:05:24.489
and what that amount will be worth in 30 years

116
00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:27.454
at an annual rate of 14%.

117
00:05:27.454 --> 00:05:31.627
So we know the monthly savings are gonna be ₣19,

118
00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:33.794
the number of years is 30,

119
00:05:35.528 --> 00:05:39.494
the annual interest rate in this example is 14%,

120
00:05:39.494 --> 00:05:42.827
and so the future value of those amounts

121
00:05:43.747 --> 00:05:44.841
can be calculated as follows.

122
00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:47.777
Equals -1 times the future value,

123
00:05:47.777 --> 00:05:48.610
I'm gonna go through this fast,

124
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.177
'cause we know how to do this now,

125
00:05:50.177 --> 00:05:53.665
the number of periods, we know that it's

126
00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:55.748
30 years times 12, comma.

127
00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.966
I'm sorry, I made a mistake there.

128
00:05:58.966 --> 00:06:00.307
See, I should not go fast.

129
00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:03.807
The rate is 14% divided by 12, comma,

130
00:06:05.045 --> 00:06:08.962
and the number of periods is 30 years times 12.

131
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.733
The older I get, the better I was.

132
00:06:11.733 --> 00:06:12.930
See, I make mistakes.

133
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.997
And then the payments.

134
00:06:14.997 --> 00:06:18.362
And then I can close brackets, and there we have it.

135
00:06:18.362 --> 00:06:21.362
He would save ₣104,366 over 30 years

136
00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:27.511
by eating for free and watching Netflix for free at home.
