00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:02.301
<v Instructor>Welcome to exercise number 20.</v>

2
00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:03.648
This one's gonna be pretty easy as we've

3
00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:06.109
already done what we're about to do

4
00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.687
with the previous exercise, only we use stocks

5
00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:12.586
and ETF, index ETFs instead of bonds.

6
00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:14.138
This will be pretty straightforward

7
00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:15.957
and now you'll probably have a good idea

8
00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:18.969
as to why we set up the portfolio management system

9
00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:19.866
the way we did.

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.746
After we do this exercise, what we'll do is we'll move on

11
00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:26.218
to another exercise to add commodities

12
00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:27.858
for our portfolio as well.

13
00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:29.387
Let's get started.

14
00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:30.707
What we're gonna do is we're gonna create

15
00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:33.987
a new portfolio with these tickers in.

16
00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:35.359
There are six tickers.

17
00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.100
The first one we'll add is BND.

18
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.580
Let's use Safari this time.

19
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.997
And we'll go to My Portfolio.

20
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:46.386
And then what we'll do is we're gonna create

21
00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:49.926
a new portfolio, and I've done a couple versions of these,

22
00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:52.509
so let's call this Exercise 20.

23
00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:56.667
Okay, great.

24
00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.524
We're gonna add symbols here, the fist one

25
00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:01.191
is BND and then TLT.

26
00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:04.471
BND, TLT.

27
00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:10.869
Then we've got tip, that's TIP.

28
00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:15.896
Then we've got VLTCX,

29
00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:21.119
ISHG,

30
00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:25.441
and the last one is BNDX.

31
00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:28.862
Good, okay great.

32
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.798
Now I wanna have all the headings here,

33
00:01:32.798 --> 00:01:34.478
not just these ones here.

34
00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:37.137
So I'll go to New View.

35
00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:38.617
We can create a new view,

36
00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:41.958
or edit existing view if you wanted to,

37
00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.044
and just select them all.

38
00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:46.377
Make sure every single field is added.

39
00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.294
Okay, good, good, good.

40
00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:51.351
Great.

41
00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:54.606
Good, done.

42
00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:56.627
Okay, now like we've done in the past,

43
00:01:56.627 --> 00:01:59.267
we're gonna highlight everything,

44
00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:01.838
including the top row there.

45
00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:02.671
Copy.

46
00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:06.377
And then we're gonna go here to settings,

47
00:02:06.377 --> 00:02:07.907
and we're gonna add it to our portfolio

48
00:02:07.907 --> 00:02:09.977
like we've done before.

49
00:02:09.977 --> 00:02:12.745
I already deleted the information I had there before,

50
00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:14.827
you might have it from a prior exercise.

51
00:02:14.827 --> 00:02:16.627
You can just write over the top of it.

52
00:02:16.627 --> 00:02:19.105
Remember you gotta be in cell A200.

53
00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.078
Okay, good, there we go.

54
00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:22.107
Great.

55
00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:25.274
Okay now let's go back to exercise 20.

56
00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:32.438
We've got it populated here, great,

57
00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:34.006
so let's answer the questions now.

58
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:37.256
You'll notice that these questions here

59
00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:41.773
don't necessarily refer to that ticker

60
00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:44.358
in each row.

61
00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:45.935
It does sometimes, but not all the time.

62
00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:47.907
So the first question is, find out what percent

63
00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:50.907
of the holdings of the Vanguard Total International

64
00:02:50.907 --> 00:02:54.678
Market ETF Fund that are rated at triple A or above.

65
00:02:54.678 --> 00:02:56.761
The ticker there is BNDX.

66
00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:00.617
And I'm really trying to stress that I want you

67
00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:03.558
to invest in high quality bonds only.

68
00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:04.391
BNDX.

69
00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:10.284
Yeah, just click on that, it might be easier.

70
00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:11.406
Great.

71
00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:12.877
And we wanna see what percent of holdings

72
00:03:12.877 --> 00:03:15.166
are triple A or higher.

73
00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:16.358
Scroll down, good.

74
00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:18.275
22.97%, fantastic.

75
00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:20.446
Okay, great.

76
00:03:20.446 --> 00:03:23.131
And if you wanted to, you can write your answer down.

77
00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:24.457
Next question.

78
00:03:24.457 --> 00:03:26.166
Using Yahoo! Finance, what percent of the holdings

79
00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:29.055
of the iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond ETF

80
00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:30.888
are triple A or above?

81
00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:34.008
So I'm gonna copy this one.

82
00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:37.679
Paste it.

83
00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:46.377
And here the answer is 100%, awesome.

84
00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:48.076
So I would enter 100% there.

85
00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:48.909
Next up.

86
00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:52.977
I've got, what does TIPS stand for?

87
00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:55.315
We know it's Treasury Inflation Protected Securities

88
00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:59.286
but let's enter in the ticker for TIPS, which is TIP.

89
00:03:59.286 --> 00:04:00.119
TIP.

90
00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:04.977
And you can look at the Fund Summary here.

91
00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:08.310
It'll tell you that TIPS stand for that.

92
00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:11.747
Next up.

93
00:04:11.747 --> 00:04:15.914
What are the top five holdings of this index here?

94
00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.555
Let's go here, paste it in.

95
00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:25.718
VLTCX, you can actually ticker too, if you want to.

96
00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:28.998
And the top five holdings are right here.

97
00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:32.587
Ge Cap, Busch, Busch, Goldman, DTS, Deutsche Telekom

98
00:04:32.587 --> 00:04:34.257
and these are all bonds.

99
00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:37.166
I love the yield in that, it's pretty nice.

100
00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:40.188
And this fund is nicely diversified.

101
00:04:40.188 --> 00:04:44.588
Wow, the largest piece is 0.76%, I like that.

102
00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:45.588
Very cool.

103
00:04:45.588 --> 00:04:48.998
And the top 10 holdings are only 4.29%.

104
00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:51.248
Okay, what do we have next.

105
00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:53.206
Using Yahoo! Finance, find out

106
00:04:53.206 --> 00:04:57.518
the top five country holdings are for iShares

107
00:04:57.518 --> 00:04:59.748
One to Three Year International.

108
00:04:59.748 --> 00:05:01.915
Top five country holdings.

109
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:08.749
Alright, here they are, top five country holding.

110
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.148
Denmark, Portugal, Japan, Ireland, Sweden.

111
00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:12.170
Cool.

112
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.420
Nicely diversified as well.

113
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.580
And the last question here is using Yahoo! Finance

114
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.581
to find out what the top three country holdings are

115
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:22.081
of this fund here.

116
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.457
So I'm actually gonna go copy from up here this time.

117
00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.874
And there are your answers right there.

118
00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:39.853
Cool, so this process is pretty simplistic,

119
00:05:39.853 --> 00:05:41.844
and now that we know how to use it thoroughly,

120
00:05:41.844 --> 00:05:45.904
it should be pretty easy for us to add to our portfolio,

121
00:05:45.904 --> 00:05:48.893
commodities as well as real estate investment trust.

122
00:05:48.893 --> 00:05:51.813
We'll talk about commodities in the next exercise,

123
00:05:51.813 --> 00:05:54.009
and the next lesson as well.
