00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:02.317
<v ->Welcome to Exercise Number 4,</v>

2
00:00:02.317 --> 00:00:05.210
where we will analyze both your current

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.534
and your new and improved income statements.

4
00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:11.258
Meaning the data that you created in Exercises 2 and 3.

5
00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:15.425
And so please navigate to Exercise Number 4 here,

6
00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.397
You can see the tab at the bottom here.

7
00:00:18.397 --> 00:00:19.990
Or you can actually go there

8
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.528
by clicking on that "Next Exercise" button

9
00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:23.831
on the top right hand corner.

10
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:26.318
Or, and I try to make it easy for you,

11
00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:30.239
you can click right here to see all the exercises, okay?

12
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.215
So please navigate to Exercise 4,

13
00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:37.115
"Analyzing Your Income Statement."

14
00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:39.194
And "IS" stands for "Income Statement," okay?

15
00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:42.720
And the left hand chart, here, and questions

16
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.709
pertain to your current income statement.

17
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:49.265
And the right hand chart, here, and questions, here,

18
00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.928
are for your new and improved income statement.

19
00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:55.178
(easy listening music)

20
00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:24.260
And so please review these charts

21
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.376
and then answer Question Number 1, Part 1,

22
00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.876
and Question Number 1, Part 2.

23
00:01:31.808 --> 00:01:35.217
So Question 1, Parts 1 and 2

24
00:01:35.217 --> 00:01:38.777
deals with how much money is left over

25
00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:40.827
after all expenses

26
00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:44.161
divided by your income after tax.

27
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:46.556
And higher is better, of course.

28
00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.842
And so please pause me now

29
00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:52.327
and answer Question 1, Parts 1 and 2,

30
00:01:52.327 --> 00:01:54.680
in order to understand

31
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.850
how your monthly savings rate is currently.

32
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.037
Okay, meaning the left side of the exercise.

33
00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:04.543
And what your new and improved savings rate will be,

34
00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:05.897
meaning the right side.

35
00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:07.281
Okay, so please pause me now

36
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.869
and answer Questions Part 1 and 2,

37
00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.006
and then click on that plus symbol, there, you see here?

38
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:14.405
To check your answers.

39
00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.873
And after you complete Question 1, then please unpause me.

40
00:02:17.873 --> 00:02:18.706
Thanks.

41
00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:22.421
Okay.

42
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.076
Now that you've completed Question 1,

43
00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:26.952
and you've read the answers,

44
00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:30.378
please try to make your savings rate, from now on,

45
00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:32.310
way higher than 10%,

46
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.602
and please don't worry if you don't save any money yet,

47
00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:39.647
because we're going to work on this in this course.

48
00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:41.232
Okay, but promise me, though,

49
00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:43.803
and I'm gonna get down on my knees, here, okay?

50
00:02:43.803 --> 00:02:44.636
Promise me,

51
00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:45.469
can you even see me?

52
00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.302
I'll back up here.

53
00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:47.135
(he chuckles slightly)

54
00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:48.055
Here I am, praying.

55
00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:50.701
And I'm doing this because I wanna make a point, here.

56
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:54.190
Promise me that when you get...

57
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.023
Hi there!

58
00:02:55.023 --> 00:02:57.120
When you get your next raise,

59
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.775
please have as much of that raise as possible

60
00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:04.196
deducted automatically from your bank account,

61
00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:07.289
as it's out of sight and out of mind.

62
00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:08.760
Kind of like I am right now.

63
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.738
Meaning I'm out of sight and I'm clearly out of my mind.

64
00:03:11.738 --> 00:03:12.956
Okay, let me get up.

65
00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:14.232
(grunt of exertion)

66
00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:15.659
God, my knees!

67
00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.940
God, the older I get, the better I was, man!

68
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.031
Now I understand why baseball catchers...

69
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:23.443
They get in the Hall Of Fame,

70
00:03:23.443 --> 00:03:26.065
don't have as many hits as other people do!

71
00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:26.923
Damn it, that hurt!

72
00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:28.221
Okay.

73
00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:29.433
But I did, anyway, I did all of that,

74
00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:30.474
it's a little ridiculous why I did that

75
00:03:30.474 --> 00:03:32.824
but I did all of that because I care.

76
00:03:32.824 --> 00:03:36.209
And I want you to please remember that...

77
00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.582
That when you get a raise,

78
00:03:37.582 --> 00:03:39.818
the next raise you get, I want you to...

79
00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:40.651
(snaps his fingers)

80
00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:44.604
immediately make auto-withdrawals from your bank.

81
00:03:44.604 --> 00:03:45.437
Okay?

82
00:03:45.437 --> 00:03:47.949
And we're gonna discuss which banks to use

83
00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.990
in Part 2 of the course, here, okay?

84
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.223
That'll be an exercise later.

85
00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:54.664
Okay, let's move onto Question Number 2, now.

86
00:03:54.664 --> 00:03:58.589
Where we will calculate our current housing expense

87
00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.145
as a percent of our pre-tax income.

88
00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:02.655
Okay, and as always,

89
00:04:02.655 --> 00:04:04.608
you can ask me questions if you have those.

90
00:04:04.608 --> 00:04:05.621
We'll go through this.

91
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:10.147
So please pause me and complete Question 2, Parts 1 and 2,

92
00:04:10.147 --> 00:04:12.113
and then, like you've done in the past,

93
00:04:12.113 --> 00:04:13.660
click on that plus symbol, there,

94
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.815
to check your answers and then unpause me.

95
00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:18.884
Okay.

96
00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:22.273
Ideally, we want our housing-related expenses

97
00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:26.891
as a percent of our pre-tax income, to be below 28%.

98
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.724
Okay?

99
00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:29.281
And if it's not under 28%

100
00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:31.593
in your new and improved income statement,

101
00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:33.158
then please try to cut back

102
00:04:33.158 --> 00:04:37.081
on your household-related expenses, okay?

103
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:39.872
Our final question is Number 3,

104
00:04:39.872 --> 00:04:43.684
where we're going to calculate our current debt expense

105
00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:46.561
as a percent of pre-tax income.

106
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:50.311
So please complete Question 3, Parts 1 and 2,

107
00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:53.435
and then again, click on the plus symbol

108
00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:57.602
to check your answers, and then unpause me, thanks.

109
00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:59.996
Okay.

110
00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:01.530
We want our debt expenses,

111
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.486
divided by our pre-tax income,

112
00:05:05.486 --> 00:05:08.642
to be under 36%.

113
00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:12.603
Okay, so we are now done with Exercise Number 4,

114
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:15.357
and as always, if you have any questions,

115
00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.203
please let me know.

116
00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:17.036
Thank you.
