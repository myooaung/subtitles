00:00:00.871 --> 00:00:02.989
<v ->Here are 12 things you need to know</v>

2
00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.291
if you're considering investing in an investment property,

3
00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:10.189
meaning real estate that is not your primary residence.

4
00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.159
Number one, set up a company.

5
00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:14.731
If you're gonna invest in real estate,

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:16.640
then please set up a company,

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.987
like a limited liability company,

8
00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:22.229
or another type of company that will protect you

9
00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:25.080
and insure that you're okay if your company

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.429
gets sued for whatever reason.

11
00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.008
Of course, hire a lawyer and an accountant

12
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:33.320
to help you understand the tax implications

13
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.629
and legal implications when it comes to

14
00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.459
signing real estate investment contracts

15
00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:42.389
as every region in every country is different.

16
00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:45.920
The investment property has expenses,

17
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.589
so of course these expenses should make the amount

18
00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.756
of income tax that you pay on this investment property less.

19
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.389
That's why you kinda set up as an individual company.

20
00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:02.699
I'd love to see you get to a point where most of your income

21
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.339
comes from investments like real estate,

22
00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:10.731
so you can quit if you work for somebody else.

23
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:13.160
Just as a quick side note,

24
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.891
don't invest in time shares, please.

25
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:20.029
If you buy a second home as a vacation house,

26
00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:23.299
it's not a great investment most of the time.

27
00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.278
As these are discretionary real estate investments.

28
00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:29.421
These investments are the first ones to lose

29
00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:33.610
huge amounts of value if the economy turns.

30
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.602
Try to invest in places that you can rent to others

31
00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:39.758
as their primary residence.

32
00:01:39.758 --> 00:01:43.500
If this is the case, then of course, make sure

33
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.289
that it's in a very good school district, if applicable.

34
00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.361
Number two, property management.

35
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:52.460
If you don't have time to collect the rent,

36
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.058
or do maintenance and upkeep, then consider hiring

37
00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:58.711
a landlord or somebody to manage the property.

38
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:00.791
Perhaps you can pay them a certain percentage

39
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:03.391
of the rent that's charged.

40
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:07.359
And separately, anyone know the name of this landlord here?

41
00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.721
Yes, I am dating myself.

42
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:10.652
Okay, moving on.

43
00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:12.919
Number three, making income statement

44
00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.002
for only this investment.

45
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.041
If you plan on investing in real estate,

46
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:20.852
then aside from your own house,

47
00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:23.031
then please consider making an income statement

48
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:25.641
for each investment property.

49
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:29.241
Make it similar to what we did in exercise number two,

50
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:31.332
meaning that revenue is the rental price

51
00:02:31.332 --> 00:02:34.812
paid for the real estate, and the expenses

52
00:02:34.812 --> 00:02:37.292
include all expenses that deal with the rental,

53
00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:41.429
meaning maintenance charges, property tax,

54
00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.791
your mortgage on this residence, if applicable,

55
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:47.500
as well as income taxes that you're gonna pay, et cetera.

56
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.841
Think of every individual piece of real estate you own

57
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:53.508
as having its own separate income statement.

58
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.090
And spend a lot of time on making

59
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.412
this real estate income statement

60
00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:02.900
before buying the investment property, please.

61
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.401
Always be conservative, so before you buy

62
00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:08.092
that investment property, make the income statement,

63
00:03:08.092 --> 00:03:10.732
to make sure that you're actually gonna be

64
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.100
cashflow positive on it,

65
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.932
meaning you're gonna make money on it.

66
00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:15.041
That's number one, number two make sure to

67
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.379
hire a lawyer to look at it, and look at the documents

68
00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.766
(mumbles), and an accountant as well.

69
00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.574
Have your accountant look at your income statement as well

70
00:03:23.574 --> 00:03:24.859
and see if it makes sense.

71
00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.430
Because we are not experts globally

72
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.458
in real estate investing, meaning I'm not,

73
00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:32.539
I don't know if you are, maybe you are,

74
00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.520
that's why it makes sense to get an accountant

75
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.928
take a look at it.

76
00:03:36.928 --> 00:03:40.790
Number four, who is the target market?

77
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.539
Please understand what type of person

78
00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.637
will rent from you if you buy this property.

79
00:03:46.637 --> 00:03:48.518
Understand the demographics.

80
00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:51.075
Is the renter a bachelor and wants to be close

81
00:03:51.075 --> 00:03:53.539
to restaurants and cool bars?

82
00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.907
Is the renter an executive living out of town

83
00:03:56.907 --> 00:04:00.104
and wants to be close to the airport or close to the work,

84
00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:02.144
the city, wherever it might be?

85
00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:05.085
Is the renter a family that would love to be close

86
00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:07.096
to great public schools, et cetera?

87
00:04:07.096 --> 00:04:09.685
Remember, location, location, location.

88
00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:13.792
Number five, DYI, meaning do it yourself, DYI.

89
00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:15.581
Try to do renovations yourself

90
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:18.434
as contractors can bankrupt you.

91
00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:21.424
Do everything yourself, except for anything dangerous

92
00:04:21.424 --> 00:04:24.974
involving electricity or big machines, of course.

93
00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:27.222
Use YouTube for help on how to do

94
00:04:27.222 --> 00:04:30.642
certain renovations like installing carpets

95
00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:33.975
or putting in crown moldings, et cetera.

96
00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:38.833
I've done this, and yeah I've made a bunch of mistakes,

97
00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:41.393
and you might as well, but you know what?

98
00:04:41.393 --> 00:04:42.766
You're gonna save yourself so much money

99
00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:44.923
and it feels so good doing it yourself too.

100
00:04:44.923 --> 00:04:47.104
Make it a family event too, if you can.

101
00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:49.153
If you want to, as a way to kind of teach the kids

102
00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:50.403
about business.

103
00:04:51.763 --> 00:04:54.784
I renovated my attic, and I turned it into

104
00:04:54.784 --> 00:04:56.451
a man cave recently.

105
00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:01.541
I had no idea what I was doing.

106
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:03.841
But I watched a lot of YouTube videos,

107
00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:07.357
and I asked the sales reps at my local hardware stores,

108
00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:09.578
called Home Depot and Lowe's.

109
00:05:09.578 --> 00:05:11.373
I asked these sales reps, you know,

110
00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:13.533
just for a lot of general instructions.

111
00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:16.533
The renovations cost me very little.

112
00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.053
I put in my own, actually, I'll show you the equipment,

113
00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:20.893
I brought it here.

114
00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:24.310
I put in my own carpets using this thing.

115
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:29.419
It's pretty cool, it actually melts the carpet together

116
00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.351
if you use more than one piece of carpet at a time.

117
00:05:33.351 --> 00:05:35.591
That's actually how they, that's how they glue together

118
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:37.842
carpet on the ground, I didn't know that,

119
00:05:37.842 --> 00:05:42.063
but you put a (mumbles) under it and melt it, whatever.

120
00:05:42.063 --> 00:05:44.563
I know enough to be dangerous.

121
00:05:46.983 --> 00:05:49.983
I also used, I used this thing here,

122
00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:55.040
to make sure that the wall and the floorboards

123
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.207
look like they were in sync and there's no gap between them.

124
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.509
I think it's called a caulking device

125
00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:03.938
or something like that, whatever.

126
00:06:03.938 --> 00:06:08.105
I bought cheap supplies from IKEA to hide my storage.

127
00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.277
That's just this one here, you see how I pull this down

128
00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:15.719
right here, these cost next to nothing from IKEA.

129
00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.837
I know it looks pretty cheap but whatever.

130
00:06:17.837 --> 00:06:21.587
I made my own door, to the rest of the attic.

131
00:06:22.552 --> 00:06:24.822
I used some leftover wood I had.

132
00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:27.364
I added these hooks here to the ceiling

133
00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:30.543
so I can enclose myself in drapes.

134
00:06:30.543 --> 00:06:33.244
When I'm just recording, just audio only,

135
00:06:33.244 --> 00:06:35.695
like all the Excel exercises you see in this course

136
00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:37.884
so I wouldn't get echoes.

137
00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:41.253
I know it's really far from perfect,

138
00:06:41.253 --> 00:06:43.743
but I saved a lot of money.

139
00:06:43.743 --> 00:06:47.576
For the floorboards, I got one of these things

140
00:06:48.873 --> 00:06:52.804
which can actually help you to cut in different angles

141
00:06:52.804 --> 00:06:54.804
and put these things on.

142
00:06:56.432 --> 00:06:59.152
Floorboards, I think they're called.

143
00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.994
It was a lot of fun, kids had a good time doing it as well,

144
00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:04.874
and we saved a lot of money too.

145
00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:08.202
Far from perfect but it was fun.

146
00:07:08.202 --> 00:07:12.369
And also, anybody know what seat this is from, here?

147
00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:16.844
I used to go to my dad, to games with my dad,

148
00:07:16.844 --> 00:07:18.666
and this was a seat from that stadium

149
00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:19.674
which no longer exist.

150
00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:21.757
Number six, restrictions.

151
00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.404
Are there zoning issues?

152
00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:27.194
Meaning, can you rent this to a business

153
00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:30.863
or just to people that want to live in it?

154
00:07:30.863 --> 00:07:33.943
Also, are there any Airbnb restrictions?

155
00:07:33.943 --> 00:07:37.954
Some regions have this stupid restrictions.

156
00:07:37.954 --> 00:07:41.153
And if it's an apartment, is it a co-op or a condo,

157
00:07:41.153 --> 00:07:43.876
meaning, are you allowed to rent it out?

158
00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:46.764
Just find out if there's any really stupid condo laws

159
00:07:46.764 --> 00:07:49.746
pertaining just to the building that you're considering

160
00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:52.426
buying in, like no kids, or pets, or whatever it is,

161
00:07:52.426 --> 00:07:53.759
stuff like that.

162
00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:58.306
Number seven, comparable recent sales.

163
00:07:58.306 --> 00:08:00.636
The value of any investment you make,

164
00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:03.476
is all based on recent sales of similar companies,

165
00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:05.876
whether it's stocks, bonds that are high quality,

166
00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:06.956
commodities, that sort of things.

167
00:08:06.956 --> 00:08:08.466
Comparable recent sales.

168
00:08:08.466 --> 00:08:12.273
What of houses or apartment similar to this one

169
00:08:12.273 --> 00:08:13.773
sold for recently?

170
00:08:14.715 --> 00:08:17.632
You don't wanna overpay, obviously.

171
00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:20.984
Number eight, when you're talking to your accountant,

172
00:08:20.984 --> 00:08:23.435
ask your accountant if there's any tax issues

173
00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:25.935
or tax benefits to doing this.

174
00:08:27.793 --> 00:08:30.381
Talk to your accountant first before buying,

175
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:34.381
as only a house you might live in gets you tax breaks,

176
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:37.602
but only a second house might not.

177
00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:41.970
Make sure you hire the right real estate expert lawyer

178
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.661
to look at the house or the apartments.

179
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:49.099
There could be asbestos issues, if it's an older building.

180
00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:52.322
There could be awful plumbing or insects, et cetera.

181
00:08:52.322 --> 00:08:55.282
Just don't sign anything without your lawyer first

182
00:08:55.282 --> 00:08:57.032
reviewing every word.

183
00:08:58.852 --> 00:09:01.826
If you do sign something, make sure,

184
00:09:01.826 --> 00:09:05.993
make sure it says this deal is subject to inspection.

185
00:09:08.822 --> 00:09:10.811
I've done this before, you can bring your mobile phone

186
00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:14.043
and your mobile phone charger, and plug them

187
00:09:14.043 --> 00:09:17.291
into the outlets to see if all the plugs

188
00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:19.862
are getting electricity, that sort of thing.

189
00:09:19.862 --> 00:09:22.340
Also if you can pull up the carpets,

190
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.183
as sometimes the floors might look better,

191
00:09:26.183 --> 00:09:27.758
or it'd be done another carpets,

192
00:09:27.758 --> 00:09:31.591
which might actually enhance the rental price.

193
00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:36.827
Number 10, never never never buy the first place you see

194
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:38.408
if you're new to this place.

195
00:09:38.408 --> 00:09:39.288
I'm gonna say it again.

196
00:09:39.288 --> 00:09:42.316
Never buy the first place you see if you're new to this.

197
00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:43.830
Your first investment in real estate

198
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.110
should be a very small investment,

199
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.332
like a small apartment.

200
00:09:48.332 --> 00:09:50.309
So you can understand the issues

201
00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:53.430
and upside too when investing in real estate.

202
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.670
In many countries there are really entertaining

203
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.658
television shows that show someone buying a place

204
00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:02.961
and renting it out or fixing it up a bit.

205
00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:06.750
Watch those shows as you can get great ideas

206
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.188
on what issues to watch out for when investing

207
00:10:10.188 --> 00:10:11.438
in real estate.

208
00:10:12.852 --> 00:10:15.569
All the star has got to be aligned for you,

209
00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:18.900
for your first real estate investment property.

210
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.892
The reason I say that is because real estate

211
00:10:20.892 --> 00:10:24.571
can be highly illiquid, meaning it can take a long time

212
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:26.452
to sell real estate.

213
00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:28.697
Illiquid investments tend to own us

214
00:10:28.697 --> 00:10:31.420
in tough economic environments rather than

215
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.932
the other way around.

216
00:10:33.932 --> 00:10:38.099
Number 11, finding cheap real estate via foreclosures.

217
00:10:39.292 --> 00:10:41.230
You can go to foreclosures or auctions

218
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.732
as you could get a bargain when you have

219
00:10:44.732 --> 00:10:46.401
a motivated seller.

220
00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:48.292
My next door neighbor, they bought their house

221
00:10:48.292 --> 00:10:50.330
where I live now for next to nothing

222
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.340
because they bought it in a foreclosure.

223
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.740
So just search online for a foreclosures where you live.

224
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.452
Number 12, do your own research.

225
00:10:58.452 --> 00:11:01.090
I've stressed this a few times at least in this course.

226
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.172
Please do your own research as real estate brokers

227
00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:07.176
are very biased, kinda like the media,

228
00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:10.522
they wanna get their commissions to state the obvious.

229
00:11:10.522 --> 00:11:13.605
Lastly, if you're selling your place,

230
00:11:15.432 --> 00:11:18.424
staging it is actually a good investment,

231
00:11:18.424 --> 00:11:21.352
meaning renting furniture and having each room

232
00:11:21.352 --> 00:11:24.519
have a minimalist look and feel to it.

233
00:11:25.615 --> 00:11:29.782
The return on minor landscaping is actually very high.

234
00:11:32.135 --> 00:11:34.883
The rule of thumb here is that for every dollar you spent

235
00:11:34.883 --> 00:11:39.050
on a tree, the return on investment is 10 times higher

236
00:11:39.937 --> 00:11:43.551
than the cost of that tree in just a couple of years.

237
00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:46.084
It's good to kind of plan advanced to,

238
00:11:46.084 --> 00:11:48.025
let's say you own your own place and you wanna sell it

239
00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:49.293
two or three years down the road.

240
00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:50.975
Plant those trees now.

241
00:11:50.975 --> 00:11:53.384
And as always, try to do everything yourself

242
00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:56.593
which is safe, because it's a lot of fun to do

243
00:11:56.593 --> 00:11:59.553
and it's good money lesson for the family

244
00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:01.392
if you have kids, and you'll save a lot of money

245
00:12:01.392 --> 00:12:03.559
doing it yourself as well.
