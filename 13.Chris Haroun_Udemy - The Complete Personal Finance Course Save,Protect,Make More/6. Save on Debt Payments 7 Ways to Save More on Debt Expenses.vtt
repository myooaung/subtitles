00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.041
<v ->We will discuss loans and mortgages</v>

2
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.470
and credit cards later in the course,

3
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.152
but for now let's talk about

4
00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:21.111
six tips to lower your debt expenses.

5
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:23.363
Debt expense tip number one,

6
00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:26.264
cancel your credit cards every year tip.

7
00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:28.557
This one's been out there, but this is something I do.

8
00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:31.688
There's so many expenses on your credit cards

9
00:00:31.688 --> 00:00:34.942
that are recurring that we sometimes forget to cancel

10
00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:36.995
or we didn't read the fine print

11
00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.339
and we're being billed monthly or even annually

12
00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.625
from items like Xbox Gold, or magazines,

13
00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.227
or internet music services, et cetera.

14
00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:48.827
These companies make it so hard to cancel these items.

15
00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:50.899
It's so hard to find the phone number

16
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.717
just to call them and cancel the payments.

17
00:00:53.717 --> 00:00:56.437
So, the best way to stop them from charging you

18
00:00:56.437 --> 00:01:00.291
is to cancel your credit card annually.

19
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:03.491
I'm not telling you to do anything unethical here.

20
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:07.981
Try to stop those companies from billing you if you can,

21
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:10.320
and also when you cancel your credit card,

22
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.341
if there's no way that you can find

23
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:14.499
a way to cancel these things, then obviously

24
00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.469
they can't keep charging you when you cancel that card.

25
00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.960
Take a close look at your credit card bill because

26
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.771
there's quite often very, very small charges that we ignore,

27
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.091
but they add up over time.

28
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:29.349
Okay, debt expense number two,

29
00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.720
lower your interest charges by asking

30
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.970
at least one time per year for a break.

31
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:38.198
If interest rates drop,

32
00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:41.171
then please call your debt holders immediately

33
00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:43.810
and see if you can refinance your loans

34
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.979
or mortgages by asking for lower rates.

35
00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.298
And we're gonna cover mortgages later in the course here.

36
00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:52.881
(upbeat music)

37
00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:36.037
As for discounts, the worst thing they're gonna say

38
00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:38.339
on the phone to you is no.

39
00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.807
But you have to at least try because

40
00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:43.277
most people don't bother trying to do this,

41
00:02:43.277 --> 00:02:47.542
and a company is only as good as its customer service.

42
00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.575
I really believe that, so ask more often, please.

43
00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:52.714
Debt expenses tip number 3,

44
00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.546
pay you credit card debts first tip.

45
00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:57.095
Credit cards are evil,

46
00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:59.615
many of them charge close to 20% annually,

47
00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:02.685
which is about twice as high than the average

48
00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:06.637
historical return you can get investing in stocks.

49
00:03:06.637 --> 00:03:09.666
So obviously, pay these credit cards first,

50
00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:13.066
and if you cannot, then please make the minimum payment

51
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.664
so that your credit rating does not get destroyed.

52
00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:18.277
And we're gonna talk a lot about credit ratings

53
00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:22.773
and how to improve your credit rating later in the course.

54
00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:25.245
Debt expense tip number four,

55
00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:28.986
read, read, read all statements tip.

56
00:03:28.986 --> 00:03:32.455
Please read every line item on all of your bills,

57
00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:35.074
and every line item on all of your account statements,

58
00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:37.954
as mistakes are made all the time.

59
00:03:37.954 --> 00:03:40.380
It's kinda like when you go out to dinner as well,

60
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.285
if you look closely every now and then you'll notice

61
00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.605
you got charged for an extra drink, whatever it is.

62
00:03:44.605 --> 00:03:46.215
Just be a pain in the neck please,

63
00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:49.703
because I care and I want you to save money.

64
00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:51.463
So, call your credit card company

65
00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:53.623
if you see a mistake on your statement,

66
00:03:53.623 --> 00:03:55.554
as this is why you pay them

67
00:03:55.554 --> 00:03:57.804
crazy high interest rates anyway,

68
00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:01.095
and you're a customer, the customer is always right.

69
00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:04.583
It will almost always eliminate incorrect charges

70
00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:08.063
if you complain, all you gotta do is call.

71
00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:10.142
Debt expenses tip number five,

72
00:04:10.142 --> 00:04:13.775
tracking expenses and budgeting tip.

73
00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:17.914
If you track your expenses, you will spend much less.

74
00:04:17.914 --> 00:04:19.935
Later in the course we're gonna create

75
00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:22.474
a budget for you and when you budget,

76
00:04:22.474 --> 00:04:25.575
you think of each item like it's an allowance.

77
00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:28.375
For example, if you budget $10 per month

78
00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:31.165
for lunch at a fast food restaurant,

79
00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:35.081
then that is all you can spend at that fast food restaurant.

80
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:36.845
And this'll make much more sense

81
00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:38.906
to you later on in the course.

82
00:04:38.906 --> 00:04:41.425
Debt expense tip number six,

83
00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:45.255
please understand what hurts your credit score tip.

84
00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:48.135
Please look at your credit score annually

85
00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:50.894
and do whatever you can to improve it.

86
00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:53.306
You can also call credit agencies

87
00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:56.175
and ask them how to improve your credit score.

88
00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:58.197
And we're gonna cover your credit score

89
00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:01.563
in a lot of detail later in the course.

90
00:05:01.563 --> 00:05:04.085
Debt expenses tip number seven,

91
00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:05.445
you don't need to have more

92
00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:07.866
than two or three credit cards tip.

93
00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:10.677
Please minimize the number of credit cards that you have

94
00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:14.010
and understand what the annual fees are,

95
00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:17.405
and only use credit cards that will help you

96
00:05:17.405 --> 00:05:19.803
get points to save on travel, et cetera,

97
00:05:19.803 --> 00:05:23.970
and cancel all store-based credit cards if you can, please.

98
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:28.201
These fees can add up over time

99
00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:29.865
over a number of different credit cards

100
00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:32.745
that you might forget you actually have.

101
00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:35.225
Sometimes you get these teaser rates,

102
00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:37.604
they seduce you to sign up for a credit card

103
00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.665
because there's not fee, no annual fee,

104
00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:42.305
and then in year two there's a massive annual fee.

105
00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:45.084
So just please make sure that you read the fine print.

106
00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:47.884
If you don't understand then call the credit card company

107
00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:51.444
and ask them to explain it to you in plain english.

108
00:05:51.444 --> 00:05:54.095
I have had to do this a number of times because

109
00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:58.262
these contracts you get involved with are quite complex.
