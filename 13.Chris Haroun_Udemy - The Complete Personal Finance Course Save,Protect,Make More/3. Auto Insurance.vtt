<v ->Most countries, states, and provinces</v>

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:07.189
have mandatory auto insurance laws.

3
00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.176
Of course, I think you should get it as one accident

4
00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.149
can bankrupt you, even if it wasn't your fault.

5
00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.229
If you rent a car, please check to see

6
00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.909
if your credit card already offers

7
00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:20.438
free rental car insurance.

8
00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:21.691
Quite often they do.

9
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.091
Also, ask the auto insurance company

10
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:29.175
if your insurance can be reduced, if you add something

11
00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:31.992
to you car, like a Mobileye device

12
00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:33.672
that looks like this.

13
00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:36.923
Mobileye, I think, is now owned by Intel.

14
00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:40.136
And, most people spend about $100 per month

15
00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:42.184
for auto insurance, which is really expensive,

16
00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:43.724
but it's worth it.

17
00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:45.797
You know, one small accident can cause

18
00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:47.707
your insurance costs to go up a lot too.

19
00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:49.046
So, just be careful.

20
00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:53.517
Separately, I use this auto feature on my iPhone

21
00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:55.776
which makes a lot of sense to me, okay?

22
00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:59.359
I also carry a, let me see if I can get it.

23
00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.906
I also carry this cable in my car to charge my phone

24
00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.357
so that I'm never tempted to use the phone when I'm driving.

25
00:01:10.357 --> 00:01:13.987
And, when my kids start, God they grow fast.

26
00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:16.407
But, when my kids start driving, I'm gonna have them

27
00:01:16.407 --> 00:01:19.176
put their mobile phones in the trunk.

28
00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:20.533
Hopefully they'll listen.

29
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:25.222
And, don't buy a car without first understanding

30
00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:26.413
the insurance price.

31
00:01:26.413 --> 00:01:28.514
And, shop around a lot, please, for the best

32
00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:30.172
auto insurance coverage.

33
00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:32.661
You know, please ask at least five different places

34
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:35.452
before buying auto insurance similar to what we did

35
00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:38.016
in exercise 15 with the banks.

36
00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:40.944
A lot of people buy pets and cars without understanding

37
00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:43.527
how much it costs to have them.

38
00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:47.304
And, so here's a great website for calculating

39
00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:50.114
the price of a car before you buy it,

40
00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:54.176
as some expensive cars have high insurance.

41
00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:57.296
And, the website here is called Kelly Blue Book.

42
00:01:57.296 --> 00:02:00.805
Another one I've got here is called truecar.com.

43
00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:04.972
And, there's also edmunds.com, E-D-M-U-N-D-S.com.

44
00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:08.096
And sometimes you can actually get

45
00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:11.649
lower auto insurance prices if you take

46
00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.254
a safe drivers course.

47
00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:17.671
Or you buy anti-theft equipment for your car

48
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.424
or if you don't use your car that often.

49
00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:22.683
Just ask your auto insurance company

50
00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:25.945
what you can do to lower your auto insurance costs.
