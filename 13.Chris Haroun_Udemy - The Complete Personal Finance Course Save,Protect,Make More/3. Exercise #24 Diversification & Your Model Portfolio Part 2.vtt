00:00:01.097 --> 00:00:04.147
<v ->Okay, now, I went here, and I categorized</v>

2
00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:05.774
as More-Risky, Less-Risky,

3
00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:10.361
and let's say that we're easily within my constraints here

4
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:14.098
'cause I got 65% More-Risky and 35% Less-Risky,

5
00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:14.931
but watch this.

6
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.405
If I change this one here, and sometimes you're gonna,

7
00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.358
see how sometimes it doesn't work?

8
00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:21.191
Right?

9
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:22.966
Usually, you can select.

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.467
Sometimes, after you select, it won't let you,

11
00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:28.502
but if I just copy that and then paste that below, see,

12
00:00:28.502 --> 00:00:32.669
and now it says, my More-Risky exposure is 70%

13
00:00:33.654 --> 00:00:36.006
versus the limit of 65, so I'm above that.

14
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.943
So I'm gonna Control + Z that, okay.

15
00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:40.530
Okay, but anyway, you just click there,

16
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.662
and you should be able to select the entry.

17
00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:46.667
If it doesn't let you, which is highly unusual,

18
00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.404
then just copy and paste, but usually, it's like this.

19
00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:51.100
You click there, and it lets you do it.

20
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.774
Okay, great.

21
00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:54.195
Sometimes after you've already selected it,

22
00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:55.494
it's a little finicky.

23
00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:57.442
It's fine, okay, great.

24
00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:01.609
Okay, you can enter additional comments here, and that's it.

25
00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.726
We're done with, I'm done showing you the example data here.

26
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:12.426
But one more thing I wanna show you

27
00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:15.340
is if we go here to Dashboard Summary,

28
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.184
because I've entered in stock information now

29
00:01:18.184 --> 00:01:20.983
in Position Holdings, this has now

30
00:01:20.983 --> 00:01:22.526
been updated automatically.

31
00:01:22.526 --> 00:01:23.359
See that?

32
00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.192
Isn't that cool?

33
00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:25.974
And these are all the tickers, right,

34
00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:28.579
and I think I've got 20 of them here, okay.

35
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.985
And you can mouse over, and sometimes it gives you

36
00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:33.648
more information if you want,

37
00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:35.311
but you should remember all the tickers.

38
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.653
If you're not sure which ones are which,

39
00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:40.098
just go directly to the Portfolio here,

40
00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:41.641
and you'll be able to decipher which one's which.

41
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:46.355
So, for example, SPYG, if I can't remember what that is,

42
00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:48.111
I'll just click here, and I'll look here.

43
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:52.278
SPYG, and we can see it's a SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P Growth ETF.

44
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.242
Okay.

45
00:01:58.242 --> 00:02:00.633
Oh, one more thing I want to show you.

46
00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:03.724
Now, I'm gonna go change our currency, okay.

47
00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:07.474
So, in US dollars, see that, we have $99,996.

48
00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:10.865
Remember, I lost $4 today.

49
00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:14.282
So right here is the total in US dollars.

50
00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:18.272
Now, what I can also do is I can check

51
00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:22.439
to see what the value of this Portfolio is in my currency.

52
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.597
Okay, so I don't know what country you're watching

53
00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:28.448
this from, but you click here, or Setting, same thing,

54
00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.035
and let's say we change our country,

55
00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:31.131
and I'm gonna make a random one.

56
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:32.339
Here we go, boom.

57
00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:33.922
All right, Morocco.

58
00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:36.250
And then, I'm gonna go here, and I'm gonna go

59
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.604
down to Morocco, show you how ignorant I am,

60
00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:41.865
dirham, okay, I didn't know

61
00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:42.921
that was the name of the currency, sorry.

62
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:44.993
That's the value there when I made this course

63
00:02:44.993 --> 00:02:48.488
of the exchange rate, and if you click here,

64
00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:51.613
you can get a more recent exchange rate.

65
00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:52.992
See how exchange rate's already changed

66
00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:54.049
since I created this?

67
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.267
Okay, great.

68
00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:57.540
So let's go to our Portfolio page here to see

69
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.499
what the (mumbles) value is in Moroccan currency,

70
00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:02.517
and there it is.

71
00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:05.441
So the value, and that makes sense because it's close

72
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.368
to a nine to 10 to one ratio to US dollar.

73
00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:12.535
That's the value of our Portfolio in the Moroccan currency.

74
00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:18.698
Again, I want to stress that these 10 diversification rules

75
00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.206
that I'm giving you are general guidelines,

76
00:03:21.206 --> 00:03:23.523
and I recommend following many

77
00:03:23.523 --> 00:03:26.077
of these rules if you want to.

78
00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:27.866
Okay, so thank you very much.

79
00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:29.805
Again, if you have questions, let me know,

80
00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:32.740
and we're almost done with the course.
