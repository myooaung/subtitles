<v ->If you work for a company or a charity</v>

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.186
or a government agency, please ask human resources

3
00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:10.290
or your boss what tax benefits are offered

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.933
by your employer, okay?

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.794
And there might be other incredible tax savings available

6
00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:17.464
to you offered by your employer,

7
00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:21.005
like healthcare tax savings plans,

8
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.482
retirements plans, we talked about, daycare plans,

9
00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:28.226
education plan, veteran plans if you're a veteran,

10
00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:30.328
and much more, okay?

11
00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:33.453
There's also a benefit that some countries have

12
00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:35.746
and some companies have,

13
00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:39.778
which is called a flexible savings account or FSA,

14
00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:42.936
flexible savings account, which actually lets you save

15
00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:46.978
and spend pretax money on your healthcare, okay?

16
00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:51.480
If you put money into these tax exempt plans,

17
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.436
then the amounts of the taxes you pay decreases a lot.

18
00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:58.562
And we know the power of compound interest over time

19
00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:01.517
from what we did in exercise number one.

20
00:01:01.517 --> 00:01:05.933
And some employers even have insurance plans for you,

21
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.301
health insurance, life insurance, that sort of thing.

22
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.021
So just take advantage of as many of these plans

23
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:14.722
as possible, not just because they can save you money,

24
00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:19.275
but because you're gonna get an unbelievable pretax benefit

25
00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:20.821
from it, as well.

26
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:22.637
And if applicable, as your supervisor

27
00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:24.792
or ask human resources if any

28
00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:27.458
of the aforementioned tax benefit programs

29
00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:29.089
we just talked about exist,

30
00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.211
and if so, please take advantage

31
00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:34.596
as some of these plans are actually free money.
