00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:02.323
<v ->Using the World Bank's website,</v>

2
00:00:02.323 --> 00:00:03.962
let's take a look at interest rates

3
00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:06.779
in different parts of the world.

4
00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.819
We will look at what is called the real interest rates,

5
00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:14.323
which accounts for prices that are high or low,

6
00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:17.261
as opposed to just regular interest rates,

7
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:19.614
called nominal interest,

8
00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:23.741
which does not account for changes in prices.

9
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:27.064
So, here you can see the interest rate by country.

10
00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:29.489
And this is incredibly important

11
00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.296
when considering investing in the bonds or stocks

12
00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:35.165
of a country that has a lot of debt.

13
00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:37.245
And we can see that the interest rates are

14
00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.483
in the low single digits in North America,

15
00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:42.122
but in other countries, it can be well

16
00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:43.624
into the double digits,

17
00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:46.504
partially because of inflation.

18
00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:48.626
Let's talk about why interest rates are high

19
00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:50.876
in some parts of the world.

20
00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.843
It's primarily because high prices

21
00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:58.010
means inflation that governments are trying to control.

22
00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:00.377
Okay, bear with me here.

23
00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:01.635
This will make sense in a sec.

24
00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:04.520
So, high prices occur in many places

25
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.976
for different reasons, including very high

26
00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:11.037
demand for products, geopolitical reasons

27
00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:13.677
impacting the price of oil,

28
00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:17.400
or other economic mismanagement policies.

29
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.896
So a demand is rising for products in a country.

30
00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:23.896
And the supply of those products

31
00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:26.872
does not increase as much as demand does.

32
00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:28.957
Then prices increase.

33
00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:32.776
And the same can be said if demand is unchanged,

34
00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:35.358
but the supply drops a lot.

35
00:01:35.358 --> 00:01:36.797
Then the price goes up.

36
00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.280
And I'll give you examples.

37
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.160
So, one example is in the 1970s.

38
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.320
On a few occasions, and partially due

39
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.496
to geopolitical reasons,

40
00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:48.093
the amount of oil that many countries

41
00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:50.676
could access to declined a lot.

42
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.613
And as a result, gas prices increased big time

43
00:01:55.613 --> 00:01:57.870
in many countries.

44
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.075
See, when prices increase it's called inflation.

45
00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:03.075
And when prices increase

46
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:06.936
and GDP growth slows a lot,

47
00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:09.152
or even contracts, meaning goes down,

48
00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:11.635
this is called stagflation.

49
00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:15.875
And in general, how can we stop prices from rising?

50
00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.815
Well, you can either increase the supply

51
00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.959
of those products or decrease the demand, okay?

52
00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.973
And so, since it's hard for governments

53
00:02:24.973 --> 00:02:28.893
to figure out how to increase the supply of stuff we buy,

54
00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:33.060
then they have to resort to decreasing consumer demand.

55
00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:35.939
So, how do they do this?

56
00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.477
How do governments decrease our demand

57
00:02:38.477 --> 00:02:41.075
for products that we want to buy?

58
00:02:41.075 --> 00:02:42.360
Well, governments do this by making

59
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.576
the money supply lower, okay?

60
00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:50.360
Now, when there's less money out there in circulation,

61
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.579
then the price of money goes up a lot, okay?

62
00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.576
How does this work?

63
00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:58.200
Well, let me discuss an example first.

64
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.372
And this is something that resonates closely.

65
00:03:02.372 --> 00:03:04.456
My kids love this product.

66
00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:08.456
Okay so, this here, this is the Nintendo Switch.

67
00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:10.696
And when it first came out,

68
00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:13.578
you couldn't find it anywhere.

69
00:03:13.578 --> 00:03:17.859
It was, demand was red hot and supply was limited.

70
00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.517
As a result, many people bought

71
00:03:19.517 --> 00:03:22.840
this product on eBay for way, way more

72
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.157
than the price this product was supposed to be for.

73
00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:28.397
Then eventually, Nintendo was able to produce

74
00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:31.219
a lot more of these products,

75
00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.969
and supply caught up with demand.

76
00:03:34.856 --> 00:03:39.516
As a result, the price finally decreased for this product.

77
00:03:39.516 --> 00:03:42.760
Now, if the CEO of Nintendo decided

78
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.320
to make fewer of these units,

79
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.699
and demand stayed constant, meaning unchanged,

80
00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.576
then of course the price would increase

81
00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:51.493
a lot for this product.

82
00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.299
So, who is the CEO in charge

83
00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.882
of a country's supply of money?

84
00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:02.877
Well, the CEO in charge of a country's supply of money,

85
00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:04.840
so to speak, in the United States,

86
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.007
this person is called the Federal Reserve chairperson, okay?

87
00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:11.960
And we call it the Fed.

88
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.974
And in other countries, the person in charge

89
00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:16.276
of changing the supply of money

90
00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:19.619
is called the governor or the bank of that country,

91
00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:21.640
or the minister of finance,

92
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.006
or in the case of Europe,

93
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:25.480
the European Central Bank, which is called the ECB,

94
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.578
European Central Bank.

95
00:04:27.578 --> 00:04:30.216
So, how do all these people that are

96
00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:35.096
in charge of money raise or lower interest rates?

97
00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:36.456
Well, they do this by increasing

98
00:04:36.456 --> 00:04:39.459
or decreasing the money supply.

99
00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:43.616
Quite often, through buying or selling bonds.

100
00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.019
As a quick side note.

101
00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:49.686
If you or me were to get a loan from a bank,

102
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.717
we would pay interest on that loan

103
00:04:54.717 --> 00:04:56.278
until we had to pay it back to the bank.

104
00:04:56.278 --> 00:04:59.416
When governments get loans from banks,

105
00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:00.932
it's not called a loan.

106
00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:02.654
It's called a bond.

107
00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:05.757
And the government issues a bond,

108
00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:08.557
and then they pay whoever owns the bond interest,

109
00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:10.612
kind of like a loan.

110
00:05:10.612 --> 00:05:13.416
So, if the government of a country

111
00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:17.117
buys those bonds back from the larger banks

112
00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:20.616
in their country, then what happens is

113
00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:23.219
the banks get more money.

114
00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.477
More money is put, this is fake cash.

115
00:05:26.477 --> 00:05:30.144
So what happens is the banks get more money.

116
00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:35.360
Okay so, the banks now have more money out there.

117
00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:39.400
And in return, the government gets the bond back.

118
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.136
So if the government buys a bond from a bank,

119
00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:45.414
the banks give that bond back to the government

120
00:05:45.414 --> 00:05:49.331
and the government gives the banks money.

121
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:52.195
Okay so, I'll give you an example.

122
00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:54.472
This here is a bond.

123
00:05:54.472 --> 00:05:58.157
And this was issued by the city of Los Angeles.

124
00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:00.579
And so, if a lot of banks own these bonds,

125
00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:01.960
and then the government said,

126
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.800
hey, I want to buy that bond back for a little bit

127
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.096
more than what you paid,

128
00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:06.957
the government buys the bond back,

129
00:06:06.957 --> 00:06:10.053
the bank gives the bond back to the government,

130
00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:12.760
in this case, the government or city of Los Angeles,

131
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.517
and then in return, because the government

132
00:06:15.517 --> 00:06:17.117
bought this from the banks,

133
00:06:17.117 --> 00:06:19.416
the banks will get cash.

134
00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:21.336
So there's more cash, fake cash,

135
00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:23.379
there's more cash out there.

136
00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:24.957
More cash out there.

137
00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:28.776
And more money in supply basically means that

138
00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:31.796
the banks are going to lend out more money

139
00:06:31.796 --> 00:06:33.014
because they have more money,

140
00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:35.640
and so, what happens is, let me just put

141
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.936
this fake money down.

142
00:06:36.936 --> 00:06:38.579
Damn, it looks real though.

143
00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:42.477
What happens is more money supply in circulation

144
00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:45.336
means that prices go down for money

145
00:06:45.336 --> 00:06:48.077
as there's more money to go around,

146
00:06:48.077 --> 00:06:49.517
kind of like the Nintendo thing.

147
00:06:49.517 --> 00:06:51.976
So, this means if interest rates,

148
00:06:51.976 --> 00:06:53.815
this means that interest rates go down

149
00:06:53.815 --> 00:06:56.760
when the money supply has increased, okay?

150
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.974
Great.

151
00:06:57.974 --> 00:07:00.414
So, and interest rates are also called

152
00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:02.216
the discount rates.

153
00:07:02.216 --> 00:07:03.718
That's just another word for interest rates,

154
00:07:03.718 --> 00:07:07.236
discount rates, or LIBOR in Europe,

155
00:07:07.236 --> 00:07:09.576
which stands for, LIBOR stands for

156
00:07:09.576 --> 00:07:11.976
London Interbank Offer Rate.

157
00:07:11.976 --> 00:07:16.616
Okay, which is based on five currencies in Europe.

158
00:07:16.616 --> 00:07:18.600
They got the yen, US dollar, the euro,

159
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.754
the British pound, and the Swiss franc, for now.

160
00:07:21.754 --> 00:07:24.658
Okay, the whole process of changing

161
00:07:24.658 --> 00:07:26.579
the amount of money out there

162
00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.731
is called QE, or quantitative easing.

163
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:32.257
And it just means it gets easier to get money

164
00:07:32.257 --> 00:07:35.174
as the quantity of money increases.

165
00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:39.736
If the quantity of these units increases a lot,

166
00:07:39.736 --> 00:07:42.317
then the price goes down.

167
00:07:42.317 --> 00:07:43.576
Same thing with money.

168
00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.837
If there's a lot more money in society out there,

169
00:07:45.837 --> 00:07:49.197
then the demand for, or the price of money goes down

170
00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:50.579
because there's just tons of it.

171
00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.459
And the price of money is done through interest rates.

172
00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:54.819
Just think of it that way, okay?

173
00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:56.637
Price of money equals interest rates.

174
00:07:56.637 --> 00:07:58.339
So when you buy a product from the store,

175
00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.160
the source sells it to you at their retail value,

176
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.880
which is higher than what they bought the product for

177
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.459
when they paid wholesale.

178
00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:08.920
And this is how it works with banks.

179
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.379
Banks buy money, they get money basically

180
00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.296
from the governments at a certain interest rate,

181
00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:16.918
which is the price, and then the banks

182
00:08:16.918 --> 00:08:19.194
make money by lending it out at

183
00:08:19.194 --> 00:08:21.757
a little bit higher interest rate,

184
00:08:21.757 --> 00:08:24.216
in order to make a profit.

185
00:08:24.216 --> 00:08:26.777
And the opposite thing occurred,

186
00:08:26.777 --> 00:08:29.517
meaning the government sold a lot of bonds

187
00:08:29.517 --> 00:08:30.680
to get banks in their country

188
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.957
to give them money back.

189
00:08:32.957 --> 00:08:36.216
So, if the government basically said,

190
00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:37.997
hey, I got a bond.

191
00:08:37.997 --> 00:08:39.495
Anybody want to buy a bond?

192
00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:40.680
And the banks are like, I don't really know.

193
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.238
The government's like, well, I'll give

194
00:08:42.238 --> 00:08:43.277
you good interest rate.

195
00:08:43.277 --> 00:08:45.016
So, what happens is, sorry, it's upside down,

196
00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:47.320
the banks buy this bond

197
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.677
and the government gets the money from the banks.

198
00:08:51.677 --> 00:08:52.760
So now there's less money out there

199
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.000
for the banks to lend.

200
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.739
So interest rates go up.

201
00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:57.837
Okay, it makes sense?

202
00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:59.336
Okay great, and if you have questions about this,

203
00:08:59.336 --> 00:09:01.379
please let me know.

204
00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:02.296
Okay, cool.

205
00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:05.079
Therefore, if there's less money now

206
00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:07.219
that the banks can lend to us all,

207
00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:09.379
then demand for money increases

208
00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:11.699
relative to the lower supply of money.

209
00:09:11.699 --> 00:09:13.720
And interest rates rise.

210
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.157
Okay, so it's all about supply and demand.

211
00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:19.619
The government changes the supply of money

212
00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:20.957
that the banks have access to,

213
00:09:20.957 --> 00:09:22.579
which changes the price of money,

214
00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:25.480
meaning it changes the interest rate of money.

215
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.063
And this process is called monetary policy,

216
00:09:30.053 --> 00:09:32.886
which is a country's money policy.

217
00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:36.854
And this is crucial for all investors

218
00:09:36.854 --> 00:09:39.800
globally to understand for so many reasons.

219
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.176
One of which is the fact that

220
00:09:41.176 --> 00:09:44.077
investors must figure out or have

221
00:09:44.077 --> 00:09:47.517
a general sense for how much money

222
00:09:47.517 --> 00:09:49.779
companies can make in the future,

223
00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:52.040
and then discount that future money

224
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.659
that companies make, okay?

225
00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:56.099
Into today's terms.

226
00:09:56.099 --> 00:09:59.640
So they can calculate what a company is worth today

227
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.717
that will make money in the future.

228
00:10:02.717 --> 00:10:05.597
And this is referred to as the time value of money,

229
00:10:05.597 --> 00:10:07.939
which you covered in the first exercise of the course.

230
00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:09.480
If this seems a little bit complicated

231
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.899
for you to understand,

232
00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:12.957
think of it this way.

233
00:10:12.957 --> 00:10:14.378
At the beginning of the course, we said,

234
00:10:14.378 --> 00:10:15.939
okay, we got a dollar today.

235
00:10:15.939 --> 00:10:18.456
That's worth a lot more in the future.

236
00:10:18.456 --> 00:10:20.920
The future value of the money.

237
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.456
I want you to think of the opposite.

238
00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:24.596
So, if companies make a lot of money in the future,

239
00:10:24.596 --> 00:10:26.456
what's that future money worth today?

240
00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:28.356
Well, we need to use interest rates

241
00:10:28.356 --> 00:10:29.539
to figure out that future value

242
00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:32.858
and turn it into present value, okay?

243
00:10:32.858 --> 00:10:35.192
And you could play around this in Excel as well.

244
00:10:35.192 --> 00:10:37.939
We use the FV formula, future value.

245
00:10:37.939 --> 00:10:40.156
You can enter in the PV formula as well.

246
00:10:40.156 --> 00:10:41.557
A little off topic but anyway,

247
00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:42.776
if you have questions, let me know.

248
00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:44.520
So, a crucial input into calculating

249
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.499
what the time value of money is for a company

250
00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:48.376
is the current interest rate

251
00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:51.293
that the company operates in, okay?

252
00:10:52.477 --> 00:10:53.837
And one of the most powerful tools

253
00:10:53.837 --> 00:10:55.776
that a country has is the ability

254
00:10:55.776 --> 00:10:57.859
to change their interest rate.

255
00:10:57.859 --> 00:10:59.299
And when times are tough,

256
00:10:59.299 --> 00:11:02.216
and when we're in a recession

257
00:11:02.216 --> 00:11:04.397
or about to enter a potential recession,

258
00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:05.779
you know what governments do?

259
00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:08.840
They cut, meaning they lower the interest rate

260
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.778
in order to stimulate the economy, okay?

261
00:11:12.778 --> 00:11:13.997
Now we understand why governments

262
00:11:13.997 --> 00:11:17.277
raise interest rates when the economy is doing well.

263
00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:18.876
They raise interest rates partially

264
00:11:18.876 --> 00:11:22.616
so they can have a few bullets in the chamber,

265
00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:23.619
in case they have to

266
00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:24.617
(gunshots)

267
00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.760
jumpstart the economy at some point

268
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.837
in the future when the economy is not doing well.

269
00:11:29.837 --> 00:11:32.360
So, governments raise interest rates

270
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.433
so that they can stimulate the economy in the future

271
00:11:35.433 --> 00:11:37.350
by cutting rates, okay?

272
00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.477
And you might be thinking, wait a second, Chris.

273
00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:43.253
I know of at least one country that has

274
00:11:43.253 --> 00:11:46.280
or has had very high interest rates

275
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.558
and the economy is not doing well.

276
00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:49.694
What's that all about?

277
00:11:49.694 --> 00:11:53.861
Well, some countries have out of control rising prices,

278
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.737
partially due to economic or

279
00:11:56.737 --> 00:11:58.637
government policy mismanagement.

280
00:11:58.637 --> 00:12:00.760
And the only way to stop those prices

281
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.178
from rising out of control

282
00:12:02.178 --> 00:12:04.856
is to increase interest rates.

283
00:12:04.856 --> 00:12:09.459
Germany had incredibly high inflation in the 1920s,

284
00:12:09.459 --> 00:12:11.619
which is called hyperinflation.

285
00:12:11.619 --> 00:12:14.017
And this is crazy but people actually

286
00:12:14.017 --> 00:12:17.218
started using their currency as wallpaper.

287
00:12:17.218 --> 00:12:18.531
It was worthless.

288
00:12:18.531 --> 00:12:21.215
And they also used wheelbarrows to bring money

289
00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:24.179
to the market to buy food.

290
00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:28.346
And a loaf of bread in Germany costs 0.6 marcs in 1918.

291
00:12:30.442 --> 00:12:34.442
And then by 1923, it cost over 200 billion marcs

292
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.871
to buy a single loaf of bread in Germany.

293
00:12:38.871 --> 00:12:41.710
And this is, of course, hyperinflation.

294
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.710
And then, there's a, this note here.

295
00:12:46.174 --> 00:12:50.341
This is, this here is 10 billion Zimbabwe dollars.

296
00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:57.272
And Zimbabwe's currency recently lost

297
00:12:57.272 --> 00:13:01.439
literally 99.9% of its valuation between 2007 and 2008.

298
00:13:03.387 --> 00:13:07.430
And in 2008, the average inflation rate

299
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.597
at one point in Zimbabwe was 98%.

300
00:13:11.571 --> 00:13:13.870
The average daily inflation rate was 98%.

301
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.710
Every day, prices would double.

302
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.710
It's difficult, difficult situation.

303
00:13:19.868 --> 00:13:22.552
In the United States in the late 1970s,

304
00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.930
President Carter's approval rating was only 30%,

305
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.790
partially given the fact that inflation was 13%,

306
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.409
and oil prices were way too high.

307
00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:33.728
And there was a, I think they called it

308
00:13:33.728 --> 00:13:37.432
a crisis of confidence at that point.

309
00:13:37.432 --> 00:13:40.268
And gold prices spiked to a record,

310
00:13:40.268 --> 00:13:43.018
at that point, of $376 per ounce.

311
00:13:44.952 --> 00:13:47.134
And we're gonna discuss commodities later, okay?

312
00:13:47.134 --> 00:13:50.334
Gold usually goes up a lot in times of crisis,

313
00:13:50.334 --> 00:13:52.072
which is why we have to be aware

314
00:13:52.072 --> 00:13:55.011
of what the price of gold is.

315
00:13:55.011 --> 00:13:56.974
And if we personally think that

316
00:13:56.974 --> 00:13:59.065
gold prices are gonna go up a lot,

317
00:13:59.065 --> 00:14:01.529
it could be kind of a fearful indicator

318
00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:04.254
for the economy, and I personally, little side note.

319
00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:06.654
I think we should have 10% of our net worth

320
00:14:06.654 --> 00:14:09.192
in commodities at all points in time, okay?

321
00:14:09.192 --> 00:14:11.294
Part of that should be in gold.

322
00:14:11.294 --> 00:14:12.654
And how do we do it?

323
00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:16.351
Well, through the ETF, the great GLD.

324
00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:18.355
Okay, and we'll cover that in much more detail later.

325
00:14:18.355 --> 00:14:19.892
Okay, we'll talk about diversification

326
00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:22.225
in exercise number 24, okay?

327
00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:26.376
But we need to understand how all

328
00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:30.193
these instruments are related, and they are.

329
00:14:30.193 --> 00:14:32.113
Which is why I'm spending time discussing

330
00:14:32.113 --> 00:14:35.016
interest rates, commodities, stocks, et cetera.

331
00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:37.678
And when we discuss your mortgage later,

332
00:14:37.678 --> 00:14:40.992
you will have this aha moment and realize

333
00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:44.654
why we covered interest rates in so much detail.

334
00:14:44.654 --> 00:14:46.115
Let's go back to inflation now,

335
00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:47.948
meaning prices rising.

336
00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:51.294
So, the way the United States dealt with

337
00:14:51.294 --> 00:14:54.899
double digit inflation at that point in the 1970s

338
00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:59.066
was with massive, massive interest rate hikes, okay?

339
00:15:00.157 --> 00:15:02.136
And the head of the US Federal Reserve,

340
00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:05.016
the CEO of money in the US at that point,

341
00:15:05.016 --> 00:15:07.690
was a guy named Paul Volcker.

342
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.171
And Volcker flew to Europe to attend an IMF meeting.

343
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:13.496
And while he was there,

344
00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:16.094
he met with his good friend, Helmut Schmidt,

345
00:15:16.094 --> 00:15:19.134
who was the chancellor of West Germany at the time.

346
00:15:19.134 --> 00:15:21.358
And Helmut Schmidt helped Volcker

347
00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:24.494
understand how chaotic the economy

348
00:15:24.494 --> 00:15:25.896
would become in the United States

349
00:15:25.896 --> 00:15:30.456
if they did not deal with the inflation rate immediately.

350
00:15:30.456 --> 00:15:32.414
And so, what happened was when the

351
00:15:32.414 --> 00:15:35.278
Federal Reserve in the United States meets,

352
00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:37.054
met at that point, they raised rates.

353
00:15:37.054 --> 00:15:39.391
But let me explain what that means, okay?

354
00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:42.958
In the United States, when the Federal Reserve meets,

355
00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.336
and there's not just one person

356
00:15:45.336 --> 00:15:46.411
in the Federal Reserve.

357
00:15:46.411 --> 00:15:48.515
There's a bunch of people in the Federal Reserve.

358
00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:50.195
So back then, Volcker headed it up,

359
00:15:50.195 --> 00:15:52.156
but you've got regional chairpeople

360
00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:54.591
of different states or different regions.

361
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:58.758
When they all meet, those meetings are called FOMC meetings,

362
00:16:00.254 --> 00:16:04.755
which stands for Federal Open Market Committee meetings.

363
00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:06.731
And the Federal Reserve, or the Fed,

364
00:16:06.731 --> 00:16:08.014
as some people call it,

365
00:16:08.014 --> 00:16:10.995
back then, they raised interest rates a lot.

366
00:16:10.995 --> 00:16:13.235
And this caused a big recession in the United States

367
00:16:13.235 --> 00:16:15.735
that lasted from 1980 to 1982.

368
00:16:16.814 --> 00:16:19.534
And I remember that recession well.

369
00:16:19.534 --> 00:16:21.614
I grew up in Canada, but that recession

370
00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:23.374
really hit us hard.

371
00:16:23.374 --> 00:16:25.016
And when I was a kid, my dad,

372
00:16:25.016 --> 00:16:26.398
I remember the mortgage on our house,

373
00:16:26.398 --> 00:16:29.771
interest rates were actually close to 20%.

374
00:16:29.771 --> 00:16:32.238
And that really hurt the Canadian economy

375
00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:33.315
and my dad too.

376
00:16:33.315 --> 00:16:34.835
I remember it was a tough time when I was a kid,

377
00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:37.034
because in Canada, you cannot write off

378
00:16:37.034 --> 00:16:38.696
the interest on your mortgage,

379
00:16:38.696 --> 00:16:39.976
like you do in the United States,

380
00:16:39.976 --> 00:16:43.496
and I'll explain what all that means later too.

381
00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:47.395
Okay great, so as investors trying to make money,

382
00:16:47.395 --> 00:16:50.376
we need to understand the monetary policy,

383
00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.958
not just of our country,

384
00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.979
but the monetary policy of other large

385
00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:57.216
countries or trading blocks,

386
00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.915
as the policy and decision making

387
00:16:58.915 --> 00:17:02.932
of those countries affects many countries in the world

388
00:17:02.932 --> 00:17:04.798
and almost all countries.

389
00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:08.819
And certainly impacts financial institutions.

390
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:09.816
Why?

391
00:17:09.816 --> 00:17:12.355
Because their decisions affect what

392
00:17:12.355 --> 00:17:14.659
interest rates professional investors will use

393
00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.776
in their financial models,

394
00:17:16.776 --> 00:17:20.878
and how much money the companies that they analyze

395
00:17:20.878 --> 00:17:24.456
might use to fund their growth, okay?

396
00:17:24.456 --> 00:17:28.419
Also, stable economies with higher interest rates

397
00:17:28.419 --> 00:17:31.252
can have much stronger currencies,

398
00:17:33.459 --> 00:17:36.259
which affects the financial models

399
00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:39.416
that professional investors analyze.

400
00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:43.496
Also, higher interest rates mean fewer jobs

401
00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:45.896
and fewer companies are created, yeesh.

402
00:17:45.896 --> 00:17:46.958
Why?

403
00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.819
Because when interest rates are high,

404
00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:51.619
we would rather put our money in the bank

405
00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:54.078
in order to get that great return on investment

406
00:17:54.078 --> 00:17:56.696
as bank interest rates are higher.

407
00:17:56.696 --> 00:17:59.754
For example, if interest rates are hypothetically 18%

408
00:17:59.754 --> 00:18:01.715
and the stock market returns,

409
00:18:01.715 --> 00:18:04.099
I don't know, 10 to 15% on a good year,

410
00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:07.139
then we most likely won't buy stocks.

411
00:18:07.139 --> 00:18:10.889
We also won't likely buy as much real estate,

412
00:18:11.939 --> 00:18:13.555
and we won't invest as much in

413
00:18:13.555 --> 00:18:15.438
private venture capital companies,

414
00:18:15.438 --> 00:18:18.419
and we won't buy as many commodities.

415
00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:22.056
Instead, we will put our money in the bank

416
00:18:22.056 --> 00:18:25.096
or buy bonds as the return on our investments

417
00:18:25.096 --> 00:18:28.216
will be superb, relative to the risk

418
00:18:28.216 --> 00:18:29.198
that we're taking on.

419
00:18:29.198 --> 00:18:31.258
Interest rates are high, so put your money in the bank.

420
00:18:31.258 --> 00:18:33.918
And this, of course, assumes that

421
00:18:33.918 --> 00:18:36.158
you are investing in banks that are

422
00:18:36.158 --> 00:18:38.837
ensured by the government.

423
00:18:38.837 --> 00:18:41.695
For example, and we kind of covered this,

424
00:18:41.695 --> 00:18:43.635
for example, in the US,

425
00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:45.139
the government issues you,

426
00:18:45.139 --> 00:18:47.918
insures you, I should say,

427
00:18:47.918 --> 00:18:50.078
the government insures you in banks

428
00:18:50.078 --> 00:18:54.436
up to a value of $250,000 per bank investment.

429
00:18:54.436 --> 00:18:56.622
And this is the FDIC insurance,

430
00:18:56.622 --> 00:19:00.175
or Federal Depository Insurance Corporation,

431
00:19:00.175 --> 00:19:02.942
which we covered when we looked at

432
00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:06.520
exercise number 15, called Is Your Money Safe?

433
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.958
And so, the FDIC exists partially

434
00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:12.078
so we don't lose faith in our financial system

435
00:19:12.078 --> 00:19:14.339
and take all of our money out of the bank,

436
00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:16.542
which is catastrophic,

437
00:19:16.542 --> 00:19:18.819
as the banks can't lend money anymore

438
00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:21.219
to help companies grow.

439
00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:23.240
In fact, and this is awful,

440
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.819
and this is against the law.

441
00:19:24.819 --> 00:19:28.236
But in 2008, hedge funds in New York City

442
00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:30.990
that bet against the banks,

443
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.128
meaning they shorted the stocks

444
00:19:32.128 --> 00:19:33.386
and they wanted the stocks to go down

445
00:19:33.386 --> 00:19:34.507
and make money from it,

446
00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.312
what they did was these hedge funds,

447
00:19:37.312 --> 00:19:40.395
they hired actors to line up at banks

448
00:19:41.808 --> 00:19:43.565
so that when the media saw,

449
00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:45.088
oh my gosh, look at all these people lining up,

450
00:19:45.088 --> 00:19:46.667
they thought these people were

451
00:19:46.667 --> 00:19:48.411
lining up to take their money out.

452
00:19:48.411 --> 00:19:51.110
They were manipulating the market

453
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.771
by causing people to panic.

454
00:19:53.771 --> 00:19:56.208
So anyway, it was against the law but

455
00:19:56.208 --> 00:19:58.688
just so you understand how catastrophic

456
00:19:58.688 --> 00:20:01.629
it can be if people take all their money out of banks,

457
00:20:01.629 --> 00:20:03.387
which is why we have insurance,

458
00:20:03.387 --> 00:20:06.491
which we talked about in the exercise 15.

459
00:20:06.491 --> 00:20:08.528
So, you'll notice that when interest rates

460
00:20:08.528 --> 00:20:11.899
are unusually high, like they were in the early 1980s,

461
00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:14.571
then not many companies are born.

462
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:16.150
Why?

463
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.851
Because potential investors would rather

464
00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:20.971
put their money in the bank or buy bonds

465
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:23.488
and earn high returns on their

466
00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:25.851
low risk bank or bond investments,

467
00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:28.587
if they are highly rated.

468
00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:32.308
And we'll talk about bond ratings very soon.

469
00:20:32.308 --> 00:20:34.443
Okay, so I want to quickly mention that

470
00:20:34.443 --> 00:20:37.488
if you have a few investment accounts open

471
00:20:37.488 --> 00:20:41.190
at a few banks, transfer some of the money,

472
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.268
if you see savings or interest rates

473
00:20:44.268 --> 00:20:48.091
that are higher at one bank or one account versus another.

474
00:20:48.091 --> 00:20:49.270
Kind of like when you're driving

475
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.308
and you see two gas stations beside each other,

476
00:20:52.308 --> 00:20:54.827
obviously you go to the one with cheaper gas if you can.

477
00:20:54.827 --> 00:20:56.406
Transferring money between accounts

478
00:20:56.406 --> 00:20:57.667
is very easy to do.

479
00:20:57.667 --> 00:20:58.987
And if you do this often enough,

480
00:20:58.987 --> 00:21:00.491
then you'll actually make a sizeable

481
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:01.872
amount of money in the long run

482
00:21:01.872 --> 00:21:03.688
compared to if you did not do this.

483
00:21:03.688 --> 00:21:05.488
And of course, we need to make sure

484
00:21:05.488 --> 00:21:08.288
that there are no fees or minimal fees

485
00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:09.572
if we want to do this.
