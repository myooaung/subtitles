1
00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.942
<v ->Life insurance can cost as little as $2 per day,</v>

2
00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:05.937
and much much more obviously.

3
00:00:05.937 --> 00:00:08.840
And there's many great resources online

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.904
for shopping for life insurance.

5
00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:13.848
So here's the $2 daily source I got online.

6
00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:16.289
And you gotta do you own research always.

7
00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.026
And the reason that insurance can seem so cheap to buy

8
00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:24.235
is because of the likelihood of all policy holders

9
00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:27.949
needing insurance money at the same time is very low.

10
00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.898
And also because of the incredible

11
00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:32.663
compounding interest phenomenon.

12
00:00:32.663 --> 00:00:35.078
As money grows really fast okay.

13
00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:38.141
And we talk about that in the first exercise in the course.

14
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:40.916
And once you get married or right before

15
00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:41.749
your first child is born,

16
00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:43.809
it really makes sense to get life insurance.

17
00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.206
Buy life insurance as soon as you can because premiums

18
00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:49.047
are much lower when you're healthier

19
00:00:49.047 --> 00:00:51.110
and younger as well obviously.

20
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.930
You know, it's hard for me to tell you exactly

21
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.613
how much you need for life insurance.

22
00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:00.508
You know, I recommend calculating how much you'd

23
00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:03.417
receive today if you'd liquidated everything you own

24
00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:05.002
except for your house.

25
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.975
And then add to that all of your retirement savings,

26
00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:12.028
then deduct taxes as a starting point to kind of figure out

27
00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:14.365
I don't know, what you need from a

28
00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:15.875
life insurance coverage perspective.

29
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.521
And I talked about the ten x ratio earlier in the course.

30
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:22.335
But just be really conservative and don't rely much

31
00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:25.953
on social security when you're calculating

32
00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:28.945
what you need coverage for.

33
00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:31.538
Most people think life insurance costs

34
00:01:31.538 --> 00:01:33.597
way more than it actually does.

35
00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:36.720
So the next step is for you to please call local

36
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.728
life insurance companies and start price shopping.

37
00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:43.302
And ask the life insurance companies to explain exactly

38
00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:47.393
how much you get and when are these policies--

39
00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:49.209
because these policies are very complex.

40
00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.412
Ask how much you get and when and that sort of thing, okay.

41
00:01:51.412 --> 00:01:53.985
When obviously means if you God forbid pass away,

42
00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:57.183
but is there kind of a lag between when you pass away

43
00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:00.189
and when your family gets the capital, that sort of thing.

44
00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.857
Ask these companies to reexplain the policy

45
00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.163
a few times to you if you need.

46
00:02:06.163 --> 00:02:07.290
I had to do that.

47
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.392
I had to ask them to explain it a couple times right.

48
00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:12.296
And then what I usually do is I explain back to them

49
00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:14.207
in my simple terms, and they either say,

50
00:02:14.207 --> 00:02:17.419
"Yeah that makes sense" or "sort of" or whatever.

51
00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.586
So these are really complex financial securities at times

52
00:02:22.647 --> 00:02:24.245
that you just gotta ask about them right.

53
00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:26.281
Especially when it comes to-- you'll hear people

54
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.320
talk about deferred annuities which basically means

55
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.950
you get insurance income later.

56
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.600
It's deferred okay.

57
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.147
That means you buy it now, and you get a certain amount

58
00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:38.790
of yearly at a certain age for a certain number of years.

59
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.264
There's so many different ways to buy insurance.

60
00:02:42.264 --> 00:02:44.502
And so the word deferred again means later.

61
00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:47.234
And the word annuities means annual.

62
00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.319
Think of the money as we get deferred annual.

63
00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.230
We get later on money every year, that sort of thing.

64
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.045
Let's drill down a little bit more on deferred anunities,

65
00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:58.199
meaning annual money we get later.

66
00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.031
There's two types of deferred annuities.

67
00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:04.815
One type is a fixed annuity

68
00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:07.392
where you get the same amount of money annually

69
00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:09.475
that grows tax deferred.

70
00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.443
This first fixed time period expires in say

71
00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:16.519
five or ten years.

72
00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.661
And when it expires, you can reinvest tax-free.

73
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.911
And the second type is an index annuity

74
00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:26.978
meaning you get part of the stock market upside

75
00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:28.816
with no downside.

76
00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:31.955
And I know it sounds a little complicated

77
00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:34.137
so please meet wit your insurance company for

78
00:03:34.137 --> 00:03:37.365
more details as they can really create these

79
00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:40.365
complex financial instruments, okay.

80
00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:44.059
Anyway, ask them all about it.

81
00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.660
But what happens though is you can get an annual

82
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.259
lump sum at a certain point in time at a certain age

83
00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.122
at a certain number of years, kinda like a pension

84
00:03:54.122 --> 00:03:55.614
with tax benefits.

85
00:03:55.614 --> 00:04:00.537
Again please ask your insurance company for more details.

86
00:04:00.537 --> 00:04:01.739
Okay, it's complicated.

87
00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.860
Ask them to explain it in great detail.

88
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.358
As they can be different based on your age, right,

89
00:04:08.358 --> 00:04:11.336
your potential retirement age and other factors as well.

90
00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:12.799
It's all quite different based on

91
00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.446
where we are on in our lives, okay.

92
00:04:16.446 --> 00:04:19.684
And also ask them what is the cap on the upside

93
00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:23.639
and double check that there's very little or downside okay.

94
00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.683
Wait a second, how can you get no downside?

95
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.988
Because insurance companies use very complex options

96
00:04:29.988 --> 00:04:33.619
to make sure that they don't lose money.

97
00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:37.847
Again, please ask your insurance company for more details.

98
00:04:37.847 --> 00:04:42.080
And of course, ensure that they are very reputable

99
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.449
and have a good rating like Moody's

100
00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.129
and S&amp;P rates them well.

101
00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.109
Don't worry, we're going to cover what rating agency

102
00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:51.101
Moody's and S&amp;P means later in the course

103
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:54.052
when we talk about bonds which is a fascinating topic

104
00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:56.599
that you're gonna love.

105
00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.639
Again I have to stress how we recommend not investing

106
00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.003
in variable annuities as the hidden fees are awful.

107
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:06.395
I like investing in term instead as I like to

108
00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:09.637
only buy life insurance from life insurance companies.

109
00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:13.033
And these life insurance policies are complicated,

110
00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:14.940
and many of them are quite different.

111
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.768
Just ask your insurance sales person

112
00:05:17.768 --> 00:05:22.200
to explain it a few times over and over and over

113
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.617
until you get it.

114
00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:28.560
And sometimes the most complicated financial products

115
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.024
cost us more in fees in the long run.

116
00:05:31.024 --> 00:05:32.525
They're hidden, okay.

117
00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:35.475
And insurance is one of the most complex topics

118
00:05:35.475 --> 00:05:37.085
in all of finance.

119
00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:41.418
And I actually had to-- I had to ask many, many times

120
00:05:41.418 --> 00:05:45.595
until my insurance rep really dumbed it down for me.

121
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:48.010
And I was able to explain it back to him

122
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.140
what I thought all this meant.

123
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.878
And then finally he said, "yes that's correct."

124
00:05:53.878 --> 00:05:56.158
So just ask them to explain it and reexplain it

125
00:05:56.158 --> 00:05:58.845
because every policy can be quite different

126
00:05:58.845 --> 00:06:00.143
based on what country you're in.

127
00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:02.374
I'm trying to make this course generic enough

128
00:06:02.374 --> 00:06:04.057
to fit and work in every country,

129
00:06:04.057 --> 00:06:05.872
but every insurance policy is different.

130
00:06:05.872 --> 00:06:08.057
So the next lecture, we're going to talk

131
00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:09.604
about auto insurance.
