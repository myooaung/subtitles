00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:03.517
<v ->Now that you've completed your current income statement,</v>

2
00:00:03.517 --> 00:00:07.321
we can think about ways to save much much more.

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.221
So that your new and improved income statement will

4
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:13.059
reflect your saving strategies.

5
00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.461
And so you might have noticed that your dashboard summary

6
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:19.261
has been updated a bit, right?

7
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.821
Which you can access by clicking on the dark blue button

8
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.720
on the left side here of your dashboard summary.

9
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.317
You can see some of the items you entered

10
00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.317
are reflected here.

11
00:00:30.317 --> 00:00:33.734
And our goal is to use what we will learn

12
00:00:34.877 --> 00:00:37.480
from the next exercise and the many associated

13
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.379
savings lectures so that we can increase our savings rate

14
00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.221
materially, as a percentage of what you make.

15
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.500
And we're actually gonna cover more than 100

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.339
different ways to save in the next section

17
00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.619
of the course.

18
00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.019
So that when we do the same income statement exercise

19
00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.296
again we're gonna get much higher savings.

20
00:00:57.296 --> 00:00:59.436
A much higher savings rate I should say,

21
00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:02.837
as you create your new and improved income statement.

22
00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:06.520
And so please continue to keep in mind

23
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.117
how small changes in our spending patterns

24
00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:11.901
can lead to material savings in the long run.

25
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:12.772
It all adds up.
