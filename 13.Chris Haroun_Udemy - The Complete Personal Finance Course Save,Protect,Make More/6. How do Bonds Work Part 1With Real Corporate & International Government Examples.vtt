00:00:00.588 --> 00:00:04.244
<v ->We know that companies can raise money by selling stocks</v>

2
00:00:04.244 --> 00:00:08.060
so that we the stockholders or shareholders, same thing,

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.642
we own part of that company, which is also known as equity.

4
00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:15.956
So remember when we discussed your balance sheet

5
00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:19.068
earlier in the course, we know that assets

6
00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:21.270
equals liabilities plus equity.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.067
So if a company wants money to help their business grow

8
00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.608
they need to raise cash, right?

9
00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:31.736
Which is an asset, they need to raise cash.

10
00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:33.403
So, let's say IBM...

11
00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:38.456
Let's say IBM wants to raise a hundred million dollars.

12
00:00:38.456 --> 00:00:40.208
Well, what they can do is they can either

13
00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:43.385
sell more shares or get a loan.

14
00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:46.601
Okay? They can do that. They can either sell more shares

15
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:47.685
or get a loan.

16
00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:51.050
Either way, cash will go up by a hundred million.

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.797
So cash is an asset, okay?

18
00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:56.380
And here is an IBM share. Okay?

19
00:00:57.788 --> 00:00:59.371
So, what happens is

20
00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.050
if you buy one of these shares

21
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.069
IBM gets to put money in their bank account

22
00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.493
but the equity goes to you.

23
00:01:09.493 --> 00:01:13.609
So they can either get more cash by raising debt,

24
00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.525
or selling part of the company, selling equity, okay?

25
00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:22.332
One share of IBM looked like this many years ago

26
00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.434
and what happens now is a lot of this stuff is electronic

27
00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:28.101
but this is an IBM share, right?

28
00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:32.601
And IBM stands for "Industry's Biggest Mistake."

29
00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:35.114
No more Dad humor, I promise. Okay.

30
00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:36.920
So, this is what it looks like.

31
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.508
It's got the name of the person that owned it

32
00:01:38.508 --> 00:01:41.804
at that point in time, some dude from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

33
00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:43.901
Right? And you couldn't forge it

34
00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:47.422
because it had these little dots on it that you can rub off.

35
00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:49.078
Anyway, that's what it looked like.

36
00:01:49.078 --> 00:01:53.190
This is one share of IBM, that's what it looked like.

37
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.488
Now let's say that IBM decides that

38
00:01:55.488 --> 00:01:59.260
if they issued new shares, then some investors would get mad

39
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.334
as the number of shares would go up,

40
00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:05.079
which means that there is the same amount of earnings

41
00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.110
divided by more shares.

42
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.677
So the earnings per share would go down, right?

43
00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:12.102
So the price to earnings ratio would look worse, right?

44
00:02:12.102 --> 00:02:14.677
It would actually go up and investors might get upset.

45
00:02:14.677 --> 00:02:18.115
And so IBM might decide, "Okay, we're not gonna issue

46
00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:20.990
"shares then. What we'll do is this:

47
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.727
"We will get a massive loan for a hundred million dollars."

48
00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.823
Right? It's a huge amount, a hundred million.

49
00:02:26.823 --> 00:02:29.258
And a bank might not have enough money

50
00:02:29.258 --> 00:02:30.990
to lend them a hundred million dollars.

51
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.357
So what does IBM do?

52
00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:37.165
They decide they will raise debt, not just

53
00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:40.838
from one bank but from many, many, many, many banks

54
00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:43.004
and many, many, many, many people.

55
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:46.295
So what does that mean? Well, IBM does this

56
00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:48.664
by raising a hundred million dollars

57
00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:50.664
from thousands of investors all over the world

58
00:02:50.664 --> 00:02:53.366
like you and I, by issuing debt to you and I

59
00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.966
in the form of a bond.

60
00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:59.440
Yes, we are going to lend money to IBM, right,

61
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.660
and this is called a bond.

62
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.946
So, how does that work, the whole process?

63
00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:09.126
Well, we each give IBM money, and in return we get

64
00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:13.231
interest on the loan, meaning the bond to IBM.

65
00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:16.468
Well, in the old days, when you would buy a stock

66
00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:18.778
you would get the stock's certificate as proof,

67
00:03:18.778 --> 00:03:21.052
which I just showed you, that you own the stock.

68
00:03:21.052 --> 00:03:24.570
For example, if you invested in IBM in the 1970s,

69
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.595
they would send a certificate to your house

70
00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:28.497
like the one I just showed you.

71
00:03:28.497 --> 00:03:30.836
Today, you get electronic ownership of a stock

72
00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:33.555
and so you actually don't get a certificate like that,

73
00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:34.851
as cool as it looks like.

74
00:03:34.851 --> 00:03:38.306
Now, the reason I wanted to show you this stock certificate

75
00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:40.604
is because it's easier for you to visualize

76
00:03:40.604 --> 00:03:43.055
and understand how bonds work.

77
00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:46.975
So, we're now gonna put some more layers on this, okay?

78
00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:49.808
So, this here is a bond from 1913.

79
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:56.728
It's a New York central real estate bond.

80
00:03:58.653 --> 00:04:01.455
And you could actually buy these things

81
00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:03.494
for really cheap on eBay, right?

82
00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:06.616
And you see these things here?

83
00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:08.834
These are all coupons.

84
00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:11.786
Like, real money. You clip these coupons off

85
00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:15.432
and you get money for it, okay? There's lots of coupons.

86
00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:18.599
Lots and lots of coupons. I'll explain what this means.

87
00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.669
And the railroad company probably issued this bond

88
00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.595
so they could build more train tracks,

89
00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:26.371
which costs a lot to do.

90
00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:27.204
Alright.

91
00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:31.917
And this here, oh the coupon just fell, dammit. Okay.

92
00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:36.433
This here is an example of a government bond,

93
00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:38.399
with coupons. Okay? The coupons just fell off.

94
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.787
This was, these two were here, there's actually

95
00:04:40.787 --> 00:04:43.884
two coupons here that you would clip off. Okay?

96
00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:46.933
And this is a Russian bond, I bought it over eBay,

97
00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:49.480
it came from Latvia the other day,

98
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.381
and if anybody can read what this means, please tell me.

99
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:56.112
It looks like it's from 1916, so it was probably used

100
00:04:56.112 --> 00:04:58.557
to fund World War I, I think.

101
00:04:58.557 --> 00:05:01.417
So, anybody speak Russian out there, put it in the Q&amp;A field

102
00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:03.583
for us to understand. Okay. Anyway.

103
00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:07.257
That's an example of an international bond.

104
00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:11.424
And this one here actually is from the city of Los Angeles.

105
00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:17.339
Okay? So this is a Los Angeles issued one from 1927.

106
00:05:18.988 --> 00:05:23.294
And there's lots and lots of coupons here,

107
00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:25.877
bear with me please. Ah! Sorry.

108
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.292
Yeah, these are little coupons on the side here.

109
00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:32.655
It's in remarkably good condition

110
00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:35.125
for a piece of paper from the 1920s.

111
00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:37.454
So, what you would do, I'll actually do it right now,

112
00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:41.012
is, you would rip one of these coupons off.

113
00:05:41.012 --> 00:05:42.723
They cut them, actually, there's no dotted line,

114
00:05:42.723 --> 00:05:44.784
but you cut it off, and then you submit it

115
00:05:44.784 --> 00:05:47.731
and you get a coupon bond for it.

116
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:49.400
And they actually wrote on them, "nine dollars,

117
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.250
"19 dollars, 67 dollars." That's really interesting.

118
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.768
And you can't see that closely, or maybe you can,

119
00:05:54.768 --> 00:05:57.292
I'll hold it against my shirt, but it says "canceled."

120
00:05:57.292 --> 00:06:00.473
Right? The dots through it. I always thought canceled

121
00:06:00.473 --> 00:06:02.522
had two L's, apparently it has one.

122
00:06:02.522 --> 00:06:07.154
So anyways this is a bond issued by the state of California.

123
00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:11.154
Okay? It's pretty cool. The city of Los Angeles.

124
00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:15.803
So, traffic is a nightmare in L.A., so they clearly

125
00:06:15.803 --> 00:06:18.350
didn't raise enough money, but you can see here

126
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.516
that the coupons here are cashed every six months.

127
00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:25.227
I can see the dates up closely, you can't, sorry.

128
00:06:25.227 --> 00:06:28.333
But anyway, in the early 1980s,

129
00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:29.761
I'll give you another example here,

130
00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:32.273
this one's more interesting I think. Okay.

131
00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:35.182
In the early 1980s the Walt Disney Corporation

132
00:06:35.182 --> 00:06:38.845
wanted to build a massive theme park in France.

133
00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:41.946
And I remember it was very controversial

134
00:06:41.946 --> 00:06:45.049
for many reasons at the time, one of which was the cost.

135
00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:48.180
And the cost was going to be insanely high

136
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.562
and Disney didn't have the money. Right?

137
00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:53.818
And so they could've issued more stock, more shares

138
00:06:53.818 --> 00:06:56.402
to investors in the stock market, issue more equity.

139
00:06:56.402 --> 00:06:57.870
But the problem is a lot of investors

140
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.842
would've been upset because what would happen is

141
00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:05.477
it would dilute how much money Disney makes per share.

142
00:07:05.477 --> 00:07:07.092
So what'd Disney do instead?

143
00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:10.057
Well, what they did was they did a debt offering.

144
00:07:10.057 --> 00:07:12.577
They issued Euro Disney bonds

145
00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:14.917
in order to finance this massive investment.

146
00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:16.743
It's the only way they could finance it!

147
00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:18.818
Right? And you see the coupons back here.

148
00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:20.287
Right? I don't know if you can see that,

149
00:07:20.287 --> 00:07:22.822
Chris, maybe in post-production zoom in there, okay?

150
00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:26.925
Okay, now you understand what coupons are for, right?

151
00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:29.678
You'd buy a bond and then you'd mail in these coupons,

152
00:07:29.678 --> 00:07:33.404
or give a coupon to a bank and then you'd get cash, right?

153
00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:37.405
Now, that assumes the companies or the government agencies

154
00:07:37.405 --> 00:07:41.395
have money to give to you for these coupons

155
00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:43.662
every six months or so, okay?

156
00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:45.600
And so with this bond here issued by

157
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.231
the New York Central Railroad Company.

158
00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:52.017
It's a thousand dollar bond, see here.

159
00:07:52.017 --> 00:07:55.161
A thousand dollars paying four and a half percent per year.

160
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:57.761
Right? That means that you get

161
00:07:57.761 --> 00:07:59.967
four and half percent interest on it.

162
00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:01.195
And what they would do is they would pay you

163
00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:03.855
the equivalent of that every six months.

164
00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:07.183
And so once you clipped all these coupons off,

165
00:08:07.183 --> 00:08:10.201
see, they're numbered here, where it looks like cash.

166
00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:15.103
Then what happens is you get back your initial investment

167
00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:18.503
which, in this case, is a thousand dollars.

168
00:08:18.503 --> 00:08:20.505
That's the par value, okay?

169
00:08:20.505 --> 00:08:22.736
So, anyway, that's how that one works.

170
00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:25.846
They're all quite similar, but now you know

171
00:08:25.846 --> 00:08:28.142
why they call it coupons, it's kind of interesting.

172
00:08:28.142 --> 00:08:29.099
Kind of interesting.

173
00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:30.975
Okay, there's a good reason why I showed you

174
00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:33.013
these bond documents.

175
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.445
Because it's going to make it way easier

176
00:08:35.445 --> 00:08:38.040
and more interesting for me and for you

177
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.804
to learn how bonds work.

178
00:08:39.804 --> 00:08:43.167
Bear in mind with me for one minute, please, here, okay?

179
00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:45.926
Now we understand how bonds work that have coupons,

180
00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:50.040
because we give a government like Russia or a company like

181
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.942
the New York Railroad Company or Disney money, okay?

182
00:08:53.942 --> 00:08:56.246
We give them money and in return they give us

183
00:08:56.246 --> 00:09:00.507
a piece of paper that says, "You gave us this much money

184
00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:03.898
"and you can get all that money back that you gave us

185
00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:06.130
"in a certain number of years, and you know what?

186
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.246
"As a way to say thank you for investing with us,

187
00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:11.640
"you can take a coupon off every six months and make money

188
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.629
"okay? And that's a dividend coupon. Okay? So.

189
00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:17.496
"When the bond expires, or when it's mature,

190
00:09:17.496 --> 00:09:20.781
"then you get your entire amount of money back."

191
00:09:20.781 --> 00:09:22.870
Okay? That's part of the contract

192
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.085
that you see in these documents, right?

193
00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:27.461
All these little disclosures and they were

194
00:09:27.461 --> 00:09:28.501
hard to read back then because

195
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:31.166
that's actually cursive writing.

196
00:09:31.166 --> 00:09:33.333
It's hard to read. Anyway.
