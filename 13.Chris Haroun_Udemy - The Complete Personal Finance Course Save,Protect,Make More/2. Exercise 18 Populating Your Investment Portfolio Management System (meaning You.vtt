00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:03.704
<v ->Please click on the Your Portfolio button</v>

2
00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:04.878
on the top right-hand side

3
00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:07.045
of your Excel file here okay.

4
00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:08.780
And I'm gonna go into much more detail

5
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.741
on what the columns mean when we cover

6
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:14.077
stocks in the next section.

7
00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:16.705
But rather than discussing boring theory,

8
00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:19.788
let's just jump right in and create a portfolio.

9
00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:22.948
Okay and I will keep this initially

10
00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:26.007
at a really high level for this exercise.

11
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.922
And then we will drill down and discuss

12
00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:30.746
stocks, bonds, real estates,

13
00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:32.147
commodities, et cetera,

14
00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:34.407
after this section okay.

15
00:00:34.407 --> 00:00:37.084
Then we will do a diversification exercise

16
00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:41.210
after we cover the aforementioned topics okay.

17
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.836
So if you haven't already done so,

18
00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:43.930
please open your complete

19
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.237
Personal Finance Dashboard Excel spreadsheet,

20
00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:49.329
and in the top right-hand corner,

21
00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.016
you will see a gray button called

22
00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.143
Your Portfolio.

23
00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:53.251
Please click it.

24
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:55.974
Welcome to Exercise Number 18.

25
00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:58.011
And so what we're gonna do is

26
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:02.115
we are going to populate our portfolio here

27
00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:05.074
with 10 different tickers okay,

28
00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:09.459
and a couple of those tickers will be ETFs.

29
00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:10.992
And the way to do this is to

30
00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:13.077
please follow these instructions.

31
00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:14.274
So first of all make sure

32
00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.630
that you're here on the Settings tab,

33
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.822
and it doesn't matter what

34
00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:19.394
country or currency you select,

35
00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:20.557
so select your own if you want.

36
00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:22.689
I'm just gonna use US for now.

37
00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.352
And what you're gonna do is

38
00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:27.269
you're gonna scroll down here okay,

39
00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.714
and we're gonna complete

40
00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:34.131
seven steps together okay and

41
00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:37.452
when you create your tickers

42
00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:39.930
after you finish this exercise,

43
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.046
you can always click here

44
00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:43.499
to find the correct ticker

45
00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.249
if you can't find it, right,

46
00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.706
and this will help you with international

47
00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:51.254
as well as domestic tickers here okay.

48
00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:52.684
And so for example

49
00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:55.273
if you're gonna pick a Brazilian stock,

50
00:01:55.273 --> 00:01:56.773
sometimes it'll be

51
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.374
.SA afterwards.

52
00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:02.746
So just play around with it in Yahoo Finance.

53
00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:03.654
I'm not gonna click that

54
00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:05.535
but I think you get the idea.

55
00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:09.682
Okay let's go back to Exercise Number 18.

56
00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:11.982
So let's scroll down.

57
00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:13.838
And now we're gonna follow these steps

58
00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:16.290
and this will make a lot more sense to you very soon.

59
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.926
This is pretty cool.

60
00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:20.919
So step one, we're gonna open your browser.

61
00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.869
Okay and what I'll do is I'm gonna put

62
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.702
the browser window here side by side.

63
00:02:26.702 --> 00:02:27.536
And these are the tickets

64
00:02:27.536 --> 00:02:29.550
we're gonna use in a second.

65
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.003
So what I'll do is this

66
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:34.253
and then I'll go back here.

67
00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.325
I'll do that.

68
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.408
And then I am going to put this here,

69
00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:44.458
and then that right there.

70
00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:45.572
Okay good.

71
00:02:45.572 --> 00:02:47.477
So what we're gonna do is

72
00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:50.870
we're gonna go to Yahoo Finance.

73
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.620
So finance.yahoo.com.

74
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.737
Okay great.

75
00:02:56.498 --> 00:03:00.799
And then create a user ID and sign in okay.

76
00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.493
Then what you're gonna do is

77
00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:06.760
you're gonna click on Portfolio here,

78
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.218
and if you haven't signed in yet,

79
00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:09.238
you can sign in right now.

80
00:03:09.238 --> 00:03:12.582
So I'll just, let me just sign in.

81
00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:16.082
Add account, I don't know what that means.

82
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.610
Okay great, so, now what we're gonna do

83
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.652
now that we're signed in is

84
00:03:23.652 --> 00:03:26.239
we are gonna create a new portfolio.

85
00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.322
So I'll go to portfolio, click on it.

86
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.500
And then we're gonna create a portfolio here.

87
00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:40.377
And I'll call this portfolio

88
00:03:40.377 --> 00:03:42.007
Exercise

89
00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:43.090
18 Portfolio.

90
00:03:44.303 --> 00:03:46.716
Please do the same thing on yours.

91
00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:48.778
And you can have it in US dollars

92
00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:49.953
or any currency you want.

93
00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:51.343
Just leave it at US for now.

94
00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:52.176
Okay next.

95
00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:54.571
Okay.

96
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:56.858
Great, we created a new portfolio.

97
00:03:56.858 --> 00:03:58.611
Now we have to do is

98
00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:01.784
we have to enter in the tickers.

99
00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:03.969
So you click on Add Symbol

100
00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.581
and you'll enter in the 10 tickers,

101
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:06.788
and I'll show you which tickers to use.

102
00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.708
So you can click here or up here, same thing.

103
00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.995
Add Ticker.

104
00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:12.390
Now

105
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.959
these are the tickers we're gonna enter in okay.

106
00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.243
And so let's enter them in one by one,

107
00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:20.998
and I'm gonna go on fast mode for a second here

108
00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:23.665
just so I don't waste your time.

109
00:04:39.596 --> 00:04:41.929
Okay great they're all added

110
00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:44.877
and you can sort them.

111
00:04:44.877 --> 00:04:47.083
So I'll just sort here alphabetically.

112
00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:48.924
Now what we're gonna do is

113
00:04:48.924 --> 00:04:51.841
we're gonna create a New View okay.

114
00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:56.269
So I'll click New View here okay.

115
00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:59.701
And then I'm gonna edit which columns are shown.

116
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:01.891
Okay there's not that many columns that are not shown here,

117
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:06.292
and lots and lots columns for data analysis exercise later.

118
00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:08.100
Edit View okay.

119
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.847
And make sure they're all selected okay.

120
00:05:10.847 --> 00:05:12.279
Select all.

121
00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.654
Looks like they are which is great,

122
00:05:13.654 --> 00:05:16.113
but just make sure they're all selected,

123
00:05:16.113 --> 00:05:17.530
every single one.

124
00:05:18.816 --> 00:05:19.871
Great.

125
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:21.160
Save.

126
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.993
Okay cool.

127
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.623
Now we have a ton of data okay,

128
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.717
and you'll notice that not every field is populated,

129
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.663
and it's because I'm actually,

130
00:05:34.663 --> 00:05:35.935
I'll leave it back here sorry,

131
00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.483
I'm actually doing this

132
00:05:38.483 --> 00:05:41.994
at three o'clock in the morning California time.

133
00:05:41.994 --> 00:05:43.913
And so when the market is open,

134
00:05:43.913 --> 00:05:46.658
you will see these fields okay.

135
00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:47.491
Great.

136
00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:49.548
Now

137
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.863
what we're gonna do is

138
00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:57.821
we're going to copy all this data okay.

139
00:05:57.821 --> 00:06:00.273
And please make sure that you copy

140
00:06:00.273 --> 00:06:02.284
starting at the word Symbol here.

141
00:06:02.284 --> 00:06:04.191
You gotta copy the header as well.

142
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:06.008
And this will make a lot of sense to you in a minute.

143
00:06:06.008 --> 00:06:10.046
So right here you can see your portfolio.

144
00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:11.510
This is the image.

145
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.295
And then here in Yahoo Finance,

146
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:15.300
you're gonna click on Symbol,

147
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.964
highlight all the way down to the bottom,

148
00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:19.304
and then copy it.

149
00:06:19.304 --> 00:06:21.287
So let me do this first.

150
00:06:21.287 --> 00:06:23.037
So I'm gonna go here,

151
00:06:24.797 --> 00:06:27.380
make sure you select all of it,

152
00:06:28.692 --> 00:06:29.525
copy,

153
00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:34.073
and then what I'm gonna do is

154
00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:35.573
here on cell A200,

155
00:06:37.306 --> 00:06:39.139
I'm gonna click Paste.

156
00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:43.431
And voila.

157
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.773
All of our data has now been entered.

158
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:51.254
Great.

159
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.963
Cool.

160
00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:56.166
Step eight, what we're gonna do is

161
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:59.017
were gonna go to our Portfolio Management System

162
00:06:59.017 --> 00:07:01.118
by clicking the Your Portfolio button.

163
00:07:01.118 --> 00:07:02.726
Let me just maximize the screen

164
00:07:02.726 --> 00:07:05.827
so we can get the real estate here.

165
00:07:05.827 --> 00:07:08.077
Okay Your Portfolio, click.

166
00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:11.542
And what you'll see is you'll see

167
00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:14.418
all the tickers are added here.

168
00:07:14.418 --> 00:07:15.726
Isn't that cool?

169
00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.566
So they're all automatically added here.

170
00:07:17.566 --> 00:07:19.436
Let's go through it really quickly okay.

171
00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:23.603
And this here is just basically telling you how to insert

172
00:07:24.672 --> 00:07:27.911
the tickers which we just did here in the Settings section.

173
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:32.078
So here we've got all 10 tickers that we added okay.

174
00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:36.764
There's also a couple of

175
00:07:37.613 --> 00:07:40.136
ETFs that are added as well.

176
00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:43.578
See here, you got some ETFs, great.

177
00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:44.995
And

178
00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:47.362
I'll discuss every single column,

179
00:07:47.362 --> 00:07:48.850
what all this stuff means really soon,

180
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.557
but let me just show you quickly what we got here.

181
00:07:51.557 --> 00:07:53.057
So I have a lot of

182
00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.617
background formulas and whatnot,

183
00:07:56.617 --> 00:07:58.477
no code, just formulas

184
00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:02.101
that's basically telling every single data point

185
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:05.492
that you pasted where to go in the spreadsheet.

186
00:08:05.492 --> 00:08:07.758
This will make sense okay.

187
00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:11.226
And so you'll see here if we scroll across

188
00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:13.611
the Daily Percent Change,

189
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:14.557
you could see the ones

190
00:08:14.557 --> 00:08:15.429
that perform the worst

191
00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:16.557
and ones that perform the best.

192
00:08:16.557 --> 00:08:18.958
And so this was a day, I guess,

193
00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.181
when the markets did really well.

194
00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:22.332
So there's not that many stocks

195
00:08:22.332 --> 00:08:23.400
that were down that day

196
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.001
which is red, and green is up,

197
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:26.245
and you can see which ones are up the most.

198
00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:27.906
So the SLV

199
00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:29.205
was up the most

200
00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:31.955
which is the ETF for Silver okay.

201
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:35.671
And we'll talk about clients soon.

202
00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:37.438
Here are the stocks that were down,

203
00:08:37.438 --> 00:08:38.656
you can see in red.

204
00:08:38.656 --> 00:08:40.690
You can scroll over here.

205
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.322
You can see the Change From 52-week high, low, et cetera,

206
00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:45.797
and I'll explain what all of this stuff means very soon.

207
00:08:45.797 --> 00:08:47.476
And this here is the Dividend Yield.

208
00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:50.993
And I created this kinda fun star system here

209
00:08:50.993 --> 00:08:53.432
using Conditional Formatting

210
00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:58.199
to have a full star if it's a higher dividend yield,

211
00:08:58.199 --> 00:09:01.483
and no star or an empty star if it's a lower dividend yield.

212
00:09:01.483 --> 00:09:04.872
And I'll explain what this means very very soon okay.

213
00:09:04.872 --> 00:09:09.013
And I'll explain also how to create this entire spreadsheet,

214
00:09:09.013 --> 00:09:11.843
meaning every single thing we've done in this entire course,

215
00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.003
this entire spreadsheet

216
00:09:13.003 --> 00:09:15.726
in the second last section in this course.

217
00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:17.105
It's optional but if you wanna,

218
00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:18.168
I can teach you from scratch

219
00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:20.019
how to create all this stuff.

220
00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:21.746
It's a lot of fun too.

221
00:09:21.746 --> 00:09:22.742
Okay great.

222
00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:25.357
And then you'll see some white cells, which,

223
00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.749
again when you see a white cell,

224
00:09:26.749 --> 00:09:28.550
it's stuff you're allowed to enter in,

225
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.210
so you put the Purchase Price,

226
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.204
the Purchase Date, the Shares Owned, et cetera.

227
00:09:34.204 --> 00:09:36.528
And I also created a field called

228
00:09:36.528 --> 00:09:38.818
Have You Owned it for More Than a Year for tax reasons.

229
00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:40.704
If you sell a stock within one year,

230
00:09:40.704 --> 00:09:42.334
usually you pay more taxes

231
00:09:42.334 --> 00:09:44.104
than if you held it for more than a year.

232
00:09:44.104 --> 00:09:45.490
And this is pretty cool here.

233
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.508
This basically picks up automatically

234
00:09:48.508 --> 00:09:52.899
all the sectors if you use a stock in S&amp;P 500.

235
00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:55.837
And so IBM is a tech company.

236
00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:58.142
General Electric is an industrial company.

237
00:09:58.142 --> 00:10:01.400
Coke, ticker KO is consumer staple, et cetera.

238
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.217
Exxon is energy.

239
00:10:03.217 --> 00:10:06.405
And there's no categories here for these ETFs.

240
00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:08.248
And then I listed here Sector Driver,

241
00:10:08.248 --> 00:10:10.862
what makes the stock or the sector move.

242
00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:13.027
So for Apple, it's Product Cycle.

243
00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:14.186
Whenever they announce a new

244
00:10:14.186 --> 00:10:15.583
iPhone or whatever it is,

245
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:16.652
investors get excited,

246
00:10:16.652 --> 00:10:17.892
and that's called a catalyst

247
00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:19.868
which helps a stock do well.

248
00:10:19.868 --> 00:10:21.930
And I've also entered in other stuff here.

249
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.271
Okay great.

250
00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:24.685
So we are now done.

251
00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:28.628
Let's scroll back with Exercise Number 18.

252
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.990
And if you want,

253
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.550
just play around by entering your own tickers

254
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.915
back of course only in the Settings button,

255
00:10:35.915 --> 00:10:38.065
and I'll show you again where to do that.

256
00:10:38.065 --> 00:10:39.315
Click Settings.

257
00:10:40.248 --> 00:10:41.248
Scroll down.

258
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.600
Right here we go.

259
00:10:45.407 --> 00:10:48.862
And then what you do is just follow these steps here,

260
00:10:48.862 --> 00:10:50.581
and if you can't find the right ticker,

261
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:52.712
again you can click that okay.

262
00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:55.668
So just follow these seven steps,

263
00:10:55.668 --> 00:10:59.771
and the eighth step is just a look at the results.

264
00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:02.967
And we'll build on this logic in future exercises.

265
00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:06.467
So we just added stocks to this portfolio.

266
00:11:07.586 --> 00:11:10.421
What we'll do now is in future exercises,

267
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:13.562
after I explain what every single column means,

268
00:11:13.562 --> 00:11:14.814
we're gonna do something similar

269
00:11:14.814 --> 00:11:17.332
and add commodities, bonds,

270
00:11:17.332 --> 00:11:19.897
real estate investment, trust, et cetera.

271
00:11:19.897 --> 00:11:21.195
And as always if you have questions,

272
00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:22.258
please let me know.

273
00:11:22.258 --> 00:11:23.175
Thank you.
