00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.364
<v ->Remember when you were in school</v>

2
00:00:02.364 --> 00:00:05.273
and you often did a lot better in courses

3
00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:07.983
where you were really organized with your notebook,

4
00:00:07.983 --> 00:00:10.442
legible notes, handouts, textbooks,

5
00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:12.484
and additional materials, remember that?

6
00:00:12.484 --> 00:00:14.707
This is what I want us to do when it comes

7
00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:17.715
to organizing our tax and money documents.

8
00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:22.012
I just want you to be really, really organized.

9
00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:24.066
And I know it might seem a little bit silly

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.579
to be this organized with tax documents,

11
00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.589
but I promise you, later on when you come back

12
00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.911
and look at these documents, and I promise you,

13
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:33.480
you'll need to come back to it eventually,

14
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.739
you'll feel much more comfortable

15
00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.700
with your financial situation.

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.396
Kind of like when you study for a final exam,

17
00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:42.483
and you go back and look at your notes

18
00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:45.628
from the semester or the term or whatever,

19
00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.723
you do much better if you're much more organized.

20
00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:51.411
Okay, so most people are really, really disorganized

21
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:54.394
when it comes to their money and taxes.

22
00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:56.171
And I used to be like this.

23
00:00:56.171 --> 00:01:00.338
And so I developed a system for you to use if you want.

24
00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:05.400
It actually involves printing out this attached pdf, okay.

25
00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:10.352
And it's included, this pdf here in PowerPoint

26
00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:14.158
as well as in pdf format, okay.

27
00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:17.675
I've included it in this lesson as an attachment

28
00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:20.469
in case you want to customize it.

29
00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.405
And the name of the document is called annual tax filing

30
00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:26.581
and it looks like this here.

31
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.081
And you can also get this on the Excel tab

32
00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:34.427
if you scroll down, you'll see the name of this file

33
00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.277
and you can click on it, if you're not getting it

34
00:01:36.277 --> 00:01:37.982
from within the course.

35
00:01:37.982 --> 00:01:39.208
Okay great.

36
00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:42.243
If you want, just go to exercise 13

37
00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:46.410
in your Excel dashboard called Exercise 13 Tax Organizer,

38
00:01:47.383 --> 00:01:48.864
if you're not already there.

39
00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:51.845
And you can choose to use that form I just showed you

40
00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.428
in Exercise 13 and click on the check boxes

41
00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:59.849
or you can actually do the paper version.

42
00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.285
So you can fill this out in Excel right here if you want to,

43
00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.575
click on the x in the boxes there,

44
00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:08.487
type over where you want to hard code in

45
00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:10.756
titles of your savings accounts, et cetera,

46
00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:14.086
and then hit the print button or print Save As pdf.

47
00:02:14.086 --> 00:02:16.388
I set this tab up so when you hit print,

48
00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:18.374
it's just that one page there

49
00:02:18.374 --> 00:02:21.378
which again looks like this here, okay.

50
00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:22.536
Your call.

51
00:02:22.536 --> 00:02:24.083
Now I wanna give you a bunch of options to do

52
00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:25.585
what makes most sense to you.

53
00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:29.273
Now before I explain how to use this one page snapshot

54
00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:32.433
of your finances, I recommend buying the following items.

55
00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:35.499
And I'll include the Amazon links for a couple

56
00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:36.883
of these items as well.

57
00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:39.013
So the first thing I want you to do

58
00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.215
is I want you to buy one of these things, okay.

59
00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:45.347
And you can actually write the year on the side

60
00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:47.459
so eventually you have every single year done.

61
00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.800
And this is called an accordion file,

62
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.299
'cause it looks like an accordion.

63
00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.403
When you open it up it has predefined names for you

64
00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:59.324
like insurance, finances, bills, your car, bank,

65
00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:00.602
whatever it is, right.

66
00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:03.723
You can fill in these files this way if you want to,

67
00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:05.470
but I got a better way for you.

68
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.274
Give me a second and I'll show you, okay.

69
00:03:07.274 --> 00:03:08.843
So there's a couple of examples here.

70
00:03:08.843 --> 00:03:12.933
And the one that I think is probably best

71
00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:16.777
is the cheapest one, and I love shopping on Amazon,

72
00:03:16.777 --> 00:03:19.432
because they have something called Amazon Basics,

73
00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.387
which means cheap stuff that works.

74
00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:25.554
And so this item here is their version of their accordion.

75
00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:30.105
And this is five bucks, five or six bucks.

76
00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:32.842
And there's the link right there.

77
00:03:32.842 --> 00:03:36.345
And so basically it expands and it's everything

78
00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.989
you really need to manage your finances.

79
00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.322
There's tabs and all that fun stuff as well, okay.

80
00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.547
And so I'll give you a couple more examples

81
00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:47.581
in a second here, okay.

82
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:49.414
And what you can do is

83
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.868
you can actually, you can throw in every monthly expense

84
00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.704
document that you have.

85
00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:01.795
And what I like to do is this.

86
00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:03.511
I'll show you.

87
00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:07.709
I like to actually create the monthlies ones like this.

88
00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.542
See January, February,

89
00:04:11.058 --> 00:04:12.473
March, and these are just envelopes

90
00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:14.510
and you can kind of put them in here, whatever.

91
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.369
And if you have, you can use this for multiple years

92
00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:20.629
by buying these green tabs or colored tabs,

93
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.003
just paste them over each year,

94
00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:24.447
kind of like on your license plate

95
00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:26.509
the little registration thing, right.

96
00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.751
And then I get bigger ones sometimes for education.

97
00:04:29.751 --> 00:04:32.021
You can tell my writing's awful,

98
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.858
insurance, house expenses, et cetera.

99
00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:37.691
For medical, whatever it might be.

100
00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:40.653
And just kind of categorize everything.

101
00:04:40.653 --> 00:04:43.771
And so, let me just drill down a little bit more detail

102
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:45.813
on how we're gonna go through this, okay.

103
00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:48.480
Buy one of these per year, okay,

104
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:54.335
and you can create your own tabs, if you wanted to

105
00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:56.761
and print them out, but I kind of like just writing

106
00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:58.501
on the side of it here.

107
00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:01.300
And I recommend actually gluing, see here,

108
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.463
gluing that form I spoke about here

109
00:05:04.463 --> 00:05:07.463
to the back of each back, each year.

110
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.261
And what you can do is you can check off each item

111
00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:14.474
as you put the items in there.

112
00:05:14.474 --> 00:05:18.376
Again, you can customize that one-pager here, okay.

113
00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:22.288
You can do that by opening up the PowerPoint version

114
00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:25.267
of the document, and I also saved it in pdf format

115
00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:27.437
so you can just download it, whatever,

116
00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:30.755
or just do the Excel version and hit print

117
00:05:30.755 --> 00:05:32.625
and then stick it on the box.

118
00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.384
So let's go through this.

119
00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:36.742
So, at the top here,

120
00:05:36.742 --> 00:05:39.325
you've got a bunch of, you got,

121
00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:42.543
first of all, enter the year.

122
00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:45.171
Then you've got your monthly bank statements.

123
00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:49.179
So enter in your savings, your checkings,

124
00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:52.335
and then just check off each month as you put them in here.

125
00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:54.237
Okay, each account you get in the mail.

126
00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:58.056
And I included a couple additional ones there

127
00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:00.162
if you wanted to add you own other accounts.

128
00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:02.538
And so as you get these bank statements in the mail,

129
00:06:02.538 --> 00:06:05.449
you're gonna put them in the box and then check the box

130
00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.142
to say that it's actually there.

131
00:06:07.142 --> 00:06:08.806
And if you have electronic versions,

132
00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:11.151
what you can do is you can just write the word

133
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:13.183
or the letter E inside these little boxes

134
00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:14.785
instead of checking it.

135
00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:17.591
And so once all the boxes have been checked for the year,

136
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:19.577
then you check on complete.

137
00:06:19.577 --> 00:06:22.378
And I apologize, my handwriting is just awful.

138
00:06:22.378 --> 00:06:24.783
But do that for each category, okay.

139
00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:28.599
So, this will save you a lot of aggravation, time, and money

140
00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.227
around tax season, I promise you.

141
00:06:30.227 --> 00:06:31.673
And future years as well,

142
00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:33.849
if you ever have to go back and look at older documents

143
00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.248
or other money accounts.

144
00:06:35.248 --> 00:06:37.435
I promise you, you will need to come back

145
00:06:37.435 --> 00:06:41.809
and look at many documents in this accordion in the future

146
00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:44.439
for each year, like if you, I don't know,

147
00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:46.359
if you wanna buy a house or you wanna buy a car,

148
00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:48.327
or what your address was in the past

149
00:06:48.327 --> 00:06:50.082
when you rented a place.

150
00:06:50.082 --> 00:06:53.137
And the next category here moving down, okay,

151
00:06:53.137 --> 00:06:55.804
is 12 monthly receipt envelopes.

152
00:06:58.275 --> 00:07:02.442
And these receipt envelopes, heavy, big, or small ones,

153
00:07:04.018 --> 00:07:07.297
and I like to use these ones here,

154
00:07:07.297 --> 00:07:11.301
which I buy from Office Depot and not online, okay.

155
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:12.555
Whoops.

156
00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:14.694
See how disorganized I am.

157
00:07:14.694 --> 00:07:15.807
Okay.

158
00:07:15.807 --> 00:07:18.973
And so when you put each one of those envelopes in here,

159
00:07:18.973 --> 00:07:22.291
right, then you're just gonna check in this box,

160
00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:25.324
okay, once there all here in this accordion.

161
00:07:25.324 --> 00:07:29.366
And after you accumulate receipts, just put them all

162
00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:31.542
in those envelopes on a monthly basis

163
00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:34.433
and then what you can do is you put them back

164
00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:36.121
in the box here and check the box.

165
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:39.336
And once all 12 monthly receipts envelopes are

166
00:07:39.336 --> 00:07:41.923
in the accordion, then just check

167
00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:45.447
off this complete item here, see complete,

168
00:07:45.447 --> 00:07:48.114
okay, on the top right hand corner.

169
00:07:48.114 --> 00:07:49.173
Okay, good.

170
00:07:49.173 --> 00:07:51.099
The next section down, this third section here,

171
00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:55.453
okay, is for investment or retirement accounts,

172
00:07:55.453 --> 00:07:57.035
if you have them.

173
00:07:57.035 --> 00:07:59.427
And so again, just check off the monthly boxes here

174
00:07:59.427 --> 00:08:03.455
as you receive your account statements in the mail

175
00:08:03.455 --> 00:08:05.363
and put them in here, okay.

176
00:08:05.363 --> 00:08:09.520
This'll save you a lot of aggravation, I promise you.

177
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.635
It will save you a lot of money as well in the long run.

178
00:08:12.635 --> 00:08:15.133
Let's keep moving down here, okay.

179
00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:19.300
Let's go on to the monthly mortgage or housing statements.

180
00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:23.133
And I own one house, I don't own two,

181
00:08:23.133 --> 00:08:25.524
some people have a cottage or whatever,

182
00:08:25.524 --> 00:08:27.475
a summer home, you can put that there as well, if you want.

183
00:08:27.475 --> 00:08:30.925
You can collect all your property tax documents as well

184
00:08:30.925 --> 00:08:33.132
and just throw them in each envelope as well

185
00:08:33.132 --> 00:08:35.981
or within this box somewhere.

186
00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:40.148
And what happens is right here, this red shaded area

187
00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:45.232
is really important, it's the tax section, okay.

188
00:08:45.232 --> 00:08:49.399
And I made this red as you absolutely have to have

189
00:08:50.457 --> 00:08:51.747
these documents in here,

190
00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:53.172
and these are just your tax documents

191
00:08:53.172 --> 00:08:56.781
like your W-2 Form in the U.S. your K-1, 1099,

192
00:08:56.781 --> 00:08:58.533
or whatever it might be.

193
00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:01.684
And if you don't have the forms at least one or two months

194
00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:03.897
before taxes are due from your employer

195
00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:06.339
or from anyone that hired you over the past year,

196
00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:10.012
or from companies that are supposed to send them to you,

197
00:09:10.012 --> 00:09:12.337
then call them right away, please.

198
00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:13.631
It's really important.

199
00:09:13.631 --> 00:09:15.227
You can't file taxes without those documents.

200
00:09:15.227 --> 00:09:17.097
And if you hired an accountant,

201
00:09:17.097 --> 00:09:19.943
your accountant will keep bothering you for this and say,

202
00:09:19.943 --> 00:09:21.662
where's your W-2, where's your, send it over,

203
00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:23.058
that sort of thing, okay.

204
00:09:23.058 --> 00:09:26.313
Tax forms have different names in different places

205
00:09:26.313 --> 00:09:28.783
as I mentioned before, it's called a W-2

206
00:09:28.783 --> 00:09:32.039
which is your salary tax form you get

207
00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.161
if you work for somebody, that sort of thing.

208
00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:36.886
And if you worked as a consultant, it's called a 1099,

209
00:09:36.886 --> 00:09:38.177
et cetera, okay.

210
00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.274
And so for all countries including the United States,

211
00:09:40.274 --> 00:09:43.689
please see this gray box here, okay,

212
00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:45.623
on the tax filing organizer,

213
00:09:45.623 --> 00:09:50.262
the organizer tab for helpful tax related internet addresses

214
00:09:50.262 --> 00:09:52.551
that you can click on, and hopefully they're helpful.

215
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:55.587
And if they're ever incorrect for whatever country

216
00:09:55.587 --> 00:09:57.874
you're in, let me know, I'll change it immediately.

217
00:09:57.874 --> 00:09:59.086
Okay.

218
00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:02.288
And you should not have to ask for any

219
00:10:02.288 --> 00:10:04.201
of the aforementioned tax documents I mentioned,

220
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:06.652
because they should've already been sent to you.

221
00:10:06.652 --> 00:10:08.617
But just in case you didn't receive them,

222
00:10:08.617 --> 00:10:10.531
just follow up and complete this box here

223
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:12.123
that you received them, okay.

224
00:10:12.123 --> 00:10:16.040
And as a quick side note, per this U.S. example

225
00:10:16.977 --> 00:10:20.105
of a tax form, you will see where to put

226
00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:22.855
in the W-2 tax information, okay.

227
00:10:23.986 --> 00:10:26.360
And this is the pink form I showed you before

228
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.375
and this is just a close-up of it.

229
00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:30.542
Lastly, at the bottom here

230
00:10:32.015 --> 00:10:35.182
of your tax filing document one-pager,

231
00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:39.249
I have a line listed for your financial goals,

232
00:10:39.249 --> 00:10:41.065
like paying off student debts

233
00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:43.213
or paying off a house by what year.

234
00:10:43.213 --> 00:10:45.622
And I also included a line with the location

235
00:10:45.622 --> 00:10:49.623
of your files on a computer, if they're on a computer.

236
00:10:49.623 --> 00:10:52.241
And I wrote here Blue Western Digital Drive.

237
00:10:52.241 --> 00:10:54.313
Okay, we're all different.

238
00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:56.882
By the way, if you wanna secure your Excel file

239
00:10:56.882 --> 00:10:59.384
in this course, right, 'cause it has a lot

240
00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:00.899
of your sensitive information in it,

241
00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:02.415
remember I didn't ask for your last name,

242
00:11:02.415 --> 00:11:04.079
only your first name or nickname early on.

243
00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:06.119
But what you can do is you can click

244
00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:08.071
on this secure file button here,

245
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:11.420
okay and just kind of keep your Excel documents

246
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.979
on your computer only and not on the cloud, please, okay.

247
00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:17.711
Identity theft is a massive issue

248
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.868
and we're gonna cover how to make sure

249
00:11:19.868 --> 00:11:22.697
you are not a victim of identity theft

250
00:11:22.697 --> 00:11:26.667
later in the course in this lecture here, okay.

251
00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:28.834
Next up down here, we have

252
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.087
a line item that calculates your net worth

253
00:11:33.087 --> 00:11:35.563
by taking your year end assets minus

254
00:11:35.563 --> 00:11:37.315
your year end liabilities.

255
00:11:37.315 --> 00:11:39.283
We discussed how to calculate your net worth

256
00:11:39.283 --> 00:11:41.287
when we talked about your balance sheet

257
00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:42.985
in exercise seven, okay.

258
00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:45.731
And tracking your net worth is a really good thing to track

259
00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:47.603
from one year to the next to make sure

260
00:11:47.603 --> 00:11:49.519
that your net worth is increasing

261
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:52.299
as you get closer to your financial goals, okay.

262
00:11:52.299 --> 00:11:53.899
So, below your net worth here,

263
00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:57.467
we have your year end total savings meaning

264
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.821
all savings you have, okay.

265
00:11:59.821 --> 00:12:03.376
Then just write down this amount here, okay,

266
00:12:03.376 --> 00:12:05.095
how much is in your retirement savings account

267
00:12:05.095 --> 00:12:06.561
et cetera, okay.

268
00:12:06.561 --> 00:12:08.001
And the reason I do this is eventually

269
00:12:08.001 --> 00:12:11.518
you're gonna have a bunch of boxes side by side,

270
00:12:11.518 --> 00:12:12.625
I don't know if you can see that,

271
00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:14.531
but I wrote black on black 2017,

272
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:16.419
you can see these numbers here.

273
00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:18.657
And you'll be able to go back and kind of look at

274
00:12:18.657 --> 00:12:22.749
how you're doing each year based on this snapshot here.

275
00:12:22.749 --> 00:12:24.267
Okay.

276
00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:27.322
Again, it's good to document all this stuff

277
00:12:27.322 --> 00:12:29.366
so you ensure that you're increasing

278
00:12:29.366 --> 00:12:31.253
the amount of money you've saved

279
00:12:31.253 --> 00:12:33.041
from one year to the next, okay.

280
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:34.949
And then below that line item, please enter

281
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:37.711
in the date that you filed your taxes.

282
00:12:37.711 --> 00:12:39.802
I've not filed mine yet,

283
00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:41.753
that's why it's blank, okay.

284
00:12:41.753 --> 00:12:43.382
The date that you filed your taxes

285
00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:45.269
and the dollar or currency amount

286
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:48.925
that you expect either have to pay in additional taxes,

287
00:12:48.925 --> 00:12:53.085
or how much you expect to receive via a tax refund.

288
00:12:53.085 --> 00:12:55.057
It's good to track this, okay.

289
00:12:55.057 --> 00:12:58.705
By the way that card there is from Monopoly.

290
00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:03.391
I was in the Toys R Us store here with my son Matthew

291
00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:06.459
when he was four, and he saw the Monopoly board game

292
00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:08.837
on the shelf in the store, he said,

293
00:13:08.837 --> 00:13:10.508
"Dad, look, they're now making

294
00:13:10.508 --> 00:13:12.743
"non-iPad version of Monopoly."

295
00:13:12.743 --> 00:13:14.354
Okay, sorry, moving on.

296
00:13:14.354 --> 00:13:18.425
At the bottom of the form we had the actually tax refunds

297
00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:21.865
or payments that you received or paid.

298
00:13:21.865 --> 00:13:24.844
And we are done with this year's taxes,

299
00:13:24.844 --> 00:13:27.255
then just file the accordion box away in storage

300
00:13:27.255 --> 00:13:30.319
and just start a new box for the new year, okay,

301
00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:31.950
and print out another form

302
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.008
like the one I showed you to stick on here.

303
00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:36.752
And you put them all stack up like this, okay.

304
00:13:36.752 --> 00:13:39.062
And it's actually quite fun to do and I like it.

305
00:13:39.062 --> 00:13:41.630
And the kids help out with this too, it's fun, it's fun.

306
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.211
So a couple more tips.

307
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.388
When you receive any bill or statement in the mail,

308
00:13:45.388 --> 00:13:48.388
I recommend placing them in a folder

309
00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:53.475
that looks like this, okay.

310
00:13:53.475 --> 00:13:55.933
And you can buy these really cheap online.

311
00:13:55.933 --> 00:13:59.207
This one cracked, unfortunately, but it's a, yeah, anyway.

312
00:13:59.207 --> 00:14:01.549
So, and what you do is this.

313
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.853
You put the bills here, okay.

314
00:14:03.853 --> 00:14:07.323
And you do not put them into your accordion file

315
00:14:07.323 --> 00:14:11.791
or folder there until you've read the statement, right

316
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:13.399
and looked for errors.

317
00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:15.307
As you get overcharged all the time

318
00:14:15.307 --> 00:14:16.890
on credit card statements, okay.

319
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.479
And maybe what you could do, if you want,

320
00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:22.039
is set a weekly alarm on your phone

321
00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:24.455
on like a Saturday morning to remind you

322
00:14:24.455 --> 00:14:26.193
to pay the bills, okay,

323
00:14:26.193 --> 00:14:28.160
and to look through the statements

324
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.403
while you enjoy your homemade

325
00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:32.539
and lower cost cup of coffee or tea.

326
00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:37.242
And once you've actually gone through them, right,

327
00:14:37.242 --> 00:14:39.521
and Christine and I will go through this,

328
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:40.989
and sometimes I won't know,

329
00:14:40.989 --> 00:14:42.354
has she done yet, have I done yet?

330
00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:44.257
And that's why we like to put them in here first

331
00:14:44.257 --> 00:14:45.839
before letting them graduate

332
00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.435
or move up to the accordion box.

333
00:14:47.435 --> 00:14:51.602
And what you can do is you can actually get a stamp

334
00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:55.951
and you can get a stamp that's called

335
00:14:55.951 --> 00:14:58.509
Review the Document or one called Paid.

336
00:14:58.509 --> 00:15:00.037
And I actually bought this,

337
00:15:00.037 --> 00:15:04.204
I think I got this from Office Depot, it's just a red stamp.

338
00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:07.721
And it basically what you do is

339
00:15:09.044 --> 00:15:12.275
once you've gone through a bill and paid it,

340
00:15:12.275 --> 00:15:14.973
you just click this red stamp thing

341
00:15:14.973 --> 00:15:17.547
and it looks like that, hi, I'm seven.

342
00:15:17.547 --> 00:15:19.220
Anyway, that's what it looks like, right.

343
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.630
Remember when you used to get in the night club,

344
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.040
they used to stamp on me, where, anyway.

345
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.139
Anyway,

346
00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:25.451
and it's important to do this, because

347
00:15:25.451 --> 00:15:29.088
one late payment, just one late payment

348
00:15:29.088 --> 00:15:31.566
can not only cost you a lot of money

349
00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:33.527
in interest related penalty payments,

350
00:15:33.527 --> 00:15:36.987
but it can also really hurt you in your credit rating

351
00:15:36.987 --> 00:15:40.588
which might mean you won't get a loan to buy a house

352
00:15:40.588 --> 00:15:44.835
because of one, and yes, I mean one late payment.

353
00:15:44.835 --> 00:15:46.439
Right, it's crazy.

354
00:15:46.439 --> 00:15:48.575
And I'm gonna discuss your credit score,

355
00:15:48.575 --> 00:15:51.171
your credit rating, how to improve your credit rating

356
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:52.741
later in the course in this lecture here.

357
00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:56.573
And again, we got the kids to kind of help out

358
00:15:56.573 --> 00:15:59.337
with this stuff and they love using this stamp thing

359
00:15:59.337 --> 00:16:03.151
and my older two sons, Andrew and Matthew,

360
00:16:03.151 --> 00:16:06.345
and Dillon, poor guy, he was sleeping,

361
00:16:06.345 --> 00:16:07.963
and we did this to him.

362
00:16:07.963 --> 00:16:10.473
So it wasn't me, I promise you.

363
00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:14.710
All right, lastly, put warranties in the accordion as well,

364
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.015
if you get them.

365
00:16:16.015 --> 00:16:18.647
And just always think about in hindsight,

366
00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:20.286
what year did I buy that appliance?

367
00:16:20.286 --> 00:16:21.737
Oh yeah, it was 2015.

368
00:16:21.737 --> 00:16:23.992
Okay, then the warranty information

369
00:16:23.992 --> 00:16:25.679
is gonna be in the 2015 box.

370
00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:28.229
And one little side note about warranties,

371
00:16:28.229 --> 00:16:31.119
don't ever, ever, ever buy extended warranties

372
00:16:31.119 --> 00:16:34.013
on any lower price electronics item.

373
00:16:34.013 --> 00:16:37.195
It's usually a ripoff, right?

374
00:16:37.195 --> 00:16:39.239
Amazon started to do this, too.

375
00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:41.691
They're starting to actually have popups saying,

376
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:43.293
wait, before you buy this product,

377
00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:44.571
do you want an extended warranty?

378
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:46.206
Okay, all right, good.

379
00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:49.347
So we're done now with the offline tax organizing system.

380
00:16:49.347 --> 00:16:52.342
Okay, and if you have any questions on how to do this

381
00:16:52.342 --> 00:16:54.347
or better ideas, then please share it

382
00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.649
with the rest of us or let me know.

383
00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:58.841
And so in the next lecture I'm gonna outline

384
00:16:58.841 --> 00:17:02.683
some really cool online apps and websites

385
00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:04.649
that you can use to

386
00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:06.399
manage your finances.

387
00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:11.323
Although you know I prefer doing everything

388
00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:13.072
on my computer for security reasons.

389
00:17:13.072 --> 00:17:15.849
So if you do use software, I recommend using software

390
00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.929
that only runs on your computer.

391
00:17:18.929 --> 00:17:21.827
We're gonna cover this in a lot more detail very soon.

392
00:17:21.827 --> 00:17:24.910
You know, before we end this lecture,

393
00:17:25.835 --> 00:17:29.693
I mentioned writing down your short financial goals

394
00:17:29.693 --> 00:17:33.860
in this section, in the bottom section here in the course.

395
00:17:38.335 --> 00:17:40.579
And anybody that I've ever met

396
00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:42.169
that's extraordinarily successful

397
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:45.177
has written down their goals.

398
00:17:45.177 --> 00:17:46.862
Just remember nobody's smarter than you,

399
00:17:46.862 --> 00:17:48.427
especially when you write down your goals.

400
00:17:48.427 --> 00:17:49.851
I know it's a little bit out there,

401
00:17:49.851 --> 00:17:51.055
but I really do believe it.

402
00:17:51.055 --> 00:17:52.909
And if you haven't already watched the Steve Jobs video

403
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:54.540
called Nobody Is Smarter Than You,

404
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.530
then please do so at this link.

405
00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.280 line:15% 
Thanks, and I'll see you in the next lecture.
