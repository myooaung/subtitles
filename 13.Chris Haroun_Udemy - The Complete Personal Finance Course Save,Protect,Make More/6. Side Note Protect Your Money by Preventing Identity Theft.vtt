1
00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:03.869
<v ->Unfortunately, many of us will become a victim</v>

2
00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:06.296
of identity theft in our lifetime.

3
00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:08.557
And this will only get worse,

4
00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:10.467
so we need to be preemptive,

5
00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:11.699
we need to be vigilant,

6
00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.507
we need to be proactive

7
00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:16.059
to ensure that nobody steals our identity,

8
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.617
which can literally ruin your life.

9
00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.967
And so, in the past,

10
00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.895
if I lost a wallet, you know,

11
00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:26.447
I would just call up the credit card companies,

12
00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:27.898
which happened to me in London once,

13
00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:30.735
and cancel all of my credit cards, okay?

14
00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:32.194
It's not that simple any more.

15
00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:35.421
Because, you know, we might not find out

16
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:37.546
that somebody stole our financial information

17
00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:38.775
for many months,

18
00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:40.805
and sometimes years.

19
00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:44.506
It eventually, there's something called RFID theft,

20
00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:46.314
which is gonna be common.

21
00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:49.747
RFID stands for radio frequency identification,

22
00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:50.839
I think, yeah.

23
00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.268
So RFID theft's gonna be common.

24
00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:55.589
And that means people, this is coming.

25
00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.181
Right, people will steal your financial information

26
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:03.244
wirelessly from your pocket without touching, okay?

27
00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:05.690
And without taking your credit cards, right?

28
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.149
And so it's happening already,

29
00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.141
and the best way to protect about it

30
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:12.641
is to buy RFID blockers, okay?

31
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:18.138
And so, a lot of bags you can buy now, actually,

32
00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:19.901
have RFID blockers.

33
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:24.361
I'll show you here in this particular bag of mine.

34
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.442
Okay, so right here, you see that red,

35
00:01:27.442 --> 00:01:28.275
see there?

36
00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:30.183
That's an RFID blocker, okay?

37
00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:31.157
I don't know if you can see red there.

38
00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.092
But whatever.

39
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.010
So, and that's obviously where I put my

40
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.679
credit cards and stuff.

41
00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.995
All right, nice candy bar I can eat later.

42
00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:41.061
I forgot about it.

43
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:41.930
(laughs)

44
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.597
Okay, oh, and another one is an RFID wallet.

45
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.901
And I made this one, actually.

46
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.162
I should say, I put it together.

47
00:01:51.162 --> 00:01:53.359
So let me show you.

48
00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:54.930
This here is my...

49
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.261
This is an RFID wallet, okay?

50
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:59.896
And this thing, this cost 10 bucks, right?

51
00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:00.839
This RFID wallet.

52
00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:02.319 line:15% 
I'll give you the link here as well.

53
00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.578 line:15% 
Right, and then I spent $18 on this iPhone case, okay?

54
00:02:05.578 --> 00:02:06.557 line:15% 
And it's silicon,

55
00:02:06.557 --> 00:02:08.997 line:15% 
which means I can glue something to it, okay?

56
00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:10.658 line:15% 
Now, crazy glue doesn't work with this.

57
00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:12.299 line:15% 
But this is an RFID wallet

58
00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.800 line:15% 
that I actually used silicon and glued to it.

59
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.482
And you know when you get a credit card in the mail

60
00:02:16.482 --> 00:02:18.439
and there's that kinda stuff,

61
00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.901
the glue stuff behind the credit card

62
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:21.882
that sticks it to the piece of paper?

63
00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:22.839
That's silicon.

64
00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:23.991
So you can rub it off here.

65
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:25.711
But it actually seals nicely there.

66
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.711
And so this is an RFID blocker, okay?

67
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:28.561
See that?

68
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:29.621
It's kinda neat, eh?

69
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:30.802
Kinda cool.

70
00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:31.635
Okay.

71
00:02:32.698 --> 00:02:33.679
I'll turn that around there.

72
00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:34.558
Yeah.

73
00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:35.577
Isn't that wild?

74
00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:38.908
So I am a nerd, I know, right?

75
00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:40.639
And soon we won't be using these.

76
00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.918
Everything'll be wireless, whatever.

77
00:02:41.918 --> 00:02:43.250
But, you know.

78
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.008
So that's what an RFID blocker is.

79
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.399
And again, I give you the links here to glue it.

80
00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.589
Use silicon glue, not crazy glue, okay?

81
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.770
Also, please be careful.

82
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.901
If any of your sensitive documents are saved online,

83
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.791
and this is why I include the security button here

84
00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:01.799
on your Complete Personal Finance dashboard file,

85
00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.661
and I did not ask you to enter in your real last name

86
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.421
in the settings section,

87
00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:07.690
or any account numbers.

88
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.751
And you could even include your,

89
00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:11.110
I don't know, your nickname if you wanted to, okay?

90
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.079
Okay, and so save this file itself out,

91
00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.621
offline only, please, okay?

92
00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:20.501
And when it comes to your credit cards,

93
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.471
the whole sign the back thing is a joke, right?

94
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:26.319
It really is ridiculous of signing the back, right?

95
00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.951
And so I'll show you.

96
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:29.831
Let me just take out my nerd,

97
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.664
you know, nerd wallet.

98
00:03:30.664 --> 00:03:32.250
Let me take out my credit cards here

99
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.917
and let me show you.

100
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:36.551
Okay.

101
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.618
Here we go, okay.

102
00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:41.090
So this here is a Virgin America Visa

103
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.444
that I'm actually canceling because my,

104
00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:46.439
somebody stole this number.

105
00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.810
I don't know where they did it.

106
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.589
But anyway, you see the back there?

107
00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:50.770
I don't know if you can see that.

108
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.141
It says see ID, okay?

109
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.558
So whenever I go, it's there,

110
00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:57.410
and I pay with this thing,

111
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.169
or I used to, whatever,

112
00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.311
and they wanna see my signature,

113
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:02.459
they would just ask for my driver's license, right?

114
00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.834
It's so ridiculous that we give our credit card away

115
00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:07.196
to people to...

116
00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.889
At dinners and stuff.

117
00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.669
Anyway, it is what it is.

118
00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:11.578
At least in Europe,

119
00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:13.519
they actually bring a little thing to your table

120
00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.901
where you can swipe right there,

121
00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:16.079
which makes a lot of sense.

122
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.912
Okay.

123
00:04:16.912 --> 00:04:19.111
Also, destroy all...

124
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:22.503
Destroy all your hotel cards, okay?

125
00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:25.062
Because these hotel cards, right?

126
00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:29.381
They contain a lot of your personal information, right?

127
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.053
Already on here when you check in the hotel, right?

128
00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:34.101
And you gotta destroy it.

129
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:34.959
And I'll show you how,

130
00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:37.122
very soon, how to do that, but...

131
00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:39.322
And never give anybody the three or four-digit

132
00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:43.072
credit card verification code over the phone.

133
00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:45.863
Just don't do that, please.

134
00:04:45.863 --> 00:04:47.085
It's just not worth it.

135
00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:49.703
And then never give your email or phone number away

136
00:04:49.703 --> 00:04:51.285
when buying anything ever, whatever.

137
00:04:51.285 --> 00:04:52.282
Just always ask

138
00:04:52.282 --> 00:04:55.763
and only give it to them if you have to,

139
00:04:55.763 --> 00:04:57.815
and anyway, we covered that before.

140
00:04:57.815 --> 00:04:59.695
Also explicitly tell people

141
00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:03.557
to not put you on any distribution lists

142
00:05:03.557 --> 00:05:05.031
when you're at a store buying something

143
00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:06.871
and asked for an email address, right?

144
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:08.362
Or just open another email address

145
00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:11.582
for only stuff that you don't care about, right?

146
00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:13.921
And then what I actually do is I,

147
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:15.642
I search my inbox every week or so,

148
00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:16.973
my Gmail inbox,

149
00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:19.186
for the word unsubscribe, okay?

150
00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:21.543
And then I just click unsubscribe on all the emails

151
00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:23.343
that I don't wanna be on, okay?

152
00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:25.050
I don't know how I get on those lists, but I do.

153
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.831
And never give your social security or social insurance

154
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:29.971
or government issued ID number to anyone

155
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:32.121
unless you absolutely have to,

156
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:33.743
and only if it's in person, okay?

157
00:05:33.743 --> 00:05:35.461
Be careful.

158
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:39.261
And just, you wanna shred all receipts, okay?

159
00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:43.428
And you can buy these shredders for relatively cheap online.

160
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.543
Let me see if I can get it in here.

161
00:05:47.543 --> 00:05:48.743
Here is one here.

162
00:05:48.743 --> 00:05:52.493 line:15% 
And actually also shred credit cards.

163
00:05:52.493 --> 00:05:53.503 line:15% 
You see right here?

164
00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:55.533 line:15% 
You can put the credit card in here.

165
00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.242 line:15% 
And this is Amazon Basics.

166
00:05:57.242 --> 00:05:58.223 line:15% 
I love Amazon Basics.

167
00:05:58.223 --> 00:05:59.093 line:15% 
The cheapest stuff,

168
00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:00.770 line:15% 
and it works great, whatever.

169
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.445 line:15% 
And here's the link to get it, as well, right?

170
00:06:03.445 --> 00:06:05.463
So don't put your tie close to this thing.

171
00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:06.413
Not that I wear a tie.

172
00:06:06.413 --> 00:06:07.554
I don't even know how to tie one.

173
00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:09.133
But anyway, keep it away from kids, too.

174
00:06:09.133 --> 00:06:11.032
And I shred all of our stuff,

175
00:06:11.032 --> 00:06:12.743
because somebody could easily go through your trash.

176
00:06:12.743 --> 00:06:14.413
Easily, right?

177
00:06:14.413 --> 00:06:16.634
And they can get so much financial information

178
00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:18.485
that it's crazy.

179
00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:22.045
I wasn't like this until my credit card got stolen,

180
00:06:22.045 --> 00:06:23.885
or my number, in the past.

181
00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:26.154
And if it hasn't happened to you yet,

182
00:06:26.154 --> 00:06:28.274
it might if you're not careful.

183
00:06:28.274 --> 00:06:29.953
I certainly was not careful before.

184
00:06:29.953 --> 00:06:30.870
Anyway, so.

185
00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:36.317
Use private mode when you use browsers, too, okay?

186
00:06:36.317 --> 00:06:40.066
Especially if you're not using your own device

187
00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:40.965
to look at the internet.

188
00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:42.366
So, for example, I don't know,

189
00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:44.727
if you check email on a computer at the Apple Store

190
00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:45.898
or a library,

191
00:06:45.898 --> 00:06:47.416
just go to private mode, okay?

192
00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:51.147
Which is often called incognito mode, okay?

193
00:06:51.147 --> 00:06:53.485
And you can go to file, open, whatever,

194
00:06:53.485 --> 00:06:55.252
private mode, that sort of thing, okay?

195
00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:56.465
And I use Chrome, which is great.

196
00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:58.847
And always review all transactions

197
00:06:58.847 --> 00:07:00.937
on all of your credit card statements.

198
00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:03.185
And I promise you that you will find

199
00:07:03.185 --> 00:07:06.396
at least one questionable transaction every single year,

200
00:07:06.396 --> 00:07:09.287
at a minimum, if you look, okay?

201
00:07:09.287 --> 00:07:11.385
And cancel your credit card

202
00:07:11.385 --> 00:07:14.105
or get a new credit card every year

203
00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:16.204
so that recurring charges stop.

204
00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:19.167
Like the Xbox Live charge I had for years,

205
00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:20.355
I finally got rid of.

206
00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:23.105
And it's really hard to keep track of online transactions

207
00:07:23.105 --> 00:07:24.105
that we make.

208
00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:28.515
And we often click I Agree to online legal contracts

209
00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:30.294
all the time without reading them.

210
00:07:30.294 --> 00:07:33.385
And who the heck has time to read that stuff, okay?

211
00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:37.155
And I promise you this is only gonna get worse, okay?

212
00:07:37.155 --> 00:07:39.654
And one other thing I wanna mention is this.

213
00:07:39.654 --> 00:07:43.075
Download pop-up and ad blockers for your browser,

214
00:07:43.075 --> 00:07:44.915
as well, okay?

215
00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:46.515
And actually, also,

216
00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:47.403
I wanna mention this one, sorry.

217
00:07:47.403 --> 00:07:50.123
Place a hold on your mail if you go away

218
00:07:50.123 --> 00:07:53.465
for even just a few days, okay?

219
00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:55.035
And, you know, have antivirus

220
00:07:55.035 --> 00:07:56.683
and firewall software up to date

221
00:07:56.683 --> 00:07:58.614
and installed on your computer

222
00:07:58.614 --> 00:07:59.863
from a reputable company,

223
00:07:59.863 --> 00:08:03.030
and certainly not this one here, okay?

224
00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:07.211
Okay, and then call the three credit reporting agencies,

225
00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:09.753
or however many agencies there are in your country,

226
00:08:09.753 --> 00:08:12.670
and ask the credit reporting agency

227
00:08:13.643 --> 00:08:15.265
to freeze your credit account

228
00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:17.873
so nobody has access to it if you want to.

229
00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:20.123
And you do have that legal right.

230
00:08:20.123 --> 00:08:23.323
Just ask them first if freezing your credit account

231
00:08:23.323 --> 00:08:26.803
is gonna have a negative impact on your credit score

232
00:08:26.803 --> 00:08:27.886
or not, okay?

233
00:08:29.624 --> 00:08:31.874
And then you have to unfreeze it when you wanna get a loan

234
00:08:31.874 --> 00:08:33.595
so they can check.

235
00:08:33.595 --> 00:08:35.126
And, you know,

236
00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:37.502
change your home wifi password often,

237
00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:41.854
and all passwords that you use online, obviously, as well.

238
00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.873
Order your credit report at least once a year

239
00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:48.363
and check to see if there were no accounts that were opened

240
00:08:48.363 --> 00:08:50.233
not by you, but by somebody else.

241
00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:52.832
And a lot of us have already been hacked

242
00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.323
identify fraud wise,

243
00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:56.222
which is hurting our credit rating right now.

244
00:08:56.222 --> 00:08:57.782
We just don't know it, right?

245
00:08:57.782 --> 00:09:00.462
So you gotta be vigilant with this stuff, okay?

246
00:09:00.462 --> 00:09:03.923
And if your country has a do not call website,

247
00:09:03.923 --> 00:09:06.462
go to it and make sure your phone numbers

248
00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:10.202
and/or email addresses are registered

249
00:09:10.202 --> 00:09:12.123
so people don't solicit money from you,

250
00:09:12.123 --> 00:09:13.632
which can drive you nuts, right?

251
00:09:13.632 --> 00:09:15.406
And just for more details on identity theft,

252
00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:17.906
here's one website to look at.
