00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:03.347
<v Narrator>Let's talk about section D</v>

2
00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:05.128
which is sector and stock drivers.

3
00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:08.668
So basically, this here will tell you

4
00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:11.175
what makes a stock move.

5
00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.270
And some of it is prepopulated for you

6
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.393
meaning the yellow cells

7
00:00:14.393 --> 00:00:16.264
and the other ones you have to enter yourself.

8
00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:18.912
And I actually want you to go ahead and do this

9
00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:21.876
with all of your stocks and commodities and bonds

10
00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:23.549
and real estate investments, trust investments

11
00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:25.529
that you'll add to this dashboard.

12
00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.036
I want you to do this because I want you to understand

13
00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:31.013
what makes those go up or down.

14
00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:35.808
And so, yellow means it's already been calculated for you.

15
00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:40.242
And what this is doing is if the stock is in the S&amp;P 500

16
00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:44.813
which means these ones here and not the ETFs,

17
00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:48.491
then what I've done is I've created logic here

18
00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:52.431
so that it'll tell you what is the primary driver

19
00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:53.964
for a stock meaning the catalyst,

20
00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:55.723
meaning what makes it go up or down.

21
00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:56.819
And it's not perfect

22
00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:59.253
but I just want you to kind of understand

23
00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:00.389
that there's usually one or two things

24
00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.082
that makes every stock moves.

25
00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:04.614
And so for Apple, it's product cycle.

26
00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:06.940
In fact, for any thing that's information technology,

27
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.079
I'll highlight all them here.

28
00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.194
It's product cycle based.

29
00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:14.819
Okay and you can see they're all IT here, okay.

30
00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.481
If it's industrials like General Electric,

31
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:20.065
it's usually healthy gross domestic product growth.

32
00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:21.588
And we'll talk about GDPs soon.

33
00:01:21.588 --> 00:01:23.826
But all you gotta know about GDP is

34
00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:27.986
GDP is basically the revenue for a country, okay.

35
00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:30.817
Great and so when the revenue for a country is growing fast,

36
00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:32.832
meaning when the economy is doing well,

37
00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:37.139
then stocks that are industrial like GE or Caterpillar

38
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:40.222
or Komatsu in Japan, tend to do well.

39
00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:45.485
Okay and then for defensive stocks like Coca Cola

40
00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:48.173
which is somewhat countercyclical,

41
00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:50.689
I wrote that there's no driver for them.

42
00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.307
But these stocks tend to outperform

43
00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:56.394
meaning the consumer staples in defensive stocks,

44
00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:57.818
when the economy is not doing well.

45
00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:01.155
So Campbell's Soup for example,

46
00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:04.267
that company and that ticker will outperform

47
00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:05.751
because it's defensive.

48
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.788
You know, you're still gonna eat soup in down markets

49
00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:10.621
'cause you gotta eat.

50
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:11.746
Soup is good food.

51
00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:12.579
Okay.

52
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:14.956
All right so that's sector drive.

53
00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:19.410
Okay and again, yellow means please don't touch this.

54
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.304
You can just type here.

55
00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:23.471
Okay so in this case here,

56
00:02:24.798 --> 00:02:27.251
I wrote down what are other drivers.

57
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.988
And I kept this column here for ya to hardcode

58
00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:33.039
meaning to type in your own stuff.

59
00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.703
Because not every stock you're investing in

60
00:02:35.703 --> 00:02:37.980
is obviously going to be in the S&amp;P.

61
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.634
And not every stock is gonna have the same drivers.

62
00:02:41.634 --> 00:02:42.811
Not every tech stock.

63
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:46.240
Okay so you can type them in here, okay.

64
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.874
So, okay that's great.

65
00:02:47.874 --> 00:02:51.541
Now, this here is a one-time catalyst, okay.

66
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:57.128
So, say we're in the future

67
00:02:57.128 --> 00:02:59.545
and Apple is going to release

68
00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:05.127
iPhone eight million (laughing).

69
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:08.484
You know what I mean.

70
00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:11.852
Then, that is an important thing to know

71
00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:14.162
because that might cause the stock to go up

72
00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:14.995
when it's announced.

73
00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:16.451
That sort of thing.

74
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:18.364
Okay, iPhone eight, nine, 10, 11, whatever it is.

75
00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.645
iPhone X, okay, you get the idea.

76
00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:24.046
And I wrote here, an example is the Beijing Olympics.

77
00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.836
So, when I worked,

78
00:03:25.836 --> 00:03:27.598
I worked at a couple of hedge funds

79
00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:31.124
and I was in New York before the Beijing Olympics.

80
00:03:31.124 --> 00:03:33.433
And my portfolio manager

81
00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.365
at one of the hedge funds I worked at said

82
00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:38.694
let's invest in everything that is going to do well

83
00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:40.731
because of the Beijing Olympics.

84
00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:44.781
And what happened was stocks that were,

85
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:47.393
that had stuff that was used to make stuff

86
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.138
for the Beijing Olympics did well

87
00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:50.492
ahead of the Beijing Olympics

88
00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:52.927
like every commodity company on the planet.

89
00:03:52.927 --> 00:03:55.226
That sort of thing, okay.

90
00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:58.541
And then here, this is just for additional comments

91
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.714
that you might have here.

92
00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:04.607
And we are done discussing sector and stock drivers.

93
00:04:04.607 --> 00:04:06.300
If you have questions on that, please let me know.

94
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.505
Otherwise, in the next lecture we'll talk about

95
00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:11.304
your investment research in section eight.

96
00:04:11.304 --> 00:04:12.137
Thank you.
