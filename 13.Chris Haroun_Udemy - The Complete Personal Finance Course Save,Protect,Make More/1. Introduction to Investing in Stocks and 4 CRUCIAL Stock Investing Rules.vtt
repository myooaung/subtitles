1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.637
<v ->Remember when we spoke about your balance sheet</v>

2
00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:05.430
in exercise number seven, and how all of the stuff

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.614
in your possession, meaning assets, is either owned by

4
00:00:08.614 --> 00:00:12.197
a bank or owned by you, you meaning equity.

5
00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:18.760
So companies can raise money in two similar ways.

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.007
One way is by getting a loan, meaning a liability,

7
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.174
which in many cases is a bond, and they will have to pay

8
00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:31.789
back this loan, meaning the bond, because of the loan,

9
00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.580
and the other way companies raise money

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.179
by selling part of their company to you and I, right?

11
00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.744
And that means they sell stocks, meaning they sell equity

12
00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:43.661
in their company to us.

13
00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:48.306
Now governments cannot sell parts of themselves

14
00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:52.139
to us or other governments or other companies.

15
00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.692
Governments don't issue stocks.

16
00:00:55.692 --> 00:00:59.527
Governments issue bonds, meaning loans,

17
00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:02.972
so they can pay for stuff like building bridges or roads

18
00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:05.139
or parks or airports, etc.

19
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.708
And so stocks have had an annual average return

20
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:12.541
since the 1920s of about 10%.

21
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:17.134
Government bonds, however, have had an annual average return

22
00:01:17.134 --> 00:01:21.217
of 5%, and we're gonna talk about stocks now

23
00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.669
and we will discuss bonds a little bit later.

24
00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:29.482
Stocks are riskier, so please own more stocks

25
00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:31.040
when you are younger,

26
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.572
and we'll talk about diversification soon, okay?

27
00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:36.287
Bonds are less risky than stocks,

28
00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:40.215
so please own more bonds when you're older.

29
00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:41.603
And so we're gonna talk about how to diversify

30
00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:45.548
your investments later as I mentioned, but for now,

31
00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:48.321
we're gonna tweak this, but I'm want to give you

32
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:52.488
a simple risk management-based rule for you to understand

33
00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:55.444
how much in terms of stocks you should own

34
00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:59.347
and how much bonds, and I'm gonna build on this a lot later

35
00:01:59.347 --> 00:02:02.496
and change this a bit but here's what we're gonna do, okay?

36
00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:06.293
I want you to take 100 minus your age,

37
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.564
and that is the percent of your investments

38
00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:12.463
that should be in riskier investments, okay?

39
00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:15.605
For example, if you are 70 years old,

40
00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:20.506
then 100 minus 70 equals 30, and this is how much

41
00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:23.486
as a percent of your portfolio to think about investing

42
00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:26.966
in riskier investments like stocks, okay?

43
00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:29.886
The other 70% of your portfolio

44
00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:32.276
should probably be in lower-risk investments

45
00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:35.192
with lower return potential

46
00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:38.210
as we can't recover quickly enough if we lose money

47
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.941
when we get older, okay?

48
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:42.512
So again, I'm gonna tweak this 100 minus your age

49
00:02:42.512 --> 00:02:45.852
diversification strategy soon and build more logic

50
00:02:45.852 --> 00:02:47.163
on top of it.

51
00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:49.406
Okay, no more talk about diversification

52
00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:50.664
for a little while now.

53
00:02:50.664 --> 00:02:54.907
Let's just focus on individual investments.

54
00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:56.888
And as you know,

55
00:02:56.888 --> 00:03:01.385
I designed your investment portfolio management system,

56
00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:04.788
meaning your portfolio gray button here,

57
00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:08.128
I designed it so that it can account for stocks,

58
00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:11.217
commodities, bonds, and real estate investment trusts

59
00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:12.050
and more.

60
00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.638
What I'm going to do in a minute is I'm gonna go through

61
00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:18.295
your investment portfolio management system

62
00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:21.417
in a lot of detail, meaning I am going to explain

63
00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:25.715
all of the columns of data in your portfolio.

64
00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:28.877
But before I do that, I want to discuss

65
00:03:28.877 --> 00:03:32.692
four stock market investing best practices,

66
00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:35.547
or four rules that I've learned in my many years

67
00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:39.714
of making mistakes from investing and some successes too.

68
00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:45.300
Okay, stock picking rule number one is we don't ever trade.

69
00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.512
We don't ever trade or else investing in stocks

70
00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:50.510
is like a casino

71
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.302
and you can't accumulate wealth, and Warren Buffett said,

72
00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:56.955
"The longer the view, the wiser the intention."

73
00:03:56.955 --> 00:03:59.720
So before buying any stock,

74
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.924
again we'll ask ourselves that simple question.

75
00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:05.701
In five years, is this company going to be more relevant

76
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:08.864
or less relevant than it is today?

77
00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:12.542
Most Wall Street investors are fooled by randomness

78
00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:15.090
and they're not long-term focused enough,

79
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.581
and this is why 95% of mutual funds

80
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.090
cannot outperform indexes.

81
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.358
And you will beat these mutual funds as well.

82
00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:26.112
Number two, rule number two.

83
00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:28.445
Do your own research always.

84
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:32.773
We need to always, always, always please form

85
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:37.060
our own opinions as the opinions of other people,

86
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.705
especially when it involves money is biased.

87
00:04:39.705 --> 00:04:41.508
People are biased, okay?

88
00:04:41.508 --> 00:04:45.090
I'm not saying they're unethical but hear me out here.

89
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.432
When you go to a clothing store,

90
00:04:47.432 --> 00:04:49.042
and the salesperson at the clothing store

91
00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:51.687
works on commission, they'll often influence you

92
00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:54.040
to buy certain items because of the fact

93
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.871
that they get commissions, and it gets absolutely worse

94
00:04:57.871 --> 00:05:01.134
as you know when buying real estate or a car,

95
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.564
as they are often, these salespeople are thinking

96
00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:06.157
with their wallet.

97
00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:08.428
They don't have your best interest in mind.

98
00:05:08.428 --> 00:05:11.994
Also, please never, ever, ever, ever, ever, please,

99
00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:16.233
never rely on the media for investment advice, okay?

100
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.677
Why?

101
00:05:17.677 --> 00:05:22.116
Because they're biased and because the people they interview

102
00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:24.899
on television are almost always biased as well,

103
00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:27.266
and I'm not saying the people they interview

104
00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:30.795
are unethical at all, but the people they interview

105
00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:33.911
are investment professionals that already own stocks

106
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:36.344
and of course, they're gonna say positive things

107
00:05:36.344 --> 00:05:38.758
about the stocks they own.

108
00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:42.273
Also, if a financial journalist interviews a CEO

109
00:05:42.273 --> 00:05:45.115
of a company, of course the CEO's gonna say great things

110
00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:46.448
about that company.

111
00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:48.421
You know, they're great salespeople.

112
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:50.664
That's how they became CEO, right?

113
00:05:50.664 --> 00:05:52.821
It's not just because they're smarter than us.

114
00:05:52.821 --> 00:05:54.229
You know, they're just great salespeople,

115
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.594
and CEOs are probably the best salespeople in the world

116
00:05:57.594 --> 00:06:00.087
so just be careful, and I want you to question everything.

117
00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:01.881
Always do your own research.

118
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.227
Protect yourself and your family,

119
00:06:04.227 --> 00:06:06.483
and just don't watch finance programs

120
00:06:06.483 --> 00:06:07.928
because they're very biased.

121
00:06:07.928 --> 00:06:10.912
You know that the media can really mess with your head,

122
00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.515
and if a friend of yours one day comes up to you

123
00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:18.700
offering you the chance to invest in their company,

124
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.466
I want you to ask yourself one basic question in your head.

125
00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:25.630
Why am I so lucky to be given this opportunity?

126
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.656
Okay, just question everything please.

127
00:06:27.656 --> 00:06:29.873
Okay, I think you know what I'm getting at.

128
00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:31.706
And so I'm gonna show you more information

129
00:06:31.706 --> 00:06:34.490
on how to do your own research in the next lesson

130
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.693
when you go through your investment portfolio

131
00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:38.377
management system.

132
00:06:38.377 --> 00:06:39.597
And if you get a chance,

133
00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:43.052
I want you to please watch this video on the awful impact

134
00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:47.219
that the media had on many people's life savings in 2008.

135
00:06:48.195 --> 00:06:50.519 line:15% 
<v ->The president and I talked to earlier in the day yesterday</v>

136
00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:52.134 line:15% 
about watching it.

137
00:06:52.134 --> 00:06:54.134
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

138
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:56.687
<v Narrator>What was it?</v>

139
00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:59.042
A major speech, a legislative breakthrough?

140
00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:01.369
<v ->How the hell did we end up here, Mr. Kramer?</v>

141
00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.801 line:15% 
<v Narrator>No, it was Thursday night's Daily Show</v>

142
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.138 line:15% 
where host Jon Stewart skewered CNBC financial pundit

143
00:07:07.138 --> 00:07:08.416 line:15% 
Jim Kramer.

144
00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:11.788 line:15% 
<v ->I can't reconcile the brilliance and knowledge</v>

145
00:07:11.788 --> 00:07:14.959 line:15% 
that you have in the intricacies of the market

146
00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.654 line:15% 
with the crazy bull(bleep) I see you do every night.

147
00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:20.582 line:15% 
<v ->There's a market for it and you give it to 'em</v>

148
00:07:20.582 --> 00:07:21.415
and I think we do--

149
00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:24.344
<v ->There's a market for cocaine and hookers.</v>

150
00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:26.812
You knew what the banks were doing, and yet,

151
00:07:26.812 --> 00:07:28.958
were touting it for months and months.

152
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.235
The entire network was, and so now to pretend

153
00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:36.427 line:15% 
that this was some sort of crazy, once-in-a-lifetime tsunami

154
00:07:36.427 --> 00:07:39.667 line:15% 
that nobody could have seen coming, is disingenuous at best

155
00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.122 line:15% 
and criminal at worst.

156
00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:42.407 line:15% 
<v Narrator>Like a prosecutor bearing down</v>

157
00:07:42.407 --> 00:07:44.794 line:15% 
on a decidedly uncomfortable witness,

158
00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:46.621 line:15% 
Stewart argued that the financial network

159
00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:48.892 line:15% 
and by extension much of the business press

160
00:07:48.892 --> 00:07:52.178
had given the public a false sense of financial security.

161
00:07:52.178 --> 00:07:54.359
<v Announcer>And the Bulls and the Bears are duking it out.</v>

162
00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:55.981
<v Narrator>But as Stewart himself said,</v>

163
00:07:55.981 --> 00:07:58.500
Jim Kramer was not the real target of his anger.

164
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.386
<v Promoter>The voice of experience you can trust.</v>

165
00:08:00.386 --> 00:08:02.591
<v Narrator>And CNBC is at root a symptom</v>

166
00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:05.270
of what was happened over the last year and a half.

167
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.016
It's a network with a very small audience of about 300,000

168
00:08:08.016 --> 00:08:11.033
but a very affluent one, with a relentless,

169
00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:13.165
at times hypercaffeinated intensity

170
00:08:13.165 --> 00:08:16.394
that's focused on the day-to-day movement of the markets.

171
00:08:16.394 --> 00:08:17.859
<v ->It's been another one of those days, up and down</v>

172
00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:18.917
and up and down and--

173
00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:21.614
<v ->The reason they exist is to do this moment by moment.</v>

174
00:08:21.614 --> 00:08:23.979 line:15% 
What's gonna happen tomorrow, and you know,

175
00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:26.291 line:15% 
I think that's pretty much a mug's game in terms of

176
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:29.233
what it can actually tell ordinary people.

177
00:08:29.233 --> 00:08:31.393
<v ->And you guys knew that that was going on.</v>

178
00:08:31.393 --> 00:08:33.247
<v Narrator>The core of Stewart's anger is his belief</v>

179
00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:36.627 line:15% 
that in its coverage, and in its lack of skepticism,

180
00:08:36.627 --> 00:08:39.647 line:15% 
much of the press was painting one picture to the public

181
00:08:39.647 --> 00:08:42.848 line:15% 
while knowing full well that the reality was very different.

182
00:08:42.848 --> 00:08:46.278 line:15% 
<v ->And that it is a game that you know,</v>

183
00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:49.697 line:15% 
that you know is going on, but that you go on television

184
00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:53.159
as a financial network and pretend isn't happening.

185
00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:55.342
<v Narrator>Actually, says New Yorker financial writer</v>

186
00:08:55.342 --> 00:08:57.404
Jim Surowiecki, much of Wall Street's problem

187
00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:59.475
was that it fooled itself.

188
00:08:59.475 --> 00:09:02.043
<v ->A lot of guys on Wall Street, one way or another,</v>

189
00:09:02.043 --> 00:09:03.456
drank their own Kool-Aid.

190
00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:04.668
<v Narrator>Now, with the disappearance</v>

191
00:09:04.668 --> 00:09:07.762 line:15% 
of $50 trillion, four-and-a-half million jobs

192
00:09:07.762 --> 00:09:10.578 line:15% 
and an immeasurable loss of financial well-being,

193
00:09:10.578 --> 00:09:12.794 line:15% 
the anger at what has happened is showing up

194
00:09:12.794 --> 00:09:14.613 line:15% 
across the media universe.

195
00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:16.182 line:15% 
It reaches from ABC News,

196
00:09:16.182 --> 00:09:18.141 line:15% 
which followed the corporate jet travels

197
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:21.808 line:15% 
of Bank of America's CEO like OJ-like focus,

198
00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:25.087
to a piece on a lavish weekend party

199
00:09:25.087 --> 00:09:27.058
thrown by a Chicago bank.

200
00:09:27.058 --> 00:09:30.463
That aired on TMZ, a site mostly featuring

201
00:09:30.463 --> 00:09:33.044
the misbehavior of celebrities.

202
00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:34.565
<v ->But the real issue is this.</v>

203
00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:36.485 line:15% 
How do we get the hard questions asked

204
00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:38.380 line:15% 
before things go wrong?

205
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.161 line:15% 
That is the very serious question

206
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:42.419 line:15% 
the late-night comedian was raising.

207
00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:43.252 line:15% 
Katie.

208
00:09:43.252 --> 00:09:44.149 line:15% 
<v ->All right, Jeff Greenfield.</v>

209
00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:47.640 line:15% 
Jeff, thank you for your perspective on that.

210
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.119
<v ->Okay, moving on.</v>

211
00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:51.949
In terms of what to read, aside from annual reports,

212
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:55.261
I'd recommend reading The Wall Street Journal,

213
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.638
not the editorials in it,

214
00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:59.403
but just kind of like what happened and why.

215
00:09:59.403 --> 00:10:01.706
You'll understand why bonds are issued

216
00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:04.087
or why stocks go up or why stocks go down.

217
00:10:04.087 --> 00:10:07.303
Don't read someone else's opinion on what to buy, okay?

218
00:10:07.303 --> 00:10:08.574
Aside from The Wall Street Journal,

219
00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:10.792
I also like the Financial Times, ft.com,

220
00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:12.537
just to understand sectors

221
00:10:12.537 --> 00:10:14.459
from a high-level market perspective

222
00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:17.630
and just to stay informed with how the world works,

223
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.268
the world of finance works, okay?

224
00:10:19.268 --> 00:10:23.169
And if you ever have questions about finance concepts,

225
00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:24.752
or how the world of finance works,

226
00:10:24.752 --> 00:10:27.166
just ask me in the course and I'll humbly do my best

227
00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:29.164
to answer, and if I don't have an answer for you right away,

228
00:10:29.164 --> 00:10:30.660
I'll do research for you, okay?

229
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.543
Okay, and when you do your own research,

230
00:10:33.543 --> 00:10:36.434
if you can't understand the company,

231
00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:38.217
then don't invest in it.

232
00:10:38.217 --> 00:10:40.935
And when I used to work at a big hedge fund,

233
00:10:40.935 --> 00:10:43.965
we had portfolio meetings and we had to discuss

234
00:10:43.965 --> 00:10:47.304
what stocks to buy and why and my boss would always tell me,

235
00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:50.314
"Chris, if you can't explain it, you don't understand it."

236
00:10:50.314 --> 00:10:52.848
It's so true, it's so true, okay?

237
00:10:52.848 --> 00:10:56.928
And I remember when I was in business school in 1999,

238
00:10:56.928 --> 00:10:59.644
I am dating myself again here, but back in 1999,

239
00:10:59.644 --> 00:11:01.973
at business school, Warren Buffett came and taught

240
00:11:01.973 --> 00:11:05.061
one of my classes, and I remember a classmate of mine

241
00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:08.502
was pitching a tech stock to him during class,

242
00:11:08.502 --> 00:11:12.082
and after about 30 seconds into the stock pitch,

243
00:11:12.082 --> 00:11:14.550
Warren Buffett very nicely interrupted and said,

244
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.507
"Son, I'm gonna interrupt you.

245
00:11:17.507 --> 00:11:19.636
"I'm gonna interrupt you there because I don't understand

246
00:11:19.636 --> 00:11:22.033
"where this company will be in two, three, four,

247
00:11:22.033 --> 00:11:25.370
"or five years product cycle-wise," right?

248
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.776
And then he went on, Warren Buffett then went on to say

249
00:11:28.776 --> 00:11:31.432
that he didn't like to invest much in technology

250
00:11:31.432 --> 00:11:32.934
as he didn't really understand the sector

251
00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:35.904
as well as other sectors, and he was dead right,

252
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.772
as this was December of 1999

253
00:11:37.772 --> 00:11:41.025
and I think it was three months later, in March of 2000,

254
00:11:41.025 --> 00:11:43.906
when the tech market crash started.

255
00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:46.486
So just keep it simple when you do your own research

256
00:11:46.486 --> 00:11:47.319
as well.

257
00:11:48.243 --> 00:11:51.860
I remember another time, Warren Buffett was on a panel

258
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.954
years ago, and the topic of this panel was

259
00:11:54.954 --> 00:11:59.005
Can Newspapers Stay Relevant in the Long Run,

260
00:11:59.005 --> 00:12:02.597
and everybody was arguing their points, and of course,

261
00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:04.506
there was a lot of bias on this panel

262
00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:09.017
because these people worked at big newspaper companies,

263
00:12:09.017 --> 00:12:11.024
and Warren Buffett then said something

264
00:12:11.024 --> 00:12:14.589
which caused everybody to remain silent for a while.

265
00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:18.180
And I love Buffett because he keeps things so simple,

266
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.660
and that's why he's so successful, in his long-term focus.

267
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.680
Warren Buffett said this.

268
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.633
If the internet was invented before newspapers were,

269
00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:28.966
would newspapers even exist?

270
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:32.010
It's pretty smart, simple but smart, right?

271
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.721
Just keep it simple when you do your own research,

272
00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:36.328
and Buffett years ago, I remember he,

273
00:12:36.328 --> 00:12:38.368
when he was talking about Coca-Cola as a great investment

274
00:12:38.368 --> 00:12:40.742
many, many, many years ago, he basically said,

275
00:12:40.742 --> 00:12:42.583
"I think people are gonna drink more Coke

276
00:12:42.583 --> 00:12:44.778
"in the future than they do today," right?

277
00:12:44.778 --> 00:12:46.461
Anyway, that was interesting.

278
00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:48.961
Number three, be a contrarian.

279
00:12:50.165 --> 00:12:51.534
Warren Buffett famously said,

280
00:12:51.534 --> 00:12:53.530
"Be fearful when others are greedy,

281
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.453
"and be greedy when others are fearful."

282
00:12:56.453 --> 00:12:59.352
You want to buy when other people are not buying

283
00:12:59.352 --> 00:13:01.011
and vice versa.

284
00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:03.797
And just be unemotional about investing as well.

285
00:13:03.797 --> 00:13:06.097
You know, if everybody loves a stock,

286
00:13:06.097 --> 00:13:09.290
then who is the incremental investor?

287
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.935
Be a contrarian, especially when you want to start

288
00:13:11.935 --> 00:13:14.402
buying a new stock position in your portfolio.

289
00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:17.703
I want you to patiently wait for a big pullback.

290
00:13:17.703 --> 00:13:20.224
And Wall Street has done a lot of,

291
00:13:20.224 --> 00:13:23.251
Wall Street has a lot of extreme sayings,

292
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:26.431
and one of them is to buy when there is blood

293
00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:30.235
in the streets, and I know that's very,

294
00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:32.538
that's very extreme, but when it feels really uncomfortable

295
00:13:32.538 --> 00:13:35.245
to buy, sometimes that's the right time to buy.

296
00:13:35.245 --> 00:13:36.898
Okay, number four.

297
00:13:36.898 --> 00:13:40.119
Never ever, ever, ever, ever use margin.

298
00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:44.609
Many hedge funds and investment firms went bankrupt in 2008

299
00:13:44.609 --> 00:13:47.617
as they used loans to invest, meaning margins.

300
00:13:47.617 --> 00:13:49.210
And never do that, okay?

301
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.377
And just to quote Warren Buffett, these margin investments

302
00:13:54.385 --> 00:13:57.265
or getting a loan to invest are financial weapons

303
00:13:57.265 --> 00:14:00.765
of mass destruction and a quick side note.

304
00:14:01.938 --> 00:14:02.969
What is a hedge fund?

305
00:14:02.969 --> 00:14:04.528
A hedge is the same thing as a mutual fund

306
00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:07.197
except instead of just buying stocks that are gonna go up,

307
00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:09.264
they bet against stocks that are gonna go down,

308
00:14:09.264 --> 00:14:10.625
and they call it a hedge fund because

309
00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:12.718
in your backyard you have hedges, protecting,

310
00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:14.637
anyway, your backyard, okay.

311
00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:16.583
So in the next few lessons, we're gonna discuss

312
00:14:16.583 --> 00:14:19.437
researching stocks in more detail.

313
00:14:19.437 --> 00:14:22.082
And as we go through your investment management

314
00:14:22.082 --> 00:14:25.214
portfolio system in Excel in a lot of detail,

315
00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:28.153
I really want you to understand the concepts,

316
00:14:28.153 --> 00:14:30.236
and if you don't, just let me know right away

317
00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:32.082
but I think the best way to learn this stuff

318
00:14:32.082 --> 00:14:34.313
is to dive right in right now.

319
00:14:34.313 --> 00:14:36.246
We'll talk about real-life examples,

320
00:14:36.246 --> 00:14:37.804
no theory in this course.

321
00:14:37.804 --> 00:14:38.637
Thank you.
