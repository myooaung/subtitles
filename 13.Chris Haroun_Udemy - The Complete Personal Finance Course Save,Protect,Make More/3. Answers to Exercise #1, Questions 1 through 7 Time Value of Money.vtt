00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:12.921
<v ->Before I discuss the answers to exercise number one,</v>

2
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.755
I want to stress that the younger you start to save,

3
00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:17.176
the better.

4
00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:19.030
And if you're older, don't worry,

5
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.453
as we'll cover many personal finance strategies

6
00:00:22.453 --> 00:00:24.473
in this course.

7
00:00:24.473 --> 00:00:27.129
And so, if you've not started saving,

8
00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:29.939
then promise me, please, promise me

9
00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.523
that the next time you get a raise,

10
00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:35.747
please have the money automatically taken

11
00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:38.874
out of every single paycheck.

12
00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:41.413
As that additional savings should be

13
00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:43.468
out of sight and out of mind.

14
00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:45.429
If you don't see it you won't spend it.

15
00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.790
And I want you to get to the point

16
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.957
where you save 10-20% of every single paycheck eventually.

17
00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:56.920
I actually think it's a lot of fun

18
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.338
to come up with ways to save,

19
00:00:58.338 --> 00:01:02.141
and I like to think of saving like it's a game.

20
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:03.966
And when we do the budget section,

21
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.915
later in the course, you'll see what I mean,

22
00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:10.110
as you influence your family, your friends,

23
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.838
your loved ones, et cetera,

24
00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:16.054
to also think in terms of how to save money.

25
00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:20.221
And I want us to be very conservative when saving,

26
00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:25.707
so I won't spend much time discussing pensions,

27
00:01:25.707 --> 00:01:27.532
or Social Security money,

28
00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:29.783
that you might be receiving when you retire,

29
00:01:29.783 --> 00:01:32.458
as I don't want to rely on this.

30
00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:35.043
And there's many reasons why.

31
00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:38.095
I guess one of the reasons is we have no idea

32
00:01:38.095 --> 00:01:40.070
how much taxes we're gonna be paying

33
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.775
in the future, et cetera,

34
00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:45.518
and if governments say, "No new taxes,"

35
00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:47.042
don't believe it, ever.

36
00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.459
<v ->Read my lips. No new taxes.</v>

37
00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:54.287
<v Voiceover>Then he gave us the second biggest</v>

38
00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:56.782
tax increase in American history.

39
00:01:56.782 --> 00:02:00.569
<v ->Okay, and so I really hope that this exercise,</v>

40
00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.943
number one, really motivates you to save even more.

41
00:02:04.943 --> 00:02:07.648
And I want you to please just think about,

42
00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:09.399
think about everything you spend money on

43
00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.481
as worth a lot more in the future,

44
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:15.398
which will help us not to overspend

45
00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:19.594
on small items that really add up.

46
00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:22.779
And so let's now take a look at the answers

47
00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.465
to question number one.

48
00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.385
With most of the questions,

49
00:02:26.385 --> 00:02:29.264
there's one unknown variable in the equation.

50
00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:32.471
And so for question #1, we know that in three years,

51
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:36.120
we want to buy a car that costs ₣10,000.

52
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.112
So we know the amount of time,

53
00:02:38.112 --> 00:02:41.148
we know the dollar amount at the end,

54
00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:43.132
and we also know the interest rate

55
00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:46.415
that our money's gonna earn in the bank.

56
00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:49.296
And so the only unknown variable is

57
00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:52.065
how much money do we need to save per month?

58
00:02:52.065 --> 00:02:53.793
And so we're gonna use the solver,

59
00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:56.629
or goal seek, I should say,

60
00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:57.866
utility here.

61
00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.076
So let me open this up,

62
00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:01.993
it'll take a second for it to load.

63
00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:05.304
And I already have the answer here for you,

64
00:03:05.304 --> 00:03:09.304
but let's just say that I wanted to delete this.

65
00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:11.725
We can solve for this now.

66
00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:13.877
We know it's three years,

67
00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:15.958
we just have to find out the monthly savings.

68
00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.028
And so the value in three years,

69
00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:20.375
and I already calculated for you here,

70
00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:23.200
that we're gonna take the interest rate divided by 12,

71
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.717
because that's the interest per month.

72
00:03:24.717 --> 00:03:26.681
We're making monthly payments,

73
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:28.724
or monthly savings.

74
00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:32.530
And the same thing here, with the number of periods

75
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.821
for saving here, so interest rate's divided by 12,

76
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:40.516
and the savings rate is also going to be divided by 12,

77
00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:42.728
or actually multiplied by 12 in this case,

78
00:03:42.728 --> 00:03:46.249
because we want to go from monthly to yearly,

79
00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.076
so we speak about it in the same terms.

80
00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:48.909
12 to 12.

81
00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.689
And if that doesn't make sense to you, please let me know.

82
00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.356
So let's use solver.

83
00:03:55.398 --> 00:03:58.005
We want to get, and you'll hear me say "solver"

84
00:03:58.005 --> 00:03:59.693
and "goal seek."

85
00:03:59.693 --> 00:04:01.659
they're basically the same thing,

86
00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.282
and they've been kind of branded differently

87
00:04:03.282 --> 00:04:05.282
over the years by Excel.

88
00:04:06.524 --> 00:04:07.357
Microsoft, that is.

89
00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:08.381
So what we're gonna do,

90
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:12.548
is we're gonna set this value here to 10,000, ₣10,000,

91
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.532
by changing this cell.

92
00:04:16.532 --> 00:04:18.420
Now I can click on that and then go click here,

93
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.323
or just click right away here.

94
00:04:20.323 --> 00:04:21.985
Either way works.

95
00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:23.152
We can go, OK.

96
00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:28.970
And it's gonna take a second to solve here.

97
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.319
Alright, almost there.

98
00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.138
Yay, okay, cool.

99
00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.971
So the answer is ₣247.

100
00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:40.275
We need to save ₣247 every single month for three years.

101
00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:42.617
Now just for fun, let's assume we made

102
00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:44.870
no interest on that over three years.

103
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.787
So 247 saved per month,

104
00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:50.346
times three years times 12.

105
00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:52.635
That's that amount there.

106
00:04:52.635 --> 00:04:55.176
Of course the difference between this amount,

107
00:04:55.176 --> 00:04:58.846
8,892 and ₣10,000, is the fact that of course

108
00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:02.903
we're making money by investing the money here,

109
00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:06.403
with an interest rate of 8% per year.

110
00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:09.476
Moving on to question #2,

111
00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:13.371
we want to have ₣100,000 in 20 years

112
00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:16.283
in order to send our child to college.

113
00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:17.522
It's expensive, eh?

114
00:05:17.522 --> 00:05:21.837
If we assume that the interest rate in savings is 12.5%,

115
00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:23.962
how much do we need to save every single month

116
00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:26.442
in order to have ₣100,000 in 20 years?

117
00:05:26.442 --> 00:05:29.235
Well, similar to the last question,

118
00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:30.959
there's one unknown variable,

119
00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.965
which is how much to save per month.

120
00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.593
So the math will be quite similar here.

121
00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:37.760
So let's click here to see the answer.

122
00:05:38.898 --> 00:05:42.981
And so the monthly savings turns out to be 94.47.

123
00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:48.582
And we used solver here again to get that value.

124
00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:52.127
So let me delete this variable here.

125
00:05:52.127 --> 00:05:53.412
And let's calculate it.

126
00:05:53.412 --> 00:05:54.662
Actually, you can take all of them out

127
00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:56.132
if you wanted to.

128
00:05:56.132 --> 00:05:59.882
So the number of years, we know, is 20 years.

129
00:06:01.441 --> 00:06:04.191
The annual interest rate is 12.5.

130
00:06:05.878 --> 00:06:08.673
And this is the green one, which means you can't change it.

131
00:06:08.673 --> 00:06:13.348
I already accounted for in here, the number of months.

132
00:06:13.348 --> 00:06:15.337
And the interest payment, or I should say

133
00:06:15.337 --> 00:06:18.794
the rate per month, and the number of periods per year.

134
00:06:18.794 --> 00:06:22.569
So 12, because we're calculating it monthly.

135
00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.736
So we're gonna use solver, or goal seek, same thing.

136
00:06:27.578 --> 00:06:32.537
And we're gonna go to what-if analysis here, goal seek.

137
00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:36.454
And we're gonna set this value here to ₣100,000

138
00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:41.543
by changing this cell here,

139
00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.706
and Excel is going to calculate.

140
00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:48.999
There we go, great.

141
00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.749
So the answer is we would need to save ₣94.47

142
00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:58.017
every single month for 20 years

143
00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.489
at this interest rate, in order to send

144
00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:01.239
our child to college.

145
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:06.069
Moving on to question #3, and I wish I read this one

146
00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:08.121
when I was younger. (laughs)

147
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:11.715
So let's say that you're gonna go party with your friends.

148
00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:14.740
And you're planning on spending ₣50 that night,

149
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.180
which is a lot,

150
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.513
but instead of spending ₣50,

151
00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:22.353
you limit yourself to spending only ₣10 that night.

152
00:07:22.353 --> 00:07:24.230
And so we're gonna take the ₣40

153
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.360
and we're going to invest it annually

154
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.825
at a return of 12% for 50 years.

155
00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:33.938
And so the question is, what is that one-time savings

156
00:07:33.938 --> 00:07:37.184
of ₣40 gonna be worth in 50 years

157
00:07:37.184 --> 00:07:38.730
at an interest rate of 12%?

158
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.496
There's one unknown variable here as well.

159
00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:44.193
The green ones don't change,

160
00:07:44.193 --> 00:07:45.126
but I'm gonna change,

161
00:07:45.126 --> 00:07:47.400
I'm sorry, it's updating, it takes a second.

162
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.150
There we go. Good.

163
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.541
I'm gonna calculate the future value.

164
00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:53.873
And we talked about this earlier.

165
00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:57.977
To calculate the future value of a one-time savings,

166
00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.617
it's pretty easy.

167
00:07:59.617 --> 00:08:01.324
What you do is you equal,

168
00:08:01.324 --> 00:08:05.166
you take the savings, and it's gonna be worth more

169
00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:06.872
in the future, so we're gonna multiply it by

170
00:08:06.872 --> 00:08:10.372
by one plus the interest rate, that's .12.

171
00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:13.547
And how many years?

172
00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:18.492
Well, you're gonna have to do it to the power of time.

173
00:08:18.492 --> 00:08:20.242
Hit Enter, and voila.

174
00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:23.611
Here's your answer.

175
00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:26.194
You would end up having ₣11,560

176
00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:31.520
if that one night you decided to only spend ₣10

177
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.687
instead of 50.

178
00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:39.447
Let's move on to question #4, which actually builds

179
00:08:39.447 --> 00:08:40.697
on question #3.

180
00:08:41.743 --> 00:08:45.910
The only difference is that instead of saving ₣40 one time,

181
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:51.408
you decide to save ₣40 every single month for 50 years.

182
00:08:52.677 --> 00:08:56.344
You decide to save ₣40 by only spending ₣10.

183
00:08:58.072 --> 00:09:00.944
Maybe you bought beers and drank them at home,

184
00:09:00.944 --> 00:09:03.400
or went out partying with your friends

185
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.742
at a cheaper place, whatever it is.

186
00:09:05.742 --> 00:09:06.606
Too much information, I know.

187
00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:08.463
Sorry. (laughs)

188
00:09:08.463 --> 00:09:11.506
So, all we're gonna do in this case is,

189
00:09:11.506 --> 00:09:13.703
it's very similar to the last question,

190
00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:15.765
except we're not gonna do the future value

191
00:09:15.765 --> 00:09:17.506
of a one-time payment.

192
00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:20.291
We're actually gonna do the future value

193
00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:24.014
of many payments, and I'm gonna show you

194
00:09:24.014 --> 00:09:25.389
exactly how this works.

195
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:29.139
Excel is amazing, because if you enter in FV,

196
00:09:30.507 --> 00:09:32.630
and open brackets, it's gonna anticipate

197
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.099
what you're trying to do.

198
00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:38.099
We got 12%, divided by 12 periods per year.

199
00:09:41.643 --> 00:09:43.893
And then we've got 50 years

200
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.878
times 12 payments per year,

201
00:09:50.593 --> 00:09:54.318
and then you hit comma one more time,

202
00:09:54.318 --> 00:09:56.791
and it's gonna say, hey, what's the payment?

203
00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:59.042
And you say it's ₣40.

204
00:09:59.042 --> 00:10:01.098
You close brackets, you hit Enter,

205
00:10:01.098 --> 00:10:04.598
and let me make this a little bit smaller.

206
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:08.743
I think I gotta actually make it smaller this way.

207
00:10:08.743 --> 00:10:09.709
There we go. Good. Yeah.

208
00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:12.626
Okay, so it's actually ₣1.5 million

209
00:10:13.698 --> 00:10:15.544
you'll be saving.

210
00:10:15.544 --> 00:10:18.855
And it's amazing, and you can actually put in here,

211
00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:21.188
minus one times that amount.

212
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.496
It's the same thing.

213
00:10:23.496 --> 00:10:26.295
And you'll see here that we took the logic

214
00:10:26.295 --> 00:10:29.369
from the math here, and it puts it into English here.

215
00:10:29.369 --> 00:10:33.369
And you would save ₣1.562 million over 50 years.

216
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:36.325
Isn't that amazing?

217
00:10:36.325 --> 00:10:37.770
It's amazing.

218
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.599
Every time you go out with your buddies,

219
00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:41.875
just think about how much money you can save

220
00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:46.596
by instead of buying drinks from an expensive restaurant

221
00:10:46.596 --> 00:10:49.856
or bar, whatever, just kind of have drinks at home,

222
00:10:49.856 --> 00:10:52.270
alcoholic or non-alcoholic, it's the same thing.

223
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.270
They make ridiculous margins on both of them.

224
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.573
And that's why when you go to McDonald's,

225
00:10:55.573 --> 00:10:57.542
they always say, "Would you like a Coke with that?"

226
00:10:57.542 --> 00:10:59.795
Because there is basically no margins,

227
00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:01.513
McDonald's doesn't make money on really anything

228
00:11:01.513 --> 00:11:02.566
except for drinks.

229
00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:05.055
And a little bit on fries as well.

230
00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:09.582
In terms of question #5, we're almost halfway there.

231
00:11:09.582 --> 00:11:14.487
Now, you decide that after you watch this entire course,

232
00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:18.404
that all 100 plus of the savings methodologies,

233
00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:21.979
or savings tips, I give you in the course

234
00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:24.254
make sense to you, and that's not gonna happen,

235
00:11:24.254 --> 00:11:26.238
but just pretend it does. (laughs)

236
00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:29.861
So, let's say that you save an extra 100 bucks, or ₣100,

237
00:11:29.861 --> 00:11:33.868
every single month after watching this course.

238
00:11:33.868 --> 00:11:38.035
And in 30 years, if the interest rate on your savings

239
00:11:38.994 --> 00:11:43.161
is 15%, what would that additional ₣100 be worth?

240
00:11:44.478 --> 00:11:48.354
The savings, every single month, in 30 years.

241
00:11:48.354 --> 00:11:49.755
What we're gonna do for this one,

242
00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:53.445
and the math is quite similar to the last one,

243
00:11:53.445 --> 00:11:54.980
just let me refresh this, taking a second,

244
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.883
here we go, good.

245
00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.788
So we only have one unknown variable,

246
00:11:58.788 --> 00:12:00.661
which is the value in 30 years.

247
00:12:00.661 --> 00:12:04.293
So I'm gonna go equals future value,

248
00:12:04.293 --> 00:12:07.025
open brackets, the rate,

249
00:12:07.025 --> 00:12:08.242
and we know we're doing it monthly

250
00:12:08.242 --> 00:12:10.681
so we're dividing that by 12,

251
00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:12.474
the number of periods, we got 30 years,

252
00:12:12.474 --> 00:12:15.874
but we're doing it monthly, so times 12,

253
00:12:15.874 --> 00:12:17.459
and then the payment.

254
00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:19.850
Close brackets, and there we go.

255
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.017
It's ₣692,000.

256
00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:26.052
Again, I'm gonna multiply this by -1,

257
00:12:26.052 --> 00:12:27.385
minus one times,

258
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.542
and there is our additional savings here.

259
00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.114
It's pretty amazing, eh?

260
00:12:33.114 --> 00:12:34.330
Pretty cool.

261
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.566
And the really neat thing about this is

262
00:12:36.566 --> 00:12:40.641
if you change this from 30 years to 35,

263
00:12:40.641 --> 00:12:42.224
watch what happens.

264
00:12:44.236 --> 00:12:46.442
Isn't that amazing?

265
00:12:46.442 --> 00:12:47.871
That's incredible. Incredible.

266
00:12:47.871 --> 00:12:51.085
That tiny change, five years at the tail end,

267
00:12:51.085 --> 00:12:53.738
is massive, and when we create financial models

268
00:12:53.738 --> 00:12:56.167
for companies, the terminal value,

269
00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:58.602
meaning the last year, or last couple years,

270
00:12:58.602 --> 00:13:01.405
is usually the bulk of what a company is worth

271
00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:03.901
in the future, is what they make many years from now.

272
00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:05.577
A little off-topic, so isn't that incredible?

273
00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.739
Watch, let's change to 31.

274
00:13:07.739 --> 00:13:10.372
So just one more year, that's what you get.

275
00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:12.248
What if we go 40?

276
00:13:12.248 --> 00:13:14.248
Wow. Wow. Okay. Amazing.

277
00:13:15.385 --> 00:13:16.501
Go back to 30.

278
00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:17.418
Okay, cool.

279
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:21.672
Let's build on this logic for question #6,

280
00:13:21.672 --> 00:13:24.093
so we're gonna do the exact same question,

281
00:13:24.093 --> 00:13:25.829
except we're gonna assume that we're gonna save

282
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:29.809
₣150 per month instead of ₣100 per month.

283
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.907
And the interest rate is going to be 15%,

284
00:13:32.907 --> 00:13:35.957
which was the same as the last question.

285
00:13:35.957 --> 00:13:39.308
But instead of 30 years, we're gonna do it for 50 years.

286
00:13:39.308 --> 00:13:41.069
Check this out, this will blow you away.

287
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:45.236
The question is, what is your savings in 50 years,

288
00:13:46.112 --> 00:13:49.435
by saving that amount per month?

289
00:13:49.435 --> 00:13:51.730
So we're gonna do, and I'm just gonna multiply it

290
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.123
by minus one, I think you understand now.

291
00:13:54.123 --> 00:13:57.696
Times future value, and what's the rate,

292
00:13:57.696 --> 00:13:59.980
it's that over 12 months.

293
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.686
Comma, I love Excel.

294
00:14:01.686 --> 00:14:04.741
Number of periods, it's 50 times 12.

295
00:14:04.741 --> 00:14:08.423
That's over 12 months, 50 times 12.

296
00:14:08.423 --> 00:14:10.742
Comma, what's the payment?

297
00:14:10.742 --> 00:14:13.205
Close brackets, boom.

298
00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:14.739
Wow, man. Look at that.

299
00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:16.239
Look at that. Huh.

300
00:14:18.403 --> 00:14:21.820
₣20.7 million would be saved in 50 years.

301
00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:29.418
So we had an additional 20 years,

302
00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:31.122
and an additional ₣50 per month,

303
00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:32.578
with the same interest rate,

304
00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:33.643
and look at the differential.

305
00:14:33.643 --> 00:14:37.502
Before we were at 692, now we're at 20.7 million.

306
00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.662
It's incredible, just amazing.

307
00:14:39.662 --> 00:14:43.318
Just amazing, and I hope you love how awesome

308
00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:45.308
compound interest can be.

309
00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:47.458
And all you gotta do is just save a little bit more

310
00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:50.329
every month, or every day, than you think you should.

311
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:53.246
And it all adds up in the long run.

312
00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:56.678
Now let's move on to question #7,

313
00:14:56.678 --> 00:14:57.655
but you know what I've done, actually,

314
00:14:57.655 --> 00:15:01.019
is I've clicked this button here, up here, you see it?

315
00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:03.556
Number two, and when you click that, it opens up

316
00:15:03.556 --> 00:15:06.803
every single one of these hidden answers, here.

317
00:15:06.803 --> 00:15:07.636
Just to save us time.

318
00:15:07.636 --> 00:15:08.678
It takes a while to open them.

319
00:15:08.678 --> 00:15:11.012
Okay, so number seven.

320
00:15:11.012 --> 00:15:12.785
This is a great question, I love this one.

321
00:15:12.785 --> 00:15:15.720
Okay, so, I really want to impress upon you

322
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.135
the fact that you can lose a lot of money,

323
00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:20.968
or leave a lot of money on the table,

324
00:15:20.968 --> 00:15:23.384
if you invest in mutual funds

325
00:15:23.384 --> 00:15:25.178
that charge fees that are too high,

326
00:15:25.178 --> 00:15:27.518
and I'll go through this in a lot of detail

327
00:15:27.518 --> 00:15:28.519
in part three of the course,

328
00:15:28.519 --> 00:15:30.864
but I want to put this on your radar screen right now,

329
00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:33.231
because it makes me sick how much these mutual funds

330
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:34.732
make from us.

331
00:15:34.732 --> 00:15:39.327
Okay, so mutual funds charge a couple percent more sometimes

332
00:15:39.327 --> 00:15:41.399
than index funds.

333
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:43.803
I'll talk about that in more detail later.

334
00:15:43.803 --> 00:15:47.281
And so the question here is asking you to compare

335
00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:49.864
a mutual fund investment return

336
00:15:51.052 --> 00:15:54.511
with an index fund investment return.

337
00:15:54.511 --> 00:15:57.269
And the mutual fund in this hypothetical case

338
00:15:57.269 --> 00:16:00.256
has 3% higher fees than the index fund,

339
00:16:00.256 --> 00:16:02.876
which is why the mutual fund is only gonna return 8%

340
00:16:02.876 --> 00:16:05.793
versus 11% for the index fund.

341
00:16:06.707 --> 00:16:09.112
And then the final a-ha moment answer

342
00:16:09.112 --> 00:16:10.728
for this question here, if I double-click,

343
00:16:10.728 --> 00:16:13.838
is just gonna be how much more money do we make

344
00:16:13.838 --> 00:16:15.741
by investing in an index fund

345
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:19.201
versus a mutual fund, given the better fee structure

346
00:16:19.201 --> 00:16:20.486
with the index fund.

347
00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:21.403
Okay, good.

348
00:16:22.239 --> 00:16:24.151
So similar to the last question,

349
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.867
here's what we're gonna do.

350
00:16:26.867 --> 00:16:29.617
We're gonna say equals minus one,

351
00:16:31.107 --> 00:16:34.690
times the future value of, what's the rate?

352
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:37.604
That divided by 12,

353
00:16:37.604 --> 00:16:41.627
comma, number of years, 25 years, times 12,

354
00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:42.985
'cause it's monthly.

355
00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:44.568
Comma, that, enter,

356
00:16:46.665 --> 00:16:50.082
and we're gonna make ₣95,103 for 25 years

357
00:16:52.677 --> 00:16:53.871
of saving a hundred.
