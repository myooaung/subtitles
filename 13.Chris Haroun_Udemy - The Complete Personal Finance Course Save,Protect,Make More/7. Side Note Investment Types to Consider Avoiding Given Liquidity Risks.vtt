1
00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:02.180
<v ->There are other investment classes</v>

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.904
that we have not discussed yet in this course

3
00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:08.135
and I recommend avoiding most of these

4
00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:11.211
following investment classes if you can.

5
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.281
The first one I wanna talk about is

6
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:16.024
private company investments

7
00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:18.744
meaning venture capital investments.

8
00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:23.166
These private company investments are highly eliquid,

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.564
meaning they're very difficult to sell

10
00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:29.205
and most of them, almost all of them go to zero.

11
00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:31.848
So for every story you hear about somebody investing

12
00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:34.742
in Google or Facebook when it was private,

13
00:00:34.742 --> 00:00:37.676
there are countless thousands of stories

14
00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:40.990
of investments in private companies that went belly up,

15
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.454
meaning they went bankrupt.

16
00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:45.365
And so in the venture capital industry here,

17
00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:47.195
we refer to companies that have a value

18
00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:50.701
of over one billion dollars as being called uniquence

19
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.712
and statistically speaking, you have a better chance

20
00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:55.963
of getting struck by lightening than investing

21
00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:57.095
in a unicorn.

22
00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.733
So if you're gonna make a private

23
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.613
or venture capital investment

24
00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:03.868
just make sure please that it is

25
00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:06.527
a very, very tiny percentage of your net worth

26
00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:11.173
and your portfolio that you can certainly afford to lose.

27
00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:12.534
Just keep in mind there's a good chance

28
00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:14.261
you'll lose of it.

29
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.161
And don't invest in your family or friend's

30
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:19.494
private companies or you might very well

31
00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:23.294
lose them as friends.

32
00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:24.878
It's happened to me.

33
00:01:24.878 --> 00:01:26.331
Number two, options.

34
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:30.991
Please don't invest in puts or calls, meaning options

35
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.601
or what are called derivatives, same thing kind of,

36
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:37.457
as your losses can literally be unlimited

37
00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:40.213
and Warren Buffett calls derivatives,

38
00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:43.256
weapons of mass financial destruction.

39
00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:45.808
And he's so right, man.

40
00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:49.530
Because so many investment funds, hedge funds, et cetera,

41
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.105
went belly up in 2008 because of excess leverage.

42
00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:58.105
The only exception here is to use puts or calls,

43
00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:02.181
is if a company that you work for

44
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:04.482
that has given you stock and you're not allowed,

45
00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:07.051
you can't sell that stock 'cause it's a private company

46
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:08.724
or you're locked up for some reason

47
00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:12.017
and that's like 99% of your net worth,

48
00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:15.895
then you might be able to buy puts on a similar company

49
00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:19.368
to hedge yourself, and so before you do this though,

50
00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:22.802
I want you to please speak with a professional money manager

51
00:02:22.802 --> 00:02:25.294
or your accountant, actually and your accountant.

52
00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:28.303
Call your accountant first about this

53
00:02:28.303 --> 00:02:31.063
as structuring these investments can be

54
00:02:31.063 --> 00:02:34.008
very, very complicated and I don't want you

55
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:35.175
to lose money.

56
00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.785
Number three, leveraged investments.

57
00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:41.199
Never borrow money and invest money in stocks

58
00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.779
or other investment classes.

59
00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.021
We will save borrowing money for our mortgage

60
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.095
on our primary residence only.

61
00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:51.511
Okay, number four, collectables.

62
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:53.741
Only invest in collectables if it's something

63
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.279
you are incredibly passionate about

64
00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.012
and if it's your hobby and make sure you can sell

65
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.623
these collectables if needed.

66
00:03:01.623 --> 00:03:04.120
How do you know if you can and what you can get from them?

67
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.645
Go to eBay and see what you can get for them.

68
00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:11.713
But make sure that you deduct at least a 10% fee from eBay

69
00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:13.347
'cause of PayPal fees, et cetera.

70
00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:16.567
And when you go and search on eBay

71
00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:19.566
make sure you can go and do an advanced search

72
00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.907
and filter based on recent sales,

73
00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:24.450
meaning sales actually went through

74
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.617
instead of auctions that expired and nobody bought the item.

75
00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.462
I wanna talk a little bit about...

76
00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:35.681
I wanna talk a little bit about

77
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.848
baseball cards and hockey cards and comic books as well.

78
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:42.488
And that'll be the rest of this lesson.

79
00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.321
If you're not interested in this stuff

80
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:46.321
just please skip to the next lesson.

81
00:03:47.796 --> 00:03:50.196
I was a big collector when I was a kid

82
00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.520
and I'm gonna nerd out big time.

83
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.097
I actually did a bunch of research into this.

84
00:03:57.097 --> 00:03:59.956
The difference between a card that looks perfect

85
00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.461
versus a card that almost looks perfect,

86
00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:05.726
can be hundreds of thousands of dollars.

87
00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:08.404
A Wayne Gretzky rookie card that's in perfect condition

88
00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:11.573
is at least 100 grand and one that is just slightly

89
00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:13.406
below perfect can be worth literally

90
00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:14.953
a couple hundred bucks.

91
00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:18.668
Actually, I did research on it and I called the companies

92
00:04:18.668 --> 00:04:21.370
that do all these ratings and I asked them.

93
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.510
And so there's two main companies.

94
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.117
So for cards, the best company out there

95
00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:28.284
is called PSA,

96
00:04:29.828 --> 00:04:32.656
PSACARD.COM, you can go to that website.

97
00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:34.074
They rate all the cards.

98
00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:37.949
So what you do is you send in your cards

99
00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.204
and then they will rate them.

100
00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:43.233
And if it's a 10 out of 10 like this one is here,

101
00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:45.107
they're absolutely perfect.

102
00:04:45.107 --> 00:04:47.246
I don't know Chris if you can zoom in on that,

103
00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:48.424
but it's a 10 out of 10.

104
00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:49.459
The corners are perfect.

105
00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:52.841
You literally, here I go, I'm nerding out here.

106
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:55.841
You literally put these on like this

107
00:04:57.226 --> 00:04:59.551
and there's four different lenses.

108
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:01.108
I'm now older, so I gotta put it farther away,

109
00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:04.858
but the card has gotta be absolutely perfect.

110
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:08.079
The corners, everything about it for it to be

111
00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:09.908
a 10 out of 10.

112
00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:11.891
God, I'm such a nerd.

113
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:16.637
But if you look at a Rickey Henderson rookie card,

114
00:05:16.637 --> 00:05:17.852
the difference between a nine out of 10

115
00:05:17.852 --> 00:05:21.387
and a 10 out of 10 is $30,000 or a couple hundred bucks.

116
00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:24.506
Actually, I'll include nines and 10s here

117
00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:26.972
for the Rickey Henderson sample card.

118
00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:28.004
So that's that.

119
00:05:28.004 --> 00:05:30.754
Now when it comes to comic books,

120
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:38.624
there's a company that does the comic books.

121
00:05:38.624 --> 00:05:40.957
It's not PSA Card, it's SGC.

122
00:05:42.804 --> 00:05:45.067
For example, I had this one growing up.

123
00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:46.461
This was Wolverine.

124
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:48.400
I think I got this in the 70s.

125
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.233
I'm dating myself.

126
00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:52.855
It cost me 60 cents, which is a lot back then.

127
00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:54.962
But this one here, I thought it was perfect.

128
00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:56.182
I was all excited.

129
00:05:56.182 --> 00:05:57.875
Wolverine number one.

130
00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:02.042
And I got it rated and it was a nine out of 10 by CGC.

131
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.924
And so nine out of 10 is not really worth as much

132
00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:06.257
as say a 10 out of 10, not even close

133
00:06:06.257 --> 00:06:08.692
or 9 out of 10, there's no such thing as 10 out of 10

134
00:06:08.692 --> 00:06:09.662
I don't think on comic books.

135
00:06:09.662 --> 00:06:12.633
But anyway, you can go to CGC and they'll tell you

136
00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:14.359
all about it and they'll help you out.

137
00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:15.435
Call them as well if you want

138
00:06:15.435 --> 00:06:17.803
before sending in your comics to get graded.

139
00:06:17.803 --> 00:06:19.338
For those of you that collect,

140
00:06:19.338 --> 00:06:21.827
that are old and pathetic like me,

141
00:06:21.827 --> 00:06:23.564
that collected comics when you were a kid,

142
00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:25.729
these things can be worth a bunch of money now

143
00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.246
because they made a lot of movies out of these things.

144
00:06:27.246 --> 00:06:29.037
Like Marvel was bought by Disney.

145
00:06:29.037 --> 00:06:31.447
Disney made a gazillion movies, whatever.

146
00:06:31.447 --> 00:06:34.370
Even I had a comic book when I was a kid

147
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.254
that I found recently, which is Rocket Raccoon.

148
00:06:38.254 --> 00:06:39.868
I don't know why I had it, but I have it.

149
00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:42.095
It's worth some money because of the movie

150
00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:43.724
Guardians of the Galaxy.

151
00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:44.976
I had no idea they were gonna make a movie out of that

152
00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.270
when I was a kid, but anyway,

153
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.049
it's fun to collect this stuff.

154
00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:51.770
I had a ton of Wayne Gretzky rookies when I was a kid,

155
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.391
tons of them and I'm such an idiot.

156
00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:56.535
I put them actually on my bike

157
00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:58.480
into the wheels so that it sounds

158
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.480
like a motorbike on my old BMX bike.

159
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.621
Anyway, I'm an idiot.

160
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:07.165
Before I let you go I wanna tell you

161
00:07:07.165 --> 00:07:08.798
a quick story about Rickey Henderson.

162
00:07:08.798 --> 00:07:10.352
This guy was awesome.

163
00:07:10.352 --> 00:07:13.242
He's the fastest baseball player ever.

164
00:07:13.242 --> 00:07:14.598
He had a lot of stolen bases.

165
00:07:14.598 --> 00:07:16.436
He actually lives not too far away from here

166
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.176
in a much better house than I'll ever even

167
00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:20.206
dream of living in.

168
00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:22.111
This is a funny story.

169
00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:25.571
Years ago, he got a signing bonus for a million dollars

170
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:28.917
and he took that million dollar check he got

171
00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:31.861
and he put it up on the wall and he framed it.

172
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:34.412
And at the end of the year, the accounting department

173
00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.299
of the Oakland Athletics baseball team out here

174
00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:40.410
called him and said, hey Rickey are you gonna

175
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.303
cash that check?

176
00:07:42.303 --> 00:07:43.730
But anyway, he kept it on the wall.

177
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.701
This guy is a legend.

178
00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:46.813
I love this guy.

179
00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:48.362
Anyway, here's kind of a funny video on that

180
00:07:48.362 --> 00:07:50.195
if you wanna watch it.

181
00:07:51.088 --> 00:07:54.036
Separately, with baseball cards

182
00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:56.171
if you have any cards in the 1990s,

183
00:07:56.171 --> 00:07:57.923
they're not worth anything.

184
00:07:57.923 --> 00:08:00.587
The sweet spot is pre 87

185
00:08:00.587 --> 00:08:01.824
and anybody that's in the hall of famous

186
00:08:01.824 --> 00:08:03.391
is worth a bunch.

187
00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:07.558
Comic books, it's I'd say probably pre 87 as well.

188
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:11.010
What happened in both those industries

189
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.818
comics and cards is post 87,

190
00:08:13.818 --> 00:08:15.938
there's a massive supply increase

191
00:08:15.938 --> 00:08:18.069
because everyone was collecting back then,

192
00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:20.618
and so cards that are like after 87 or so

193
00:08:20.618 --> 00:08:23.022
and comics after 87 or so are worth almost nothing.

194
00:08:23.022 --> 00:08:24.634
In fact, most baseball card companies

195
00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.135
went almost belly up and the only one

196
00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:27.596
that really survived was Topps,

197
00:08:27.596 --> 00:08:29.627
which bought most of the other companies

198
00:08:29.627 --> 00:08:31.524
and now their prices are higher

199
00:08:31.524 --> 00:08:33.640
because they own the market.

200
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.072
Remember I talked about monopolies and oligopolies

201
00:08:35.072 --> 00:08:37.529
with Warren Buffett.

202
00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:40.480
Actually, just like we talked about supply and demand

203
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.161
with the Wii thing and interest rates and money

204
00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:46.171
and the price of money interest rates,

205
00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:47.840
the same thing can be said with comic books

206
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.990
and think about them the same way as well.

207
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.239
I love the industry.

208
00:08:53.239 --> 00:08:56.204
I love baseball, so if you have any questions

209
00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:59.251
about any of this stuff, just please let me know.

210
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:00.334
Okay, thanks.
