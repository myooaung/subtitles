1
00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:02.561
<v ->Now that we understand what ETFs are</v>

2
00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:04.693
from a very high level perspective,

3
00:00:04.693 --> 00:00:06.143
I wanna introduce you to

4
00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:08.897
your Investment Portfolio Management System

5
00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:09.980
or your IPMS.

6
00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:13.902
I'm not gonna,

7
00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:15.383
I'm not gonna edit that out.

8
00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:17.686
I'm not gonna call that anymore either okay.

9
00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:18.849
I'm just gonna call it

10
00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.861
your Investment Portfolio Management System.

11
00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:23.907
If I can't laughed at myself then I'm,

12
00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:24.740
I'm just hopeless dude.

13
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.401
Okay.

14
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.283
Okay so,

15
00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:28.393
I wanna introduce you to this

16
00:00:28.393 --> 00:00:31.619
Investment Portfolio Management System now because,

17
00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.869
we're gonna use this system

18
00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:37.513
to pick ETFs to invest in,

19
00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:40.108
as well as individual stocks.

20
00:00:40.108 --> 00:00:42.307
And when you pick stocks

21
00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:44.974
or ETF index funds to invest in,

22
00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.985
I wanna to ask yourself one simple question

23
00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:53.028
which uses your god given common sense.

24
00:00:53.028 --> 00:00:54.480
And that question is this.

25
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.389
I want you to please ask yourself,

26
00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.067
before picking any investment ever,

27
00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:01.516
ask yourself this question.

28
00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:03.531
Well this company,

29
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.298
or this investment or this ETF,

30
00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:10.057
be more or less relevant in five to ten years?

31
00:01:10.057 --> 00:01:12.356
Very simple question.

32
00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:15.139
And now any 5% of mutual fund professionals,

33
00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:16.909
can't beat index funds

34
00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.307
because quite often,

35
00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.788
they are too short term focused.

36
00:01:20.788 --> 00:01:21.621
Okay.

37
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:24.977
We are long term greedy in this course okay.

38
00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:27.133
And ask yourself this question

39
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.025
works exceptionally well.

40
00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:30.558
And if you think about it,

41
00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:31.837
you know if years ago

42
00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:32.764
wherever you ask yourself

43
00:01:32.764 --> 00:01:36.686
if you're gonna use Yahoo search more or less in five years,

44
00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:39.018
right where you invest in the company probably not.

45
00:01:39.018 --> 00:01:42.411
And usually when a company becomes less relevant

46
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:44.190
over a few years,

47
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.352
in most cases they are done in the long run,

48
00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:49.007
because turn arounds more often than not,

49
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:50.352
do not work.

50
00:01:50.352 --> 00:01:54.110
Just like my beloved Canadian represent,

51
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.205
my Canadian Blackberry product.

52
00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:57.865
I don't use the Blackberry anymore

53
00:01:57.865 --> 00:01:59.798
and many people don't.

54
00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:01.396
The right was on the wall for a while.

55
00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:03.928
And it's hard for a company to stay relevant

56
00:02:03.928 --> 00:02:04.761
in the long run,

57
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:07.001
once it becomes a little bit less relevant okay.

58
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.815
And if you ask yourself the five year test,

59
00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:13.718
then I think you'll know not to invest in the company.

60
00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:14.989
Okay.

61
00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.190
I think you get the idea.

62
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.353
So when do we sell a company?

63
00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:22.547
We sell if valuation is too expensive

64
00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:24.616
or if something happens

65
00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:26.796
that makes you not want to own that stock

66
00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:28.725
or the investment in the long run.

67
00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:29.668
Okay.

68
00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:32.857
If something happens like negative news item

69
00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:34.820
on the company we're investing in,

70
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.563
just ask yourself one simple question.

71
00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:38.837
Which is this.

72
00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:41.707
If I had known about this news item

73
00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:43.630
on this stock for example,

74
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.367
before I invested,

75
00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:48.156
would I still have bought this stock?

76
00:02:48.156 --> 00:02:49.541
Okay and if the question is no,

77
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:51.681
then consider selling it.

78
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:53.917
This stock in index picking methodology

79
00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:57.021
is actually gonna help you to outperform mutual funds

80
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:59.275
because you're a longer term focus investor.

81
00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:01.947
And long-term investing is much easier okay.

82
00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:04.451
When it comes to a stock,

83
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.034
we don't care with the path is,

84
00:03:07.882 --> 00:03:09.514
we just care about the destination,

85
00:03:09.514 --> 00:03:12.234
which is much higher in the long run okay.

86
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:16.259
Okay and unlike portfolio managers and mutual funds,

87
00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.760
we are not tourists in stocks or indexes.

88
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.588
We are not renters.

89
00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:23.401
We are long-term owners

90
00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:26.583
and long-term investors do much better.

91
00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:30.433
Okay and I love this quote from Warren Buffets.

92
00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:33.518
He said, "I never attempt to make money

93
00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:35.638
"on the stock market.

94
00:03:35.638 --> 00:03:37.509
"I buy on the assumption,

95
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.854
"that they close the stock market the next day,

96
00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:42.193
"and not reopen it for ten years."

97
00:03:42.193 --> 00:03:43.173
I love it.

98
00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:44.006
Okay.

99
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:45.298
Listen now and take closer look at our

100
00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:48.507
Investment Portfolio Management System.

101
00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:50.647
And don't worry,

102
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.628
as we're gonna focus on what stocks

103
00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:55.657
or ETF or other investments to consider adding

104
00:03:55.657 --> 00:03:57.023
to this system

105
00:03:57.023 --> 00:03:59.245
later as we don't know yet

106
00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:03.149
what are personal diversification strategy is going to be

107
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:04.486
and I haven't covered that yet.

108
00:04:04.486 --> 00:04:06.244
I haven't covered a pick stocks

109
00:04:06.244 --> 00:04:08.439
or how to do research on them yet.

110
00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.909
Okay we'll cover that in a lot detail soon.

111
00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.396
It'll be a lot of fun.

112
00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:13.089
And so the way to access your

113
00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.339
Investment Portfolio Management System

114
00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:19.725
is to click this button called Your Portfolio right here.

115
00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:21.885
So let's take a closer look now.

116
00:04:21.885 --> 00:04:22.718
What we're gonna do,

117
00:04:22.718 --> 00:04:24.002
is I'm gonna go through this one

118
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:25.898
from a very high level perspective.

119
00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.796
And then in future lessons we'll go through

120
00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:31.257
exactly what each section means.

121
00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:34.186
And so when you click on your portfolio,

122
00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:35.382
you'll see another section.

123
00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:36.882
There's section A,

124
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.856
then section B right here,

125
00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:43.591
section C,

126
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:44.424
D, E,

127
00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:46.873
etc.

128
00:04:46.873 --> 00:04:48.372
And what I'll do is

129
00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:51.584
I will explain all this section of the portfolio

130
00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:53.649
in upcoming lessons okay.

131
00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:55.688
I just wanna put this anywhere on our screen,

132
00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:58.450
give you a high level introduction of the system.

133
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.880
And when you come here you'll notice that

134
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.963
there is this bright yellow cell here

135
00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:08.541
and I made it bright yellow because

136
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:12.331
this here will convert from US Dollars

137
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:14.323
to your local currency.

138
00:05:14.323 --> 00:05:15.445
Okay and so,

139
00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:18.865
I've selected US here in US Dollar so,

140
00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:21.666
if you're managing a portfolio in United States

141
00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:24.190
using this spreadsheet,

142
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.765
then there obviously won't be a change in the exchange rate.

143
00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:28.976
Okay and,

144
00:05:28.976 --> 00:05:31.309
if you actually have another currency,

145
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:32.619
so let's just for fun,

146
00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:34.917
let me just change the currency for a second here to Euros,

147
00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.063
okay.

148
00:05:36.063 --> 00:05:38.525
So what will happen is

149
00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:41.692
you will get the value converted here.

150
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:43.551
It says you zero now,

151
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:46.865
cause you don't have anything in this portfolio yet.

152
00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:48.413
But I just wanna introduce you that

153
00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:52.580
constantly change it back here to dollars for now.

154
00:05:53.595 --> 00:05:54.688
Okay great.

155
00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:55.521
Okay.

156
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.674
And,

157
00:05:56.674 --> 00:05:59.371
this Portfolio Management System

158
00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:01.538
is generic enough that

159
00:06:01.538 --> 00:06:04.627
it will be able to manage your investments

160
00:06:04.627 --> 00:06:06.745
in many different types of stocks,

161
00:06:06.745 --> 00:06:09.810
bonds, ETFs commodity, etc.

162
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.375
And we're using Yahoo Finance

163
00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:13.629
and populate this very soon

164
00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:16.014
with commodities, stocks,

165
00:06:16.014 --> 00:06:17.756
bonds, real estate investments,

166
00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:18.653
trust and etc.

167
00:06:18.653 --> 00:06:20.296
I'll explain all that stuff means later okay.

168
00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.351
But this spreadsheet here will manage all that stuff.

169
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.078
And as I mentioned couple times the course,

170
00:06:26.078 --> 00:06:27.890
don't enter information any box,

171
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.542
unless it shaded white.

172
00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:30.375
Okay this for yellow.

173
00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:33.276
And you'll see why very soon okay.

174
00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:34.484
And,

175
00:06:34.484 --> 00:06:36.781
this row here,

176
00:06:36.781 --> 00:06:37.736
row seven,

177
00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:40.100
tells you what each field means.

178
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.551
What is the market capitalization,

179
00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:42.595
what is this stock,

180
00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:43.721
what is the percent change.

181
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:45.036
A lot of it is intuitive,

182
00:06:45.036 --> 00:06:46.440
a lot of it is not.

183
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.462
And you can always hide this as well

184
00:06:49.462 --> 00:06:51.194
and get out of the way just so you have more

185
00:06:51.194 --> 00:06:52.947
real estate on your screen here.

186
00:06:52.947 --> 00:06:54.780
Just like you can always hide

187
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.853
this row here row two.

188
00:06:56.853 --> 00:06:57.686
And we now how to do that,

189
00:06:57.686 --> 00:07:00.086
you just click that little plus or minus button there.

190
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.602
Let me do it.

191
00:07:01.602 --> 00:07:02.435
Okay.

192
00:07:02.435 --> 00:07:05.144
And it's a little slow sometimes that's okay though.

193
00:07:05.144 --> 00:07:06.685
Great.

194
00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:07.889
And so,

195
00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.969
here is our holdings.

196
00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:11.546
We will have this populated soon,

197
00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:12.735
of course it's empty right now,

198
00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:14.500
cause there's just nothing there.

199
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.333
And if we scroll down,

200
00:07:17.472 --> 00:07:22.442
we can see that our historical performance will be in here.

201
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.275
And so,

202
00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:24.753
you're actually gonna hard-coded in here.

203
00:07:24.753 --> 00:07:26.021
What was your performance January,

204
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:27.769
February, March, etc.

205
00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:30.403
You can change this here if you want to as well.

206
00:07:30.403 --> 00:07:31.937
And then comments as well and

207
00:07:31.937 --> 00:07:34.818
I love putting comments on a monthly basis

208
00:07:34.818 --> 00:07:36.164
on my mistakes.

209
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.543
Like, "oh I sold that too fast"

210
00:07:37.543 --> 00:07:39.984
or "gosh, what didn't I buy more of this position,

211
00:07:39.984 --> 00:07:41.364
"when it was down a lot."

212
00:07:41.364 --> 00:07:42.761
That sort of thing.

213
00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:44.149
And then this here is hard-coded

214
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:45.107
just for annual,

215
00:07:45.107 --> 00:07:46.807
actually just a summary of that.

216
00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:48.811
I think you get the idea.

217
00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:51.363
And if you scroll down here,

218
00:07:51.363 --> 00:07:54.229
these are positions that you no longer own.

219
00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:55.884
And so what you do is,

220
00:07:55.884 --> 00:07:58.163
you'll just kinda highlight this,

221
00:07:58.163 --> 00:08:01.118
cut and then paste it down here,

222
00:08:01.118 --> 00:08:02.977
when you don't own it anymore.

223
00:08:02.977 --> 00:08:04.554
And if you have questions let me know.

224
00:08:04.554 --> 00:08:06.920
And down here are Watchlist.

225
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.874
Things you wanna put in the portfolio eventually,

226
00:08:09.874 --> 00:08:11.221
but you don't wanna add it yet.

227
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:12.798
And so you'll be able to add them here

228
00:08:12.798 --> 00:08:14.739
and again we'll talk about that very soon.

229
00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:15.636
And so,

230
00:08:15.636 --> 00:08:17.039
this the very high level,

231
00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:20.103
overview of this Portfolio Management System

232
00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:22.520
and next couple of exercises,

233
00:08:23.683 --> 00:08:26.757
by the end of section 18 or so,

234
00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:29.961
you will understand exactly what all this columns mean

235
00:08:29.961 --> 00:08:33.936
and we're gonna populate this first with stocks.

236
00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:37.491
Then we'll populate it with bonds and commodities, etc.

237
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:39.042
And as always if you have any questions,

238
00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:40.495
please let me know, thank you.
