<v ->I have no idea why they don't teach us about saving money</v>

6
00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:21.296
and personal money management in all schools.

7
00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:24.402
Instead of all the useless business stuff we never

8
00:00:24.402 --> 00:00:27.986
really use, like supply and demand bogus theoretical charts,

9
00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.443
or too much calculus.

10
00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:32.698
You know, teach your kids or siblings,

11
00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:35.794
or other relatives or friends, about saving money,

12
00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:38.943
because when one teaches, two learn.

13
00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:42.148
And at dinner, if you have kids, teach them about what

14
00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:45.084
you learned in this course, especially the very first

15
00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:48.610
exercise that we did when we looked at how much money

16
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.872
we could save by not buying coffee or tea daily.

17
00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:57.680
Kids all want, they all want instant gratification,

18
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.152
unless we show them the power of compound interest.

19
00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:05.592
And I found that when I was younger and in school,

20
00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:08.363
sometimes, but not often, other students (laughing)

21
00:01:08.363 --> 00:01:10.464
in my class would ask me for help.

22
00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:14.377
And when I helped them, I actually learned the stuff better.

23
00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:16.144
I think you know what I mean.

24
00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:18.280
And so again, when one teaches, two learn.

25
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.762
So, teach your kids about money.

26
00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:24.400
And you'll end up saving, protecting, and making a lot more.

27
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.922
And those are the three pillars of this course, obviously.

28
00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:30.496
And teach them about what you're learning in the course

29
00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:32.864
when you have dinner each night, okay?

30
00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:34.682
And again, it's a way for you to kinda reinforce what

31
00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:37.744
you learn as we go through this journey together.

32
00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.416
And there's a saying that I heard recently,

33
00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:41.872
which is interesting, which is,

34
00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:45.000
when you have small kids, you have small problems.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.545
But when you have big kids, you have big problems.

36
00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:51.628
Let me add the word, money, to that saying, okay?

37
00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.563
When you have small kids, you have small money problems.

38
00:01:55.563 --> 00:01:58.248
But when you have big kids, you have big money problems,

39
00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:02.202
unless you teach them about money from a young age.

40
00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:05.789
And I actually overdid this, to be honest, with my kids.

41
00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.103
And when my middle child,

42
00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:10.047
Matthew, was three years old (laughing),

43
00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:12.046
we were having lunch and I paid in cash.

44
00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:14.664
And he said, "Money is bad, right, Dad?"

45
00:02:14.664 --> 00:02:17.414
Anyway, my kids teach me so much.

46
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:21.886
I actually told him it's not bad, but just, anyway,

47
00:02:21.886 --> 00:02:22.998
I taught him life lessons like I'm teaching you

48
00:02:22.998 --> 00:02:24.958
in this course, humbly.

49
00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.045
And I even remember, later that day when

50
00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:30.062
we were driving home, and I had an apple core and

51
00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:32.862
I threw it out the window and Matthew said to me,

52
00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:37.281
"Dad, don't be mean to the Earf." (laughing)

53
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:38.695
Okay, let me move on here.

54
00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:42.749
My grandfather, he grew up during the Great Depression,

55
00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.253
and we, grew up during the Great Recession.

56
00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:47.086
What do I mean by that?

57
00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:50.701
Well, we were literally within 24 hours, we were within

58
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:55.302
24 hours of bank machines not working in 2008.

59
00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:56.969
It was a crazy time.

60
00:02:58.207 --> 00:02:59.727
And I blame my parents, if they helped me

61
00:02:59.727 --> 00:03:02.115
five years earlier, I'd actually have money. (laughter)

62
00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.012
I'm just kidding obviously. (laughing)

63
00:03:04.012 --> 00:03:06.022
I blame myself only for everything.

64
00:03:06.022 --> 00:03:09.036
Okay so, just like how I learned to be frugal or cheap

65
00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:12.484
from my grandfather, you can teach your kids the same

66
00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:16.469
lessons as the Great Recession of 2008 was similar,

67
00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.975
actually, to the Great Depression.

68
00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:20.225
And, with kids,

69
00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.639
make saving money fun for them, like a game.

70
00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.091
Get them to appreciate and save money so that,

71
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:31.787
when you or I spend money incorrectly,

72
00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:35.101
our kids kinda call us out on it.

73
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:37.709
And I love my kids, when they correct me,

74
00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.645
when I spend money incorrectly.

75
00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:43.271
They say things to me like, "Dad, you know you coulda

76
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.293
gotten that cheaper on Amazon."

77
00:03:45.293 --> 00:03:48.477
Or, "Dad, did you know we can save money if we buy that

78
00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:50.685
video game later?"

79
00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:55.471
I bought them Super Mario Oddyssey the day it came out,

80
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:57.105
for them. (clears throat)

81
00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:00.454
Kidding, sort of, it's a masterpiece, okay.

82
00:04:00.454 --> 00:04:02.460
I actually sort of learned about a business

83
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.008
when I was younger, back in the 80s,

84
00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:10.320
when I used to play this game called SimCity.

85
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.064
So, I'm dating myself here, I know.

86
00:04:14.064 --> 00:04:16.105
A lot of people don't even know what this thing is, here.

87
00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:18.361
They call it a floppy disk 'cause it used to be floppy.

88
00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:21.522
I never throw anything out, which my wife can't stand.

89
00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:22.572
It's okay, though.

90
00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:24.561
And recently, I actually introduced my kids to the more

91
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:29.006
recent version of SimCity, as an amazing way to learn about

92
00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:31.082
business, taxes, budgeting,

93
00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:35.602
loans, mortgages, location, location, location,

94
00:04:35.602 --> 00:04:39.602
real estate investing, and overspending as well.

95
00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:43.363
And as a quick side note,

96
00:04:43.363 --> 00:04:45.922
my son Matthew and I are actually making...

97
00:04:45.922 --> 00:04:48.677
he's 12 now, he'll be 13 next year, by the time

98
00:04:48.677 --> 00:04:51.803
this course comes out, but we're actually together making

99
00:04:51.803 --> 00:04:55.434
a free course, coming out within the next year,

100
00:04:55.434 --> 00:04:59.523
teaching kids about business, as well as saving, protecting,

101
00:04:59.523 --> 00:05:04.134
and making money by analyzing Clash of Clans strategies.

102
00:05:04.134 --> 00:05:06.157
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

103
00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:08.299
And it'll be free, look for it within the next year.

104
00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:11.698
And, other ways to get kids interested in saving,

105
00:05:11.698 --> 00:05:15.643
is to show them how to sell their video games

106
00:05:15.643 --> 00:05:18.812
or unused Legos or toys, et cetera, on eBay,

107
00:05:18.812 --> 00:05:21.043
like we talked about earlier in the course.

108
00:05:21.043 --> 00:05:25.581
And let them spend part of the proceeds and save the rest.

109
00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:28.060
It's never too early to start saving.

110
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.456
Get them to look at aliexpress.com

111
00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:35.106
for cool things to sell at school, or on eBay,

112
00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:37.377
with the help of you, of course.

113
00:05:37.377 --> 00:05:40.286
And just teach them about arbitrage, meaning, buying stuff

114
00:05:40.286 --> 00:05:42.574
cheaper and selling it for more.

115
00:05:42.574 --> 00:05:46.618
Which basically is what all retail stores do.

116
00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:48.855
Lastly, this is kinda cool.

117
00:05:48.855 --> 00:05:51.718
You can get your kids interested in the stock market,

118
00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:54.007
which we'll talk about in part three of the course.

119
00:05:54.007 --> 00:05:55.968
You can get your kids interested in the stock market

120
00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:57.801
at www.giveashare.com.

121
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.796
And I'm gonna show you something in a second,

122
00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:03.038
which is pretty cool.

123
00:06:03.038 --> 00:06:05.969
At giveashare.com, what you can do, is you can buy them,

124
00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.731
buy your kids, a framed certificate of a share of,

125
00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:13.842
Walt Disney, for example, or Nike, which is dope,

126
00:06:13.842 --> 00:06:14.984
according to my kids.

127
00:06:14.984 --> 00:06:17.887
Right, that's...I know, I'm trying to act cool,

128
00:06:17.887 --> 00:06:19.727
I'm not, I get it.

129
00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:22.395
Or any cool brand (chuckles) that they love.

130
00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:25.292
And you can have them hang it on their wall if they want.

131
00:06:25.292 --> 00:06:27.377
And you can even...

132
00:06:27.377 --> 00:06:29.625
I'm gonna show this to you, this is kinda fun.

133
00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:33.299
You can even buy them a share of a sports team.

134
00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:36.716
So, I've got one here for my son, Andrew.

135
00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:41.604
He's gettin' this for Christmas, in a week or two.

136
00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:45.017
It's a share of Manchester United.

137
00:06:45.017 --> 00:06:47.473
And that's obviously a football team.

138
00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:50.930
The real football, sorry, which is pretty cool.

139
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.601
I think he'll like this.

140
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:55.115
And hopefully it teaches him to save.

141
00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:57.154
He's my older kid.

142
00:06:57.154 --> 00:07:01.745
And this gift, it serves a couple of purposes.

143
00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:05.249
Number one, he loves the sport of football.

144
00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:07.199
And number two, it's a reminder that he should always

145
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.863
think about saving.

146
00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:12.521
It's pretty cool to have on your wall, too.

147
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:13.996
Andrew actually asked

148
00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:15.163
for a new Xbox

149
00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.214
FIFA game, this Christmas.

150
00:07:18.214 --> 00:07:20.458
And he said, "Dad, no, it's FIFA!"

151
00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:22.386
Right, you know, I'm old, whatever.

152
00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:25.058
And I said, Andrew, you already got that game last year

153
00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:27.602
so why do you need another one, anyway?

154
00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:30.006
And so, instead I bought him this...

155
00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:32.396
I know, they changed the players and all that cool stuff.

156
00:07:32.396 --> 00:07:35.765
But I bought him this badass Manchester United stock

157
00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:40.464
certificate, which again, I'll give it to him on Christmas.

158
00:07:40.464 --> 00:07:43.381
'Cause this will go up in value but

159
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.065
video games will go down in value.

160
00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.731
Right?
Depreciation.

161
00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:51.784
And I'm gonna let Santa get him really boring gifts,

162
00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:54.151
like socks, or clothes.

163
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:56.455
This Manchester United thing is from me, not Santa.

164
00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:59.534
So, Santa will buy him clothes and socks.

165
00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:02.638
Just kidding, (clears throat) sort of, no, no I'm not.

166
00:08:02.638 --> 00:08:05.798
Okay, so I want all the street credit

167
00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:08.607
for getting him this dope gift.

168
00:08:08.607 --> 00:08:09.440
Okay.

169
00:08:10.304 --> 00:08:13.199
Now, we are done with part one of the course,

170
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:15.015
which was the saving portion of the course.

171
00:08:15.015 --> 00:08:17.551
And I really hope you enjoyed taking it

172
00:08:17.551 --> 00:08:19.742
as much as I have making it.

173
00:08:19.742 --> 00:08:22.608
And I will see you in part two of the course,

174
00:08:22.608 --> 00:08:24.543
where we will discuss protecting money.

175
00:08:24.543 --> 00:08:28.032
And then in part three, we will discuss making money.

176
00:08:28.032 --> 00:08:28.865
Thank you.
