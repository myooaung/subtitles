00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:02.380
<v ->Welcome to exercise number two,</v>

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.598
where we'll create your current monthly income statement

3
00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:09.035
so we can figure out ways to save more money

4
00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:10.765
when we do exercise number three.

5
00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:12.627
Okay, so don't worry

6
00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:14.457
if the current income statement

7
00:00:14.457 --> 00:00:17.512
that you create here is not 100% accurate

8
00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:20.439
or perfect 'cause I just kinda want you to understand

9
00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.439
from a high level perspective where your

10
00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.748
money is going and how to save more.

11
00:00:26.748 --> 00:00:29.345
So please open up your complete personal finance

12
00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.427
dashboard Excel document,

13
00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:34.223
and click on the tab called exercise two

14
00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:36.220
and three income statement,

15
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.011
so we can complete exercise number two.

16
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.373
Okay, and so, I want ya to,

17
00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.890
I want ya to please take your time

18
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.101
completing this exercise as I promise you

19
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:47.763
that this will lead to significant savings,

20
00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:49.471
and a much, much higher net worth

21
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:51.422
for you later in life if you take

22
00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:53.859
your time with this exercise.

23
00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.918
As you know, there's a couple ways to access

24
00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:57.924
information in this spreadsheet.

25
00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.178
I'm gonna click here to go to

26
00:00:59.178 --> 00:01:00.796
exercise number two.

27
00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:02.733
You could have also gone up here

28
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.106
to select exercise two,

29
00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:05.939
that sort of thing,

30
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.460
or clicked on income statement here,

31
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.365
it would have gone to the same place.

32
00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:09.198
Okay, cool.

33
00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:12.011
So what we're gonna do now, is we're gonna create

34
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.906
our current income statement.

35
00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.007
Do the best you can, doesn't have to be perfect.

36
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:17.874
But take your time with it please.

37
00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:18.832
So,

38
00:01:18.832 --> 00:01:20.714
an income statement is money in

39
00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:22.420
minus money out.

40
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.092
And as with all of our exercises

41
00:01:25.092 --> 00:01:28.009
we only enter in stuff in the white boxes.

42
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.446
If applicable.

43
00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.736
And so we're gonna do this on a monthly basis.

44
00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:35.604
So let's say that your annual salary is $50,000

45
00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:38.143
and I have it up here in rupees,

46
00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:40.159
you can change to dollars or whatever format you want.

47
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.833
Okay, so let's say I make $50,000 a year.

48
00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.166
I would go 50 divided by 12.

49
00:01:46.068 --> 00:01:46.901
'Kay.

50
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:48.217
We want to look at everything on a monthly basis.

51
00:01:48.217 --> 00:01:50.498
And that's 100% of my pre-tax income

52
00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:52.244
because that's all I've entered in.

53
00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:53.663
So just enter in your salary here

54
00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:54.895
on a monthly basis.

55
00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:57.539
Don't deduct taxes yet, please.

56
00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.219
We'll deduct taxes and other stuff

57
00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.992
in the next part, okay?

58
00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:03.492
Meaning in the money out part.

59
00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:05.423
So,

60
00:02:05.423 --> 00:02:06.617
what we're gonna do also is you can

61
00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:07.450
enter in commissions.

62
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.064
Let's say I make, I don't know,

63
00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:11.220
maybe $10,000 a year in commissions,

64
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.789
so I'll say $10,000 divided by 12.

65
00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.175
Okay so again, just keep everything

66
00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:19.410
on a monthly basis, please.

67
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.427
And you can put in notes here

68
00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:21.958
if you want, so it's optional.

69
00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:22.900
Okay.

70
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.879
Okay, great.

71
00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.165
So monthly income is 5 grand,

72
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.082
that means 60 per year.

73
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.550
And we'll go through here and

74
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.593
if you make money on other stuff as well,

75
00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:34.039
like dividend income, or interest income,

76
00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.930
you can put it here.

77
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.538
Or rental income,

78
00:02:36.538 --> 00:02:39.073
or I don't know, maybe you're driving an Uber on the side,

79
00:02:39.073 --> 00:02:40.768
you can put that here, or Airbnb,

80
00:02:40.768 --> 00:02:42.590
you're renting a room on the side,

81
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.333
or maybe you're teaching a unit.

82
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:47.057
Okay, then after you're done that,

83
00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:49.181
what we're gonna do

84
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:52.600
is we're gonna enter in money out.

85
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.433
Okay?

86
00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:54.695
And I want you to do this again

87
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:55.985
on a monthly basis.

88
00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.878
Federal tax, state tax, or provincial.

89
00:02:58.878 --> 00:02:59.756
That sort of thing.

90
00:02:59.756 --> 00:03:01.184
Healthcare, social security.

91
00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:02.909
Okay and you can get this from your paycheck

92
00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.679
sometimes as well.

93
00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:06.479
Just make it monthly, please.

94
00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.958
And then if you wanted to add more items,

95
00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.896
anywhere, don't, please don't in,

96
00:03:10.896 --> 00:03:13.196
please don't insert or deduct any rows.

97
00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:14.876
Just click on that little plus

98
00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:18.127
and you can insert more here for example, 'kay?

99
00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:19.494
Alright, so

100
00:03:19.494 --> 00:03:21.219
oops, let me get rid of that.

101
00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.226
You can put comments though if you want, as well.

102
00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:26.996
You'll enter in all of your car expenses as well.

103
00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:30.363
You're childcare expenses, if you have them okay?

104
00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:32.996
And stars means potentially tax deductible

105
00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:34.466
and we'll cover that later, 'kay?

106
00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:36.568
If you don't have kids, let's skip that.

107
00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:40.235
Communications and technology expenses here.

108
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.782
Debt you have,

109
00:03:42.782 --> 00:03:44.032
if you have it.

110
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.085
Education expenses, put that here as well.

111
00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.252
Entertainment or hobbies.

112
00:03:50.252 --> 00:03:51.505
And I try to make everything visual,

113
00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:52.923
it's just more fun, it's easier

114
00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:54.749
just to kind of look at images

115
00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.252
instead of looking at boring text.

116
00:03:57.252 --> 00:03:59.839
Food and drinks, on a monthly basis.

117
00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.353
Fees and other charges, like ATM fees

118
00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:04.966
which is a bank machine fee.

119
00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:07.046
And then gifts and donations you make as well

120
00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.492
because they're tax deductible,

121
00:04:08.492 --> 00:04:10.837
we'll cover that later.

122
00:04:10.837 --> 00:04:12.935
Health expenses, I think of these as

123
00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:13.862
more an investment.

124
00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:15.128
That's just me.

125
00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:17.726
Enter all this stuff in here.

126
00:04:17.726 --> 00:04:19.136
Housing.

127
00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:20.984
And if you own a house these will be

128
00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:23.357
quite high, if you don't

129
00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:27.050
then they'll be much lower obviously.

130
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.706
And then we're gonna put your mortgage here as well.

131
00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:29.944
'Kay?

132
00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:30.944
Okay, great.

133
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.303
Personal haircut expenses,

134
00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:35.329
pet's if you have them.

135
00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:36.619
Shopping.

136
00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:38.451
Vacation, you get the idea.

137
00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:40.180
And then other here, if you don't have

138
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.974
it categorized, okay?

139
00:04:41.974 --> 00:04:43.610
And so please go through this

140
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.981
and enter all this information.

141
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:46.844
And the reason why I'm saying to do this

142
00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:47.875
and take your time with it,

143
00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:51.524
is because later, and don't scroll over here yet please.

144
00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:52.647
But I'm going to quickly.

145
00:04:52.647 --> 00:04:54.479
I'm gonna go to the top.

146
00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:55.638
What we're gonna do later is we're

147
00:04:55.638 --> 00:04:58.699
gonna make our new and improved income statements.

148
00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.532
Okay?

149
00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.559
And you'll be able to click on these

150
00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.841
and watch videos, or you can watch videos

151
00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:05.192
in the next section and I'll walk you

152
00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:06.579
though everything, don't worry.

153
00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:08.431
And in terms of how to cut down

154
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:09.424
on these expenses.

155
00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:12.095
And you will be absolutely blown away

156
00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:13.885
with how much money you're going to save.

157
00:05:13.885 --> 00:05:14.718
Which means you're net worth's

158
00:05:14.718 --> 00:05:17.215
gonna be a lot higher after we're done with this, 'kay?

159
00:05:17.215 --> 00:05:18.916
So again, take your time with this

160
00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:21.357
and then when you're done, please watch

161
00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:25.007
the next lecture, and we'll go through

162
00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:27.133
what the bottom line is here.

163
00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:29.330
So what's gonna happen is you will see

164
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.649
your net income right here.

165
00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:34.657
Okay, that's money in minus money out.

166
00:05:34.657 --> 00:05:37.556
And then, again, if you don't use

167
00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:40.655
