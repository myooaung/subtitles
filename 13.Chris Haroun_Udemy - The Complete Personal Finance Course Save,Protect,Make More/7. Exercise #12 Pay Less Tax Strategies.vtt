00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:02.563
<v ->Please go to exercise number 12.</v>

2
00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:05.000
Which is called Pay Less Taxes.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.781
Because I'm gonna ask you a couple questions here

4
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:10.381
that are gonna summarize saving for your retirement

5
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:12.520
which is question number one.

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.659
Saving for educational needs, if applicable,

7
00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.439
which is question number two.

8
00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.598
And a really fun exercise in question number three

9
00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.963
which is it's not really a tax question

10
00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:24.963
but a question of what do I need

11
00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:27.939
or what do you need to save to buy your own airplane

12
00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.734
or, or large ticket item?

13
00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:33.129
So just have fun with this one and once you answer

14
00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.851
the questions as always click on the plus sign

15
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:37.388
to check your answers.

16
00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:42.374
And in this exercise please look closely at what happens

17
00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:46.124
if you change the tax rate from 0% okay,

18
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.230
in the retirement accounts, to 50%.

19
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.050
Assuming the money was never placed

20
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.310
in the retirement account.

21
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.370
As I just want you to see what happens if you

22
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.248
never took advantage of these great tax shelters.

23
00:01:02.248 --> 00:01:04.310
Okay and this will make much more sense

24
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.153
to you once you complete the exercise okay.

25
00:01:07.153 --> 00:01:09.430
And as always please let me know if you have

26
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.130
any questions and, and I really hope you

27
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.233
enjoy exercise number 12,

28
00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.183
especially question number three.
