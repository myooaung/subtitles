<v ->Welcome to exercise number three where we're gonna</v>

2
00:00:03.156 --> 00:00:05.459
create your new and improved income statement.

3
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.758
So please open up your Complete Personal Finance dashboard

4
00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:12.557
excel spreadsheet and go to exercise number three.

5
00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:16.099
Which is on the tab called Exercise 2 and 3

6
00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.077
Income Statements, that's the name of the tab.

7
00:00:18.077 --> 00:00:22.120
So in this exercise we're actually gonna scroll to the right

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.203
and complete money out, you see here.

9
00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:28.776
Money out means expenses.

10
00:00:28.776 --> 00:00:31.896
Expenses portion of the new and improved income statement.

11
00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:34.536
Based on savings that we can now benefit from

12
00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:37.917
as a result of watching the videos on how to save

13
00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:39.334
for each section.

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.157
Which you might have already watched in the course.

15
00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:45.477
Now, if you haven't watched the savings videos,

16
00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:47.795
or you wanna refresher on how to save for each

17
00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.637
expense category here as you complete this,

18
00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:52.936
this exercise then click on the appropriate

19
00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:55.019
video buttons shown here.

20
00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:59.139
And it'll take you to YouTube to watch it there okay.

21
00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:00.465
Or you can go back in the course

22
00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:02.183
and watch it in the course, they're the same thing.

23
00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:06.044
Okay, and the income tax savings button might be tough

24
00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:09.441
for you to implement okay, right away.

25
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:12.863
So if you want, skip the income tax section here okay.

26
00:01:12.863 --> 00:01:15.982
And click on the buttons that apply for you to watch

27
00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:19.063
videos online on how to save for each category.

28
00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:20.944
Again if you haven't watched those videos.

29
00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:22.241
And if they're applicable.

30
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:23.745
Right, if you don't have pets,

31
00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:26.384
or don't have pets or kids then don't watch those sections.

32
00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:28.945
Okay, and again not all of them apply to you.

33
00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:32.081
Take your time with this and really enjoy this exercise

34
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:36.423
please and this is meant as a guideline for you, you know,

35
00:01:36.423 --> 00:01:40.590
so you can spend less and save more in the long run.

36
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:44.444
And when you finish completing your new and improved

37
00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:46.703
income statement I want you to look at the

38
00:01:46.703 --> 00:01:50.684
amazing results at the very bottom of exercise three.

39
00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:52.622
Okay, scroll to the bottom you'll see there okay.

40
00:01:52.622 --> 00:01:54.843
Then in the next lesson, what we're gonna do,

41
00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:56.844
is we're gonna analyze these cool charts

42
00:01:56.844 --> 00:02:00.761
