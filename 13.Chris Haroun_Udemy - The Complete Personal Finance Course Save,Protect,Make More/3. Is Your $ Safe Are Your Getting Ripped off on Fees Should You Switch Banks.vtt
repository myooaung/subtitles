00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:02.644
<v ->What bank should you use?</v>

2
00:00:02.644 --> 00:00:05.180
I personally prefer to use large banks,

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.372
or large financial institutions where

4
00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:11.960
the bank machines or ATMs are close to your house

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.692
if applicable, because fees add up big time,

6
00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:19.712
and quite often, your own bank's bank machine

7
00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:22.712
have little or no fees compared to using

8
00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:25.170
competitor bank machines, in many cases.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.848
We already understand the power of compound interest.

10
00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:31.040
And if we save just a few dollars

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.712
every single month on fees,

12
00:00:33.712 --> 00:00:37.700
then this can literally lead to many thousands of dollars

13
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
in money saved in a lifetime.

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.132
And if you want more details on this,

15
00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:45.904
please revisit the first exercise in the course,

16
00:00:45.904 --> 00:00:48.964
where we calculated what small savings,

17
00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:53.016
like making your own coffee or tea, can lead to

18
00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:55.920
in the long run, which is much, much bigger savings.

19
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.624
So when you select a bank, in addition to comparing

20
00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:03.704
what the interest rate is on your money in that bank,

21
00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:08.024
please research what the fees are at the bank

22
00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:11.700
and at your current bank and competing banks.

23
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.867
Ask them about these fees.

24
00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:17.644
And this will be documented in the exercise.

25
00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.536
Ask them about bank machine fees,

26
00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:25.336
debit card fees if applicable, bounced cheque fees,

27
00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:28.364
fees to print and send you cheques,

28
00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:30.748
and do we need to have a minimum balance

29
00:01:30.748 --> 00:01:32.998
in order to pay lower fees?

30
00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:37.260
Also ask them if there's other withdrawal fees.

31
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.010
And lastly, just ask if there's any fees that

32
00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:47.200
you have not talked about with this bank representative yet.

33
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.752
You can even ask them this way.

34
00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:53.744
"Please let me know what the most misunderstood aspect

35
00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:55.572
"of the fee structure is

36
00:01:55.572 --> 00:01:59.739
"of keeping money at your bank by existing consumers."

37
00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:03.740
And why do I spend so much time on fees?

38
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.908
Because this is how all financial services companies

39
00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:08.708
try to rip us off.

40
00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:09.552
And some of them are noble,

41
00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:11.844
but I'm trying to watch your back here.

42
00:02:11.844 --> 00:02:13.704
And when we discuss investing in mutual funds

43
00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:16.164
later in the course in part three,

44
00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:20.444
you will be so upset about the fees that they charge us.

45
00:02:20.444 --> 00:02:21.808
You'll be so upset that you'll

46
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.420
likely never buy a mutual fund again.

47
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.036
Instead, you'll want to buy what are called index funds,

48
00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:31.200
which are cheaper and beat the mutual funds

49
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.276
when it comes to performance, on average.

50
00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:35.712
Don't worry, I'll cover that more

51
00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:37.036
in part three of the course.

52
00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:40.100
I just want to put this on your radar screen now.

53
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.808
I don't want you to trust

54
00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:43.780
all banks or all financial services companies

55
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.480
because they're not all the same.

56
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.284
You wouldn't buy the first house you saw

57
00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:51.264
or the first car you're considering buying.

58
00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:53.608
So I want you just to take your time

59
00:02:53.608 --> 00:02:56.816
and find the bank with the lowest fees,

60
00:02:56.816 --> 00:03:01.060
and that is the safest place to park your hard-earned money.

61
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.968
This is a great segue now to discussing

62
00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:07.376
government insurance on your money.

63
00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:08.948
In many countries,

64
00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:11.900
the government insures up to a certain amount

65
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.836
on your money in a bank

66
00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:16.503
in case that bank goes bankrupt.

67
00:03:17.452 --> 00:03:19.688
That's probably how they got the word bankrupt.

68
00:03:19.688 --> 00:03:21.172
So, for example,

69
00:03:21.172 --> 00:03:25.280
the amount is currently $250,000 in the United States,

70
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.172
and it's called FDIC insurance,

71
00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:30.589
or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

72
00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:34.328
And that means that if you leave your money

73
00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:36.720
in a bank in the United States,

74
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.884
it's insured up until $250,000.

75
00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:42.540
If you have $300,000 and the bank goes belly up,

76
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.623
you lose 50K.

77
00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:47.376
And so, different countries have different limits,

78
00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:48.560
and these limits will change,

79
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.152
I promise you, they always do.

80
00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:53.036
So please find out what the limit is

81
00:03:53.036 --> 00:03:56.772
on the bank you use in your country,

82
00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:58.964
and if it's a very small amount,

83
00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:00.372
then here's what we're gonna do.

84
00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:01.572
We're gonna consider using

85
00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:04.752
several different banks if applicable.

86
00:04:04.752 --> 00:04:07.240
And some countries make the limit applicable

87
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.020
to certain kinds of accounts.

88
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.948
So you can have a minimum limit of 250K, for example,

89
00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:16.664
in each type of account with the same bank.

90
00:04:16.664 --> 00:04:18.453
Just ask your bank for more details.

91
00:04:18.453 --> 00:04:21.072
Don't just rely on a bank manager

92
00:04:21.072 --> 00:04:23.384
or a financial advisor to tell you the rules.

93
00:04:23.384 --> 00:04:27.120
From now on, please go right to the source

94
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.256
and read, read, read the rules yourself, please.

95
00:04:30.256 --> 00:04:35.220
For example, in the United States, the rules are here.

96
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.184
For every country, it's different.

97
00:04:37.184 --> 00:04:39.584
In Canada, the limit dollar-wise

98
00:04:39.584 --> 00:04:42.968
is 100,000 Canadian dollars, per this link.

99
00:04:42.968 --> 00:04:45.580
In Brazil, it's 250,000 real.

100
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.212
In most European countries, it's close to 100,000 euros.

101
00:04:50.212 --> 00:04:54.308
And just, for more details on the insurance on your money

102
00:04:54.308 --> 00:04:58.584
in your country, please click on the settings buttons here

103
00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:00.500
and scroll down to the gray box and

104
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.084
look at the very last hyperlink, if it's there.

105
00:05:04.084 --> 00:05:06.124
If you don't see a hyperlink there,

106
00:05:06.124 --> 00:05:07.972
then just do a search on

107
00:05:07.972 --> 00:05:11.900
insurance bank protection government and your country name.

108
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.112
Separately, if you're interested in learning more

109
00:05:15.112 --> 00:05:17.244 line:15% 
about deposit insurance in all countries,

110
00:05:17.244 --> 00:05:20.048 line:15% 
you can click on this link here.

111
00:05:20.048 --> 00:05:22.792 line:15% 
Now, if you don't feel comfortable

112
00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:25.944
with the banks in the country that you live in,

113
00:05:25.944 --> 00:05:28.704
then you can even consider depositing some of your money

114
00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:30.204
in Canadian banks.

115
00:05:31.656 --> 00:05:33.800
I'm saying this because there's only five or six

116
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.900
main banks in Canada,

117
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.848
and they're highly regulated,

118
00:05:37.848 --> 00:05:40.896
and none of them went belly up in 2008

119
00:05:40.896 --> 00:05:45.063
versus many banks that went bankrupt in the United States.

120
00:05:46.084 --> 00:05:49.084
If your country doesn't offer insurance

121
00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:50.688
on your money in your bank,

122
00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:53.852
then consider having some of your money in a Canadian bank.

123
00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:58.144
And I'm sure that Switzerland and other countries are

124
00:05:58.144 --> 00:05:59.656
good alternatives as well.

125
00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:01.608
Just please do your own research first,

126
00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:04.172
don't just rely on me, please, thank you.

127
00:06:04.172 --> 00:06:06.020
And in general,

128
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.504
if you use a large bank as your primary and only bank,

129
00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:15.244
then usually, your entire deposits are insured.

130
00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:17.632
Why use a large bank?

131
00:06:17.632 --> 00:06:20.404
Because later in the course, I'm gonna discuss

132
00:06:20.404 --> 00:06:23.076
many different ways to invest your money,

133
00:06:23.076 --> 00:06:24.704
and the largest banks

134
00:06:24.704 --> 00:06:27.372
usually have their own investment departments,

135
00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:30.268
which is very convenient when

136
00:06:30.268 --> 00:06:34.064
we are going to invest our savings in index funds,

137
00:06:34.064 --> 00:06:35.532
or bonds, or commodities,

138
00:06:35.532 --> 00:06:37.572
or real estate investment trusts, et cetera.

139
00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:40.056
And this will all make much more sense to you

140
00:06:40.056 --> 00:06:43.656
in part three of the course when we discuss making money.

141
00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:47.823
Now, if the bank does not have investment divisions,

142
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.056
then they can recommend, just ask them,

143
00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:54.904
which investment firms to use,

144
00:06:54.904 --> 00:06:57.108
or we can find them ourselves.

145
00:06:57.108 --> 00:06:59.600
Again, we'll cover this in part three of the course.

146
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.984
And so the bottom line here is

147
00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:06.260
to use a large, well-known bank if you can,

148
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.292
as they usually have deposit insurance

149
00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:11.796
and are usually too big too fail.

150
00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:13.912
I cringe when I say that.

151
00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:16.444
And if you get a chance, please,

152
00:07:16.444 --> 00:07:18.620
the best movie ever

153
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.544
that explains what really happened in 2008

154
00:07:21.544 --> 00:07:23.808
is called Too Big to Fail,

155
00:07:23.808 --> 00:07:26.808
and you can rent it here on YouTube.

156
00:07:28.188 --> 00:07:31.684
DTA when it comes to your money.

157
00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:34.517
DTA stands for don't trust anyone.

158
00:07:35.404 --> 00:07:39.108
And I want you to read all disclosures from now on

159
00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:42.708
before putting your money anywhere.

160
00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:45.544
You work so damn hard for your money,

161
00:07:45.544 --> 00:07:48.552
and I just want your hard work to be protected.

162
00:07:48.552 --> 00:07:51.476
And there's so many unethical hidden fees

163
00:07:51.476 --> 00:07:53.908
that companies will try to charge you.

164
00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.932
So please read the disclosures,

165
00:07:55.932 --> 00:07:59.744
and read them again, as painful as that may seem.

166
00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:03.792
And when we visit a doctor and they want us to do surgery

167
00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:05.400
on your loved one, yourself, whatever,

168
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.924
you always review in massive detail what the risks are

169
00:08:08.924 --> 00:08:11.520
and you get a second opinion sometimes.

170
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.940
And we really need to do the same when it comes

171
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.164
to our hard-earned money.

172
00:08:16.164 --> 00:08:19.280
And so in the next lesson, we're gonna do an exercise

173
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.876
to make sure that your money is safe

174
00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:24.900
and that you are not getting ripped off on fees.
