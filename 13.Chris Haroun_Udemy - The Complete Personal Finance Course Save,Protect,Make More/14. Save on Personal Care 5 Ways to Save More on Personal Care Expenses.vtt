<v ->This section's a lot of fun.</v>

2
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.810
Personal care expense tip number one.

3
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.825
Cold water works and it's cheaper tip.

4
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:19.966
Use cold water to wash your laundry, if possible.

5
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.481
Hot water costs you a fortune.

6
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:23.436
I'll move on to number two because this is

7
00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.825
one of my favorite ones.

8
00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:29.175
Okay, this one's called cut it yourself, okay,

9
00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:32.070
and before I surprise you with what I'm talking about,

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.928
I want to talk about this, okay.

11
00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:36.326
In my hand, in this container,

12
00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:40.073
I'm holding something that cost me less than $20

13
00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.835
many years ago when I bought it

14
00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:46.085
and it's saved me about $20,000 so far,

15
00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.570
and it sounds crazy,

16
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.320
and it's a bit of a riddle, okay,

17
00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:55.293
so see if you can guess what it is.

18
00:00:55.293 --> 00:00:58.793
Okay, let me first of all open it up here.

19
00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:00.647
Whoa.

20
00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:03.260
So shiny.

21
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Whoa, right.

22
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.310
Hundred dollars in ones, that's not what I'm talking about,

23
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.143
a boot.

24
00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:15.262
$500, no, this thing's made me more than that,

25
00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.669
or saved me more than that.

26
00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:20.419
A thousand dollars in tens, nope.

27
00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:23.476
$2,000 in 20s, nope.

28
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:29.648
$5,000 in 50s, nope, more.

29
00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.858
$10,000 in one hundreds, no, more,

30
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.545
way more than that, and this,

31
00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:42.022
by the way, this is all fake money, okay.

32
00:01:42.022 --> 00:01:43.450
It looks real, though right?

33
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.622
Okay, anyway.

34
00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:46.269
By the way, you can't photocopy money.

35
00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:47.364
A buddy of mine tried to do it recently

36
00:01:47.364 --> 00:01:49.576
and the police actually came.

37
00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.578
He was doing it for a joke.

38
00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:52.504
All photocopy machines, apparently,

39
00:01:52.504 --> 00:01:53.623
are hooked up to the police.

40
00:01:53.623 --> 00:01:55.133
Anyway, off topic.

41
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:58.247
Alright, so I don't know if you've guessed what this is yet.

42
00:01:58.247 --> 00:01:59.997
I'll give you a hint.

43
00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:04.239
It's something that you spend money on every month

44
00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.617
that involves cutting.

45
00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:09.458
Alright, you probably guessed that what I'm holding here

46
00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:12.519
is something that helps me cut my hair.

47
00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.186
And so I used to go,

48
00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.586
I used to go to Frank and Jimmy's Barber Shop, good guys,

49
00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:20.753
in Mississauga, Canada, and I would go

50
00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:25.567
and every two or three weeks they would ask me a question,

51
00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:28.245
which was number one or number two

52
00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:29.383
or number three or number four,

53
00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:30.873
and I would say number four.

54
00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:34.381
He'd take this thing out and then he'd put number four on,

55
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:37.443
this guy here, and you know the cost is close

56
00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:40.881
to 20 bucks with the tip, so I do it myself

57
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.437
and I've been doing it myself for a long, long time now.

58
00:02:43.437 --> 00:02:45.241
And I went to Costco, which is a big retail store

59
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:47.806
here in the United States, and I bought these

60
00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:49.990
for less than 20 bucks, okay,

61
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.990
and we joke that if you can't find it at Costco,

62
00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:56.346
then you don't need it.

63
00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:58.742
Okay, so every two or three weeks or so,

64
00:02:58.742 --> 00:03:00.573
I put my hair over the trash bin

65
00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:02.652
and I cut my hair with this thing.

66
00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:06.819
Actually even, I cut the back of my hair with this.

67
00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:10.139
I ordered this off of ebay.

68
00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.609
Let me put that down on the fake money.

69
00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.415
I put this on the back here, right here,

70
00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:18.470
around my ears, and then I just kind of cut the back

71
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.049
and hopefully the line is straight.

72
00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.248
Sometimes it's a little off, but whatever.

73
00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:24.237
Anyway, that's what I do.

74
00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.252
It's fun saving money and it feels great

75
00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:28.340
to get a deal, you know,

76
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.158
and it's good for the kids too,

77
00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:32.880
my kids to see this because, you know,

78
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.103
they hopefully can grow up,

79
00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:37.570
they'll grow up and be able to save money as well.

80
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.243
I wasn't good at saving money when I was younger, though.

81
00:03:40.243 --> 00:03:43.827
Okay, personal care expense tip number three.

82
00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:46.070
Doctor's face and hands tip.

83
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.153
What?

84
00:03:47.153 --> 00:03:49.431
Okay, wash your hands a lot more.

85
00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:52.852
Use Purell a lot more as you won't get sick as much,

86
00:03:52.852 --> 00:03:55.414
which is going to save you a lot of money in lost wages,

87
00:03:55.414 --> 00:03:57.722
and I asked my doctor recently,

88
00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:01.116
I said, dude, why is it that you're around sick people

89
00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.699
all day and you don't get sick?

90
00:04:05.248 --> 00:04:06.998
Like what's your tip?

91
00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:09.305
And he said there's two reasons.

92
00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:11.780
Number one, he washes his hands constantly,

93
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.420
and number two, he never touches his face,

94
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.542
and if you get everybody in your family to wash their hands,

95
00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:20.148
especially the kids more often,

96
00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:22.991
then the results are awesome because what really sucks

97
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.333
is that when, you know one person gets sick,

98
00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:28.505
at least in my house, then it leads to others too.

99
00:04:28.505 --> 00:04:30.498
Okay, tip number four.

100
00:04:30.498 --> 00:04:32.656
Please don't over dry clean.

101
00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:36.239
If possible, wear it again before you dry clean,

102
00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:40.406
and do you really need to dry clean that many times anyway?

103
00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.615
So you can hang up your shirt by the shower

104
00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:45.457
when you use the shower,

105
00:04:45.457 --> 00:04:48.640
as it un-wrinkles much faster that way,

106
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.044
after a few days, okay.

107
00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:52.960
Also, I actually stopped using an iron,

108
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.124
as it destroys clothes, especially when I would iron

109
00:04:56.124 --> 00:04:59.450
the collars here, it would just absolutely destroy them.

110
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.533
And this thing here actually cost me.

111
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.549
It's a steamer.

112
00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:08.159
It cost me about 20 bucks, and it actually,

113
00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.400
it saved me a lot of money over time,

114
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.721
and I used a steamer here on this white sheet

115
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:15.075
at the back here as well.

116
00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:16.545
I just kind of, you drag down.

117
00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:18.312
It's way better than an iron.

118
00:05:18.312 --> 00:05:21.184
It's like getting a touchless car wash, sort of,

119
00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:25.101
if you have a nice paint job on your car, okay.

120
00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:29.990
Tip number five, hang 'em up tip.

121
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.242
Hang up your clothes to dry them.

122
00:05:32.242 --> 00:05:33.664
And this one's simple but I have to mention it

123
00:05:33.664 --> 00:05:36.248
because the dryer, you don't realize this,

124
00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:38.357
but a dryer costs you a fortune to run

125
00:05:38.357 --> 00:05:40.339
in terms of electricity,

126
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:44.339
or coins that you use at the laundromat as well.
