00:00:00.638 --> 00:00:02.904
<v ->Now that you've completed your balance sheets</v>

2
00:00:02.904 --> 00:00:06.702
and you understand what your net worth is, let's analyze it.

3
00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:09.093
So, please select exercise number eight,

4
00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:12.525
which is called analyzing your BS.

5
00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:16.026
I'm seven, okay, so question one,

6
00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:17.555
the reason I had to write it that way is cause

7
00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:20.838
you can't fit enough characters in balance sheet so it's BS.

8
00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:24.851
Sorry, okay, anyways, so question one in exercise eight

9
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:28.921
deals with a concept called solvency ratio.

10
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.530
And the higher solvency ratio, the better, okay?

11
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.842
It's, your solvency ratio is calculated by dividing

12
00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:39.082
your net worth by your assets.

13
00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:41.682
And the result is a percent ratio,

14
00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:44.247
and again, higher is better.

15
00:00:44.247 --> 00:00:46.129
And this is really important as

16
00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.711
the value of our assets would need to fall

17
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:52.599
by our solvency ratio percent in order for us to

18
00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:55.695
potentially be in financial trouble.

19
00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:58.924
And we're gonna focus on increasing your solvency ratio

20
00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.385
in this course, and we really want

21
00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:03.409
this percent to be above 50% long run, okay?

22
00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.159
So here's an example:

23
00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:10.059
if your net worth was 50, and assets were 200,

24
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.001
then your solvency ratio would be 25%.

25
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.386
And if your assets dropped in value by 25%

26
00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:20.636
then you could be in financial trouble.

27
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.195
If your solvency ratio is below 50% now don't worry

28
00:01:24.195 --> 00:01:26.174
because we are gonna work on increasing this, okay?

29
00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:28.650
So please complete question number one,

30
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.124
so you can calculate your solvency ratio,

31
00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.849
and again, don't worry if it's way too,

32
00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:36.543
if this number is way, way too low,

33
00:01:36.543 --> 00:01:39.250
as this course is really focusing in helping you

34
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.417
to improve this ratio and many others in the long run.

35
00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:48.654
Okay, so once you've completed question number one,

36
00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:50.987
then please click on the plus symbol

37
00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:53.382
here to check your answers,

38
00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:55.810
which is linked to the balance sheet tab

39
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.927
that you completed in exercise seven.

40
00:01:57.927 --> 00:01:59.259
Okay, so please pause me now

41
00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.076
and complete question number one.

42
00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:02.159
Thanks.

43
00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:07.017
Okay, let's move on to question number two now,

44
00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:10.674
which is your debt to equity ratio.

45
00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:13.545
Your debt to equity ratio is calculated by taking

46
00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:18.270
your liabilities and dividing it by your net worth.

47
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.635
And your net worth we know is called equity,

48
00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:22.365
it's just another name for it.

49
00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:25.271
So, when we calculate our debt to equity,

50
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:29.303
meaning debt divided by equity, lower is better, of course.

51
00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:30.932
Because we wanna have less debt

52
00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:32.913
as a percentage of your net worth.

53
00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:36.918
As you get older this ratio should fall a lot

54
00:02:36.918 --> 00:02:40.293
as you pay off your mortgage and other obligations,

55
00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:43.398
and as your savings increases a lot.

56
00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:45.954
So please pause me now and complete question number two

57
00:02:45.954 --> 00:02:47.997
and then, click on the plus

58
00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:50.210
symbol here to check your answers.

59
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.684
And, before you move on to question three,

60
00:02:53.684 --> 00:02:56.070
just always remember what your

61
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.678
current solvency and debt to equity ratios are,

62
00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:01.991
As they're gonna improve a lot in the long run

63
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.581
if you apply what is learnt in this course.

64
00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:07.068
Just pause me now and complete

65
00:03:07.068 --> 00:03:10.568
question number two and come back, thanks.

66
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.930
Okay, let's move on to question number three now

67
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.709
where we're gonna calculate your debt to assets ratio.

68
00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.393
And your debt to assets ratio is calculated

69
00:03:20.393 --> 00:03:23.074
by dividing your debt, meaning liabilities,

70
00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:25.207
by your assets, and really try

71
00:03:25.207 --> 00:03:28.699
to understand these ratios, don't just memorize them.

72
00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.427
if you understand them thoroughly,

73
00:03:30.427 --> 00:03:32.297
just take some time to think about it,

74
00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:36.665
then, I promise you that your financial situation

75
00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:39.082
will improve in the long run.

76
00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:43.242
When we look at debt to assets the result is a percent ratio

77
00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:45.339
and lower is better, of course.

78
00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.342
So we're gonna focus on decreasing your debt to assets ratio

79
00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:53.509
in this course and we want this percent to be below 50%.

80
00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.902
So, please complete question number three

81
00:03:56.902 --> 00:04:01.042
and then click on the plus sign here to check your answers.

82
00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:02.625
Thank you.
