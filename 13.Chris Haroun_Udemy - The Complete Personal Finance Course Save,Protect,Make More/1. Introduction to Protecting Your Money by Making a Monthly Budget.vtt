00:00:00.745 --> 00:00:03.919
<v ->Now that you understand your personal balance sheet.</v>

2
00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.994
And now that you understand your personal income statement

3
00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:10.841
and saving more money, let's make a budget now.

4
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:13.483
Let's make a budget so you can get closer to reaching

5
00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:15.737
your financial goals.

6
00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:19.187
Now although Quicken can help you create your own budget

7
00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:23.251
per these images I wanna us to create your budget

8
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:27.685
using your complete personal finance Excel dashboard.

9
00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:31.913
I want us to do this together in the next exercise so

10
00:00:31.913 --> 00:00:36.092
we can understand how we can achieve our financial goals.

11
00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:39.384
So we can save for retirement, save for university

12
00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:41.919
for the kids, save for a vacation home,

13
00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:45.375
save for a second or third home, etcetera.

14
00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.675
We've already done enough exercises

15
00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:50.470
that we now understand the time value of money.

16
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.718
And what the future value of our savings can be worth

17
00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:57.295
given the awesome power of compound interest.

18
00:00:57.295 --> 00:00:59.857
But before we get started with our budget exercise

19
00:00:59.857 --> 00:01:03.765
in the next lesson if you don't have much in savings

20
00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:05.996
or you can't afford to saving anything yet

21
00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:07.898
please don't worry.

22
00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:11.562
Don't worry but please promise me one thing,

23
00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:13.505
promise me the second you get a raise

24
00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:15.776
please immediately increase how much money

25
00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:19.102
is (snaps) automatically removed from your paycheck

26
00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:21.927
or a bank account and placed into your investment

27
00:01:21.927 --> 00:01:23.787
or retirement accounts.

28
00:01:23.787 --> 00:01:26.037
Especially since as we know

29
00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:29.595
you can get amazing tax rates

30
00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:31.138
or tax breaks I should say

31
00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:34.231
by investing in your retirement accounts.

32
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:36.569
And not doing so is really like

33
00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.878
throwing money in the garbage.

34
00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:42.048
When you get that next raise

35
00:01:42.048 --> 00:01:43.213
I want you to move the money immediately

36
00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:46.055
so it's out of sight and out of mind.

37
00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:50.221
Like if you have candy or chips at your house

38
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:52.721
you'll be tempted to eat them.

39
00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:56.999
We don't wanna eat into your savings.

40
00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.898
And we just wanna make sure that your money's out of sight

41
00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:00.947
and out of mind.

42
00:02:00.947 --> 00:02:04.057
All successful companies have budgets.

43
00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:07.208
And these companies are successful because they stay

44
00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:09.290
within their budgets.

45
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.145
And they see their earnings per share increase over time

46
00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.955
because of this, they stay in their budgets

47
00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:17.027
which investors love to see.

48
00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:21.234
And so similarly together we will create a monthly budget

49
00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:22.703
for you in the next lesson.
