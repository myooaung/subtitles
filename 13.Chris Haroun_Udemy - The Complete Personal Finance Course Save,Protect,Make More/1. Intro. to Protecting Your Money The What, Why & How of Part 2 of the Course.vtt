00:00:00.323 --> 00:00:02.823
(funky music)

2
00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:07.437
<v ->Welcome to part two of the course,</v>

3
00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:10.595
which deals with protecting your money.

4
00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:15.309
Actors that actually win Oscars live five years longer

5
00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.366
than actors that don't,

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.885
and the reason is because they feel a sense

7
00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:23.011
of accomplishment and peace of mind.

8
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:26.360
Imagine how much longer you could live

9
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.099
or how much healthier you could be

10
00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.659
if you had financial peace of mind.

11
00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.187
And so by the end of part two of this course,

12
00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:37.155
my goal is not only to help you protect your loved ones,

13
00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:39.000
your possessions and money,

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.537
but also to feel more in control

15
00:00:41.537 --> 00:00:45.125
of your financial assets, meaning the stuff you own,

16
00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.584
so that you don't ever worry about the future

17
00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:51.848
or your financial wellbeing, okay?

18
00:00:51.848 --> 00:00:54.365
Or at least minimize that worry a lot.

19
00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.999
And I love this quote from Winston Churchill.

20
00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.042
He once said, "When I look back on all these worries,

21
00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:03.155
"I remember the story of the old man

22
00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.924
"who sat on his deathbed, that he had a lot of trouble

23
00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:09.773
"in his life, most of which never happened."

24
00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:11.384
I know my English accent's not very good.

25
00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:12.809
I'm trying.

26
00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:13.746
(laughing)

27
00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:16.701
Let me just put this fake Oscar down

28
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.784
so we can talk about the what, why and how

29
00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:21.288
of this course.

30
00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:24.211
So let me kick it off with the what

31
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.451
by the end of part two of this course,

32
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:31.334
you're gonna understand what you own and what you owe,

33
00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:34.557
meaning we'll create your personal balance sheet.

34
00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:35.390
Why?

35
00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:39.121
So we can calculate your net worth

36
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.483
and so we can look at protecting what you have,

37
00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:45.992
and more importantly, what you will have money-wise

38
00:01:45.992 --> 00:01:49.213
later in life, which will be way more

39
00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.580
than you expect, okay?

40
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.298 line:15% 
Lastly, how.

41
00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:55.645 line:15% 
How can we sleep better knowing

42
00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:59.095 line:15% 
that our current and future net worth is protected?

43
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:01.612 line:15% 
Well, what we're gonna do is we're gonna do a number

44
00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:04.407 line:15% 
of exercises to kinda help us understand

45
00:02:04.407 --> 00:02:07.692 line:15% 
how to protect our loved ones and our nest egg,

46
00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:10.722 line:15% 
including types of insurance, types of wills,

47
00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:12.791 line:15% 
types of trusts, types of tax shelters

48
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.647 line:15% 
and protecting against identity theft.

49
00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:15.480 line:15% 
And don't worry.

50
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.458 line:15% 
It's not gonna be boring.

51
00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:17.730 line:15% 
Whenever people hear the word insurance,

52
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.180 line:15% 
they're like oh my God, I'm do bored.

53
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.437 line:15% 
It's not gonna be boring.

54
00:02:20.437 --> 00:02:21.303 line:15% 
You'll enjoy it.

55
00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:23.317 line:15% 
And so here in part two of the course,

56
00:02:23.317 --> 00:02:26.903 line:15% 
we're also gonna discuss your credit score

57
00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:28.726 line:15% 
and how to improve it,

58
00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:32.951 line:15% 
and we're gonna discuss software based organizing strategies

59
00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:37.506 line:15% 
for your money and a non-computer based paper filing

60
00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:41.207 line:15% 
organization system I created that is not that advanced,

61
00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:43.755 line:15% 
but will make you much more comfortable

62
00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:46.999 line:15% 
with having control over your finances.

63
00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.399 line:15% 
And so we're also gonna discuss how to make sure

64
00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.548 line:15% 
that you're not getting ripped off with banking fees

65
00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:56.224 line:15% 
by choosing the right bank for you, okay?

66
00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:59.253 line:15% 
And we'll talk about whether a financial advisor

67
00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:01.292 line:15% 
is right for you or not.

68
00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:04.204 line:15% 
In most cases, it's not, but I'll still cover that.

69
00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.455 line:15% 
And a financial advisor is different from an accountant.

70
00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:09.111 line:15% 
And we're also gonna discuss tax shelters

71
00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:12.087 line:15% 
for your retirement and your children's education

72
00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:13.254 line:15% 
if applicable.

73
00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:16.407 line:15% 
And we're gonna discuss how the wealthiest people

74
00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:19.370 line:15% 
in the world protect their money.

75
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.378 line:15% 
And so by end of part two of this course,

76
00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:23.682 line:15% 
you're gonna have a solid knowledge

77
00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.612 line:15% 
of how to protect your money,

78
00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:26.786 line:15% 
and then after that, we're gonna discuss

79
00:03:26.786 --> 00:03:28.706 line:15% 
how to make money or make more money

80
00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:31.692 line:15% 
or make your money work for you in part three of the course.

81
00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:34.999 line:15% 
So let's begin by calculating your net worth

82
00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:35.959 line:15% 
in the next lecture.

83
00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:36.792 line:15% 
Thanks.
