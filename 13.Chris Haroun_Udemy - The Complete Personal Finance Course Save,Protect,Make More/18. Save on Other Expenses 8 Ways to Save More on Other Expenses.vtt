<v ->Other expense Tip #1, buy at month end or quarter end tip.</v>

2
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.351
Buy at month end or quarter end, given quotas.

3
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:20.269
A lot of sales people have monthly or quarterly quotas

4
00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.667
and if you buy at month or quarterly end, they're more

5
00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.643
likely to give you a deep discount any way.

6
00:00:27.643 --> 00:00:30.626
Okay, and I know I covered that little bit of detail

7
00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:34.075
earlier when I talked about speeding tickets,

8
00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.644
but as with all big purchases,

9
00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:37.424
you gotta buy right at the end

10
00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:39.576
of the quarter or the accounting period.

11
00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:41.623
Just think like a sales person always whenever you're

12
00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:43.624
buying something, you'll get a better deal.

13
00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:46.345
Always, in business, always think like the other person,

14
00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:49.364
what is their motivation, that sort of thing.

15
00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:51.695
Why am I so lucky to be given this opportunity right now,

16
00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:55.688
if somebody asks you to invest in their company.

17
00:00:55.688 --> 00:01:00.168
Other expense Tip #2, call and complain tip.

18
00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:04.180
I want you to call and complain on all products

19
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.774
that you think were too expensive relative to what you paid

20
00:01:06.774 --> 00:01:09.912
for them, like cable companies, etc.

21
00:01:09.912 --> 00:01:14.441
My grandfather, God bless him, when I was a kid,

22
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:18.608
we were having dinner and the Heinz ketchup was too watery.

23
00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:23.557
He actually wrote a letter to Heinz, I'll never forget this,

24
00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:26.743
and they literally sent him a whole crate of ketchup

25
00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:28.303
to his house.

26
00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:31.177
I remember he actually did the same thing with a sink

27
00:01:31.177 --> 00:01:33.630
that he tried to install in his basement that was cracked.

28
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.284
The company sent him two new sinks for free.

29
00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:37.784
Why can this work?

30
00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:41.375
Because most consumers don't complain.

31
00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:44.274
I want you to complain a lot please, if it's warranted,

32
00:01:44.274 --> 00:01:45.608
of course.

33
00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:49.775
You know, complain at big retail stores, at Wal-Mart,

34
00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:56.555
at any store you buy appliances from, at hardware stores.

35
00:01:56.555 --> 00:01:57.506
You know why?

36
00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:01.554
Because those big companies are so profitable anyway

37
00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.479
and you know, for the most part, they're obsessed

38
00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.607
with customer experience.

39
00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:10.943
Companies like United Airlines know that they are all

40
00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:14.248
one tweet away from upset customers, which can lead

41
00:02:14.248 --> 00:02:16.581
to millions in lost profits.

42
00:02:17.423 --> 00:02:21.462
The best companies like Amazon.com know that the customer

43
00:02:21.462 --> 00:02:25.356
is always or almost always right and a company is only

44
00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:27.828
as good as its customer service.

45
00:02:27.828 --> 00:02:29.207
I really believe that.

46
00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:33.240
You earn the right to complain the second you paid them

47
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.415
for a product or service that they are selling to you

48
00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:40.582
for much more than what it costs them.

49
00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:45.649
They want to help you stay happy, so please complain a lot

50
00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.412
if it's necessary.

51
00:02:47.412 --> 00:02:50.696
It doesn't always work, but I promise you, I promise you,

52
00:02:50.696 --> 00:02:54.668
you will save a lot of money this way in the long run.

53
00:02:54.668 --> 00:02:59.147
Other expense Tip #3, export credit card tip.

54
00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:00.383
What does that mean?

55
00:03:00.383 --> 00:03:04.254
I export all of my credit card files from the credit card

56
00:03:04.254 --> 00:03:07.470
websites and then I import this data into Excel

57
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.086
and I always analyze the statements.

58
00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:13.253
Look for incorrect charges

59
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.358
and give your credit card exports, those files, annually

60
00:03:19.358 --> 00:03:22.418
to your accountant and as the accountant

61
00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:26.335
to find legal tax deductions, of course, legal.

62
00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:32.308
Although your accountant, if you have one, is supposed

63
00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:36.475
to stay within the law when it comes to tax deductions,

64
00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.989
always question them on the legitimacy

65
00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.248
of your tax deductions, just to be safe, as ignorance

66
00:03:43.248 --> 00:03:47.415
of the tax laws is no excuse and audits can be very painful.

67
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.527
Other expense Tip #4, get me off your list please tip.

68
00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:58.250
In the long run you will save money and your time as well,

69
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.179
which you can't get it back, if you receive fewer

70
00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:03.367
promotional emails or phone calls.

71
00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:08.029
What I do every single month is a I search my Gmail email

72
00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.765
inbox for the word unsubscribe.

73
00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:12.650
I search for unsubscribe.

74
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.197
And then what I do is I click on the unsubscribe link

75
00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:19.436
at the bottom of many of those emails.

76
00:04:19.436 --> 00:04:22.800
If I have to give my email address away and my name,

77
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.967
I usually write my name first in those emails as Christopher

78
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:31.843
and not Chris, as the only person that calls me Christopher

79
00:04:31.843 --> 00:04:34.071
is my mom when she's mad at me.

80
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:35.673
I love you, Mom.

81
00:04:35.673 --> 00:04:38.161
I was called Christopher a lot growing up.

82
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:42.118
You could also get off pesky phone lists by searching

83
00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:46.285
for do not call lists in your country name in Google

84
00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.657
and by law a lot of times, you can actually get

85
00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:52.127
off these lists, right, especially the idiotic ones

86
00:04:52.127 --> 00:04:54.848
where they call you, I hate that, at like 9:00 at night

87
00:04:54.848 --> 00:04:56.473
or on the weekends.

88
00:04:56.473 --> 00:04:59.533
You can get off those lists, if you just tell them,

89
00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:00.709
take me off the list.

90
00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:02.492
Sometimes what I'll do if they call me

91
00:05:02.492 --> 00:05:04.600
and they're really rude or whatever, rarely, I say,

92
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.559
oh wow, that sounds great.

93
00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.707
Hold on a sec, I'll be right there.

94
00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:10.200
Okay, anyway, sorry, off topic.

95
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.605
Other expense Tip #5, hire an accountant tip.

96
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.501
I'm going to stress this a couple more times in the course.

97
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:20.251
Always hire an accountant to file your taxes.

98
00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:24.934
If you are in a high tax bracket or have a very complicated

99
00:05:24.934 --> 00:05:28.237
tax return, paying a tax lawyer for one or two hours

100
00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:31.377
of advice every year is an investment that provides

101
00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:35.916
unbelievable savings in the long term, I promise you.

102
00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:38.958
Accountants are not all expensive.

103
00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.505
Ask your friends, your loved ones, your parents,

104
00:05:42.505 --> 00:05:44.193
people that are older than you that you're related to,

105
00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:47.213
for recommendations on a good accountant to hire.

106
00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:51.246
Your relationship with an accountant is so important

107
00:05:51.246 --> 00:05:54.262
as you can always call this accountant during the year

108
00:05:54.262 --> 00:05:58.400
when it's not tax season and ask them about their thoughts

109
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.177
on an investment that you might make.

110
00:06:01.177 --> 00:06:04.075
If you can put this investment in a tax shelter

111
00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:08.814
before you invest, because after you invest, it can often

112
00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:13.134
be impossible to move the investment to a tax free

113
00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:15.141
or tax reduced account.

114
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.606
We'll talk much more about that later in the course.

115
00:06:18.606 --> 00:06:21.646
Other expense Tip #6, the lottery tip.

116
00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:23.470
Never buy lottery tickets or gamble.

117
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.625
You literally have a better chance of dying by using

118
00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:31.253
a vending machine than you do winning the lottery.

119
00:06:31.253 --> 00:06:32.303
Isn't that crazy?

120
00:06:32.303 --> 00:06:35.834
Sounds out there, but have you ever heard of anybody

121
00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:38.495
that has died because of a vending machine falling?

122
00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:42.953
Exactly, okay, and this statistic absolutely blew me away.

123
00:06:42.953 --> 00:06:45.750
Check this out, this is crazy.

124
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.969
70% of all people that win the lottery end up losing

125
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.394
all of that money as well as all the money they had

126
00:06:53.394 --> 00:06:57.305
before they won the lottery, within seven years.

127
00:06:57.305 --> 00:07:01.237
Crazy, and it's eerily similar to the football statistic

128
00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:04.784
we talked about earlier in the course.

129
00:07:04.784 --> 00:07:07.878
Other expense Tip #7, Pinterest Tip.

130
00:07:07.878 --> 00:07:11.461
Go to Google and type this, Pinterest cheap

131
00:07:12.747 --> 00:07:15.951
and then the product you want to buy or make.

132
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:18.950
It's really fun to do as well.

133
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.335
Other expense Tip #8, wedding expense tip.

134
00:07:22.335 --> 00:07:26.021
Get married on a Friday night as it's much cheaper.

135
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:29.610
Also, only get married once as it's cheaper.

136
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.919
Just kidding, just kidding about getting married

137
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.468
on a Friday night, okay, sorry not funny.

138
00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:37.807
Okay, I'm Dad humor, I know I get it.

139
00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:38.775
I try at least.

140
00:07:38.775 --> 00:07:42.100
Okay, we're now done discussing the more than 100 ways

141
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.836
to save money and the next step is to please,

142
00:07:44.836 --> 00:07:48.487
watch the next video, where we're going to create

143
00:07:48.487 --> 00:07:50.737
your new and improved income statement.

144
00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:51.599
Thank you.
