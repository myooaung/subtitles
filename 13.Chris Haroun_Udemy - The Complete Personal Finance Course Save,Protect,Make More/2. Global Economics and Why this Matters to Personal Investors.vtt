00:00:00.652 --> 00:00:02.788
<v ->In this lesson what we're gonna do is we're</v>

2
00:00:02.788 --> 00:00:05.475
gonna discuss three different global entities

3
00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.291
that we can use to better understand

4
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.275
global economics and interest rates.

5
00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:12.178
So we're gonna talk about one,

6
00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.721
the International Money Fund,

7
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:15.706
the second one is the World Bank,

8
00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:18.641
and the third one is the World Trade Organization.

9
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:22.095
So why are we discussing these three entities?

10
00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:24.495
Because they're a great source of country

11
00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.833
and regional research that we can do before considering

12
00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:32.227
buying bonds or other investments in other countries.

13
00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:34.339
Now the IMF, which is also called

14
00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.246
the International Monetary Fund, was created in 1944

15
00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:41.939
with the intention of making sure that the Great Depression

16
00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:46.106
of the 1930s never occurs again, as it almost did in 2008.

17
00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.506
And later in the course I'm gonna explain what really

18
00:00:50.506 --> 00:00:53.926
happened in 2008, because as personal investors

19
00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:56.528
trying to save, protect, and make more money,

20
00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.081
we have to understand what really happened,

21
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:02.553
so we are protected and somewhat insulated

22
00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:05.986
when it comes to our net worth and when it comes

23
00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:09.419
to our investment diversification strategies.

24
00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:12.547
Now the IMF has a 189 member countries,

25
00:01:12.547 --> 00:01:16.878
and the IMF's parent organization is the United Nations,

26
00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:20.393
and the IMF's goal is to make sure that the global economy

27
00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:23.115
is growing, meaning GDP is growing;

28
00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:25.631
while trying to minimize poverty and helping

29
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:28.982
to facilitate international trade at the same time.

30
00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:31.916
The IMF doesn't just give advice to countries,

31
00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:34.493
it can actually lend money to countries too

32
00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:37.915
that are experiencing balance of payments problems,

33
00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:41.533
meaning they owe more than what they have.

34
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.138
And when oil prices are high it can have

35
00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:48.174
a material negative impact on the global economy.

36
00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.426
You know in the 1970's there were was a spike

37
00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:53.717
in the price of oils which really hurt many countries.

38
00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:56.645
As such, the IMF actually lent money

39
00:01:56.645 --> 00:02:00.313
to countries that were hurt by the spike in oil.

40
00:02:00.313 --> 00:02:02.855
And when I worked on Wall Street and in the hedge fund

41
00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:06.106
industry we monitored the price of oil very closely,

42
00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:09.828
as changes in oil prices has a huge impact

43
00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:12.995
on most companies in the world, and not just companies

44
00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:17.007
that benefit from higher oil prices, like oil companies

45
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:21.401
such as, Petrobras in Brazil, or Exxon in America,

46
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:26.086
but oil prices actually impact construction and material

47
00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:30.376
companies significantly, like cement giant Cemex in Mexico,

48
00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:34.180
or construction equipment company Komatsu in Japan,

49
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.165
and its biggest rival Caterpillar in the United States.

50
00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:41.525
Interestingly enough, I actually ran a regression

51
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:45.263
or a correlation analysis when I worked at a big hedge fund

52
00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:49.240
and we discovered that the price of oil materially impacted

53
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.990
the share price of German software giant SAP,

54
00:02:53.852 --> 00:02:56.364
French video game company Ubisoft,

55
00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:59.935
and of course American solar company First Solar.

56
00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:03.685
And so changes in the prices of many commodities

57
00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:05.975
affects almost all companies in the world

58
00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.695
regardless of what industry they're in.

59
00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:11.959
As a result, we as personal investors

60
00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.527
must understand the macroeconomic implications

61
00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:18.284
of price changes in commodities.

62
00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:22.284
For example, if the price of gold goes up a lot,

63
00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:24.996
it can be seen as what's called a flight

64
00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:29.087
to quality investment or a fear investor indicator,

65
00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:31.497
and we're gonna talk more about commodities and how

66
00:03:31.497 --> 00:03:34.439
to invest in commodities a little bit later in the course.

67
00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.556
Okay let's go back to the IMF.

68
00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:40.855
In the 1990s as Communist countries moved towards capitalism

69
00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:43.917
the IMF had to lend an enormous amount of money

70
00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:47.152
to countries in places like Eastern Europe.

71
00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:50.775
Also in the early 2000's the IMF lent a lot of money

72
00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:54.868
to countries affected by the Latin American debt crisis,

73
00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:58.535
and of course IMF lending rose a lot in 2008

74
00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:02.338
when the entire world was literally,

75
00:04:02.338 --> 00:04:04.890
literally within 24 hours of bank machines not working.

76
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.761
Those were tough times and since you might one day

77
00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:10.595
consider investing in stocks or bonds

78
00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:14.152
from a particular country, let's take a look

79
00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:16.613
at the global economy's total revenue,

80
00:04:16.613 --> 00:04:20.780
meaning GDP, which stands for Gross Domestic Product.

81
00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:25.030
Then what we'll do is we're gonna drill down

82
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.446
and look at individual country revenue,

83
00:04:27.446 --> 00:04:29.940
meaning individual company GDP,

84
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.034
again GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product

85
00:04:33.034 --> 00:04:36.547
and measures how much money a country makes,

86
00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:39.753
not excluding expenses, and so if a company makes

87
00:04:39.753 --> 00:04:42.997
more money than it spends then it has a surplus.

88
00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:45.122
And if a country makes less money

89
00:04:45.122 --> 00:04:47.743
than it spends then it has a deficit.

90
00:04:47.743 --> 00:04:51.995
So if America, for example, has a large deficit,

91
00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:55.920
then who owns America's debt, meaning their bonds?

92
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.446
Well countries like China own a lot of it

93
00:04:59.446 --> 00:05:01.882
and so do big investment firms in the form

94
00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:06.075
of bonds which we will cover in a lot of detail shortly.

95
00:05:06.075 --> 00:05:10.384
The global economy is so interconnected that when one

96
00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:15.258
large country sneezes, it impacts anybody that has

97
00:05:15.258 --> 00:05:18.362
or wants to get a mortgage to buy their home.

98
00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:22.202
And there's a wealth of information that is awesome

99
00:05:22.202 --> 00:05:26.369
at www.imf.org, and so please bookmark this webpage

100
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:31.318
and read the contents if you are considering

101
00:05:31.318 --> 00:05:33.765
investing in a country outside of your own,

102
00:05:33.765 --> 00:05:37.252
or if you want to better understand certain regions

103
00:05:37.252 --> 00:05:41.419
in the world and how the global economy's actually doing.

104
00:05:42.434 --> 00:05:46.093
The data here at the IMF's website is unbiased

105
00:05:46.093 --> 00:05:49.520
and it really helps us understand how the world works,

106
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.999
so we can be more informed investors.

107
00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:56.166
Okay, let's talk quickly about the business cycle.

108
00:05:57.082 --> 00:06:01.149
Business is cyclical and the economic cycles can last

109
00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:05.585
for years; so why is it important for me to mention this?

110
00:06:05.585 --> 00:06:08.842
Because we have to understand where we are in, in terms

111
00:06:08.842 --> 00:06:12.665
of the economic cycle when analyzing the prospects

112
00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:15.594
of a particular company or country,

113
00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:17.816
especially if we think interest rates will rise,

114
00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:21.219
which means leaving more money in the bank,

115
00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.089
makes sense right, if interest rates go up?

116
00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.269
And this will all make much more sense to you very soon,

117
00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:28.106
you'll have this aha moment.

118
00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:32.153
So when the economy and the stock market are doing well

119
00:06:32.153 --> 00:06:35.743
we usually refer to this as a bull market.

120
00:06:35.743 --> 00:06:38.889
Conversely, when the stock market and the economy are not

121
00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.654
doing well we usually refer to this as a bear market.

122
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:47.393
And sometimes the stock market recovers ahead

123
00:06:47.393 --> 00:06:51.940
of a recovery in the economy as investors that buy stocks

124
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.091
usually anticipate what is going to happen,

125
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:58.072
which is somewhat priced into stocks.

126
00:06:58.072 --> 00:07:01.276
And the value of stocks today reflects what investors

127
00:07:01.276 --> 00:07:05.320
expect these stocks to earn in the future.

128
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.135
So how do we know if we are in a recession?

129
00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:10.892
Meaning a bad economic environment.

130
00:07:10.892 --> 00:07:13.601
We know if we're in a recession because a recession

131
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:17.768
is defined as having at least two consecutive quarters

132
00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:21.815
of negative, your real growth in GDP.

133
00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:27.469
Okay, now we know that a great personal investor

134
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.379
always does their own research and never relies

135
00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.567
on people on TV that sound confident.

136
00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:37.595
Don't let anybody bias your opinion in finance.

137
00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:39.785
Always go right to the data source

138
00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:44.221
and do your own homework, you know just like how we like

139
00:07:44.221 --> 00:07:47.804
to personally buy wholesale, as it's cheaper

140
00:07:47.804 --> 00:07:52.365
than buying retail, we also wanna go right to the source

141
00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:55.717
when we do our research on potential investments,

142
00:07:55.717 --> 00:07:59.095
instead of listening to the self-proclaimed

143
00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:02.416
and biased pundits or experts,

144
00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:05.731
whatever you call them on financial TV stations.

145
00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:08.414
People on TV are often biased and are often talking

146
00:08:08.414 --> 00:08:10.066
about certain stocks because they own

147
00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:12.706
them or they work at that company.

148
00:08:12.706 --> 00:08:16.585
And so when economic statistics are released

149
00:08:16.585 --> 00:08:18.419
and the media is interpreting it,

150
00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:20.952
I don't want you to take their word for it.

151
00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:23.292
What I want you to do is I want you to go right

152
00:08:23.292 --> 00:08:25.859
to the source of the data and read it yourself,

153
00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:29.121
as the best investors do their own research,

154
00:08:29.121 --> 00:08:31.005
or else you basically become a victim

155
00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:34.097
of what's called groupthink, and if everybody else

156
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:37.208
has the same opinion on a stock and everyone else owns it,

157
00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:40.476
then there aren't that many incremental buyers.

158
00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:44.345
So go to the economic websites, like the imf.org,

159
00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:46.453
or the government website in your country

160
00:08:46.453 --> 00:08:48.894
and drill down and understand why economic

161
00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:51.561
statistics are going up or down.

162
00:08:52.614 --> 00:08:56.781
And you'll find that once you do all of your own research,

163
00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:00.638
you'll be a better investor than anybody you know,

164
00:09:00.638 --> 00:09:04.608
and you won't panic when a stock falls that you own,

165
00:09:04.608 --> 00:09:09.002
you'll just think, okay I don't know the path but I know

166
00:09:09.002 --> 00:09:11.911
the destination and it's much higher for this stock,

167
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:13.531
and you might even buy more when

168
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.437
it goes down for ridiculous reasons.

169
00:09:15.437 --> 00:09:19.190
Okay cool, we are now done learning about the IMF.

170
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.905
Okay so the bottom line is that one of the primary purposes

171
00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:26.277
of the IMF is to make sure that the world's revenue,

172
00:09:26.277 --> 00:09:30.444
meaning GDP is growing, and you can track this at imf.org,

173
00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:33.594
and the IMF as we know spends a lot

174
00:09:33.594 --> 00:09:36.156
of time focused on global GDP growth.

175
00:09:36.156 --> 00:09:39.927
Okay moving on, the World Bank on the other hand

176
00:09:39.927 --> 00:09:43.586
is more focused on decreasing poverty in the world

177
00:09:43.586 --> 00:09:46.791
and my god, thank you Bill Gates, Bob Geldof,

178
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:50.089
and so many other incredible humanitarians,

179
00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:53.156
per this video here you can see now that global poverty

180
00:09:53.156 --> 00:09:56.373
is down materially since the 1980s.

181
00:09:56.373 --> 00:09:57.206
Isn't that incredible?

182
00:09:57.206 --> 00:10:00.651
Check this out, over 40% of the people in the world

183
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:04.131
in the early 1980s lived in extreme poverty,

184
00:10:04.131 --> 00:10:07.426
meaning they made less than $1.90 per day.

185
00:10:07.426 --> 00:10:10.676
Today that figure is close to 10%.

186
00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:15.755
So, so many financial journalists on TV are so negative,

187
00:10:15.755 --> 00:10:18.260
you know the sky is falling, the sky is falling, whatever,

188
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.972
and there are certainly a lot of things to be positive about

189
00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:24.886
and I don't recommend watching financial news programs;

190
00:10:24.886 --> 00:10:27.340
you'll be a much better investor if you

191
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.423
ignore them and do your own research.

192
00:10:31.571 --> 00:10:35.891
Okay, like the IMF, the World Bank was also founded in 1944,

193
00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:38.598
and I mention the World Bank because it is another

194
00:10:38.598 --> 00:10:42.618
unbelievable unbiased source of global economic data

195
00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:45.462
for you to consider reading as you

196
00:10:45.462 --> 00:10:48.587
consider investing internationally.

197
00:10:48.587 --> 00:10:52.754
Now if we go together to data.worldbank.org, you will see

198
00:10:54.952 --> 00:10:57.696
that we can search for GDP per capita,

199
00:10:57.696 --> 00:11:01.948
which means how much revenue does a country make per person,

200
00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:06.207
and so the average person made about $450 annually

201
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:09.061
in revenue in the early 1960s,

202
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.136
and now that number is more than $10,000.

203
00:11:12.136 --> 00:11:14.020
Again this is revenue, meaning

204
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.837
that expenses are not included.

205
00:11:16.837 --> 00:11:19.814
Now let's scroll in more, if we take a closer look

206
00:11:19.814 --> 00:11:23.314
at GDP per capita per country, you can see

207
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:27.397
that similar to the IMF website, you can visualize data

208
00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:30.692
on a country by country basis here as well.

209
00:11:30.692 --> 00:11:34.113
So now let's discuss the World Trade Organization.

210
00:11:34.113 --> 00:11:36.508
Okay, this is the third one we're looking at,

211
00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:40.675
the third global entity, the WTO's primary goals are

212
00:11:41.816 --> 00:11:45.576
to make sure that trading levels take place

213
00:11:45.576 --> 00:11:49.743
between countries and that trading disputes are settled.

214
00:11:51.485 --> 00:11:55.026
The WTO was founded in 1995, it's pretty new actually,

215
00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:57.257
and it's based in Switzerland.

216
00:11:57.257 --> 00:12:00.674
So if we go to wto.org, we see that there

217
00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:05.781
are over 160 members in the WTO, and you can click

218
00:12:05.781 --> 00:12:08.296
on any country and learn a lot about

219
00:12:08.296 --> 00:12:12.559
that country's trading characteristics, if you want to.

220
00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:16.270
So if we click on Canada, that's my country

221
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.508
of origin I represent here, we can see

222
00:12:19.508 --> 00:12:22.804
that you can also look at GDP statistics here.

223
00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:24.667
And I won't go into too much detail here

224
00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:27.808
as we already covered GDP earlier,

225
00:12:27.808 --> 00:12:31.654
but here you can learn more about the Canadian economy,

226
00:12:31.654 --> 00:12:36.215
their trading partners, their trading disputes, et cetera.

227
00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:39.750
And if you have a business trade issue or any issue

228
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.419
that you wanna resolve involving your company,

229
00:12:43.419 --> 00:12:47.052
just contact your local elected government official.

230
00:12:47.052 --> 00:12:48.593
You know it might be a congressperson,

231
00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:51.189
or a member of Parliament, but just keep

232
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:52.929
in mind that they work for you.

233
00:12:52.929 --> 00:12:55.494
They work for the public as you elected them.

234
00:12:55.494 --> 00:12:58.448
So call them if you need help with your business

235
00:12:58.448 --> 00:13:02.031
when it comes to international trading or other issues that

236
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:06.911
might help your company grow and hence hire more people.

237
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:11.724
Again, they work for you as you elected them, so call them

238
00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:13.228
and ask because you know what?

239
00:13:13.228 --> 00:13:14.704
Most people never ever do this

240
00:13:14.704 --> 00:13:17.188
and you've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
