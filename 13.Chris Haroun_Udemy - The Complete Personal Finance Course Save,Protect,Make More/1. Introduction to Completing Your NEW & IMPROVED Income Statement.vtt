1
00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:04.035
<v ->Now that we understand our current income statement,</v>

2
00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:07.448
meaning we understand money in and money out,

3
00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:09.869
and what our expenses are, we're gonna create your

4
00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:13.677
new and improved monthly income statement.

5
00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:16.323
And so this will come in handy later on,

6
00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:18.701
when we discuss budgeting, so you can realize

7
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:22.003
your financial dreams later in life.

8
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.385
And so, in this section, and in Exercise

9
00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:27.704
Number Three, we're gonna discuss well over

10
00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.454
100 ways to reduce your expenses.

11
00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:34.225
And so you can either watch the videos

12
00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:37.528
in this section, or click on the "How To Save"

13
00:00:37.528 --> 00:00:40.207
buttons in Exercise Three per this video.

14
00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.309
And so don't worry I'll make it very clear when

15
00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.605
to complete Exercise Number Three.

16
00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:48.868
But first of all, before we dive in,

17
00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:51.747
I wanted to change our perception

18
00:00:51.747 --> 00:00:54.541
about the process of saving,

19
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.251
and together, let's think about how saving

20
00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:01.106
money feels great, and it's fun, like a game.

21
00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:04.672
And these tips will actually save you, literally,

22
00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:07.661
thousands of dollars every year.

23
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:10.776
And if you invest thousands more each year,

24
00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:13.261
then you'll have, literally, millions more

25
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:15.085
much later in life because of the

26
00:01:15.085 --> 00:01:17.324
power of compound interest.

27
00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:18.637
And this will all make much more sense

28
00:01:18.637 --> 00:01:21.765
to you very soon in this course.

29
00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:24.756
This section, we're going to do together.

30
00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:26.627
And Exercise Number Three, I just want to say,

31
00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:30.252
is incredibly ambitious, and I humbly hope

32
00:01:30.252 --> 00:01:32.632
that this will be an event that you will

33
00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:36.003
remember and stick to forever, as this moment

34
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.628
that changed your financial future.

35
00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:43.064
Now there's 17 save money category lessons

36
00:01:43.064 --> 00:01:43.897
that we're gonna discuss before

37
00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:47.213
completing Exercise Number Three.

38
00:01:47.213 --> 00:01:51.409
Again, 17 save money category lessons we're gonna

39
00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.535
discuss before we complete Exercise Number Three.

40
00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:58.221
And if a certain lesson, or a certain save money concept

41
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:00.682
does not apply to you, like the section on

42
00:02:00.682 --> 00:02:04.157
saving money if you have children or pets, etc.,

43
00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.879
then just skip those sections please.

44
00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.909
Just watch what applies to you.

45
00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.491
Also, in order to organize this process

46
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.613
and make it easier for you to navigate

47
00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:16.082
each save money section, or lesson,

48
00:02:16.082 --> 00:02:18.317
at the beginning of each lesson I'm going

49
00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:20.386
to show you this screen.

50
00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:21.855
You see this here?

51
00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:24.588
And this shows you exactly where to go,

52
00:02:24.588 --> 00:02:27.064
time-wise, in that lesson, to learn about

53
00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:29.571
that saving money strategy.

54
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.939
Or you can just watch the entire lesson.

55
00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.981
Your call.
Your call here.

56
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:36.777
I think we're all at different stages in our lives.

57
00:02:36.777 --> 00:02:39.307
And the trick here is that we always

58
00:02:39.307 --> 00:02:42.049
must live below our means.

59
00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.193
And Warren Buffet, who I'll be quoting

60
00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:46.176
a couple times in this course,

61
00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:48.929
he's probably the best investor in history,

62
00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.262
but he's still really cheap.

63
00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:54.698
And so are many wealthy people.

64
00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:57.280
And that's how they became wealthy.

65
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.013
And Warren Buffet once said,

66
00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:02.346
"Don't save what is left after spending,

67
00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:08.179
instead, spend what is left after saving."

68
00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.856
Think about that one.

69
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:10.972
Well that's deep.

70
00:03:10.972 --> 00:03:11.805
(laughs)

71
00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:15.081
And so, in 2003, I actually met Bill Gates.

72
00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:18.560
And I sat right beside him at a lunch event

73
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.216
at Microsoft Headquarters.

74
00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:23.982
Actually the reason I was able to sit beside him,

75
00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:26.133
I was kind of aggressive, there was just this

76
00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:29.557
huge lunch meeting, 500 people there, whatever,

77
00:03:29.557 --> 00:03:32.072
and there was assigned seating, and I was

78
00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:35.489
nobody, and I saw a gap between Mr. Gates

79
00:03:37.354 --> 00:03:39.801
and the Fidelity Portfolio Manager,

80
00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:41.130
that was the biggest shareholder,

81
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.579
and I pulled up a chair.

82
00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.482
I figured I'd never get a chance again to do that.

83
00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:47.285
I'm glad I did though, I'm glad I did.

84
00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:49.504
I got to talk to him.

85
00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:53.312
When I walked him to his car after that,

86
00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:55.508
that big lunch event, I was asking him a

87
00:03:55.508 --> 00:03:58.062
gazillion questions, and I thought actually a

88
00:03:58.062 --> 00:04:00.608
limousine would pick him up.

89
00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:02.986
And he actually got into a very cheap,

90
00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:05.207
beat up, old, blue Lexus, which had his

91
00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:08.206
kids' car seats in the back.

92
00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.104
Then he drove himself home.

93
00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:14.096
And separately, do you know who this is, right here?

94
00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:16.179
This guy drives this car.

95
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.586
I didn't know who this guy was, but it's

96
00:04:18.586 --> 00:04:21.424
actually the billionaire founder of IKEA

97
00:04:21.424 --> 00:04:24.688
who drives this car, and is incredibly cheap.

98
00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:28.090
Again, this is how they became wealthy.

99
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.978
And we're gonna be like them on this save,

100
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.506
protect, make money journey that we're gonna

101
00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:35.269
go through together in this course.

102
00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:36.464
And if you can't save money, I have to stress

103
00:04:36.464 --> 00:04:38.213
this again, if you can't save money yet today,

104
00:04:38.213 --> 00:04:39.833
don't worry about it.

105
00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:41.850
I just want you to understand these concepts

106
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.517
so that when you get a raise later,

107
00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:46.778
you will save the additional amount you make,

108
00:04:46.778 --> 00:04:48.741
instead of spending it.

109
00:04:48.741 --> 00:04:50.361
And then, later in the course,

110
00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:54.276
we're gonna discuss how, when you get a raise,

111
00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:57.498
we're gonna set up auto withdrawals from your

112
00:04:57.498 --> 00:04:59.173
paychecks, so you don't spend it,

113
00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:00.783
because you can't see it.

114
00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:03.239
Out of sight, out of mind.

115
00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:05.242
And we're gonna make auto withdrawals

116
00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:07.408
to your savings account at your bank

117
00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:10.320
slightly more than you think so you're

118
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.876
forced to save.

119
00:05:11.876 --> 00:05:13.730
This will make more sense soon.

120
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.665
We're gonna discuss more about that later,

121
00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:18.586
but just please remember that, as you go

122
00:05:18.586 --> 00:05:22.021
through the next 17 save money lectures,

123
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.516
how much very small amounts can be worth

124
00:05:24.516 --> 00:05:27.216
in the future, like we discussed in

125
00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:28.837
Exercise Number One.

126
00:05:28.837 --> 00:05:30.949
We're all in this together, in this partnership,

127
00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.698
so please leave a comment also in the Q&amp;A

128
00:05:33.698 --> 00:05:37.530
section in this course if you have other ways

129
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.863
to save money that aren't discussed here

130
00:05:39.863 --> 00:05:41.760
so we can all learn from each other.

131
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.171
Thank you.

132
00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:45.647
And so in the next lecture, we're gonna start

133
00:05:45.647 --> 00:05:49.241
by discussing saving money on taxes.

134
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:51.897
And then the rest of the sections, or lectures,

135
00:05:51.897 --> 00:05:53.655
will be in alphabetical order,

136
00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:56.400
the 16 save money lectures after that.

137
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.557
And so after you watch the next 17 lectures,

138
00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:01.029
or at least the ones that apply to you,

139
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.645
please take notes on what you learned,

140
00:06:04.645 --> 00:06:07.141
that you can apply in order to save

141
00:06:07.141 --> 00:06:09.519
more money because we will use this in

142
00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:12.165
Exercise Number Three later in the course.

143
00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:15.002
And so please enjoy saving money in this section.

144
00:06:15.002 --> 00:06:15.835
Thank you.
