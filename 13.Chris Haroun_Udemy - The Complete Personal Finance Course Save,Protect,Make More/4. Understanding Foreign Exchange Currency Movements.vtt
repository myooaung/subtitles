00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:02.903
<v ->When stable economies have high interest rates,</v>

2
00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:05.785
the value of their currencies goes up

3
00:00:05.785 --> 00:00:07.796
relative to other currencies.

4
00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:10.391
And we really need to understand this phenomena

5
00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:12.983
when we analyze companies that are doing business

6
00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:14.940
in other countries.

7
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
And generally speaking, the US dollar strengthens

8
00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.085
when the US government raises interest rates

9
00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:25.270
or when other countries see the United States

10
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.434
as a relative flight-to-quality in terms of,

11
00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:31.101
in times of extreme uncertainty,

12
00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:34.328
and a great website for understanding

13
00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:36.361
not just currency rates,

14
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:39.361
but also inflation levels is xe.com.

15
00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:46.797
If we click on CAD for Canadian dollars, we can see

16
00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:50.736
that the inflation rate in Canada is 1.6%,

17
00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:54.903
which means prices rise by about 1.6% every year in Canada,

18
00:00:56.745 --> 00:01:00.511
and just above that figure, just above that figure,

19
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.142
we can see the exchange for Canadian dollars

20
00:01:03.142 --> 00:01:05.309
in other major currencies.

21
00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:08.741
We see here that one Canadian dollar

22
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:11.772
buys you about 73 US cents,

23
00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:16.146
and one US dollar buys $1.37 in Canadian dollars.

24
00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:17.993
And we can also see that the nickname

25
00:01:17.993 --> 00:01:20.646
for the Canadian dollar is the loonie,

26
00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:24.896
as a loonie is on the Canadian one-dollar coin.

27
00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.839
We also see here that the interest rate in Canada,

28
00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:31.631
which is called the Central Bank Rate is 0.5%

29
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:34.583
as of this recording, and we can link

30
00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:38.449
to the Bank of Canada from this website shown here

31
00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:40.408
which is the source of the interest rates

32
00:01:40.408 --> 00:01:42.761
and the inflation statistics.

33
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:44.682
Okay, let's go back to xe.com now.

34
00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:46.265
Let's go back to that website.

35
00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:50.432
And we can see charts of the historical moves of currencies.

36
00:01:51.503 --> 00:01:53.898
And every company that we're investing in

37
00:01:53.898 --> 00:01:55.942
does a lot of business in other countries.

38
00:01:55.942 --> 00:01:57.387
We gotta know.

39
00:01:57.387 --> 00:02:00.130
We gotta know their currency exchange rate,

40
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.849
and if we're investing in US dollars,

41
00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:06.390
or US dollar done in stocks or other countries

42
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.007
on your investment portfolio management system,

43
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:13.882
we have know what our exchange rate is if applicable.

44
00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:17.806
Now we know that we can go to our Settings button here

45
00:02:17.806 --> 00:02:22.009
in order to change the foreign currency exchange rate.

46
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.325
And economies that are more dependent than others

47
00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.900
on selling commodities or other natural resources

48
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.165
like oil include Canada, Australia, and Brazil,

49
00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:33.638
and there's others too.

50
00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:37.805
As such, most of the time, when oil prices are very high,

51
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:43.614
so too are the valuations of the three respective currencies

52
00:02:43.614 --> 00:02:46.346
I just mentioned relative to other currencies.

53
00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:47.179
Why?

54
00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:51.082
This example here explains why.

55
00:02:51.082 --> 00:02:56.053
If the price of most major commodities are very, very high,

56
00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:58.937
then if China wants to buy iron ore from Australia

57
00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:01.104
for example to make steel,

58
00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:05.790
then China would have to buy more Australian dollars

59
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.731
in order to buy Australian iron ore in Australia

60
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.711
which drives the price of the Australian dollar up a lot.

61
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:17.271
And the converse is true of course

62
00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:19.642
if commodity prices are dropping,

63
00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:23.322
you know, as China would need to exchange fewer

64
00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:26.674
or less money, I should say, for fewer Australian dollars

65
00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:29.848
in order to buy Australian commodities, okay?

66
00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:32.417
And I also like to use this website

67
00:03:32.417 --> 00:03:35.999
for looking at historical exchange rate charts, okay.

68
00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:37.832
It's forexfactory.com.

69
00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:42.959
And this website is incredibly detailed.

70
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.466
If we look at the historical chart of the Canadian dollar

71
00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:49.877
relative to the US dollar, we see that the Canadian dollar

72
00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:53.742
as at par with the US dollar, meaning it was valued at

73
00:03:53.742 --> 00:03:58.618
$1 relative to each dollar in 2008, partially because

74
00:03:58.618 --> 00:04:01.326
the price of oil in 2008 was over $100 per barrel

75
00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:03.156
at one point.

76
00:04:03.156 --> 00:04:07.621
Okay, so so far, we have only discussed currencies

77
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:10.538
that are floating currencies, right,

78
00:04:10.538 --> 00:04:13.818
meaning ones that increase or decrease

79
00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:16.773
relative to other currencies in the free market,

80
00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:18.277
okay, the open market, right,

81
00:04:18.277 --> 00:04:21.221
and in governments though that do a lot of business

82
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.888
with one or a few larger countries often fix

83
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.513
their currencies, also called peg.

84
00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:32.057
They peg their currency to another one

85
00:04:32.057 --> 00:04:36.109
so that the value of their currency never changes

86
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.871
relative to the larger country's currency.

87
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.477
That way, these countries maintain their fixed

88
00:04:43.477 --> 00:04:47.067
or pegged, same thing, pegged currency, right, through,

89
00:04:47.067 --> 00:04:48.249
and the way they do it is they do it

90
00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.171
through massive open-market purchases

91
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:52.361
or sales of their own currency

92
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:56.528
through that country's reserves of foreign currency, okay?

93
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:03.328
And when demand is too high for their currencies,

94
00:05:03.328 --> 00:05:05.431
these governments buy bonds

95
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:08.572
so as to increase the amount of supply of their own currency

96
00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:11.901
in the markets, right, and also to maintain

97
00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:14.434
their fixed currency value.

98
00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:17.772
Recall the higher the supply of currency,

99
00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:21.152
the lower the interest rate is for that currency,

100
00:05:21.152 --> 00:05:22.858
and this is artificial.

101
00:05:22.858 --> 00:05:26.340
It can may be maintained for many, many years

102
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.616
as long as the underlying currency reserves are plentiful,

103
00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:34.317
okay, and the second that a country that has a

104
00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:38.370
fixed reserve rate, if they run out of foreign currency

105
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.715
to be able to buy or artificially change

106
00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.557
their own currency value, if they run out of that money,

107
00:05:43.557 --> 00:05:46.776
then what's gonna happen is they can't fix that rate anymore

108
00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:49.678
and it automatically floats and it's disastrous,

109
00:05:49.678 --> 00:05:51.250
and I'm not gonna go there.

110
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.356
But if you have questions, ask me offline.

111
00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:54.715
George Torres made a lot of money

112
00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:57.094
breaking the British pound into Thai baht.

113
00:05:57.094 --> 00:05:58.630
Off topic, though.

114
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.883
Okay, the following countries here have their currencies

115
00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:05.582
pegged to the US dollar or other relatively stable

116
00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:10.184
and stronger economies or stronger economies I should say,

117
00:06:10.184 --> 00:06:12.427
as these countries might do a lot of business

118
00:06:12.427 --> 00:06:16.257
with the United States or these other countries,

119
00:06:16.257 --> 00:06:19.235
and hence, rather than dealing with uncertainty,

120
00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:23.152
with FX or foreign exchange rate price changes,

121
00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:29.533
their currencies remain at the same level at all times

122
00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:34.071
relative to the United States dollar or other currencies.

123
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:37.740
We know that high inflation leads to higher interest rates

124
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.646
and I think it's important to discuss

125
00:06:39.646 --> 00:06:42.301
great economic entities or events

126
00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:45.554
that are somewhat deflationary, okay?

127
00:06:45.554 --> 00:06:50.079
So there is this epic speech that Ronald Reagan,

128
00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:51.849
who's my favorite president ever,

129
00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.991
he gave this speech at the Berlin wall in 1989,

130
00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:57.649
and I'll show you a clip of it right here

131
00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:59.081
and then I'll discuss why this important.

132
00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:02.010 line:15% 
(audience applauds)

133
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.093 line:15% 
<v ->Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.</v>

134
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:08.743 line:15% 
(audience cheers)

135
00:07:08.743 --> 00:07:12.143
<v ->Interestingly enough, when Reagan made that speech,</v>

136
00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:13.733
his speechwriter was so mad with him

137
00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:16.541
because he went off-script and said, "Tear down this wall"

138
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:18.749
bur when the wall fell, the Berlin Wall of course,

139
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:22.149
what happened was you had all of this incredibly educated

140
00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:25.378
Eastern-European labor moving west,

141
00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:28.146
and one of the biggest inputs into prices

142
00:07:28.146 --> 00:07:30.850
of anything you buy is the price of labor.

143
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.465
And so you had much lower-priced smart labor moving west,

144
00:07:35.465 --> 00:07:39.572
and that kept interest rates very low in the late '80s

145
00:07:39.572 --> 00:07:42.129
and in the '90s, right, for years.

146
00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.034
It was because of that, because of that,

147
00:07:44.034 --> 00:07:45.332
which is pretty cool.

148
00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:49.345
And I guess a more recent event that's similar to this

149
00:07:49.345 --> 00:07:53.846
is Amazon Web Services, and if you're interested in this,

150
00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:56.838
you can read an article I wrote here in Venture Beat on this

151
00:07:56.838 --> 00:08:00.631
but I believe that Amazon Web Services

152
00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:03.719
is this generation's Berlin Wall teardown event.

153
00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:05.526
A bit off-topic, but anyway, here's the link here

154
00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:06.359
if you want to read up on this

155
00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:07.896
and if you have questions, as always, please let me know.

156
00:08:07.896 --> 00:08:08.729
Thanks.
