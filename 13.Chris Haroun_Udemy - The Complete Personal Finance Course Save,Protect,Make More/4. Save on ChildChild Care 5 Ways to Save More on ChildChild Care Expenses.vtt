00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.574
<v Chris>Child or childcare tip number one: gifts tip.</v>

2
00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:16.998
Only buy gifts for your kids twice per year.

3
00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:18.958
The holidays and their birthdays.

4
00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.030
And you're actually helping them by doing this, too,

5
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.649
as it doesn't cost much to spoil kids, as we know.

6
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.816
And if you do, or if we do - spoil them, that is

7
00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:33.490
then we have small kids, we have small problems

8
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.458
but when we have big kids, we have big problems.

9
00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:40.134
Childcare tip number two: lights off tip.

10
00:00:40.134 --> 00:00:43.586
I can hear my dad saying "Chris, turn the light off!"

11
00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:46.169
So make sure your kids turn their lights out

12
00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:48.329
and buy LED lights if you can as well.

13
00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.969
And I have to mention this, but we almost

14
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.793
actually had a fire in the house recently.

15
00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:58.634
So if you get a chance...where did I put it?

16
00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:00.967
I've got these cool devices here.

17
00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:02.467
I want to show ya.

18
00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:05.680
I bought these things.

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.840
And I put them in every single,

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.264
every room in the house basically.

21
00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:11.527
They're not that expensive.

22
00:01:11.527 --> 00:01:12.559
It's called Fire Gone.

23
00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:14.784
And they're actually cheaper than this one

24
00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:16.837
that I keep in my recording studio

25
00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:19.517
because I have lights on and stuff.

26
00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:21.996
So, these ones here, you can buy, like,

27
00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:23.484
ten of them at the same time or whatever.

28
00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.350
It's called Fire Gone, and the kids know how

29
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.101
to use this a lot easier because the bigger ones

30
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:30.905
these ones here - the kids don't really...

31
00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:32.745
They might panic and like "How do I use this?"

32
00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:35.613
But this they know what a trigger is, so anyway...

33
00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:39.165
A little off-topic there, but I care.

34
00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.832
I care, okay, great.

35
00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.336
Alright, so childcare tip number

36
00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.205
three: shopping with your kids.

37
00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:49.118
Try not to bring your kids shopping with you.

38
00:01:49.118 --> 00:01:51.165
Or if you do, teach them about why

39
00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:54.277
certain products cost more than others.

40
00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:56.777
Like generic mouthwash versus

41
00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:00.525
mouthwash made by Crest or Scope.

42
00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:03.252
And tell your kids to look at the ingredients as well.

43
00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:05.108
Kind of like I have in this video here

44
00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:08.637
at a drugstore called Walgreens here in the US.

45
00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:10.198
I tell them to look at the ingredients

46
00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:13.904
and always buy the cheaper products.

47
00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.680
Okay, childcare tip number four:

48
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.034
teach your kids about money tip.

49
00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:20.632
And teach them about how to have

50
00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:22.880
more than one income source.

51
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.191
Okay, so we got to teach our kids when it comes to money

52
00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:30.391
because when one teaches, two learn.

53
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:33.118
I find, like, even when I'm teaching you here, humbly,

54
00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:35.511
I feel like I'm reminding myself of stuff

55
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:38.235
that I used to do a lot but I'm not doing

56
00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:41.046
as much as I should from a saving perspective.

57
00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:43.807
Okay, so when one teaches, two learn, so teach your kids.

58
00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:46.323
And if we do this enough, then you become

59
00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:49.859
a catalyst for you saving more and

60
00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.598
you make them more independent as well.

61
00:02:52.598 --> 00:02:54.126
And if you do this enough, then

62
00:02:54.126 --> 00:02:56.502
before you purchase something your kids will say to you

63
00:02:56.502 --> 00:03:00.099
"Hey, Dad" or "Hey, Mom...wait. Isn't this one cheaper?"

64
00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.115
Or "Did you price shop online first, Dad?"

65
00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:05.004
Or "Dad, do we really need that tip?"

66
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:07.995
Or "Dad, let's do the gardening together!"

67
00:03:07.995 --> 00:03:09.139
which never happens.

68
00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.860
"Let's do the gardening together!"

69
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.572
It's a family event instead of hiring someone.

70
00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:15.299
It's great exercise, too.

71
00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.703
I'm just amazed that we didn't learn about

72
00:03:17.703 --> 00:03:20.731
personal money management like this in school.

73
00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:22.999
I wish I did when I was younger.

74
00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.331
And make your kids pay for and earn stuff as well.

75
00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.748
And, you know, for example, my three sons

76
00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:34.956
they wanted iPhones, and I wasn't going

77
00:03:35.796 --> 00:03:38.233
to be one of those parents that buy an iPhone for my kids.

78
00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:39.377
I want them to feel good about

79
00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:43.049
earning every penny to buy that iPhone.

80
00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.830
So what I did, actually, is I had them start a business.

81
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.741
I helped them out as well.

82
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:54.197
And what you can do is go to Alibaba's website

83
00:03:54.197 --> 00:03:57.837
called Aliexpress [Dot] [Com], which is owned by Alibaba

84
00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:59.333
and search for stuff that you wanna

85
00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.741
import from China and then sell.

86
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.396
And it's dirt cheap, right?

87
00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:06.550
And the shipping is almost next to nothing.

88
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.365
And I think it might be subsidized

89
00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:09.912
by the Chinese government, the shipping,

90
00:04:09.912 --> 00:04:11.540
which is why it's so cheap, but it takes

91
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.452
about thirty days for the stuff to arrive.

92
00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:15.702
Let me give you an example.

93
00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:17.489
So...

94
00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:26.101
My kids and I, we imported several hundred of these things.

95
00:04:27.692 --> 00:04:30.359
And these are just iPhone cases.

96
00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:35.583
And what we would do is we would

97
00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:39.198
sell these for ten bucks over eBay.

98
00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:41.118
And what would happen is, whenever

99
00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:42.650
they sold one it was so cool.

100
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.710
They got to print out the shipping.

101
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.406
And then the profit after all expenses

102
00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:49.790
for the kids was five bucks, right?

103
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.246
So we had five dollar profit margin on this?

104
00:04:52.246 --> 00:04:54.534
What they would do is whenever we sold one...

105
00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:55.830
They would go to eBay, they would

106
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.461
print out the shipping label, stick the shipping label

107
00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:02.016
on a little package we had, bubble-wrap package,

108
00:05:02.016 --> 00:05:03.360
walk up to our driveway, put it in

109
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.212
the mailbox, turn the flag up, done.

110
00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:08.100
And it was really cool, it was really cool.

111
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.748
And you know, these are...I think they're leather.

112
00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:14.319
They smell and look like leather, at least.

113
00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.152
It's amazing.

114
00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:18.380
The markup is just off the charts on these things.

115
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.036
So anyway, it was a lot of fun to do.

116
00:05:21.036 --> 00:05:22.549
And what we did was this...

117
00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:26.716
After the kids sold an iPhone, what they would do is

118
00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:30.254
they would go onto the fridge and there was

119
00:05:30.254 --> 00:05:33.095
one page around the fridge for each of the kids.

120
00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:35.503
My two older ones have iPhones, the youngest one doesn't.

121
00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:39.902
But there's a page on the fridge for each kid.

122
00:05:39.902 --> 00:05:42.694
And there was two hundred squares.

123
00:05:42.694 --> 00:05:45.012
And what they would do is after they sold one,

124
00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:47.086
they would go on the fridge, and they would

125
00:05:47.086 --> 00:05:48.750
put an "x" in one of the squares until

126
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.102
they got enough to buy an iPhone.

127
00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:53.166
So anyway, it's pretty cool.

128
00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:55.038
It was a lot of fun as well.

129
00:05:55.038 --> 00:05:57.036
And that profit margin was five bucks

130
00:05:57.036 --> 00:06:00.110
for each case for the kids, they sold.

131
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.672
And then what you can do is...

132
00:06:02.672 --> 00:06:06.833
Actually, I'll attach that spreadsheet I made for the kids

133
00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:11.000
here and if you want you can try doing that as well.

134
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:15.356
And it made them feel independent from a young age.

135
00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:18.333
Confidence about earning something, right?

136
00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:21.060
It feels real good for them to earn something.

137
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.436
And so, just try doing this stuff with your kids.

138
00:06:24.436 --> 00:06:25.861
Or do it on your own so you don't have

139
00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:28.452
to rely on your idiot boss for money.

140
00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:30.812
Just kidding about calling your boss an idiot.

141
00:06:30.812 --> 00:06:31.692
Sort of.

142
00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:33.294
Right, so...

143
00:06:33.294 --> 00:06:37.535
So, search for "arbitrage opportunities" online

144
00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:40.519
meaning buying low and selling high.

145
00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.831
Okay, and my kids actually...

146
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:45.581
Let me show you one more example.

147
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.567
What we did, actually, is we realized

148
00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:51.996
we arb'd these as well; it was really fun.

149
00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:54.587
We went to Starbucks, and Starbucks

150
00:06:54.587 --> 00:06:58.324
used to sell these things for, at least in America here,

151
00:06:58.324 --> 00:07:01.060
for two bucks each, these plastic cups, right?

152
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.827
And we'd run these through the dishwasher a bunch of times.

153
00:07:02.827 --> 00:07:05.301
But they're two bucks each.

154
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:07.708
No, they were one buck each, now they're two bucks each.

155
00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:09.419
But when they were one dollar each,

156
00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:12.291
we saw that on eBay you can sell them for two dollars each.

157
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:13.500
We'd buy them in bulk.

158
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.795
And we cleared out every store we could find

159
00:07:15.795 --> 00:07:18.699
all over here in California and in Florida.

160
00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:20.755
We went to visit my parents as well, right?

161
00:07:20.755 --> 00:07:22.691
We raided them all, we bought a ton of them.

162
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:24.041
We sold a ton online.

163
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:24.955
Good for the environment as well.

164
00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:27.811
And we got a hundred percent profit margin which is amazing.

165
00:07:27.811 --> 00:07:30.451
Or a little bit less after all shipping expenses.

166
00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:32.307
And it was great, and then Starbucks raised the price

167
00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:35.403
from one buck to two buck, to two bucks, right?

168
00:07:35.403 --> 00:07:36.605
Starbucks, yeah.

169
00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:38.939
So, anyway, another idea.

170
00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:42.171
But just go to Aliexpress [Dot] [Com]

171
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:46.773
and just look around for cool stuff you think you can sell.

172
00:07:46.773 --> 00:07:49.205
I've imported a couple items, and tried to sell,

173
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:51.711
and failed miserably but I keep trying, right?

174
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:53.307
And you'll find something as well

175
00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:57.189
where there's great demand for it where you live as well.

176
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:58.934
And it's good to get the kids involved

177
00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:01.147
as well in this sort of thing, because, again:

178
00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.370
when you have small kids, you have small problems;

179
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.666
when you have big kids, you have big problems

180
00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:07.393
unless so raised them right, so I'm doing my best.

181
00:08:07.393 --> 00:08:11.479
Okay, alright, sorry for rambling on that last one.

182
00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:14.513
So child or childcare tip number five:

183
00:08:14.513 --> 00:08:16.305
turn the water off tip.

184
00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:19.223
I can hear my mom saying, "Chris, turn the water off!"

185
00:08:19.223 --> 00:08:21.639
Have your kids set a timer, if you want,

186
00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:23.745
on their iPhone or Alexa device or

187
00:08:23.745 --> 00:08:26.639
whatever it might be when they take a shower

188
00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.127
as water waste really becomes expensive.

189
00:08:29.127 --> 00:08:33.307
And the same thing when they brush their teeth as well.

190
00:08:33.307 --> 00:08:35.270
Have them turn the water off when they're brushing.

191
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.783
All this stuff adds up.
