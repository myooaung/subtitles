00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.415
<v ->If you feel very comfortable with how interest rates work</v>

2
00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:09.658
and how bonds work, then please skip the next couple

3
00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:13.598
of lessons and go right to exercise number 20.

4
00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:17.666
Now it's very important to discuss how interest rates work

5
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.272
because if interest rates rise, then we should keep

6
00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:24.276
more money in the bank, and if we think that interest rates

7
00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:27.152
will rise a lot in the near future,

8
00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:31.287
then we need to lock in a long-term mortgage loan

9
00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:34.477
so we can lock in those low interest rates today.

10
00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:38.021
We will discuss mortgages and housing in the next section

11
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:40.683
after we're done with bonds here.

12
00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:43.725
But we can't discuss mortgage rates or interest rates

13
00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:46.643
without first understanding how interest rates work,

14
00:00:46.643 --> 00:00:49.496
what makes interest rates go up and down,

15
00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:53.420
and why this is crucial for you and I to understand.

16
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.749
It's actually fascinating.

17
00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.670
If you understand how interest rates work,

18
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.838
then you will be a much better investor in bonds,

19
00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:01.942
and you'll be a better investor in real estate,

20
00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:04.831
and you'll be a better investor in your home,

21
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.302
meaning your current or future mortgage loan

22
00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:10.147
to finance the purchase of your home.

23
00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:12.206
And it's crucial to please understand

24
00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:15.811
how interest rates work because when rates go up a lot,

25
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.254
people don't buy as many stocks.

26
00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:19.403
Why?

27
00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:22.969
Because the interest rate you get for keeping your money

28
00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.104
in the bank is higher, and if I can make 12% interest

29
00:01:27.104 --> 00:01:30.502
for example by leaving my money in the bank,

30
00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:33.207
then why would I buy stocks or as many stocks

31
00:01:33.207 --> 00:01:36.500
where the historical stock market return average

32
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.000
is about 10%?

33
00:01:38.844 --> 00:01:41.114
Now over the past couple of years,

34
00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:44.931
rates have been artificially and historically very low

35
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:48.694
and I promise you that your kids and your kids' kids

36
00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:52.526
will ask you what it was like when rates were low

37
00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:54.579
and what it was like living through

38
00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.941
the 2008 Great Recession, which was awful.

39
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:01.408
You know, rates will be higher in the future

40
00:02:01.408 --> 00:02:04.725
as you just can't have rates as low as they are today

41
00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:05.772
in the long run.

42
00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:08.975
And regardless of what investments we decide

43
00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:13.720
to put our money into, if we get the macro environment wrong

44
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.095
then our micro or stock market or real estate

45
00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.713
or investment strategies can be meaningless.

46
00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:21.203
We really have to understand how the world works

47
00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:23.147
from a high-level perspective.

48
00:02:23.147 --> 00:02:24.984
Okay, so why we are gonna learn about

49
00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:27.624
global macroeconomics right now?

50
00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:30.933
Because globalization really ties us together

51
00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:35.259
and the resulting investment trends can last decades.

52
00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.356
So we really need to understand how high-level overview,

53
00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:41.314
a high-level overview of how the world works

54
00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:44.495
from an economic and finance perspective,

55
00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:47.203
and it's absolutely fascinating.

56
00:02:47.203 --> 00:02:49.935
Okay, so when I worked at Goldman Sachs

57
00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:51.927
and at various investment management firms,

58
00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:55.262
including hedge funds, what would happen is

59
00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:58.454
during our morning meetings before the stock market opened,

60
00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:01.886
our investment analysts or our portfolio managers

61
00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:04.716
would often start the meetings discussing

62
00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:08.346
macro interest rates impacting events

63
00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:11.699
that might impact stocks or bonds.

64
00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.699
And quite often, stocks and bonds move because of

65
00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.032
bigger macro-related events.

66
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.519
Separately, when we analyze companies,

67
00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.961
we look at how much money they make, which is called revenue

68
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.313
and then we deduct expenses in order to calculate

69
00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:31.583
their profit, which is also referred to as earnings.

70
00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:34.680
And when we analyze countries, we look at it the same way

71
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.250
except revenue for a country is often referred to

72
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.083
as gross domestic product, or GDP.

73
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:44.263
And in the next couple of lessons,

74
00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:47.523
I'm gonna explain how the world of finance works

75
00:03:47.523 --> 00:03:49.650
when it comes to interest rates and currency rates

76
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.817
and even commodities, which impacts all of our portfolios.

77
00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.483
And so by the end of this section,

78
00:03:56.483 --> 00:03:58.609
you will really understand interest rates

79
00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.388
and government strategies to change interest rates

80
00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:04.177
which is important as this can all have an impact

81
00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:07.095
on the interest rates in our banks

82
00:04:07.095 --> 00:04:09.262
and of our mortgages, etc.

83
00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:14.449
Then at the end of this section, we will do exercises

84
00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.440
where we're gonna learn about how to add bond

85
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.387
and commodity investments to your portfolio dashboard,

86
00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:25.447
your portfolio management system in a very similar way

87
00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:27.989
to how we added stocks to our portfolio

88
00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:29.187
in exercise number 18.

89
00:04:29.187 --> 00:04:30.062
I think you'll enjoy this.

90
00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:30.895
Thank you.
