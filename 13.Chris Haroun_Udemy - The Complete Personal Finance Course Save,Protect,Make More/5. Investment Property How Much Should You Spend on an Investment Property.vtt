00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.130
<v ->When considering how much money to spend</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.624
on investment properties, please look at the purchase price

3
00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:08.874
divided by the annual rent.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.760
If that is under 10 times, and if you're sure

5
00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:18.772
you can rent it, then this is usually a good investment

6
00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:21.248
all things considered.

7
00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:24.215
And I'm being somewhat conservative here as always,

8
00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:27.235
as I'm not even factoring in the appreciation

9
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.652
on the property, god willing.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.327
Also make you understand the property taxes

11
00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:37.466
and if applicable, the condo taxes and that sort of thing

12
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:40.564
and a lot of apartment condos don't allow you to

13
00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:44.657
rent them out, and a lot of these places are called co-ops.

14
00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:46.100
They won't let you rent them out

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.525
and sometimes if you sell an apartment

16
00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:51.802
that has lots of rules, meaning it's part of a co-op,

17
00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:55.653
there's a flip tax, meaning you have to pay the building

18
00:00:55.653 --> 00:00:57.125
another tax on top of it.

19
00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:57.963
It's ridiculous.

20
00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:00.879
That's why you get lawyers involved to read those contracts.

21
00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.148
Of course, if you pursue this option,

22
00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.648
meaning buying a property and renting it,

23
00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.444
make sure that the monthly rental fee that you charge

24
00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:13.187
and all other taxes and all other expenses cover all

25
00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:16.586
or a very large part of the potential mortgage payments

26
00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:19.139
that you're making on this rental property.

27
00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:22.806
Also make sure you account for vacancy risk,

28
00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:26.401
as well as repairs and upgrades,

29
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:29.152
many of which are tax-deductible.

30
00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:31.000
Remember I told you to think of each property

31
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.756
as its own separate company,

32
00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:36.654
and it has its own income statement too.

33
00:01:36.654 --> 00:01:40.901
And you can depreciate almost everything except for land

34
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.143
when it comes to real estate in many countries,

35
00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:46.509
most countries actually, and this actually lowers your taxes

36
00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.812
and in some countries, like the United States,

37
00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:51.383
interest is tax-deductible.

38
00:01:51.383 --> 00:01:52.522
Let's move on now.

39
00:01:52.522 --> 00:01:55.423
Please be careful not to take on too much leverage,

40
00:01:55.423 --> 00:01:56.999
meaning too much debt.

41
00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:00.258
And don't buy real estate when everyone else is.

42
00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:04.073
Condo flipping, meaning buying and selling quickly condos,

43
00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:06.764
can be deadly if you overextend yourself

44
00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:08.872
like so many people did last decade,

45
00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:10.958
especially in places like Las Vegas.

46
00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:11.791
It was deadly.

47
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:12.755
A lot of people went bankrupt.

48
00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:13.945
It was sad.

49
00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:18.318
In addition to looking at the purchase price

50
00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:20.798
divided by the annual rent and making sure

51
00:02:20.798 --> 00:02:24.603
it's under 10 times, please also consider

52
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:27.476
this other formula I'm gonna give you here.

53
00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:31.200
Take the annual rent divided by two

54
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.782
and then divide it by the purchase price.

55
00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:35.237
This will give you the rental year.

56
00:02:35.237 --> 00:02:36.070
I'm gonna say it again.

57
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.401
Actually, I'll put it up here too.

58
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:40.940
Take the annual rent divided by two,

59
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.115
and then divide it again by the purchase price,

60
00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:46.752
and this will give you the rental yield.

61
00:02:46.752 --> 00:02:51.246
Try to make sure that the rental yield is at least 4%,

62
00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:55.769
kind of like a healthy dividend yield for a stock.

63
00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.475
And again, I'm trying to be conservative here

64
00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:01.879
with the aforementioned calculation, and of course,

65
00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.427
this yield does not account for the potential increase

66
00:03:05.427 --> 00:03:07.420
in the value of the investment property

67
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.124
and the opposite as well.
