WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.119
<v ->We know that we wanna cancel and</v>

2
00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:03.989
renew our credit cards every one or two years

3
00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:06.331
so we can stop small charges that

4
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.859
we didn't make from recurring.

5
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.689
Okay and just watch out for all fees

6
00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.019
and all statements and call the

7
00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.177
credit card company and contest, right?

8
00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:16.498
Argue with them if you didn't make

9
00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:18.797
a payment or if they overcharged you.

10
00:00:18.797 --> 00:00:22.164
And if you see an annual charge

11
00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:24.429
from your credit card company you did not realize

12
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.638
that you were gonna have to be paying

13
00:00:25.638 --> 00:00:27.610
that annual charge call and complain, okay?

14
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.610
There's so many consumer advocacy groups

15
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.557
out there that will protect you, right?

16
00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:33.526
And just complain.

17
00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:34.360
Like people get ahead in the world

18
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.074
are the ones that are complaining unfortunately.

19
00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:38.002
Ask and you'll receive.
It is what it is.

20
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:39.036
And I promise you every year

21
00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:40.814
you're gonna find a couple of charges

22
00:00:40.814 --> 00:00:43.549
that are wrong on your credit card.

23
00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:45.791
And we talked about making sure you have

24
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:47.388
an RFID blocker but you know what?

25
00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:50.764
People are becoming so lazy when it comes

26
00:00:50.764 --> 00:00:53.718
to checking your ID everywhere you go except for

27
00:00:53.718 --> 00:00:56.260
you know at the airport for obvious reasons.

28
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.252
The other day, um...

29
00:00:58.252 --> 00:00:59.085
(laughs)

30
00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:01.415
The other day my eldest son Andrew and I

31
00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:05.582
went to the doctor and the receptionist asked for my ID

32
00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.329
and I wanna make my son Andrew laugh, poor guy.

33
00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:10.655
He's fine. He's fine.

34
00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:12.830
And so what I did was I gave...

35
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.913
(laughs)

36
00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:17.260
If you wanna give me a one star rating

37
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.446
after I show you this I completely

38
00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:20.500
understand and I agree with you.

39
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.250
So I gave the doctor,

40
00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:28.116
the receptionist at the doctor's office this ID instead.

41
00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:30.906
Some of you are gonna laugh at this.

42
00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:32.976
Some are you gonna be like WTF.

43
00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.618
Why the face?

44
00:01:34.618 --> 00:01:37.701
But this is the ID for McLovin, okay?

45
00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:40.252
And he's from Hawaii.

46
00:01:40.252 --> 00:01:42.780
He has one name and...

47
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.677
If you haven't seen the movie Superbad

48
00:01:44.677 --> 00:01:46.748
please watch it because you'll get this reference.

49
00:01:46.748 --> 00:01:49.248
It's kinda funny; his fake ID.

50
00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:54.374
Okay so I gave the receptionist this ID

51
00:01:54.374 --> 00:01:57.059
instead of mine and it said McLovin.

52
00:01:57.059 --> 00:02:01.383
And the receptionist actually looked at it and said okay.

53
00:02:01.383 --> 00:02:03.291
She didn't even read it, right?

54
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.648
I then used it again a few times later that day

55
00:02:05.648 --> 00:02:07.299
when I had to pay for stuff with Andrew

56
00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.097
and we both had a good laugh about it, okay?

57
00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:11.930
And, uh...

58
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.303
(laughs)

59
00:02:13.303 --> 00:02:15.666
One guy at the store asked for my ID at another store

60
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.604
and he actually laughed, too, when I gave it to him,

61
00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.129
'cause he anyway, he saw it's not my real ID.

62
00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.430
Oh and he didn't even ask me for

63
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.617
my real ID after he laughed at it, right?

64
00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:25.347
So it's like a formality.

65
00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:27.474
Anyway it is what it is.

66
00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:28.557
Hi I'm seven.

67
00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:31.426
We had a good laugh.

68
00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:33.954
My kids actually think I'm like that guy Phil

69
00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:36.604
from that TV show Modern Family.

70
00:02:36.604 --> 00:02:38.554
I don't think that's a compliment. Okay.

71
00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:41.137
So if anybody has any questions

72
00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:45.754
about how to protect your identity,

73
00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:47.016
if we don't cover it in this course

74
00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:48.336
or if anybody has suggestions that

75
00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:50.016
we could all learn from each other

76
00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:53.309
please leave it within the course here, okay?

77
00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.221
Okay, great.

78
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:55.888
Now, when you get...

79
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.563
Whenever you rent a car you wanna

80
00:02:59.563 --> 00:03:01.027
call your credit card company first

81
00:03:01.027 --> 00:03:03.910
and make sure that they're gonna pay themselves

82
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.301
for the insurance on your card, right?

83
00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:08.352
There's some nice perks you can get

84
00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:09.891
from using certain credit cards.

85
00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:12.420
And just know what the benefits are for your credit card.

86
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.712
All right, a lot of people think that it's just

87
00:03:13.712 --> 00:03:15.432
American Express, whatever, that has-

88
00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:16.472
Or these stupid expensive cards

89
00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:18.581
that have a lot of benefits,

90
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.843
but a lot of them do, a ton of them do.

91
00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:23.512
It's not just points for airplanes, okay?

92
00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:25.763
And just as a quick side note,

93
00:03:25.763 --> 00:03:29.331
if you buy something in a small family-owned store

94
00:03:29.331 --> 00:03:30.802
use Visa or MasterCard and not

95
00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:32.872
American Express if you have it,

96
00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:34.792
because what happens is the family that owns the store

97
00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:37.651
will pay much lower fees on Visa and MasterCard.

98
00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:39.723
It's just a nice thing to do.

99
00:03:39.723 --> 00:03:40.781
And this is why a lot of small

100
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:43.803
businesses don't accept Amex, okay?

101
00:03:43.803 --> 00:03:46.512
Other obvious security measures for

102
00:03:46.512 --> 00:03:48.301
your credit cards is to have a

103
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:51.123
secret password that nobody guesses, right?

104
00:03:51.123 --> 00:03:53.020
And my MasterCard didn't work recently,

105
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.763
and I called MasterCard and they asked me

106
00:03:55.763 --> 00:03:58.051
for my wife's mother's maiden name,

107
00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:01.501
which Christine gave them and which is

108
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:03.872
the password for our credit cards, right?

109
00:04:03.872 --> 00:04:07.112
And her mom's maiden name is Triantafyllides

110
00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:09.540
which is Greek for "thirty flowers," right?

111
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.661
And the MasterCard rep asked me to spell it and I said,

112
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:15.021
"Are you kidding me?"

113
00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.371
I couldn't spell it right.

114
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:17.661
So, anyway...

115
00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:18.592
I guess I should change that now

116
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.032
I told the whole world this, right?

117
00:04:20.032 --> 00:04:21.100
(laughs)

118
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.992
Okay, so with all credit cards

119
00:04:22.992 --> 00:04:26.821
pay at least the minimum amount monthly required

120
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:29.781
or your credit rating will really get hurt.

121
00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:32.083
Also, please read the fine print

122
00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:33.581
when getting credit cards.

123
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:37.748
Just be careful with teaser rates like 1.9% APR.

124
00:04:38.893 --> 00:04:40.230
It's called introduction APR.

125
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.152
And APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate.

126
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.012
And that 1.9% is often a teaser

127
00:04:46.012 --> 00:04:47.192
and in six or 12 months,

128
00:04:47.192 --> 00:04:48.025
(snaps)

129
00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:50.161
They raise to 20%, right?

130
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:52.091
So read the fine print, okay?

131
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.552
And as much as I think that credit cards

132
00:04:54.552 --> 00:04:56.453
can cause a lot of damage,

133
00:04:56.453 --> 00:04:58.921
try to get one though if you don't already have one.

134
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:01.691
Because it helps to establish your credit rating.

135
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:03.201
So you can get a mortgage to buy

136
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:05.503
a house later in life or, god forbid,

137
00:05:05.503 --> 00:05:07.479
if you need a big loan later in life

138
00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.312
for emergency reasons, you can get them, okay?

139
00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.519
And if you're a student,

140
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.130
these credit card companies make it easy for you to get,

141
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.410
so try and get a credit card in university

142
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.401
or in college or whatever if you're in school, okay?

143
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:26.810
Because they know once you sign up

144
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.530
with one credit card you're gonna be

145
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.559
probably brand-loyal for life, okay?

146
00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.938
The same thing with computers.

147
00:05:32.938 --> 00:05:34.949
You know, when we get student discounts

148
00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.759
at the Apple store, right?

149
00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.298
Apple is, they're smart.

150
00:05:38.298 --> 00:05:40.909
They know longer-term, if they get you as a student,

151
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.358
you'll probably stay with them for life if you can.

152
00:05:43.358 --> 00:05:45.450
And by the way, if you ever go to the Apple store,

153
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.858
always ask for student discounts,

154
00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:50.399
okay, if you're a student, okay?

155
00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.599
Tell them you're a Udemy Student.

156
00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.250
Just kidding.
Sort of. No.

157
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.758
But if you are a student just always ask

158
00:05:55.758 --> 00:05:59.298
for student discounts everywhere you go, okay?

159
00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:00.988
And so, when I was an undergrad

160
00:06:00.988 --> 00:06:03.429
I went to a school in Canada, Montreal

161
00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.669
called McGill where I learned

162
00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.548
how to party too much, actually.

163
00:06:07.548 --> 00:06:08.970
But it was fun.

164
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.690
I got three credit cards.

165
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.989
Okay, I got a Visa, MasterCard and Amex.

166
00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:14.378
When I was a student, right?

167
00:06:14.378 --> 00:06:18.295
And my credit rating is awful in Canada, right?

168
00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:21.947
It was basically ruined.

169
00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:25.178
And this is probably good for me to tell you this.

170
00:06:25.178 --> 00:06:28.090
I paid them all back late.

171
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.378
I remember one year I think I paid

172
00:06:30.378 --> 00:06:31.959
one back like eight months late

173
00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.349
and I didn't even make a minimum payment

174
00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.418
And my credit rating was just terrible, right?

175
00:06:35.418 --> 00:06:38.189
And so, when I moved to the United States

176
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.338
I paid my credit cards here on time.

177
00:06:40.338 --> 00:06:41.658
I had to start from scratch, right?

178
00:06:41.658 --> 00:06:44.490
But just please learn from my mistakes, okay?

179
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.818
Again, if I still lived in Canada

180
00:06:45.818 --> 00:06:47.429
I might not be able to get a mortgage, whatever.

181
00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:49.269
And my wife, Christine, thank goodness

182
00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:51.959
she's so good at paying bills on time.

183
00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:52.804
Much better than I am.
