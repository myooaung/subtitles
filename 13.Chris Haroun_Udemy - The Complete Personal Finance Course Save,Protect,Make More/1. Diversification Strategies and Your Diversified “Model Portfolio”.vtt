00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.459
<v ->Before we discuss diversification strategies,</v>

2
00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.403
I wanna stress that if you decide to sell

3
00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:09.624
a mutual fund that you own and instead buy an

4
00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:13.603
index ETF fund, and if this mutual fund that you're

5
00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:17.021
thinking about selling is already in your retirement account

6
00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:20.938
I want you to please make sure that you can buy

7
00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.283
an index ETF in your retirement account.

8
00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:27.400
I don't want you to take money out of your retirement

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.640
account, I want you to leave it in there, okay?

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.360
Talk to an accountant if you want to on this.

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.864
Let me move on.

12
00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:37.661
Separately, now that you understand the different

13
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:41.384
investment classes, meaning stocks, bonds, commodities,

14
00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:44.904
real estate, and more, let's talk about what percents

15
00:00:44.904 --> 00:00:49.064
of your portfolio should be in each investment class.

16
00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:52.200
And please note that what I'm about to discuss

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.941
is my personal, preferred methodology

18
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:58.024
when it comes to portfolio diversification.

19
00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:01.181
So please do your own homework as well

20
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:04.360
on what your diversification strategy should be

21
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.923
and what makes most sense for you.

22
00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:07.239
This is my pick, okay?

23
00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.763
When I used to work on Wall Street at Goldman Sachs,

24
00:01:09.763 --> 00:01:13.005
our firm's investment strategists would create

25
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.483
what's called a model portfolio which suggests

26
00:01:16.483 --> 00:01:19.821
types of stocks and sectors to invest in.

27
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:22.738
I'm gonna take this a step further.

28
00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:26.104
I'm gonna have you select what risk levels

29
00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:30.104
you are most comfortable with, based on your age

30
00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:35.400
if you wanna account for that and other factors.

31
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.299
I'm gonna set up your model portfolio general guidelines

32
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.473
here so you can manage and set it up

33
00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:46.055
using our investment portfolio management system.

34
00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.614
Which is why I had you do an earlier exercise

35
00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:52.382
on your complete personal finance dashboard

36
00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:55.299
by doing exercises on stocks, bonds, ETF,

37
00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.501
real estate investment trusts, and commodities.

38
00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.461
Let's take a look now at 10 diversification rules

39
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.725
for our model portfolio construction.

40
00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.323
Don't worry, please, if this seems like a lot for you,

41
00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:09.864
like a lot of rules, I should say.

42
00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:12.360
As I'm gonna make this easier for you to understand

43
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.283
when we do our next exercise as all 10 of these rules

44
00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:20.643
that we are going to discuss are already documented

45
00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.893
for you to read when doing exercise 24.

46
00:02:25.763 --> 00:02:28.104
And they are listed here all the way to the right

47
00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:31.043
on your investment portfolio management system.

48
00:02:31.043 --> 00:02:33.923
So before we start with our first of the 10 rules,

49
00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:36.483
please remember earlier in the course

50
00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:40.643
when I gave the very basic rule of taking 100

51
00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:43.496
minus your age when deciding how risky

52
00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.384
your portfolio should be, remember that?

53
00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:48.904
What we're going to do now is I'm gonna slightly change that

54
00:02:48.904 --> 00:02:52.584
as I said I would, and what we're gonna do

55
00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:54.461
is we're gonna add more layers of diversification

56
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:57.518
to your portfolio through our 10 rules

57
00:02:57.518 --> 00:03:00.934
or general guidelines of diversification.

58
00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:03.619
And you don't have to use all 10 of these rules, please.

59
00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.760
Just think of them as general guidelines

60
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.957
and the point is is that we want to have

61
00:03:08.957 --> 00:03:10.717
a well diversified portfolio,

62
00:03:10.717 --> 00:03:15.582
so that we don't put all of our eggs in one basket.

63
00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:17.894
Let's kick it off with diversification

64
00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:19.976
portfolio construction rule number one.

65
00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:22.339
Accounting for our age.

66
00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.200
What we're gonna do is we're gonna do this.

67
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.139
We're gonna take 110 minus our age, not 100 anymore.

68
00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.095
We're gonna take 110 minus our age

69
00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:32.099
and this is how much we should invest

70
00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.560
in more risky investments, and the rest will be invested

71
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.981
in less risky investments.

72
00:03:37.981 --> 00:03:42.148
So if you are 30 years old, then 110 - 30 = 80.

73
00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.661
Which means that 80% of your portfolio

74
00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:49.054
can be in more risky investments

75
00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:52.304
and 20% in less risky investments.

76
00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.760
So if you're 50, then 110 - 50 = 60%.

77
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.954
So 60% can be in more risky investments,

78
00:04:00.954 --> 00:04:03.554
and 40% can be in less risky investments.

79
00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:05.731
People are living much longer now,

80
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:08.051
and I personally believe that the person who will live

81
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:10.899
to be 150 years old is alive today.

82
00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:12.296
Okay, moving on.

83
00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.702
Let's talk about diversification and portfolio construction

84
00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:18.775
rule number two, Accounting for Risk.

85
00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:21.112
Okay, there's two types of investment risk classes

86
00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:23.059
for our model portfolio.

87
00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:27.033
One risk class is simply called more risky,

88
00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:30.136
and the other risk class is simply called less risky,

89
00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:32.216
trying to make it easy.

90
00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:35.117
The less risky class consists of investments

91
00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:38.615
that are more likely going to hold their value,

92
00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:42.637
like governments, bonds with a rating in the As or

93
00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:45.913
above, meaning A, AA, AAA, that sort of thing,

94
00:04:45.913 --> 00:04:48.397
as well as money in your bank account,

95
00:04:48.397 --> 00:04:52.280
or money in large cap stock funds, or value stock funds,

96
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.680
meaning funds, meaning stocks that are not expensive.

97
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.774
Remember we talked about value versus growth.

98
00:04:58.774 --> 00:05:03.692
Less risky means funds only, and not individual stocks

99
00:05:03.692 --> 00:05:05.494
or corporate bonds, okay?

100
00:05:05.494 --> 00:05:09.036
We're talking about funds here, meaning ETF funds.

101
00:05:09.036 --> 00:05:11.536
Everything else is more risky,

102
00:05:12.556 --> 00:05:17.212
including individual stocks, individual company bonds,

103
00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:20.236
any bond rating well below A.

104
00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:23.404
But it's gotta be B and above, I don't want you

105
00:05:23.404 --> 00:05:24.657
to touch anything else,

106
00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:28.236
because if it the rating is too low when it comes to bonds,

107
00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:30.796
meaning that the C, D, whatever it is,

108
00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:32.614
it's just too risky, remember we talked about

109
00:05:32.614 --> 00:05:34.097
junk bonds in Vegas.

110
00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:37.153
Anyway, so commodities and REITs are also classified

111
00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:38.854
as more risky.

112
00:05:38.854 --> 00:05:42.534
We're gonna keep building on this, okay?

113
00:05:42.534 --> 00:05:45.072
Diversification and portfolio construction

114
00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:49.574
rule number three, Accounting for Investment Size

115
00:05:49.574 --> 00:05:51.313
Percent Limits.

116
00:05:51.313 --> 00:05:55.057
No investments in a particular investment or ETF

117
00:05:55.057 --> 00:05:57.574
can be more than 5% of our portfolio.

118
00:05:57.574 --> 00:05:59.714
Sorry for saying five too loud.

119
00:05:59.714 --> 00:06:03.881
The exception is cash and AAA rated government bonds.

120
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.238
Because a AAA rated government bond is usually

121
00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.678
the same thing as cash.

122
00:06:10.678 --> 00:06:12.977
A lot of times companies on their balance sheet

123
00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:16.177
in assets they'll have cash in short-term investments.

124
00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:18.454
Those short-term investments are usually in treasuries,

125
00:06:18.454 --> 00:06:22.454
a lot of times they are U.S. treasuries, same thing as cash.

126
00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:27.084
So, rule number four, no fee can ever be more than

127
00:06:27.084 --> 00:06:31.142
an expense ratio of 0.5%, and this will encourage you

128
00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:34.999
to buy ETFs instead of mutual funds, if you want to.

129
00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.701
We talked about mutual funds earlier in the course.

130
00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:43.239
This means that 0.5% or less of the value of the fund

131
00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:45.698
is used to manage that fund,

132
00:06:45.698 --> 00:06:48.477
meaning paying for the salaries of the employees

133
00:06:48.477 --> 00:06:51.215
is managed in that fund.

134
00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:55.298
Diversification and Portfolio Construction Rule Number Five,

135
00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:57.858
Commodity and REIT exposure.

136
00:06:57.858 --> 00:07:01.159
Exposure to commodities and REIT investments

137
00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.494
cannot each be more than 10% than the value

138
00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:06.911
of your portfolio as a group.

139
00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:12.013
Diversification and Portfolio Construction Rule Number Six,

140
00:07:12.013 --> 00:07:13.479
International Exposure.

141
00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.218
Try your best to get 20% or more international exposure

142
00:07:17.218 --> 00:07:18.301
in your fund.

143
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:22.701
Number seven, Sector Exposure.

144
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:25.421
Try not to have more than 20% of your investments

145
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:27.597
in one particular sector,

146
00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:30.818
especially if you currently work in that sector.

147
00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:33.277
Number eight, no trading allowed.

148
00:07:33.277 --> 00:07:35.181
Please try your best to hold all investments

149
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:37.261
for many, many, many years.

150
00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:39.879
And the only reason to sell a position is when

151
00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:43.879
you're rebalancing your portfolio every couple of years,

152
00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:46.317
per rule number 10, and we'll get there in a second.

153
00:07:46.317 --> 00:07:49.261
Or if you change your mind on an investment

154
00:07:49.261 --> 00:07:52.013
based on new information.

155
00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.317
So before selling a position or an investment,

156
00:07:54.317 --> 00:07:57.715
ask yourself this, "if I had known about this new

157
00:07:57.715 --> 00:08:00.637
"piece of publicly disclosed information,

158
00:08:00.637 --> 00:08:03.938
"would I have bought this investment or not?"

159
00:08:03.938 --> 00:08:07.079
If the answer is no, then consider selling.

160
00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:10.055
Warren Buffet always invests with the intention of being

161
00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:12.738
okay if the stock market closes for a decade.

162
00:08:12.738 --> 00:08:15.399
The longer the view, the wiser the intention,

163
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:18.178
and you wanna be long-term greedy.

164
00:08:18.178 --> 00:08:21.058
Rule number nine, Do Your Own Research.

165
00:08:21.058 --> 00:08:23.554
As we discussed in the course, please do a lot

166
00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:25.735
of research on each type of investment you make,

167
00:08:25.735 --> 00:08:29.902
read the prospectus, meaning the filings, or online PDF

168
00:08:30.914 --> 00:08:34.891
that explains what the risks are with this investment.

169
00:08:34.891 --> 00:08:38.669
Read the annual reports too, if it's a healthy

170
00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.037
trading company, etc.

171
00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:44.909
Rule number 10, Rebalance, meaning recalculate

172
00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:49.357
the accounting for age every three years or so.

173
00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:52.190
So for my portfolio, I'm 45 right,

174
00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:56.557
although I know I don't look a day over 70.

175
00:08:56.557 --> 00:09:00.724
But if I take 110 minus my age of 45, then I get 65.

176
00:09:03.117 --> 00:09:06.957
So using my framework, my model portfolio should have 65%

177
00:09:06.957 --> 00:09:10.624
of my investments in higher risk investments

178
00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:16.505
and the rest, meaning 35% in lower risk investments.

179
00:09:18.877 --> 00:09:23.044
Now, of the 65%, I can't have more than 10%

180
00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:27.910
in commodities, so if I max out on picking

181
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.231
at least 2 commodity ETFs at a maximum of 5% each,

182
00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:34.849
then there's 55% left.

183
00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:38.988
Now assuming, I max out my 20% in individual stocks

184
00:09:38.988 --> 00:09:43.155
at a maximum of 5% each, then I have 35% left.

185
00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:48.318
And of this 35% I might buy out two higher dividend

186
00:09:50.231 --> 00:09:53.431
yielding REITs that will make up 10%.

187
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:57.431
So now I have 25% left to invest in more risky investments,

188
00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:01.598
so I will allocate 5% to a smaller cap index ETF fund.

189
00:10:03.249 --> 00:10:06.544
5% to a certain growth ETF fund,

190
00:10:06.544 --> 00:10:08.769
5% to emerging market ETF fund,

191
00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:11.203
5 % to a certain sector ETF,

192
00:10:11.203 --> 00:10:15.286
and 5% left over to pick certain stocks.

193
00:10:15.286 --> 00:10:19.453
Say two stocks at 2 and a half percent capital each.

194
00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:23.788
And every few years, we should rebalance

195
00:10:23.788 --> 00:10:25.455
our model portfolio.

196
00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:29.483
So in three years when I'm 48 years old, I should have

197
00:10:29.483 --> 00:10:34.385
110 minus 48 meaning 62% in more risky stocks

198
00:10:34.385 --> 00:10:36.305
instead of 65%.

199
00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:38.464
Now since we want to preserve capital

200
00:10:38.464 --> 00:10:41.384
and have our capital appreciate,

201
00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:45.030
we put as much of our investments that you make,

202
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.532
as much as you can, you put as much as you can

203
00:10:47.532 --> 00:10:49.868
into your retirement savings program,

204
00:10:49.868 --> 00:10:51.852
and if applicable, you out as much as you can

205
00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:54.534
into educational savings programs,

206
00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:57.473
or other tax-free accounts, as much as you can,

207
00:10:57.473 --> 00:10:59.932
because we want our money to grow tax-free

208
00:10:59.932 --> 00:11:01.414
for many, many years.

209
00:11:01.414 --> 00:11:04.092
So we only pay tax one time when we take the money out

210
00:11:04.092 --> 00:11:06.406
when we have a much bigger amount.

211
00:11:06.406 --> 00:11:09.734
Now since the 1920s small company stocks,

212
00:11:09.734 --> 00:11:12.925
meaning riskier stocks have generated

213
00:11:12.925 --> 00:11:16.421
an average annual return of 12%.

214
00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:19.382
During the same period of time the larger company's

215
00:11:19.382 --> 00:11:22.902
stocks have been up about 10% on average.

216
00:11:22.902 --> 00:11:26.820
So in terms of bonds, during the same time period,

217
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.701
meaning since the 1920s, corporate bonds have generated

218
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:32.578
close to 6% return, and government bonds

219
00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:36.680
that are more than one year in length have generated

220
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.438
close to a 5% return.

221
00:11:38.438 --> 00:11:41.882
Now remember, the low interest rate over the past

222
00:11:41.882 --> 00:11:45.301
couple of years is an anomaly as rates

223
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:49.541
are usually much, much higher than they are.

224
00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:52.881
During the same period, meaning since the 1920s,

225
00:11:52.881 --> 00:11:57.749
30-day treasury bills have generated close to a 4% return.

226
00:11:57.749 --> 00:12:00.237
And you can see that higher risk investments

227
00:12:00.237 --> 00:12:04.038
generate higher returns in the long run,

228
00:12:04.038 --> 00:12:06.658
but they are much more volatile,

229
00:12:06.658 --> 00:12:10.658
which is why as we get older, we need to decrease

230
00:12:10.658 --> 00:12:14.741
the amount of risk that we have in our portfolio.

231
00:12:16.198 --> 00:12:18.481
And as you know, I don't recommend mutual funds.

232
00:12:18.481 --> 00:12:21.841
Rather, instead I recommend ETFs.

233
00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:24.915
And as you put together your portfolio,

234
00:12:24.915 --> 00:12:26.902
please know that I really care about

235
00:12:26.902 --> 00:12:29.302
your capital preservation, almost more than

236
00:12:29.302 --> 00:12:32.518
capital appreciation, especially the older you get,

237
00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.859
you wanna preserve capital because it's hard

238
00:12:34.859 --> 00:12:37.142
to make up for money that you lose when you're older,

239
00:12:37.142 --> 00:12:38.742
obviously, okay?

240
00:12:38.742 --> 00:12:42.171
I'm not gonna tell you which specific investments

241
00:12:42.171 --> 00:12:44.411
to put your portfolio for your money in,

242
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:47.846
as I always want you to do your own research.

243
00:12:47.846 --> 00:12:49.926
Two more things work mentioning.

244
00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:53.193
Number one, never sell anything in less than one year

245
00:12:53.193 --> 00:12:55.595
if it's not in a retirement account,

246
00:12:55.595 --> 00:12:59.974
if your country's taxes tax investments sold within a year

247
00:12:59.974 --> 00:13:03.754
are higher than taxes you must pay in stuff

248
00:13:03.754 --> 00:13:05.094
you hold for more than a year.

249
00:13:05.094 --> 00:13:07.658
And mutual funds do this all the time,

250
00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:10.117
which kills performance when we file taxes.

251
00:13:10.117 --> 00:13:14.101
Number two, I want you to keep a small amount of cash

252
00:13:14.101 --> 00:13:18.058
at your bank, or in very liquid government investments

253
00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:22.225
just in case you have emergency reasons to access the cash,

254
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.192
or you gotta pay more taxes than you thought.

255
00:13:26.192 --> 00:13:30.259
I will clearly document all the aforementioned
