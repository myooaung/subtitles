00:00:00.751 --> 00:00:02.370
<v ->It's almost impossible to save money</v>

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.911
unless you understand the awesome tax advantage

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:08.954
of retirement savings programs and other programs as well.

4
00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:12.220
And there's so many taxes in many countries

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.883
like Federal tax, State or Provincial tax,

6
00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:18.362
sales tax when you buy something, property tax,

7
00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:20.693
which can be 1% of the value of the property you own,

8
00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.410
et cetera, and State taxes,

9
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.091
higher taxes on the wealthy, et cetera.

10
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.686
And every country and state or province

11
00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:28.730
has different tax rates.

12
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.683
And if you take all the taxes that you pay,

13
00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:35.144
then the percent of taxes that you pay

14
00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:37.845
can be close to or more than 50%

15
00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:41.148
of your income which is crazy.

16
00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:44.045
And this means that you sort of end up working

17
00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:46.503
for the government for more than six months

18
00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:48.489
every single year.

19
00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.996
You know, from July to year end

20
00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:51.801
you work for yourself, kind of.

21
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.299
So, or you make money for yourself, I should say.

22
00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.545
So this is why you need to do anything we can

23
00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:02.959
within the law, of course, to minimize how much tax we pay.

24
00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:07.774
As this is by far our largest expense, taxes that is.

25
00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:12.033
So, let's say you make $50,000 annual income

26
00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:16.200
and on that $50,000 you're supposed to pay 20% tax.

27
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:21.395
This means you're left with $40,000 after tax.

28
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:23.070
Hold on a minute, please.

29
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.085
Many countries let you deduct now

30
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:29.887
your retirement savings that you contributed that year,

31
00:01:29.887 --> 00:01:32.685
so the amount of tax decreases.

32
00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:34.534
I'll give you an example.

33
00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:39.452
So, let's say that you contributed $10,000 that year

34
00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:41.882
to your retirement fund.

35
00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:44.601
Then this means that you're only gonna be taxed

36
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:46.851
on $40,000 and not $50,000.

37
00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:52.527
So the amount of tax that you pay is $8,000

38
00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:54.455
and not $10,000.

39
00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:58.125
Yes, you saved $2,000 in taxes right there.

40
00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:00.235
It's a huge deal, okay.

41
00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:04.631
And we know that beautiful power of compound interest

42
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.108
from exercise one of this course.

43
00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:10.833
And so it's absolutely crazy not to take advantage

44
00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:13.905
of this tax benefit every single year.

45
00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:15.831
Okay, and every country's a bit different.

46
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:18.001
But you need to max out

47
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.581
on your annual retirement savings benefit

48
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.395
or you're literally, literally throwing money

49
00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:25.009
in the garbage, okay.

50
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:26.824
And to learn more about tax shelters

51
00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:30.398
like retirements and more in your country,

52
00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:34.015
please see the gray shaded box in the settings tab here

53
00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:35.941
for this video, okay.

54
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.963
Separately, let's drill down a bit more

55
00:02:39.963 --> 00:02:42.201
on the income tax calculations.

56
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:46.115
When you calculate your income tax rate,

57
00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:49.309
in many countries, there's what's called a step function.

58
00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.567
And I wanna explain to you how it works.

59
00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:55.490
Every country and region and year and government

60
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.257
creates and changes tax laws a lot,

61
00:02:58.257 --> 00:03:01.269
which is why I hired an accountant, of course makes sense,

62
00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.629
as their job is to make you pay less tax.

63
00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.181
But I wanna give you an example of how income tax works

64
00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:10.543
in most countries of the world.

65
00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:12.770
And again, these numbers will change constantly

66
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.269
and the tax rates.

67
00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.788
So here's the step function example.

68
00:03:15.788 --> 00:03:20.149 line:15% 
Between $0 in income and 10,000, you pay 10% tax.

69
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.573 line:15% 
It's just an example.

70
00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:23.406 line:15% 
Then

71
00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.495 line:15% 
for the amount you make between $10,000 and $30,000,

72
00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.795 line:15% 
you pay 20% tax.

73
00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:34.406 line:15% 
Then for the amount you make between 30 and $50,000,

74
00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:36.156 line:15% 
you pay 35% tax.

75
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:41.676 line:15% 
And then the amount you make over $50,000, you pay 45% tax.

76
00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:45.745
Okay, so, if somebody makes a million dollars

77
00:03:45.745 --> 00:03:49.855
using the aforementioned hypothetical tax rate example,

78
00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:52.913
they would pay taxes as follows.

79
00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:57.671
They would pay $1,000 tax on the first $10,000 they made.

80
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.838
Then they'll pay $4,000 tax on the amount they made

81
00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:03.893
between 20K,

82
00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.307
or they made between 10K and 20K.

83
00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:09.893
Okay, so that's a total of 5,000 so far, okay.

84
00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:13.679
Then they pay 35% tax on the next 20K,

85
00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:17.846
meaning seven grand in taxes for a total of $12,00 so far.

86
00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:23.041
Then 45% they'll pay on the next $950,000 in taxes, right.

87
00:04:25.127 --> 00:04:28.627
So 45% of $950,000 is $427,500, okay.

88
00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.886
So let's add the 12K in taxes to this $427K, roughly amount.

89
00:04:38.815 --> 00:04:41.348
So the total that person making a million dollars

90
00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:43.931
would pay in taxes is $439,500,

91
00:04:45.316 --> 00:04:50.283
which is 43.95% tax on income of a million dollars.

92
00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:51.619
Okay.

93
00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:54.477
Now there are other tax deductions

94
00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:57.474
that you can get if you have dependents or kids.

95
00:04:57.474 --> 00:05:00.189
And if you work for somebody else,

96
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.793
then at the end of each year you will receive a tax document

97
00:05:03.793 --> 00:05:06.793
that highlights how much you've paid

98
00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.425
or should be paying in tax.

99
00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:12.587
Okay, in the United States, this tax document

100
00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:14.419
they give you is called a W-2.

101
00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.187
And if you work at a bigger company,

102
00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:18.737
you can always call human resources

103
00:05:18.737 --> 00:05:21.315
to have them explain the process to you.

104
00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:25.475
Okay, so, to see what documents like W-2

105
00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:29.026
you need to file in your country,

106
00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:31.198
please click on this link here

107
00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:34.227
on your tax filing organizer tab,

108
00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:36.793
and see the internet links in rows,

109
00:05:36.793 --> 00:05:40.104
I think it's 37 and 39 here, okay.

110
00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:41.995
And we're gonna cover a lot of the other stuff

111
00:05:41.995 --> 00:05:44.964
on this tab here in exercise number 13.

112
00:05:44.964 --> 00:05:45.797
Now,

113
00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:49.560
I want you to have your company deduct

114
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.996
as much money as possible every paycheck

115
00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:54.037
to go into your retirement savings account

116
00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:57.037
so that your taxable income is less.

117
00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:01.225
And remember when I explained the difference

118
00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:03.233
between filing and showing,

119
00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:04.749
like you're making 50K versus 40K,

120
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:08.525
remember that $2,000 in savings, 'cause you pay less taxes?

121
00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:10.399
That's what I'm talking about here.

122
00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:11.947
So in every country the dollar amount

123
00:06:11.947 --> 00:06:14.574
or currency amount you can put in your tax free

124
00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.869
retirement account is different, okay.

125
00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:20.191
It's your money grows tax free in this account

126
00:06:20.191 --> 00:06:22.836
until you take it out much later in life.

127
00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:24.380
It's a beautiful thing.

128
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.938
And so as of now, and I promise you this will change.

129
00:06:26.938 --> 00:06:30.729
The most you can put into your retirement account every year

130
00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.146
in the United States tax free is $18,500.

131
00:06:37.325 --> 00:06:40.205
Your retirement tax plan in the U.S.

132
00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:43.277
is often referred to as a 401(k)

133
00:06:43.277 --> 00:06:46.339
or in Canada it's called an RRSP.

134
00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.593
In England it's the PPP.

135
00:06:48.593 --> 00:06:52.487
And in Australia it's called the Superannuation.

136
00:06:52.487 --> 00:06:55.411
And in other countries there's other names as well.

137
00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:58.313
You can learn more about your country's retirement programs,

138
00:06:58.313 --> 00:07:01.090
if available, by clicking on the links,

139
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.591
again, in the gray box on the settings tab here

140
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:08.031
or in the tax filing organizer tab,

141
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.479
I included it as well in that box, okay.

142
00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.339
I included the same in a couple of places

143
00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.187
just to make it convenient for you.

144
00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:18.407
Okay and so, although other countries have different names

145
00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:22.935
for this concept, the concept of tax deductions,

146
00:07:22.935 --> 00:07:26.021
meaning saving money now tax free,

147
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:28.459
and then paying taxes on the saved amount later

148
00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:31.203
in the future is similar.

149
00:07:31.203 --> 00:07:34.116
The different names, but the whole concept is similar.

150
00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:38.173
You pay taxes much, much later, not today.

151
00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:39.839
So do a search in your country

152
00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.127
on the retirement savings program name

153
00:07:43.127 --> 00:07:45.555
if it's not here in this box.

154
00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:49.722
And a 401(k) in the U.S. means a company sponsored

155
00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:53.721
the retirement plan, okay.

156
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:57.888
And you don't pay taxes on the $18,500 maximum contribution

157
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.666
to your 401(k) until you take the money out

158
00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:05.061
years in the future when you retire, okay.

159
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:08.094
And the problem is, though,

160
00:08:08.094 --> 00:08:11.255
that we have no idea what the tax rate is going to be

161
00:08:11.255 --> 00:08:13.239
many years in the future.

162
00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:16.625
And just given the amount of debt many countries have,

163
00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:18.918
just please assume that the future tax rates

164
00:08:18.918 --> 00:08:21.441
could be a lot higher than they are today.

165
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.156
Okay, I just want you to be conservative, that's all.

166
00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:25.841
And every country has different

167
00:08:25.841 --> 00:08:27.347
retirement saving contribution laws,

168
00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:31.663
if applicable, and your company's human resources department

169
00:08:31.663 --> 00:08:33.797
will help you out with this.

170
00:08:33.797 --> 00:08:36.367
If you have one, call HR, and they'll walk you

171
00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:38.050
through the steps of how to contribute

172
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.697
to your retirement account,

173
00:08:39.697 --> 00:08:42.249
so it's taken out of your bank account every month, okay,

174
00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:44.014
or out of your paycheck even,

175
00:08:44.014 --> 00:08:45.922
right, before your company pays you.

176
00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:48.290
Many companies will even match every dollar

177
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.511
or a large part that you contributed

178
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:51.981
to your retirement account.

179
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:55.518
And so talk to your employer to see if those programs exist.

180
00:08:55.518 --> 00:08:59.253
And if they do exist, please do whatever you can

181
00:08:59.253 --> 00:09:02.205
to take advantage of this as it's literally free money,

182
00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:04.061
literally, okay.

183
00:09:04.061 --> 00:09:08.200
And don't focus on relying just on a pension plan

184
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.165
if you even have one, please.

185
00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:13.452
Especially if you're younger and your a Millennial,

186
00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.899
because Millennials are likely to work

187
00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:19.301
for many different places at the same time

188
00:09:19.301 --> 00:09:21.568
and have many different sources of income

189
00:09:21.568 --> 00:09:26.240
as the sharing economy gets more, more, and more relevant.

190
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.823
Kind of like driving an Uber while you work

191
00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:35.279
at part time for a company while you rented a room

192
00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:37.333
to AirBnB, that sort of thing, okay.

193
00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:39.539
Your parents might have had a pension,

194
00:09:39.539 --> 00:09:43.093
but if you're under 30, you most likely won't have one.

195
00:09:43.093 --> 00:09:46.093
Now, if you don't work for a company

196
00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:50.029
that offers a 401(k) or retirement plan,

197
00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:53.677
there are likely other government savings plans

198
00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:57.623
that you can contribute to for your retirement,

199
00:09:57.623 --> 00:10:00.951
which is called an IRA, in the United States,

200
00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:04.407
which stands for Individual Retirement Account.

201
00:10:04.407 --> 00:10:07.445
Similar to a 401(k), the IRA won't be taxed

202
00:10:07.445 --> 00:10:10.606
until you take the money out when you retire

203
00:10:10.606 --> 00:10:11.701
or later in life.

204
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:13.451
So how does all this work?

205
00:10:13.451 --> 00:10:16.973
Well, this is a tax form for the United States, okay.

206
00:10:16.973 --> 00:10:17.806
And

207
00:10:18.856 --> 00:10:20.384
I got this from my library.

208
00:10:20.384 --> 00:10:22.839
You can go online and they'll mail it to you as well,

209
00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:24.267
the government, okay.

210
00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:26.287
And here you can deduct certain items

211
00:10:26.287 --> 00:10:29.001
for the amount of income that you're documenting

212
00:10:29.001 --> 00:10:30.675
on your tax form.

213
00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:34.282
So like you pay income tax, not on your income,

214
00:10:34.282 --> 00:10:38.282
but on your adjusted gross income for this form,

215
00:10:40.486 --> 00:10:42.573
adjusted gross income.

216
00:10:42.573 --> 00:10:46.240
Now, as a separate side note, some countries

217
00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:49.597
actually let you put money

218
00:10:49.597 --> 00:10:52.121
into your retirement account today,

219
00:10:52.121 --> 00:10:56.614
but you pay taxes today and not when you take it out, okay.

220
00:10:56.614 --> 00:11:00.087
And this is kind of the opposite of what we just talked

221
00:11:00.087 --> 00:11:02.035
about in the United States.

222
00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:04.431
In the United States, they actually have a program like that

223
00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.522
called a Roth IRA.

224
00:11:06.522 --> 00:11:09.282
And the good thing about paying taxes first

225
00:11:09.282 --> 00:11:12.597
and then contributing, meaning putting the money

226
00:11:12.597 --> 00:11:15.095
into a Roth IRA, for example, in the U.S.,

227
00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:18.027
is that if you think taxes are going to be

228
00:11:18.027 --> 00:11:20.687
much, much, much, much higher in the future,

229
00:11:20.687 --> 00:11:24.854
or if you think that the tax rate will be way higher on you

230
00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:29.877
for whatever reason, then making these pay tax first

231
00:11:29.877 --> 00:11:32.865
or Roth IRA accounts, as they call it in the U.S.,

232
00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:34.293
is a good idea.

233
00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:37.391
And there are limits, though, on Roth IRA

234
00:11:37.391 --> 00:11:40.526
and non-Roth IRA contributions.

235
00:11:40.526 --> 00:11:44.693
And the IRA limit is about $5,500 or a little bit higher

236
00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:48.153
if you're older than 50 years old.

237
00:11:48.153 --> 00:11:52.047
And you gotta make less than $160,000 individually

238
00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:55.304
to do this or $183,000 as a married couple.

239
00:11:55.304 --> 00:11:59.635
And I promise you that these amounts will change

240
00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:03.089
as the tax code frequently changes every single country.

241
00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:07.256
And so please read government tax-related website contents

242
00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:11.166
as I put here for your country,

243
00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:14.385
as they're often not as complicated to read

244
00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:15.893
as you think they are.

245
00:12:15.893 --> 00:12:18.743
And just spend time and get a big cup of coffee first off,

246
00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:21.305
or actually what I like to do is

247
00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:23.276
I drink this diet Mountain Dew,

248
00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:25.498
it's actually high in caffeine, anyway.

249
00:12:25.498 --> 00:12:27.415
Sorry, off topic.

250
00:12:27.415 --> 00:12:29.284
Okay, I'm not sponsored by Mountain Dew.

251
00:12:29.284 --> 00:12:32.284
So spend time reading these websites

252
00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:36.617
and if you don't understand them,

253
00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:40.211
you can talk to your accountant as well, okay.

254
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:45.113
Because I want you to pay as little tax as possible, okay.

255
00:12:45.113 --> 00:12:47.421
And these websites can put you to sleep though,

256
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:48.785
they're kind of dry, okay.

257
00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:52.072
Dammit, now the IRS is gonna audit me for that comment.

258
00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:55.887
I don't care, okay, I just wanna do whatever it takes

259
00:12:55.887 --> 00:12:57.531
to help you protect your money,

260
00:12:57.531 --> 00:12:59.341
that your family's taken care of.

261
00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:03.402
So ask your accountant that's filing your taxes

262
00:13:03.402 --> 00:13:07.240
if there are any tax credits that you can take advantage of,

263
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.679
and if there's any way to reduce your taxable income

264
00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:13.911
in the next 12 months, meaning retirement savings programs,

265
00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:15.492
et cetera, okay.

266
00:13:15.492 --> 00:13:18.011
It's the accountant's job to understand

267
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:20.013
the changing tax codes, not yours,

268
00:13:20.013 --> 00:13:22.720
and not mine, we just don't have the time, right.

269
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.972
And so hiring an accountant can cost as little

270
00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.628
as 20 bucks in some countries

271
00:13:26.628 --> 00:13:29.555
to several hundred dollars or more in other places

272
00:13:29.555 --> 00:13:31.932
if you have a complicated tax profile.

273
00:13:31.932 --> 00:13:34.833
But it's really worth the investment for you, okay.

274
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.550
And if you're uber, uber wealthy,

275
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.607
you're obviously gonna pay thousands

276
00:13:38.607 --> 00:13:40.853
and thousands of dollars, tax lawyers and all that stuff.

277
00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:44.121
But they'll save you money as well, okay.

278
00:13:44.121 --> 00:13:45.907
And if you don't want to hire an accountant,

279
00:13:45.907 --> 00:13:48.939
then you can use online tax preparation software,

280
00:13:48.939 --> 00:13:51.287
which I don't recommend, but you can do it.

281
00:13:51.287 --> 00:13:53.269
An example is TurboTax.com.

282
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:55.575
Or you can go to your government tax website,

283
00:13:55.575 --> 00:13:58.779
for example, irs.gov in the United States,

284
00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:01.351
and search for the words free file.

285
00:14:01.351 --> 00:14:04.601
And I actually have an older form here,

286
00:14:05.466 --> 00:14:09.149
this is from 2016 for the United States,

287
00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:12.175
we the people and it's, they'll tell,

288
00:14:12.175 --> 00:14:14.805
there's free file, it's irs.gov/freefile.

289
00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:17.345
And this is anyway a tax document.

290
00:14:17.345 --> 00:14:19.744
Not as hard to understand these things as you think,

291
00:14:19.744 --> 00:14:21.532
especially after what you learn in this course.

292
00:14:21.532 --> 00:14:23.264
I humbly hope, okay.

293
00:14:23.264 --> 00:14:24.097
And so,

294
00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:27.469
many larger accounting companies, actually,

295
00:14:27.469 --> 00:14:30.471
will even let you file your taxes for free

296
00:14:30.471 --> 00:14:33.531
using their websites and their software, okay.

297
00:14:33.531 --> 00:14:36.514
But they'll really try to upsell you

298
00:14:36.514 --> 00:14:38.603
and get you as a paying customer,

299
00:14:38.603 --> 00:14:42.092
if you have more complicated tax returns, et cetera, okay.

300
00:14:42.092 --> 00:14:43.707
And I know I keep mentioning this,

301
00:14:43.707 --> 00:14:45.833
but I want you to find a way to hire an accountant,

302
00:14:45.833 --> 00:14:48.610
because I really care, and I want you to pay less tax.

303
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.579
And I want you to take advantage

304
00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:53.228
of all these beautiful tax incentive plans.

305
00:14:53.228 --> 00:14:57.958
And if you don't, you throw money in the garbage.

306
00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.763
And also by hiring an accountant,

307
00:14:59.763 --> 00:15:01.767
they'll hopefully keep you within

308
00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:04.666
from breaking the laws, because tax evasion

309
00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:06.216
is actually a felony,

310
00:15:06.216 --> 00:15:10.419
and jail time and huge fines occur by not paying taxes.

311
00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:14.311
Even if you paid too little by accident,

312
00:15:14.311 --> 00:15:17.410
even if it was an accident, it's still a felony or can be.

313
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.431
And people, this is crazy, man,

314
00:15:20.431 --> 00:15:22.278
this is gonna blow you away.

315
00:15:22.278 --> 00:15:25.113
But in many countries, most countries,

316
00:15:25.113 --> 00:15:28.612
people can report you, okay, anonymously,

317
00:15:28.612 --> 00:15:31.777
like former friends or people that are jealous

318
00:15:31.777 --> 00:15:33.631
because you're doing really well now, right.

319
00:15:33.631 --> 00:15:37.257
And they can report you to tax agencies.

320
00:15:37.257 --> 00:15:40.011
They do this, it happens a lot, it's true.

321
00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:41.805
In many countries, like here in the United States,

322
00:15:41.805 --> 00:15:44.117
your buddy, your friend, or your neighbor

323
00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:46.871
can literally call the Internal Revenue Service,

324
00:15:46.871 --> 00:15:50.831
meaning the tax agency here, and anonymously report you.

325
00:15:50.831 --> 00:15:52.435
It's crazy, I know.

326
00:15:52.435 --> 00:15:53.851
But there's a lot of celebrities

327
00:15:53.851 --> 00:15:56.339
that have gone to jail as well and other criminals as well.

328
00:15:56.339 --> 00:15:58.602
Obviously Al Capone is one example.

329
00:15:58.602 --> 00:16:02.519
He actually went to jail here in San Francisco,

330
00:16:04.193 --> 00:16:06.799
there's an island that's actually a jail here.

331
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:10.966
And he went to jail because of not paying enough tax.

332
00:16:12.047 --> 00:16:14.832
And a bunch of celebrities have gone to jail as well.

333
00:16:14.832 --> 00:16:18.271
And in many countries, people actually get rewards

334
00:16:18.271 --> 00:16:21.639
for turning in friends or employers, et cetera

335
00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:23.743
that cheated on their taxes.

336
00:16:23.743 --> 00:16:26.403
And you know, sometimes these rewards are literally

337
00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.274
in the millions of dollars.

338
00:16:28.274 --> 00:16:31.069
So who should you hire as your accountant again?

339
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:32.729
You talk to your friends and family, whatever,

340
00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:34.141
they'll tell you who to hire.

341
00:16:34.141 --> 00:16:35.329
But I want you to grab a coffee

342
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:37.445
with at least one accountant before you hire them

343
00:16:37.445 --> 00:16:39.088
and that was recommended to you,

344
00:16:39.088 --> 00:16:42.220
and just ask them what kind of tax deductions

345
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.375
you might be able to receive

346
00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:47.247
and ask them for the price they offer, et cetera, first.

347
00:16:47.247 --> 00:16:49.441
And your friends will tell you if their accountant

348
00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:51.865
has helped them get big refunds in the past,

349
00:16:51.865 --> 00:16:53.415
and that sort of thing.

350
00:16:53.415 --> 00:16:56.942
It's almost always an incredible investment

351
00:16:56.942 --> 00:17:00.187
as you can actually get a tax refund a lot of times

352
00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:01.579
by hiring an accountant.

353
00:17:01.579 --> 00:17:04.054
And it keeps you from not filing taxes properly,

354
00:17:04.054 --> 00:17:06.371
which can get you in a lot of trouble.

355
00:17:06.371 --> 00:17:08.251
As we know ignorance of the law is no excuse.

356
00:17:08.251 --> 00:17:10.442
And when you hire an accountant,

357
00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:12.242
or this accountant, be sure to tell them

358
00:17:12.242 --> 00:17:15.112
if you ever lost money in the past on investments

359
00:17:15.112 --> 00:17:16.945
as you might be able to carry forward

360
00:17:16.945 --> 00:17:20.715
this tax loss situation I've been talking about before.

361
00:17:20.715 --> 00:17:24.465
We spend a fortune on doctors to help us heal

362
00:17:25.496 --> 00:17:28.552
and often the health issue is created partially

363
00:17:28.552 --> 00:17:32.635
because we incurred too much money-related stress

364
00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.573
over many years.

365
00:17:35.573 --> 00:17:39.797
And so, I think that hiring a great lifelong accountant

366
00:17:39.797 --> 00:17:41.853
can actually save you money,

367
00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:45.795
because our money issues might be less severe

368
00:17:45.795 --> 00:17:48.701
under the tutelage or help, I should say,

369
00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:50.772
or advice of an accountant

370
00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:54.119
that can stop us from buying investments

371
00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:56.399
that contain red flags, et cetera.
