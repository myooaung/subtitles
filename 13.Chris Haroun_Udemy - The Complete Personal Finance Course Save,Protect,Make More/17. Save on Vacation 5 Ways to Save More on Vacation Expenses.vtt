<v ->Vacation expense tip number one.</v>

2
00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:14.951
Airbnb is awesome tip.

3
00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:17.102
Use Airbnb when you travel.

4
00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:18.972
I've actually saved a lot of money doing this,

5
00:00:18.972 --> 00:00:22.156
and it's so much cheaper, and it just feels authentic,

6
00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.300
and it's less institutionalized as well,

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.883
like hotels can be.

8
00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:30.807
Tip number two, book earlier than anybody tip.

9
00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:32.410
Book all flights and vacations many,

10
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.231
many, many months in advance,

11
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:37.625
and way before anybody else, as you save a fortune.

12
00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.417
And you can often cancel the bookings without penalties

13
00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:43.084
if you book way, way in advance.

14
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:48.106
And ask, as always, about the free cancellation,

15
00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:51.138
and if or when they might lower prices,

16
00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:54.222
or when they might have a sale.

17
00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:55.764
You can ask them on the phone, okay,

18
00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.256
and if they don't give you a straight answer,

19
00:00:57.256 --> 00:01:00.915
then just simply ask them what months last year

20
00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:04.915
did they have sales in, or search the web, okay.

21
00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:08.248
Vacation expense tip number three.

22
00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:10.617
Freeze account tip.

23
00:01:10.617 --> 00:01:13.169
Freeze your accounts when you go on vacation,

24
00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:15.487
or if you don't plan on using a membership

25
00:01:15.487 --> 00:01:18.727
that you have for a while, kind of like a gym membership

26
00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:22.394
or other monthly online or television plans.

27
00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:26.230
You know, companies usually agree to freeze your account

28
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.678
because they're terrified that you're going

29
00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:31.372
to cancel as a customer, okay,

30
00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:33.909
and when you call them to freeze your account,

31
00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.827
ask them for a discount when you unfreeze the accounts.

32
00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:41.525
And you know what, you lose nothing by asking,

33
00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.112
and I recommend asking for discounts annually

34
00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:46.216
from all subscriptions, right,

35
00:01:46.216 --> 00:01:48.137
and you know many are going to say no,

36
00:01:48.137 --> 00:01:50.118
but some will say yes, like cable companies

37
00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:52.159
that don't want to lose your business

38
00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.576
to places like Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube.

39
00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.395
Vacation expense tip number four.

40
00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:01.145
Kitchen cut cost tip.

41
00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:07.518
Book vacation homes or rooms in hotels with a kitchen.

42
00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:10.046
We actually do this and we shop for groceries

43
00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:13.382
when we arrive on vacation to the hotel, right.

44
00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:14.619
We obviously don't buy from the hotel,

45
00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.435
we buy from a grocery store.

46
00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.956
And food prices are ridiculously expensive on vacation,

47
00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:21.418
as you know, and if you book a hotel for a week,

48
00:02:21.418 --> 00:02:25.335
your food prices and the ridiculous resort fees

49
00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:30.088
that we never question at check out can add up big time,

50
00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:31.675
and sometimes are more than a couple of nights

51
00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:34.342
of paying for that hotel anyway.

52
00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:37.357
And you know some politician's gotta go after these hotels,

53
00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:40.627
regarding, you know, resort and other fees topic,

54
00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:43.644
as it can be so misleading at checkout time,

55
00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:46.657
but as always, read every item when you check out,

56
00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:49.152
kind of like I mentioned for restaurant receipts,

57
00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:51.680
because sometimes they overcharge you, okay.

58
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.022
Vacation expense tip number five, off season tip.

59
00:02:55.022 --> 00:02:57.815
Try to go on vacation during the off season,

60
00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:00.469
as it is, of course, much, much cheaper

61
00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.050
and there's no ridiculous stressful line ups

62
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.921
at airports as well, et cetera.
