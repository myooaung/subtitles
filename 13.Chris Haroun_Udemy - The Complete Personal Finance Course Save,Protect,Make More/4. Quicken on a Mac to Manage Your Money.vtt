- If you watched the last lecture

2
00:00:02.347 --> 00:00:05.419
on using Quicken for a PC, please skip this lecture

3
00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.544
because I'm now gonna talk about

4
00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:10.127
running Quicken on a Mac, okay?

5
00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:15.001
And I was a beta tester for Microsoft

6
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.510
and their Microsoft Money application products of the 1990s.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.401
And I've been using Quicken now

8
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.574
for more than 20 years as a customer,

9
00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:27.411
and also while I was a technology consultant at Accenture,

10
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.883
where I helped our client at the time,

11
00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:30.687
which was Nations Bank,

12
00:00:30.687 --> 00:00:32.955
which is now part of Bank of America.

13
00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:35.348
I helped B of A or Bank of America

14
00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:37.431
export bank account files

15
00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:40.747
into the Quicken format in the '90s.

16
00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:42.718
I'm dating myself, I know.

17
00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:44.460
And separately, since I'm always really,

18
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.539
really careful about your security.

19
00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.123
If you wanna manage your expenses with software,

20
00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:51.966
Quicken is the way to go.

21
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:55.294
And I think it's really, really secure

22
00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:59.256
if you use it on your computer only, okay?

23
00:00:59.256 --> 00:01:02.533
And I'll show you a demo of Quicken here.

24
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.107
But before I get there,

25
00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:07.934
I wanna talk about a higher end version of Quicken

26
00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.109
that I use and love for running my business.

27
00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:14.551
And it's called QuickBooks and it's so awesome

28
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.327
because I basically set this thing up, QuickBooks up,

29
00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.427
to do everything for me in business,

30
00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:23.127
including automatically importing all credit card

31
00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:25.010
and bank account information from various

32
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.800
bank account and credit card websites.

33
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.666
And QuickBooks also automatically pays my employees

34
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.342
and automatically sends all federal

35
00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:37.093
and state taxes to the government agencies,

36
00:01:37.093 --> 00:01:38.460
and also automatically submits

37
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.083
all payroll tax forms, et cetera.

38
00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:42.182
Then at the end of the year,

39
00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:46.885
my accountant gets a copy of my secure QuickBooks file

40
00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:49.304
and then does my taxes for me on a business level.

41
00:01:49.304 --> 00:01:50.866
And I have to stress this,

42
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.938
that I don't mind putting some business-related data

43
00:01:53.938 --> 00:01:56.920
on the internet, but just not my personal data, okay?

44
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.170
And so, anyway this is Quicken for Mac.

45
00:02:01.737 --> 00:02:05.299
And here's a demo of how to use it.

46
00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.322
It's a great product.

47
00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:10.650
I prefer to use my own Excel file,

48
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.738
like the one you're using here.

49
00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:14.797
But let me run through how this works

50
00:02:14.797 --> 00:02:16.935
and how to run it on a Mac.

51
00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:19.008
And I think you'll enjoy this.

52
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:20.759
And if you have questions, just please let me know.

53
00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.592 line:15% 
Thanks.
