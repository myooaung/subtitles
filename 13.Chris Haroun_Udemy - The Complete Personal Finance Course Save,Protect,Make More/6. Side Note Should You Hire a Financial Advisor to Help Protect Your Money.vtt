1
00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:03.221
<v ->We've talked a bit about accountants in this course</v>

2
00:00:03.221 --> 00:00:05.896
and getting an accountant to help you with your taxes.

3
00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:07.685
A financial advisor is different, though.

4
00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:09.111
A financial advisor

5
00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:11.390
makes money by charging you about 1 percent

6
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.726
of your net worth every single year, okay?

7
00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:16.744
And I know that sounds like a lot

8
00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:18.107
and it is.

9
00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:20.712
And I only recommend considering hiring a

10
00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:23.238
financial advisor if you don't have any

11
00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.511
time at all to manage your money,

12
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:27.936
or if your tax situation is so complicated

13
00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:29.849
and you have so much money,

14
00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.086
which is a high-class problem I guess,

15
00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.413
and you have so much money that a financial advisor

16
00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:35.262
can justify your justify your annual 1 percent fee

17
00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:38.263
by getting you excellent tax deductions, etc.

18
00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:39.625
Okay?

19
00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:42.463
And for most of us, hiring an accountant to do

20
00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:45.589
our taxes once per year is good enough,

21
00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.756
and it's important to have a relationship

22
00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.660
with a great accountant so you can call him every year

23
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.000
or every now and then, and

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.599
before making a big investment,

25
00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:56.661
ask him about it, and they might tell you,

26
00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:57.828
wait a second,

27
00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:01.723
put that investment in a tax shelter first

28
00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:03.510
because it's almost impossible to move something

29
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.458
into a tax shelter after you've made the investment.

30
00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:08.874
And they can also help you out by telling you

31
00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:10.610
not to do that investment.

32
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.383
Right?
They have good advice.

33
00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:16.049
Okay, so if you do decide to hire or consider

34
00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.911
hiring a financial advisor,

35
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.416
again, not an accountant, but a financial advisor,

36
00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:23.292
please ask them the following 11 questions

37
00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:26.815
before deciding to hire a financial advisor.

38
00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:29.229
And make sure you're very comfortable, please,

39
00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.300
with their responses to every single one

40
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.492
of these 11 questions, okay?

41
00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:34.325
Number 1:

42
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.758
We want to make sure that their performance

43
00:01:37.758 --> 00:01:40.580
was much better than the stock market returns

44
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.686
were in those years, which were sharply negative.

45
00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.311
Those were awful years.

46
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.096
And if the advisor was only down single digits in

47
00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:51.102
those two awful years, meaning '08 and '01,

48
00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:54.285
that's okay, as they did a relatively good job of

49
00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:57.688
preserving their clients' capital, okay?

50
00:01:57.688 --> 00:02:01.045
Question number 2 to ask a financial advisor:

51
00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:02.383
What do they charge annually?

52
00:02:02.383 --> 00:02:06.778
Again, we know it's usually about 1 percent of your assets,

53
00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:07.646
okay?

54
00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:10.953
But ask them what their real fee is,

55
00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:13.383
including transactions, okay?

56
00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:15.983
Or commission fees, okay?

57
00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:19.282
Because sometimes, they'll make you buy and sell stuff

58
00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:21.413
so they can make commissions.

59
00:02:21.413 --> 00:02:24.246
And if the commission fee is high,

60
00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:26.383
then that's an issue.

61
00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:27.216
Okay.

62
00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:28.813
Question number 3:

63
00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:30.789
This one is crucial.

64
00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.509
Please ask if they get any commissions at all

65
00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.963
on any of the financial products that they have

66
00:02:36.963 --> 00:02:39.719
ever sold to their clients, okay?

67
00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.373
And it's a bit redundant, but it's important

68
00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:42.735
to reinforce this a bit.

69
00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:46.507
If the answer is yes, then understand that they

70
00:02:46.507 --> 00:02:49.405
might be biased into making you trade more than

71
00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:51.939
you should in your account, which is not good,

72
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.522
as the fees really hurt us in the long run.

73
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.031
Okay, number 4.

74
00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:02.539
Ask if the firm that they work for makes them only

75
00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:06.347
sell financial products from that particular firm.

76
00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:08.507
And if so, this is a big issue,

77
00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:10.628
as their hands are basically tied,

78
00:03:10.628 --> 00:03:13.583
and they can only recommend one company's

79
00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:16.145
financial products, which is not ideal, okay?

80
00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:18.478
It's almost unethical, okay?

81
00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:21.197
Just know going in, okay?

82
00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:22.030
Number 5:

83
00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:26.481
Is there a redemption fee, if you decide,

84
00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:29.477
to stop using them as your financial advisor?

85
00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:30.822
And if it's above 1 percent,

86
00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:32.969
then this is an issue, of course.

87
00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:34.391
Six:

88
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.899
What percent of their net worth

89
00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.060
is in financial products that they sold or

90
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.868
recommend to their clients?

91
00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:43.434
And it should be over 50 percent of their net worth,

92
00:03:43.434 --> 00:03:45.515
not including their house.

93
00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:46.674
Number 7:

94
00:03:46.674 --> 00:03:49.712
If they manage a fund or investments,

95
00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:52.318
what percent of their net worth and the net worth of

96
00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:56.124
their parents or relatives are in that fund

97
00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:58.202
or in those investments?

98
00:03:58.202 --> 00:04:01.683
And we want this one to be above 10 percent, okay?

99
00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:05.325
And that goes for anything you sell in finance

100
00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:06.210
or buy in finance.

101
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.112
If you're a finance salesperson,

102
00:04:08.112 --> 00:04:08.945
always think to yourself,

103
00:04:08.945 --> 00:04:10.383
would I get my parents to buy this?

104
00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:11.216
And if you don't feel comfortable with that,

105
00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:14.526
then don't sell the product, okay?

106
00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:15.359
Off topic, sorry.

107
00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.212
Number 8:

108
00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:20.845
What percent of their client's net worth are liquid

109
00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:23.070
and can be redeemed immediately?

110
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.070
And we want this to be 25 percent or more, okay?

111
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.119
Number 9:

112
00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:33.667
Is there a government database that they registered at,

113
00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:34.500
if applicable, right?

114
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.920
Obviously, you Google them.

115
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.918
Or, did you find anything that makes really uncomfortable

116
00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:41.199
about them when you Googled their name?

117
00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.179
Okay, 10:

118
00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:45.133
What certifications do they have?

119
00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.214
Like a CFA or a government test that they have to take

120
00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:50.174
in your country, okay?

121
00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:52.904
In the United States there are a bunch of exams,

122
00:04:52.904 --> 00:04:54.895
the Series 3, 63, 7, etc.

123
00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:56.926
Every country's different, okay.

124
00:04:56.926 --> 00:04:58.968
And it's not crucial that they have professional

125
00:04:58.968 --> 00:05:00.801
designations, right?

126
00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:03.587
But if they must take exams in your country in order

127
00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:05.154
to be a certified financial analyst,

128
00:05:05.154 --> 00:05:08.333
make sure that they have those certifications.

129
00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:10.784
And number 11, this one's big, this is important.

130
00:05:10.784 --> 00:05:12.494
And this should go with any person you're

131
00:05:12.494 --> 00:05:15.654
about to hire, or any investment you're about to make.

132
00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:19.178
Ask them to provide you a list of 10 client names

133
00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:20.789
for you to speak with.

134
00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.417
And if they don't provide them, then that's a red flag.
