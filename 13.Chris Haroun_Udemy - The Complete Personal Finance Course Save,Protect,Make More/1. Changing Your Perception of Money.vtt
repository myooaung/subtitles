00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.805
<v ->"There are two ways to be rich: one is by acquiring much,</v>

2
00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:07.620
"and the other is by desiring little."

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.298
We need to change our perception of money.

4
00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:14.554
It's bizarre because we all want more, yet the rich person's

5
00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:17.971
almost always the bad dude in the movies.

6
00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:21.674
We actually lose friends because of money.

7
00:00:21.674 --> 00:00:23.316
I certainly have.

8
00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:27.875
We have fake friends because of it and we lose sleep over it

9
00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.465
and of course, our health suffers.

10
00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:33.233
Many of the people that I know that want to have a lot

11
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.705
of money are insecure.

12
00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:38.779
They want it for the wrong reasons.

13
00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:43.474
Many are insecure and want to show off that they have it

14
00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:46.351
and many people who live in large houses

15
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.655
are really stretching their budgets so much in order

16
00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:52.340
to show others that they have money.

17
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.026
They're never happy.

18
00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:55.242
They're never happy.

19
00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:58.849
I find that those that are wealthy and happy, which is rare,

20
00:00:58.849 --> 00:01:02.680
are those that have never cared about what other people

21
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.413
think about them.

22
00:01:04.413 --> 00:01:09.129
They choose their profession based on what they love doing

23
00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:11.629
and not for the love of money.

24
00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.030
You gotta follow your dreams and the money

25
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.114
will come accidentally.

26
00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:19.065
It's true.

27
00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:21.255
Follow the money and you'll lose your dreams,

28
00:01:21.255 --> 00:01:23.924
and maybe your money too.

29
00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:26.710
Maybe we would be less stressed out

30
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.615
in the very, very long run, about money if we changed

31
00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:32.712
our perception about money and we focus more on saving

32
00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:36.879
and more on giving it away once we accumulate a lot of it.

33
00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:41.796
You'll find that if you spend $5 on yourself,

34
00:01:42.953 --> 00:01:45.182
you actually get less joy out of spending

35
00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:48.188
that $5 on yourself than you do on spending

36
00:01:48.188 --> 00:01:50.640
it on somebody else.

37
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.457
Giving money away to charity gives you this incredible

38
00:01:53.457 --> 00:01:57.308
sense of peace in your heart, knowing that you helped

39
00:01:57.308 --> 00:01:59.933
make somebody's life better.

40
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.878
Why are we here anyway?

41
00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:03.563
What's our raison d'etre?

42
00:02:03.563 --> 00:02:05.164
What's our purpose?

43
00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:09.771
It's certainly not to accumulate a lot of stuff and wealth,

44
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:13.963
which is why I had us enter in our favorite charity

45
00:02:13.963 --> 00:02:17.046
in the setting section of the course.

46
00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:23.610
Think about how much more wealth you can give away

47
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.894
in the future if you don't spend it today.

48
00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:29.630
And you know what, we will live longer and be happier

49
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.143
if we change our perception about money.

50
00:02:32.143 --> 00:02:36.277
It's actually fun saving because it's like a game

51
00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:39.413
and you think of cool innovative ways and creative ways

52
00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:40.918
to save money.

53
00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:44.667
Saving and being cheap, within reason, is a badge of honor,

54
00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.025
in my humble opinion.

55
00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:49.420
It's an honor to give it a way and help enrich the lives

56
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.670
of those that have nothing.

57
00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:57.217
Please understand why you want money in the long run

58
00:02:57.217 --> 00:03:01.859
and if a large reason is contribution, meaning paying

59
00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.899
for scholarships for the less fortunate, in addition

60
00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:08.343
to paying to support your growing, loving family,

61
00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:11.911
then the process of accumulating money feels better.

62
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:13.836
Just know why you want it, please.

63
00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:16.816
And if it's for the wrong reasons, then I promise you

64
00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:21.295
that you will be less happy when you get more.

65
00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:24.537
Bill Gates, he seems so much happier now that he

66
00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.625
is dedicating his life to helping other people.

67
00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:28.955
God bless this guy; he's awesome.

68
00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:33.718
He seems as happy now as people that don't have much money,

69
00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:35.785
kind of like Mother Theresa was.

70
00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:37.285
God bless her.

71
00:03:37.285 --> 00:03:40.786
Or those that have some but don't care about impressing

72
00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:43.081
others that don't have it.

73
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:47.223
Friends that are not insecure are usually happier people.

74
00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:49.556
Separately, there's a saying

75
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.607
that the first generation

76
00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.278
that makes the money, the second spends it

77
00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:56.760
and the third has none.

78
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.328
First generation makes money, second spends it,

79
00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:00.021
third has none.

80
00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:02.570
The happiest of all three of those generations

81
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.911
is the first one, partially because they became wealthy

82
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:09.824
doing what they love doing and often it wasn't just

83
00:04:09.824 --> 00:04:11.994
about they money.

84
00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:15.886
Those that receive too much in terms of handouts

85
00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:19.744
or inheritance are unhappy and they often

86
00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:24.073
lose it all or accomplish much less in life.

87
00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:28.246
This is why Warren Buffet and Bill Gates will not be giving

88
00:04:28.246 --> 00:04:32.319
their kids that much relative to their net worth.

89
00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.824
They're smart.

90
00:04:33.824 --> 00:04:38.651
Our riches consist of the fewness of their wants.

91
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:42.948
It feels great to work hard and make it yourself

92
00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:47.690
because that's a philosophy of freedom and independence

93
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.023
and not material insecurity.

94
00:04:50.953 --> 00:04:52.286
I read this book

95
00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.087
by this great economist named Michael Porter.

96
00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:02.321
It's called Can Japan Compete and it's a fascinating read

97
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:07.024
on why too many governments or even parental handouts

98
00:05:07.024 --> 00:05:10.024
doesn't lead to prosperity.

99
00:05:10.024 --> 00:05:13.489
The crux of this book, actually, it's really interesting,

100
00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:17.317
is that after World War II, when the Japanese economy

101
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.734
was in trouble, what happened

102
00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:23.457
was the government in Japan,

103
00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:25.717
what they did was they gave these incentives

104
00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:29.324
to every single sub-sector within the Japanese economy

105
00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:33.256
to help revitalize growth in the '40s, '50s, '60s.

106
00:05:33.256 --> 00:05:35.787
There's actually only two sectors

107
00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:39.174
that the Japanese government did not give any money to.

108
00:05:39.174 --> 00:05:42.092
Those two sectors are the automotive sector

109
00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.180
and consumer electronics.

110
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.740
Wow!

111
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.943
That blows me away because those are

112
00:05:46.943 --> 00:05:50.854
the two most successful sectors in Japan globally.

113
00:05:50.854 --> 00:05:55.009
They make great cars and great consumer electronics as well.

114
00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.010
It just shows you that too many handouts,

115
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.472
actually it doesn't help people, it doesn't help companies,

116
00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:06.038
it doesn't help the economy at all.

117
00:06:06.038 --> 00:06:09.728
Just having a sense of purpose, making it yourself,

118
00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:10.561
is great.

119
00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:14.490
If you're helping your kids, you're actually helping

120
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.094
your kids if you make them work harder for it.

121
00:06:17.094 --> 00:06:19.179
We're going to talk a lot more about kids

122
00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:21.928
in the next lecture here.

123
00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:24.883
Making money is about independence.

124
00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:29.726
It's about the freedom to do what you want to do,

125
00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:33.226
not the freedom of wanting to show it off.

126
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:37.226
You might want to skip the rest of this lecture please,

127
00:06:37.226 --> 00:06:40.143
as I'm about to really go out there

128
00:06:41.644 --> 00:06:43.285
with what I'm about to talk about.

129
00:06:43.285 --> 00:06:45.133
So if what I've talked about in this current lecture

130
00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:46.757
doesn't resonate with you, you can skip it,

131
00:06:46.757 --> 00:06:49.232
'cause I'm really going out on a limb here.

132
00:06:49.232 --> 00:06:51.386
Okay, here we go.

133
00:06:51.386 --> 00:06:55.553
It's easier for an alcoholic to be 100% sober

134
00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:59.005
than 98% sober.

135
00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:02.957
That's extreme, but you're either all in or not

136
00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:04.842
when it comes to saving money.

137
00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:09.063
You can't be 98% committed to saving money.

138
00:07:09.063 --> 00:07:13.230
It's 100% and not 98% because those two percents,

139
00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:18.751
massive, ill thought-out impulse purchase acts by us

140
00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:21.568
can destroy our ability to build longer-term

141
00:07:21.568 --> 00:07:23.975
significant wealth.

142
00:07:23.975 --> 00:07:27.162
You don't need much money to be happy.

143
00:07:27.162 --> 00:07:28.945
Do you want an example?

144
00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:31.112
Go to a park on a weekend.

145
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.653
Look for large families hanging out together,

146
00:07:35.653 --> 00:07:40.126
having a cheap meal and I betcha they don't have much

147
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.828
but darn it, they're happy.

148
00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:46.413
Look for it and you'll know what I mean.

149
00:07:46.413 --> 00:07:49.897
They look way happier than people do in the checkout lines

150
00:07:49.897 --> 00:07:52.975
of expensive stores, after they spent a fortune

151
00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:55.083
on material possessions.

152
00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:59.359
The people we see in the park are always happier eating

153
00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:02.526
and laughing, as lower income families

154
00:08:03.976 --> 00:08:06.388
are always happier eating together

155
00:08:06.388 --> 00:08:08.313
than when we go to an expensive restaurant

156
00:08:08.313 --> 00:08:12.480
and you see how relatively unhappy more wealthy are there.

157
00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:19.703
If we care too much about what others think about us,

158
00:08:19.703 --> 00:08:23.777
then we won't save and we won't give it away as much,

159
00:08:23.777 --> 00:08:27.039
and you know, we won't make the world a better place.

160
00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.978
How much do we need to eat really, anyway?

161
00:08:29.978 --> 00:08:34.342
It goes both ways too, as we need to condition ourselves

162
00:08:34.342 --> 00:08:38.679
not to judge people based on how much wealth they have

163
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.402
or lack thereof.

164
00:08:40.402 --> 00:08:44.331
We can't treat people with more wealth than us differently

165
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:47.475
as that makes them feel really uncomfortable.

166
00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:52.180
Do you know the rich dude at work that everybody kisses

167
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.142
up to, but those people that kiss up to that person

168
00:08:55.142 --> 00:08:59.297
are not respected, especially by the rich person.

169
00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:02.778
I knew a guy who worked for George Bush Senior

170
00:09:02.778 --> 00:09:05.109
in the White House, back in the early 90s and I asked him,

171
00:09:05.109 --> 00:09:07.966
I said, what was Bush Senior's strength?

172
00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:10.484
And he said, you know what, he was great because

173
00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:12.126
he treated celebrities like people

174
00:09:12.126 --> 00:09:14.355
and people like celebrities.

175
00:09:14.355 --> 00:09:17.496
Mother Theresa, I love this woman, she once said,

176
00:09:17.496 --> 00:09:21.833
"if you judge people then you have no time to love them."

177
00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:24.058
I just love this picture so much that I've got to show

178
00:09:24.058 --> 00:09:25.391
it to you twice.

179
00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:30.690
I find that a lot of people that have university degrees

180
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.811
are insecure when it comes to them spending a lot

181
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:37.317
of money on possessions that they don't need.

182
00:09:37.317 --> 00:09:41.188
They live less fulfilled lives because the reason

183
00:09:41.188 --> 00:09:44.090
many people get advanced degrees is to be able to spend

184
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.556
more in order to remind others of how important they are.

185
00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:51.346
Don't get me wrong, I love education, I do, but I think

186
00:09:51.346 --> 00:09:54.933
we would be happier if we asked ourselves why we want

187
00:09:54.933 --> 00:09:58.621
to get degrees or why we want to spend money on certain

188
00:09:58.621 --> 00:09:59.621
items first.

189
00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:05.359
It's all about perception which ultimately leads to reality.

190
00:10:07.003 --> 00:10:09.232
We want to leave this world in a better condition than

191
00:10:09.232 --> 00:10:10.773
when we entered it.

192
00:10:10.773 --> 00:10:13.681
This is partially why we earn money.

193
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:18.211
The only time you should look in your neighbor's bowl

194
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:20.480
is to make sure they have enough.

195
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.740
You don't look in your neighbor's bowl to see if you have

196
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.073
as much as them.

197
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.918
I read this incredibly prophetic article, it was amazing,

198
00:10:30.918 --> 00:10:33.944
in the New York Times a couple years ago, that had a massive

199
00:10:33.944 --> 00:10:35.944
impact on me personally.

200
00:10:37.306 --> 00:10:39.759
It stated that many wealthy people that live

201
00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:43.914
in first world countries, are very unhappy compared

202
00:10:43.914 --> 00:10:46.164
to those that have nothing.

203
00:10:47.277 --> 00:10:49.858
I really felt the meaning of this article when one

204
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:52.936
of my clients sent me to Mumbai to give

205
00:10:52.936 --> 00:10:56.587
a few business education presentations.

206
00:10:56.587 --> 00:11:00.316
When we arrived in Mumbai, we drove through the slums

207
00:11:00.316 --> 00:11:03.538
and I had this sense of, I can't explain it, but this sense

208
00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.619
of peace and calmness in my heart as I saw

209
00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:08.619
how happy everybody was.

210
00:11:09.497 --> 00:11:11.341
Yet, they had nothing.

211
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:13.258
Imagine no possessions.

212
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.941
It's not that easy if you try.

213
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:16.774
I wonder if you can.

214
00:11:16.774 --> 00:11:19.593
Of course, I'm quoting John Lennon there.

215
00:11:19.593 --> 00:11:22.006
I actually used to work on Wall Street and everybody

216
00:11:22.006 --> 00:11:25.997
was so miserable around bonus season every December

217
00:11:25.997 --> 00:11:28.409
because they compared themselves to those

218
00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:29.891
that made more money.

219
00:11:29.891 --> 00:11:31.573
How crazy is that?

220
00:11:31.573 --> 00:11:35.153
I'm guilty of that too to be intellectually honest.

221
00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.828
This is the big problem in Western society.

222
00:11:37.828 --> 00:11:41.497
We always want more and how much can we eat?

223
00:11:41.497 --> 00:11:44.456
I read the Dalai Lama's book called The Art of Happiness,

224
00:11:44.456 --> 00:11:45.408
which is awesome.

225
00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:47.330
Read it please, the Art of Happiness.

226
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.610
The Dalai Lama, in this book, suggests that we compare

227
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.488
ourselves to those that have less only.

228
00:11:54.488 --> 00:11:58.415
He had this incredible prophetic quote which is,

229
00:11:58.415 --> 00:12:02.493
many people sacrifice their health their entire lives

230
00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:04.175
in order to make money.

231
00:12:04.175 --> 00:12:06.931
At the end of their lives, they sacrifice all their money

232
00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:10.073
in order to maintain their health.

233
00:12:10.073 --> 00:12:13.658
Then they look back on their lives and they realize

234
00:12:13.658 --> 00:12:16.923
that they never really lived to begin with.

235
00:12:16.923 --> 00:12:20.607
All your wealth can't buy you health.

236
00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:22.640
I saw a quote and a I mentioned this earlier,

237
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.296
I have to mention it again, by the time your child

238
00:12:25.296 --> 00:12:28.904
is 12, you've already spent 90% of your time that you'll

239
00:12:28.904 --> 00:12:30.077
ever spend with them.

240
00:12:30.077 --> 00:12:32.146
You'll never be able to get that time back no matter

241
00:12:32.146 --> 00:12:33.504
how much money you have.

242
00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:37.821
Sadly, when a person's possessions distracts her or him

243
00:12:37.821 --> 00:12:41.988
from their purpose, they usually end up losing both.

244
00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:47.326
If you have time, please do this optional exercise.

245
00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:50.447
Please don't think about wanting anything except

246
00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:52.614
for what you already have.

247
00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:56.767
Go on a walk, that's how I write my walks.

248
00:12:56.767 --> 00:12:58.236
I go on long walks.

249
00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:03.179
Go on a walk and write down what are at least three

250
00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:07.758
major material things you will not focus on wanting

251
00:13:07.758 --> 00:13:10.497
to have today and for the foreseeable future.

252
00:13:10.497 --> 00:13:13.188
Write down three things.

253
00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:16.358
Then later on, during your long walk, please think about

254
00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:18.275
and write down what are

255
00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:22.604
at least 10 non-material things

256
00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:24.812
that you already have in your life that you

257
00:13:24.812 --> 00:13:27.509
are incredibly grateful for.

258
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:30.281
All you need is what you have.

259
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:34.572
Now, not all of you will be interested in the next lecture

260
00:13:34.572 --> 00:13:37.668
if you don't have kids, but I think it's helpful to check

261
00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:39.169
it out anyway.

262
00:13:39.169 --> 00:13:43.035
If you don't watch the next lecture, then I really hope

263
00:13:43.035 --> 00:13:45.835
you enjoyed part one of this course and I look forward

264
00:13:45.835 --> 00:13:47.928
to seeing you in part two.

265
00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:48.761
Thank you.
