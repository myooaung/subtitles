00:00:01.631 --> 00:00:05.464
(rhythmic instrumental music)

2
00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:36.109
<v ->Welcome to the complete</v>

3
00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.886
personal finance course, and thank you.

4
00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:41.874
Please, ask me as many questions as you want to during

5
00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:44.708
and after you take this course because I am here

6
00:00:44.708 --> 00:00:48.588
24 hours a day, seven days a week forever to humbly help.

7
00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:51.260
So by the end of this course you will be armed

8
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.383
with many tools that will help you accomplish three goals.

9
00:00:55.383 --> 00:00:57.438
Number one, save more money.

10
00:00:57.438 --> 00:00:59.093
Number two, protect more money.

11
00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:01.027
And number three, make more money.

12
00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.039
So this is actually three courses in one.

13
00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.819
And there's many exercises in this course,

14
00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:09.794
most of which are in the following spreadsheet

15
00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:11.863
that is attached to this lecture,

16
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.614
which is called the complete personal finance dashboard.

17
00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:17.124 line:15% 
And it's in Excel format, of course.

18
00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:20.263 line:15% 
The purpose of every exercise in this course

19
00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:22.795 line:15% 
is to either help you save more money,

20
00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:26.256 line:15% 
protect your money, or make more money.

21
00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:29.142 line:15% 
And so this course contains no theory.

22
00:01:29.142 --> 00:01:30.970
It's actually based on my work experience,

23
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.391
as I've managed over a billion dollars in my career.

24
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:36.657
I've also worked for, met with,

25
00:01:36.657 --> 00:01:39.216
and partnered with many billionaires in my career.

26
00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:41.569
I'm certainly not one of them.

27
00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.762
And I will share their secrets,

28
00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:45.822
and their best practices with you in order

29
00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:50.030
to humbly help you save, protect, and make more money.

30
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.701
Now, before I worked on Wall Street

31
00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:54.550
at Goldman Sachs, and at a top hedge fund,

32
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.512
and in the venture capital industry,

33
00:01:57.512 --> 00:02:00.761
I used to be a programmer focused on making programs

34
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:02.794
for the financial services sector

35
00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:05.453
when I worked in tech consulting at Accenture.

36
00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:08.804
And I mention this as I created your attached

37
00:02:08.804 --> 00:02:12.444
complete personal finance dashboard Excel spreadsheet

38
00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:16.202
based on my experience working in the technology sector.

39
00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.171
Now, I was actually also a beta tester

40
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.732
for Microsoft on their financial products

41
00:02:20.732 --> 00:02:24.141
in the 1990s, I'm dating myself there.

42
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:28.093
As such, in this course I will teach you based

43
00:02:28.093 --> 00:02:31.432
on my cumulative experiences, and make it very easy

44
00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:34.803
for you to save, protect, and make more money.

45
00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:36.862
You don't need to have any experience

46
00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:41.143
with Excel or in finance at all to complete this course.

47
00:02:41.143 --> 00:02:44.223
I also want to stress that I made the concepts

48
00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:48.261
in this course generic enough, and helpful enough,

49
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:50.561
regardless of what country you live in.

50
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:52.630
This is not a US only course, okay,

51
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.989
this is meant to be used in every country in the world.

52
00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.751
And the advice is generic enough to be applied globally.

53
00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:02.912
Okay, so it's important for me to stress that,

54
00:03:02.912 --> 00:03:06.072
as I have students in 195 countries.

55
00:03:06.072 --> 00:03:10.400
Also, tax codes and finance laws change all the time,

56
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.859
but the general concept of personal finance does not.

57
00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.411
And it's similar in every single country.

58
00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:18.523
As such, this course will help

59
00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:21.344
you understand everything you need to know

60
00:03:21.344 --> 00:03:24.733
about personal finance from a high level perspective,

61
00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:27.112
regardless of what country you live in.

62
00:03:27.112 --> 00:03:29.627
The concepts of saving, protecting,

63
00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:32.653
and growing money, and compound interest,

64
00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:35.744
and minimizing expenses are universal.

65
00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:38.669
And this will be a lot of fun in this course, so you'll see.

66
00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.174
So I've worked and filed taxes,

67
00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:42.875
and set up retirement accounts,

68
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:46.436
et cetera, in several different countries.

69
00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:49.424
Now, there's well over 100 tips on how

70
00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:52.446
to save much more money in this course.

71
00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:54.305
And if you end up using just one, two,

72
00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:57.665
or three of these 100 save money tips,

73
00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:01.832
then this course has paid for itself over many, many times.

74
00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.929
Many companies, I have to stress, try to take as much money

75
00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:09.671
as they can from you through hidden fees and marketing.

76
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:13.952
And you'll be amazed at how much of your hard-earned money

77
00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.926
that you are giving up without even knowing

78
00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:18.448
about it through all these hidden fees.

79
00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:22.271
I want to make sure that this does not happen to you.

80
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:26.672
Also, everybody has a bias when it comes to money.

81
00:04:26.672 --> 00:04:30.972
Anybody on TV that you see talking about stocks has a bias

82
00:04:30.972 --> 00:04:33.810
because they want you to buy that stock.

83
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.443
Or they're a CEO of a company,

84
00:04:35.443 --> 00:04:37.889
and they're supporting their stock.

85
00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.354
So in this course, we're gonna tune out the noise and focus

86
00:04:42.354 --> 00:04:46.629
on how to save money, and also how to protect money.

87
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.617
And you'll be amazed at the power

88
00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:51.989
of compound interest, and the future value of money.

89
00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:54.858
And just how easy it is to protect your hard-earned money,

90
00:04:54.858 --> 00:04:57.970
and make it grow very, very quickly over time.

91
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.575
And in the next lecture, we're gonna discuss how to use

92
00:05:02.575 --> 00:05:06.822
your attached personal finance Excel dashboard file,

93
00:05:06.822 --> 00:05:09.004
and how we can customize this to work

94
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:13.046
in every single country in the world, if applicable.

95
00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.254
As a side note, towards the end

96
00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:19.283 line:15% 
of this course, in this section right here,

97
00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:22.397 line:15% 
I will teach you how to create and customize

98
00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:26.310 line:15% 
the Excel dashboard file included in this course.

99
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.927 line:15% 
In case you wanted to further customize it,

100
00:05:28.927 --> 00:05:32.374 line:15% 
so it can help you save, protect, and make more money.

101
00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:34.802 line:15% 
And I promise you that by the end

102
00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:38.383
of this comprehensive course you'll be much more confident

103
00:05:38.383 --> 00:05:40.888
in your abilities to save, protect, and make money.

104
00:05:40.888 --> 00:05:43.116
So thanks a lot for your commitment

105
00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:45.446
to this journey that we will take together.

106
00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:48.228
And please know, again, that I am here 24 hours a day,

107
00:05:48.228 --> 00:05:52.106
seven days a week, during and after you complete the course

108
00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:55.809
to help you save, protect, and make your money work for you.

109
00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:56.892
Let's begin.
