00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:03.251
<v ->Let's talk about fixed versus variable rates</v>

2
00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:05.061
when it comes to loans.

3
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:08.341
A fixed rate stays at the same interest rate

4
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:12.174
you got the loan at until you pay it all back.

5
00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:15.909
The interest payments are fixed.

6
00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.731
And, when it comes to getting loans,

7
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.651
you gotta read the disclosures, right,

8
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:23.981
and the fine print as variable, meaning rates change,

9
00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:26.309
variable rates can cause a lot of damage

10
00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.250
as there's often a teaser rate.

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.320
And, a teaser rate means a low rate

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.491
initially just to get you interested

13
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.159
and locked in to the loan and sign up for it.

14
00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.541
And, this variable rate can go up a heck of a lot

15
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:40.426
and destroy your credit

16
00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:43.272
and cause you a lot, I don't know, sleepless nights.

17
00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:44.105
It's bad.

18
00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:46.291
And, this is what happened to many people here

19
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.099
in the United States when they got mortgages last decade.

20
00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:54.131
And, once the teaser rates expired in a year or so

21
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:56.581
after their mortgage, then the variable rates kicked in

22
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.221
which caused the interest rate on their mortgages

23
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.471
to go up a lot.

24
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.347
And, as your mortgage payments increase unexpectedly,

25
00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:07.750
given this awful variable rate, many poor people

26
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.157
here in the United States foreclosed

27
00:01:09.157 --> 00:01:11.426
on their houses in 2008.

28
00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:13.469
It was terrible, it was awful.

29
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.678
I remember our neighbors on the left side of us

30
00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:19.549
and on the right side of us foreclosed.

31
00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.426
It was awful.

32
00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:23.327
And, there were some towns in the U.S. in California

33
00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:24.359
that were ghost towns.

34
00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.997
It was just terrible, it's awful.

35
00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:30.258
So, since the U.S. economy is about 25%

36
00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:35.256
of the global economy and since 70% of the U.S. economy

37
00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:37.901
is based on consumer spending, the entire world

38
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:41.412
was pulled into this awful recession in 2008

39
00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:42.835
because of these mortgage issues.

40
00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:44.710
And, so I'm gonna talk more about this

41
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.852
in part three of the course when we talk about investing

42
00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:50.012
in bonds, which means loans from you and me

43
00:01:50.012 --> 00:01:51.961
to governments or companies.

44
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:53.521
It'll be interesting, you'll love it.

45
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:56.222
And, a large part of the loans or mortgages

46
00:01:56.222 --> 00:01:58.881
that people have in the United States here

47
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:01.612
is from investments from foreign governments

48
00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:03.332
like China, for example.

49
00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:06.999
So, we're all connected given globalization.

50
00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:10.772
And, you'll understand why it's important

51
00:02:10.772 --> 00:02:13.910
when it comes to your net worth and investment prospects

52
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.052
when we talk about part three, investing.

53
00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:18.385
Okay, moving on.

54
00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.812
When it comes to us getting loans,

55
00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:26.172
I only advise loans for education or our homes.

56
00:02:26.172 --> 00:02:30.005
And, only do a car loan if you really have to.

57
00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:33.961
There might come a time in your life

58
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.841
when you need to get an emergency loan for whatever reason.

59
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:40.630
And, if you pay all of your bills back on time for years

60
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.940
and your credit rating is awesome as we spoke about earlier,

61
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.367
then you can get an emergency loan from a bank

62
00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:52.270
in the form of what's called a line of credit.

63
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.837
And, Christine, my wife, and I have a line of credit

64
00:02:55.837 --> 00:02:58.972
with our bank, just in case we have to pay bills

65
00:02:58.972 --> 00:03:01.388
without paying high fees, okay?

66
00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:04.641
And, we always wanna pay back on time,

67
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:06.852
'cause we know that our credit rating will get slaughtered

68
00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.430
if we don't do so.

69
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.030
So, what you can do is you can check with your bank

70
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.092
to see if you can increase your line of credit.

71
00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:18.430
And, check your bank account at least once a week

72
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.990
to make sure your balance is high enough.

73
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.292
You can even set up alerts online with your bank

74
00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:25.302
to send you an auto email.

75
00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:28.332
And, a line of credit is what people refer to

76
00:03:28.332 --> 00:03:30.761
as overdraft protection,

77
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.241
Meaning if you write a check for more than you have

78
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:35.000
in your bank account.

79
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.269
And, a line of credit is a good thing

80
00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.238
to set up as a bounced check can cost you

81
00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:43.181
at least 10 bucks if you don't have overdraft protection.

82
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.480
Now, that adds up over time.

83
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.268
Overdraft protection can be free if you ask for it too

84
00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:51.869
with some banks, you gotta ask.

85
00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.811
And, just check with your bank and ask them

86
00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:55.941
if you can increase your line of credit

87
00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:58.240
and get overdraft protection.

88
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.701
And do the same thing with your credit card limit

89
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.931
as your credit rating actually improves

90
00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:05.891
if your credit card limit increases

91
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.429
and your charges don't increase,

92
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:08.931
the amount you use your credit card with.

93
00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:11.147
Just ask them for increases, okay?

94
00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:13.315
A lot of the times they'll say yes.

95
00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:15.806
And, we're gonna discuss mortgages in the next part

96
00:04:15.806 --> 00:04:19.067
of the course as your home might be the best investment

97
00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:22.766
you will ever make as renting for just too many years

98
00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.787
can be a horrible waste of money.

99
00:04:24.787 --> 00:04:26.937
And, I rented for far too many years.

100
00:04:26.937 --> 00:04:27.854
Okay, okay.

101
00:04:28.772 --> 00:04:32.835
There's so many hidden fees in finance.

102
00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:34.976
And, if you get a loan, just make sure

103
00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:37.296
to please ask about any additional fees

104
00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:40.203
like a credit search fee or a lawyer fee

105
00:04:40.203 --> 00:04:44.605
or fees to, you know, just to complete the application.

106
00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:45.704
There's all these hidden fees.

107
00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:46.864
It's crazy.

108
00:04:46.864 --> 00:04:49.744
Right, and then after you're done asking questions

109
00:04:49.744 --> 00:04:52.616
about the loan, explain it back to the bank

110
00:04:52.616 --> 00:04:53.715
that you're getting a loan from

111
00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:57.924
and ask them if your explanation of the loan terms

112
00:04:57.924 --> 00:05:01.384
and all the fees is correct or not.

113
00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.915
And, when I used to work at a big hedge fund

114
00:05:03.915 --> 00:05:06.955
called Citadel, I can still hear my boss say it.

115
00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:07.904
He would always say to me,

116
00:05:07.904 --> 00:05:10.980
"Chris, if can't explain it, you don't understand it."
