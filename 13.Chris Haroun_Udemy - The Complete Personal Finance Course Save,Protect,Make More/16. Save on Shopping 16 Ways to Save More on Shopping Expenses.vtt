00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.699
<v ->Let's talk about shopping and saving money,</v>

2
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.699
and there's a reason why I'm wearing this jacket.

3
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.907
I'll get to that in a minute or two.

4
00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:18.738
Shopping expense tip number one,

5
00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:21.738
ask for a discount after you buy it.

6
00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.459
Keep all your receipts, and if you notice

7
00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:30.046
that an item goes on sale after you buy it,

8
00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:32.057
meaning within a month or so,

9
00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:35.675
I want you to literally bring that receipt to the store

10
00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:38.259
and ask for the same discounts.

11
00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:42.539
And this actually works most of the time with larger stores,

12
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.717
even with clothes, even if you take the tag off as well.

13
00:00:45.717 --> 00:00:47.568
And I learned this trick from my wife Christine.

14
00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:51.007
She worked in retail for years when she was in university.

15
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:51.840
You can do this.

16
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.971
Just bring the receipt in, especially for the bigger stores.

17
00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:59.371
Shopping expense tip number two, bargaining tip.

18
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.731
Please, always, always, always bargain if you can

19
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:04.800
and ask for a discount at checkout,

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.967
unless it's a very large retail chain like a Wal-Mart.

21
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.731
For the smaller companies I want you to bargain

22
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:16.509
and be a pain in the neck because if you don't,

23
00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.920
you're actually hurting your family in the long run,

24
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.598
just given the savings and compound interest.

25
00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:24.550
Just ask for a discount, ask for a discount.

26
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.440
And when you buy something and you're paying cash,

27
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.274
a lot of the times the people you're paying

28
00:01:29.274 --> 00:01:31.527
aren't gonna claim that, which is illegal,

29
00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:35.197
but they're not gonna pay the government the tax.

30
00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:37.288
They're gonna pocket the tax they charged you.

31
00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:38.557
And you know this is happening

32
00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:40.909
if you buy something at a store and you pay cash,

33
00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.267
and they don't close the cash register.

34
00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:45.997
Anyway, a little of topic there,

35
00:01:45.997 --> 00:01:46.979
but I want you to be a pain

36
00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.165
in the neck please and try to bargain.

37
00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:53.965
What I do actually if I'm gonna buy a larger number

38
00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:57.813
of items is I will tell the manager in the store

39
00:01:57.813 --> 00:02:00.504
that I'm gonna buy a large number of items,

40
00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:01.915
and I would like a discount

41
00:02:01.915 --> 00:02:05.112
at the end of the product selection process.

42
00:02:05.112 --> 00:02:08.556
And I did this recently when I bought a bike for my son,

43
00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:10.675
as I not only bought a bike for him,

44
00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:13.340
but also a helmet and a kickstand, a lock,

45
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.414
and other protective stuff for my other kids.

46
00:02:16.414 --> 00:02:19.564
And the high margin products are the smaller items

47
00:02:19.564 --> 00:02:23.084
like lights or helmets or whatever,

48
00:02:23.084 --> 00:02:26.814
and they cut the prices on those by up to 50%.

49
00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:27.647
Just ask.

50
00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.422
Worst case they can say no.

51
00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:32.635
Shopping expense tip number three,

52
00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:36.115
the best online coupon tip ever.

53
00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:37.635
I feel like a used car salesman.

54
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:39.155
But wait, there's more.

55
00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:41.446
Okay, always search for coupon codes online

56
00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:44.745
before you check out and pay for your items.

57
00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.949
Although I hate actually installing software

58
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.684
in my browser and downloading plugins,

59
00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:54.132
I actually use a coupon plugin on one of the browsers I use,

60
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:58.318
and the plugin that I use and love is called Honey,

61
00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:01.910
and I've saved hundreds of dollars annually already

62
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.093
using this Honey plugin.

63
00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:07.832
For example, here you can see that I can save

64
00:03:07.832 --> 00:03:11.332
up to 10% shopping on Intuit website.

65
00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:15.125
And Honey is a plugin that I use on Chrome,

66
00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:19.693
and I haven't found any virus issues with it yet,

67
00:03:19.693 --> 00:03:21.322
and I've researched it thoroughly

68
00:03:21.322 --> 00:03:24.354
before installing and using it.

69
00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:28.154
And here you can see that the reviews are amazing.

70
00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:31.466
And Time magazine called it free money.

71
00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:34.536
And so, here's another example.

72
00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:36.496
As of my recording here today,

73
00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:39.328
you can see that you can save a lot at Macy's.

74
00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:43.312
Actually, you can save 30% because this plugin here, Honey.

75
00:03:43.312 --> 00:03:46.889
And what happens is when you go to many websites,

76
00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.642
right when you're checking out,

77
00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:52.912
this Honey plugin pops up and says enter this code here

78
00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:55.002
to save money, or it can tell you

79
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.701
that there's a cheaper way to buy this product.

80
00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:59.131
I absolutely love it.

81
00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:02.929
Shopping expense tip number four, cash is king tip.

82
00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.198
Try leaving your credit cards at home

83
00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:07.670
and carry some cash instead

84
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.049
as you'll end up buying less stuff,

85
00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.216
and it's a hassle to walk to the bank machine anyway.

86
00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:19.000
Actually, carry cash but not large amounts,

87
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.667
and if you carry this much here,

88
00:04:23.522 --> 00:04:26.189
you might end up overspending.

89
00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.497
I gotta do this.

90
00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:28.887
This is something I've always wanted to do.

91
00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:31.137
It says there $100,000,000.

92
00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:36.687
You'll end up overspending if you have it.

93
00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:38.332
Hi, I'm dope.

94
00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:40.213
I'm trying to act cool like younger people.

95
00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:42.251
I've always wanted to do that, okay.

96
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:45.584
Anyway, sorry. (laughs)

97
00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:51.875
Shopping expense tip number five, clothes hesitation tip.

98
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.435
If you're shopping for clothes,

99
00:04:54.435 --> 00:04:58.912
and you're considering buying a clothing item,

100
00:04:58.912 --> 00:05:01.773
if you hesitate for even half a second

101
00:05:01.773 --> 00:05:05.341
and think will I wear this, then don't buy it.

102
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:08.211
Don't buy it because you'll regret wasting your money

103
00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:12.130
later when the item just collects dust in your closet.

104
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.331
Shopping expense tip number six,

105
00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:17.763
deep discount stores are awesome tip.

106
00:05:17.763 --> 00:05:20.872
Shop at the Dollar Store or Goodwill

107
00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:22.952
and take your kids with you too.

108
00:05:22.952 --> 00:05:25.792
And only buy school supplies from the Dollar Store

109
00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:29.453
if it's available where you live or a similar type store

110
00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:32.813
as the products in the store are all a buck each,

111
00:05:32.813 --> 00:05:34.483
and they're just as good,

112
00:05:34.483 --> 00:05:36.003
and you'll actually teach your kids

113
00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:38.333
a valuable lesson about money here as well.

114
00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:40.992
And I actually arrived to a meeting early recently

115
00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:41.825
as I always do.

116
00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:44.081
I always arrive way too early.

117
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:46.941
And the meeting was beside a Goodwill store,

118
00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:49.346
so I walked into the store,

119
00:05:49.346 --> 00:05:52.683
and I bought this Calvin Klein jacket here.

120
00:05:52.683 --> 00:05:54.653
See, Calvin Klein slim fit.

121
00:05:54.653 --> 00:05:57.045
I bought this for 10 bucks.

122
00:05:57.045 --> 00:05:58.241
Isn't that great?

123
00:05:58.241 --> 00:05:59.074
It's $10.

124
00:05:59.074 --> 00:06:02.312
I mean, it smells a bit like weed.

125
00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:04.131
Just kidding, sort of.

126
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.712
Dammit, now I got the munchies.

127
00:06:06.712 --> 00:06:09.712
Sorry, okay, so I'm actually gonna take my jacket

128
00:06:09.712 --> 00:06:12.970
off now 'cause it's kind of hot with all these lights here.

129
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.621
Okay, thank you Goodwill.

130
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.425
All right, I'll put this down here.

131
00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:22.192
Okay, shopping expense tip number seven,

132
00:06:22.192 --> 00:06:26.301
don't pay full price for expensive clothes tip.

133
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:28.339
You don't need to wear those brands.

134
00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.163
If you feel like you have to buy that item,

135
00:06:31.163 --> 00:06:34.081
then ask the sales rep in the store

136
00:06:34.081 --> 00:06:36.171
when that item will go on sale.

137
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:39.283
And if the sales rep says they don't know,

138
00:06:39.283 --> 00:06:42.731
then it will definitely be on sale soon or eventually.

139
00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:44.272
And you can also search the web to see

140
00:06:44.272 --> 00:06:48.411
when these retail companies have their annual sales.

141
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:51.021
So shopping tip expense number eight,

142
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:53.372
generics are cheaper tip.

143
00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:55.802
Buy generic drugs if your doctor approves

144
00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:57.911
as the ingredients are the same.

145
00:06:57.911 --> 00:06:59.842
Do this with mouthwash as well

146
00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:01.933
as other personal items as well.

147
00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:03.250
I know we talked about drugs before.

148
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.635
Let me talk about mouthwash for a second here.

149
00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:08.770
I buy the generic version of Scope mouthwash

150
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.181
as the ingredients are identical anyway,

151
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.047
and you save a fortune in the long run.

152
00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:17.591
And just remember to compare the ingredients though

153
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:19.831
and make sure the ingredients are listed

154
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:21.831
in the same order on both products

155
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:24.090
because most countries have a law.

156
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.451
They mandate that the larger ingredients

157
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:28.682
in a product have to be listed first,

158
00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:31.373
and so this video here is a video I took

159
00:07:31.373 --> 00:07:33.781
when I was shopping recently at Walgreens,

160
00:07:33.781 --> 00:07:37.489
and I compared the prices of these items.

161
00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:39.772
Shopping expense tip number nine,

162
00:07:39.772 --> 00:07:42.855
get discount cards at a discount tip.

163
00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:47.721
So try to buy discount cards for stores

164
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:50.911
that you're planning on spending a lot of money at.

165
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:53.701
Do the same thing for restaurant discount cards

166
00:07:53.701 --> 00:07:56.669
or theme park discount cards, or movie discount cards.

167
00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:58.210
My wife Christine's great at doing that.

168
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.501
She's amazing.

169
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:00.789
I learned so much from her.

170
00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:02.960
You can actually buy these discount cards

171
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.141
at Costco or other large stores.

172
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.948
And buy the discount cards deeply discounted on Ebay.

173
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.539
And so, make sure though that the person on Ebay

174
00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:15.991
that you're buying from has a good rating though,

175
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:18.181
and here's an example.

176
00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:22.581
Here's an example on Ebay of a $10 gift iTunes gift card

177
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:26.482
that is selling for about $9 with free shipping.

178
00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:29.933
Of course, make sure the person selling the item

179
00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:31.300
has great feedback rating.

180
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.533
I had to stress that again.

181
00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:36.038
And I actually buy my gym memberships at Costco,

182
00:08:36.038 --> 00:08:38.230
and Christine bought our Disneyland tickets

183
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.774
for our kids at Costco, and we saved a lot of money.

184
00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:41.864
And here's what you can do.

185
00:08:41.864 --> 00:08:44.952
You keep the receipts because you can return

186
00:08:44.952 --> 00:08:48.202
these gift cards if you don't use them.

187
00:08:49.603 --> 00:08:54.403
Shopping expense tip number 10, impulse purchasing tip.

188
00:08:54.403 --> 00:08:58.403
Never buy expensive products as impulse purchases,

189
00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.202
meaning at the last minute you go into a store.

190
00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:01.302
I wasn't planning on buying that.

191
00:09:01.302 --> 00:09:02.614
Oh, I kind of want that big speaker set.

192
00:09:02.614 --> 00:09:04.339
I gotta buy it, whatever.

193
00:09:04.339 --> 00:09:08.333
Wait seven days first and then reconsider.

194
00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:10.672
It's like a cool-off period.

195
00:09:10.672 --> 00:09:13.734
And if you still wanna make that purchase,

196
00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:16.990
then you'll likely find a better deal online,

197
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.582
or you won't make the purchase at all.

198
00:09:20.582 --> 00:09:22.163
Next up, tip number 11.

199
00:09:22.163 --> 00:09:25.414
We've got the in-store price check tip.

200
00:09:25.414 --> 00:09:27.462
Before buying anything in a store

201
00:09:27.462 --> 00:09:29.803
that is not a food-based product,

202
00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:33.104
just check on your phone for a cheaper price on Amazon,

203
00:09:33.104 --> 00:09:35.392
Wal-Mart, or other places online.

204
00:09:35.392 --> 00:09:39.950
And if you find it cheaper on the website on your phone,

205
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.176
then ask for a discount in the store.

206
00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:46.123
Retail's a tough business, and there's many apps

207
00:09:46.123 --> 00:09:48.904
that you can use for comparison shopping.

208
00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:52.223
And all you do actually is you take your phone.

209
00:09:52.223 --> 00:09:53.982
You take your phone here,

210
00:09:53.982 --> 00:09:57.243
and then you just kind of scan the image

211
00:09:57.243 --> 00:10:00.573
with the camera or the barcode,

212
00:10:00.573 --> 00:10:04.740
and your phone will tell you if it's cheaper somewhere else.

213
00:10:05.936 --> 00:10:10.103
Shopping expense tip number 12, never buy new releases tip.

214
00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.646
Don't buy products when they first come out

215
00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:16.795
like video games or hardcover books,

216
00:10:16.795 --> 00:10:20.962
as they'll be 50% off or much cheaper within six months.

217
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.068
And if you can't wait and you have to pay 60 bucks

218
00:10:26.068 --> 00:10:29.279
for a new video game, then finish it quickly

219
00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:33.239
and then sell it on Ebay for 40 bucks a month or two later.

220
00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:35.130
And don't wait to sell it though.

221
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.471
Don't wait too long as these items depreciate very quickly.

222
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.898
And you can even just rent the game for a weekend,

223
00:10:41.898 --> 00:10:44.538
and then rent it again later because your saved progress

224
00:10:44.538 --> 00:10:47.788
is already stored on your game console.

225
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.897
Shopping expense tip number 13, one-click is evil tip.

226
00:10:54.658 --> 00:10:57.049
If you have the option to do so,

227
00:10:57.049 --> 00:10:59.698
please turn off one-click shopping

228
00:10:59.698 --> 00:11:01.330
on Amazon or other websites,

229
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.730
meaning buying something immediately by pressing buttons

230
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.780
so you bypass the whole checkout process.

231
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.220
Also, and this one's kind of a pain in the neck,

232
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.925
but try to not save your credit cards online

233
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:17.998
as it'll actually slow you down from overshopping

234
00:11:17.998 --> 00:11:19.266
as you have to pull out your credit card

235
00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:22.358
and punch in all those crazy numbers.

236
00:11:22.358 --> 00:11:27.136
Shopping expense tip number 14, points add up tip.

237
00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:29.087
If you have to use a credit card,

238
00:11:29.087 --> 00:11:32.162
use one that's got award points, especially for flights.

239
00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:34.950
And a large portion of all of our family's,

240
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.033
my family's annual airplane tickets

241
00:11:37.033 --> 00:11:39.372
to visit my family in Canada are paid for

242
00:11:39.372 --> 00:11:42.039
using points on our credit card.

243
00:11:43.012 --> 00:11:45.474
Shopping expense tip number 15,

244
00:11:45.474 --> 00:11:48.057
shop when nobody else does tip.

245
00:11:49.114 --> 00:11:51.282
Buy when nobody else is buying.

246
00:11:51.282 --> 00:11:53.132
You know, like buying wrapping paper

247
00:11:53.132 --> 00:11:54.874
right after the holidays.

248
00:11:54.874 --> 00:11:59.041
And do the same thing with all products that don't expire.

249
00:12:00.473 --> 00:12:03.042
Shopping expense tip number 16,

250
00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:05.875
retail therapy is not therapeutic.

251
00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:09.801
Retail therapy doesn't work, meaning going shopping

252
00:12:09.801 --> 00:12:12.021
for items you don't need like clothes

253
00:12:12.021 --> 00:12:13.251
when you're not in the best of moods.

254
00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:14.084
And we've all been there.

255
00:12:14.084 --> 00:12:16.331
I certainly have, and you know what I mean.

256
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.713
So go to the gym instead and just lift some weights

257
00:12:19.713 --> 00:12:23.499
as the serotonin or endorphins released in your brain

258
00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:24.769
will make you feel much better,

259
00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:26.841
and it's way cheaper as well, win-win.
