00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.437
The first thing you need to do is to create an AWS account.

2
00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:11.071
You can do this by going to aws.

3
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:11.650
amazon.

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.229
com/free.

5
00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.322
You'll press the Create a new AWS account button,

6
00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:17.194
and continue through the registration process.

7
00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:19.654
Once you're done, you'll log into the console.

8
00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:25.108
In the console, you'll look through the available services for IAM,

9
00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.557
or Identity and Access Management.

10
00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:30.756
You'll click on IAM, and then navigate to the Users tab.

11
00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:35.992
In that part of the console, you'll create a new user with the Add user button.

12
00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:38.916
As I mentioned before, the serverless framework is fairly permission hungry,

13
00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:42.094
so we'll be creating a user that has admin rights.

14
00:00:42.094 --> 00:00:46.811
Importantly, you want to make this user have programmatic access to the AWS API.

15
00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:50.774
You'll also probably want to have this user have access to the console,

16
00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:54.319
so you can sign in and enable some features later.

17
00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.475
In order to go through this whole process,

18
00:00:56.475 --> 00:01:00.571
you may also have to create some groups and assign the user to the group itself.

19
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:04.013
This process is covered in more detail in my AWS Lambda course,

20
00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:06.780
You're also welcome to review the AWS documentation for

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.084
how to create a user with admin rights that has access to

22
00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:13.338
the AWS CLI and the console.

23
00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:14.600
When the user is created,

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.013
you'll copy down the access key ID and secret

25
00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:19.768
access key values that you see here.

26
00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:24.319
You'll also have to press the Show values button in order to see the secret.

27
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:33.000
Copy those values down somewhere where you can use them when you use the AWS configure command later on.
