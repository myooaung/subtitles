00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.843
Now that you have a basic understanding of the need for the

2
00:00:04.843 --> 00:00:07.404
serverless framework and the context of serverless

3
00:00:07.404 --> 00:00:09.335
applications that it falls within,

4
00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:13.385
let's take a look at what we'll be learning in this course.

5
00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:15.827
In Up and Running with the Serverless Framework on AWS,

6
00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:19.684
we'll take a look at the installation of the serverless framework,

7
00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:23.023
the application model that it uses, and the development process.

8
00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:23.303
Then,

9
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.826
we'll take a look at deploying a text notification

10
00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.124
website with a serverless HTTP API.

11
00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:32.729
In this, we'll be using plugins, APIs, and third party integrations.

12
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:37.325
Then, we'll look at scaffolding and deploying our own serverless CRUD APIs.

13
00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:40.704
Specifically, we'll look at how serverless deals with CRUD APIs,

14
00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:45.043
databases, and also how we can test and debug our applications,

15
00:00:45.043 --> 00:00:47.992
especially when they incorporate multiple parts.

16
00:00:47.992 --> 00:00:51.648
And finally, we'll take a look at what is multi-platform serverless,

17
00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:54.426
examine some of the risks that you have when you work with

18
00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:55.743
infrastructure as a service provider,

19
00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:58.959
and also see how we can build multi-platform and resilient architectures,

20
00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:04.732
as well as changing some of our code to work to be more infrastructure agnostic.

21
00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:06.766
In this course, we'll be building out a few examples,

22
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:10.901
centering around our fake company, The Woof Garden LLC.

23
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:14.530
For this, we'll have a few different course scenarios that we'll use.

24
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.338
Sometimes we'll be building out services for the company,

25
00:01:17.338 --> 00:01:20.778
or be building out technical components of things that they might use.

26
00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:23.380
We also might be building internal tools that they

27
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.114
can leverage to do different tasks.

28
00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:27.975
So don't be surprised if you see several images of

29
00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:29.406
my pets throughout the course.

30
00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:30.373
As a quick reminder,

31
00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:32.066
while the serverless framework works with many

32
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.308
languages and infrastructure providers,

33
00:01:33.308 --> 00:01:37.122
in this course we'll be exclusively using it with Node.

34
00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:38.478
js on AWS.

35
00:01:38.478 --> 00:01:45.000
Now let's take a quick look at the projects we'll be building with these two in subsequent modules.
