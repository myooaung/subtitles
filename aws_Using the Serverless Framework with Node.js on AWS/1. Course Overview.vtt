Hi everyone.

2
00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.558
My name is Fernando Medina Corey, and I'm a Pluralsight author.

3
00:00:09.558 --> 00:00:13.299
Welcome to my course on Using the Serverless Framework with Node.

4
00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:14.319
js on AWS.

5
00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:14.926
In this course,

6
00:00:14.926 --> 00:00:16.951
we're going to learn how to use the world's leading

7
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:20.852
framework for serverless development, the serverless framework.

8
00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:22.992
Some of the major topics that we'll cover in this course include

9
00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:25.152
the serverless framework's application model,

10
00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:29.401
developing and deploying our own applications on AWS using the framework,

11
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:32.276
how we can build highly scalable event-driven services,

12
00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:35.442
and how we could create resilient fault-tolerant

13
00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:38.718
application architectures using the framework.

14
00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:40.241
By the end of this course,

15
00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.395
you'll know all the fundamental concepts you'll need to work

16
00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:44.202
with the framework and have practiced each of them by

17
00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:47.278
creating your own serverless services, full stack applications,

18
00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:48.505
and CRUD APIs.

19
00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:52.495
Before beginning the course, you should be somewhat familiar with JavaScript,

20
00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:55.336
HTML, and the command-line, though all the commands,

21
00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:58.854
code, and installation instructions will be provided for you during the course.

22
00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:01.707
You may also want to take my Introduction to AWS Lambda

23
00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:04.986
course here on Pluralsight to get a more fundamental

24
00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:06.653
understanding of serverless applications.

25
00:01:06.653 --> 00:01:08.615
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about

26
00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:11.610
serverless application development with my course on using

27
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.000
the serverless framework with Node. js on AWS here at Pluralsight.
