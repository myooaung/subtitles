00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.010
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.900
So we want to be able to change both dice images when we click on any one of the buttons. In order to
2

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.690
do this,
3

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:16.700
we need both the rightDiceNumber and the leftDiceNumber to update when we click on any one of these
4

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.520
flat buttons.
5

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:27.290
The simple solution is to generate a new number for our leftDiceNumber and rightDiceNumber whenever
6

7
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.430
any of these buttons are pressed.
7

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.320
All we need to do is simply copy the behavior that we have for the rightDiceNumber over here, and we'll
8

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.590
copy that line of code for the leftDiceNumber down here.
9

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.900
So now whenever either of the buttons are pressed, we update the leftDiceNumber to a new random number.
10

11
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.440
We update the rightDiceNumber into a new random number, and we call set state on that to update the
11

12
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.940
image on both of these places.
12

13
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.440
Now when set state gets called, it sees that leftDiceNumber is used here
13

14
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.360
and rightDiceNumber is used here.
14

15
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.270
And it will redraw both of these images.
15

16
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.640
So let's give that a go.
16

17
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.850
Let's hit save.
17

18
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.400
And now when I click on the left side, the right side also changes. When I click on the right side, the
18

19
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.440
left side also changes.
19

20
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.070
Perfect.
20

21
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.570
That's exactly what we wanted. Now in this last challenge for Dicee,
21

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.290
I want you to use what you learned about functions or what you already know about functions, to remove
22

23
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.570
all of our repeated code because you can see we've got a lot of code that looks the same,
23

24
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.700
right?
24

25
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.820
How can you remove that and put it into a function so that you call the function instead when the buttons
25

26
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.790
get pressed?
26

27
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.690
So we don't have all of this code that looks identical to each other.
27

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.230
Pause the video and I'll share the solution with you in the next lesson.
