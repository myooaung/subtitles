00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.000
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.610
So now that you've built and tested the 'I Am Rich' app on a emulator or a simulator, it's time to try
2

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.010
and run it on a physical device.
3

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.860
So, if you have a physical Android device and you would like to test your app on it, then follow along
4

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.690
with this lesson.
5

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.560
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
6

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
Now if you don't have an Android device, you can skip ahead to the next lesson where we show you how
7

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.390
to test your app on a physical iOS device.
8

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.680
All right.
9

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.060
So there's quite a few steps that are involved in order to successfully be able to connect our Android
10

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.890
device with the computer.
11

12
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.650
And I'm going to walk you through them step by step.
12

13
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.000
And it's really important that you do them in the order that we're showing you here.
13

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.870
So the first step is you're going to go into your phone, and you're going to enable developer mode.
14

15
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.420
So you're going to go into your Settings, and go on to About, and you're going to somehow locate something
15

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.870
called your Build number.
16

17
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.170
Now, on this HTC device that I'm showing you right here, it's under About, and then it's inside Software
17

18
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.070
information.
18

19
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.910
And then we have to go into More, in order to discover this thing called Build number.
19

20
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.850
Now once you've discovered Build number, then you have to start tapping on it. And you're going to get
20

21
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.440
a popup that tells you how many steps you are away from being a developer.
21

22
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.520
So keep tapping.
22

23
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.220
You have to tap a total of seven times before you get to join the secret club of Android developers.
23

24
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.130
And now when you head back to the main settings, you'll get a new secret menu appear which is Developer
24

25
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.190
options.
25

26
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.500
And here, you have to make sure that USB debugging is enabled and click OK
26

27
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.790
when it prompts you.
27

28
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.740
Now once you enable USB debugging, this will allow your phone to be able to communicate with your computer.
28

29
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.300
Depending on your phone make and the operating system, the version of Android that you're running,
29

30
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.450
you might see a different user interface.
30

31
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.560
So the Build number might be located, for example in this other Nexus device I've got here,
31

32
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.750
you'll find the build number under Settings and under System and About. And it's here where it says about
32

33
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.310
phone, that you can locate the Build number, which is the place that you have to tap on.
33

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.160
So you might have to hunt around a little bit for this thing called Build number.
34

35
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.390
But you can also have a quick google and find out for your version of your Android operating system
35

36
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.280
and for your phone, where you can locate this Build number.
36

37
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.130
And once you found it, tap it seven times to enable Developer mode, and then you'll be able to enable
37

38
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.310
USB debugging.
38

39
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.200
It's a bit of a treasure hunt if you will.
39

40
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.400
Now, once you've successfully enabled USB debugging, then the next thing is to connect your phone to your
40

41
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.640
computer with a USB.
41

42
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:04.040
And strangely, this is one of the most common downfalls for students who are trying to test their device.
42

43
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.650
Because, not all USB cables are equal.
43

44
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.350
And some USB cables will only transfer power and not data.
44

45
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.570
But of course, we need both power and data to be transferred.
45

46
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.030
So ideally try and find the original cable that came with your phone. If not, make sure you've got a proper
46

47
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.590
cable made by somebody decent.
47

48
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.990
Now, once you've connected your phone with USB, what you should see on your phone is a prompt.
48

49
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.190
So head over to your phone and take a look at the screen, and see if you have this popup asking you
49

50
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.420
whether if you want to trust this computer.
50

51
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.150
Now it's really important here that you check the box where it says always allow from this computer.
51

52
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.720
So you don't have to deal with this popup every time you want to run your app. And then go ahead and
52

53
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.930
click OK.
53

54
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.480
So now, you've trusted this computer to receive data from it into your phone
54

55
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.700
and we're finally ready to actually run the app from Android Studio. So here on the right, I've got my
55

56
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.790
physical device showing,
56

57
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.710
and here is my Android Studio.
57

58
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.700
And you can see that after completing all of those steps successfully, I can actually see my device listed
58

59
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.730
in this list of drop downs.
59

60
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.490
And it's now ready to receive my app.
60

61
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.990
So go ahead and make sure it's selected,
61

62
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.280
then click on the play button.
62

63
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:44.600
And now the app's been built, and it's now going to show the app on my HTC One physical device.
63

64
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.950
And there it is. Success.
64

65
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:55.430
We've managed to get our app loaded onto a physical device and showing on our phone. So if you're using
65

66
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.760
a Google phone such as a Nexus or a Pixel,
66

67
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.330
this usually is a pretty straightforward task. But if you're using a phone from a not a well-known make,
67

68
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.440
then we've seen students encounter a lot of problems along the way.
68

69
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:16.370
So if it is not working for you, and even after going through all those steps that I mentioned, step by
69

70
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.690
step, and you still don't see your phone show up right here, then head over to the court resources under
70

71
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:30.740
this module, you'll see a link to a troubleshooting document. Where we've listed some of the things that
71

72
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.110
could go wrong and ways of solving it.
72

73
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.400
But hopefully for everybody else,
73

74
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.400
this should now be working.
74

75
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.640
And if you have a computer that's maybe a little bit older and running the emulator is extremely slow,
75

76
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.120
then you might want to consider simply running the apps onto your physical device every time.
76

77
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.300
Because now your app doesn't require the computer and all it has to do is to send the package of code
77

78
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.080
to your phone and your phone can use its resources to render the app.
78

79
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.030
So that's another tip.
79

80
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:11.010
Now on the next lesson, we're going to show you how to run your app onto a physical iPhone device.
80

81
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.090
So if you want to be able to do that, then head over to the next lesson.
81

82
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.220
Otherwise, you can skip ahead and continue to build our next app.
