00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.990
All right so we've been building up to this moment for the entire module now.
1

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.210
But finally we're ready to talk about Firebase.
2

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.110
Consider our messaging app. When a user types a message into the app and they hit send, that message has
3

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.840
to be saved somewhere on a database somewhere.
4

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.200
So that later on when another user looks at the same chat, they'll be able to see that message show up.
5

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.840
They're essentially getting that data out of the database.
6

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.010
Now in terms of the database, we have two options.
7

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.540
We can either save data locally onto a user's phone or we could put that data into the cloud and save
8

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.400
it onto the Internet.
9

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.090
This is where Firebase comes in. Firebase is going to make it super easy for us to be able to save our
10

11
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.290
message data and our user details in the cloud by using their pre-built methods and classes.
11

12
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.350
Now that's only one of the things that you can do with Firebase.
12

13
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.900
There's actually a whole bunch of things that you can do including hosting your website or using ML
13

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.120
Kit or A/B split testing.
14

15
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.900
But also we're going to be using it to authenticate our users so that users can sign up to our service
15

16
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.890
with their email and password and they'll be able to log back in at a later date using that.
16

17
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.490
And we're going to use Firebase to manage our users details. So once you already, head over to firebase
17

18
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.520
.google.com and take a look through the documentation and see all the things that it can help
18

19
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.490
you with.
19

20
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.050
Now in our module, we're going to be mostly concerned with cloud Firestore which is the latest way of using
20

21
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.620
Firebase to store data in the cloud.
21

22
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.300
We're also going to be using the authentication package so that we can log in and register our users.
22

23
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.610
But first of all, you have to log in using your Google account and then head over to the Firebase  console.
23

24
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.940
And here you're going to add a new project to your firebase console.
24

25
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.780
Now the project name I'm going to call Flash chat and we'll leave the project ID and locations as it
25

26
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.790
is but you can uncheck this box if you don't want to share your data with Google and Firebase. Finally
26

27
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.630
check to agree to the terms and we're ready to go.
27

28
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.890
So in this page it allows you to choose if you want to give data for certain aspects.
28

29
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.930
And I'm simply going to leave them all unchecked and go ahead and click Create project.
29

30
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.170
Now this usually takes about five to 10 seconds and once it's done we can click on the continue button.
30

31
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.160
And now we're ready to start adding Firebase to our app.
