00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.740
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.200
So it's time for a brand new module.
2

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.900
And in this module we're going to be building a beautiful weather app.
3

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.160
And in the process, we're going to learn about how to get the GPS location of the phone,
4

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.350
be it iOS or Android.
5

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.800
We're going to learn how we can network and make API calls to grab a live data from the Internet.
6

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.120
And we're also going to learn about futures and asynchronous Dart programming.
7

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
So there's a lot of fun stuff that's coming up.
8

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.240
And by the end of the module, we're going to have a beautiful app to show for all of our hard work.
9

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.160
It's going to not only be able to grab us the weather for our current location, but we'll also be have
10

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.220
to type in any city that we want the weather for and it will be able to bring us the weather just like
11

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.780
magic.
12

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.460
But it's not magic, it's programming.
13

14
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.840
So once you already head over to the next lesson and we're going to get started building it out.
