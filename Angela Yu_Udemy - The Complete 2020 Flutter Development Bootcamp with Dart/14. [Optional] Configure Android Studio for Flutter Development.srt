0
1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,740
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,600
So now that you finally installed all the software, it's time to configure Android Studio so that we
2

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,620
have the optimal experience when we're developing Flutter apps.
3

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,900
So first things first.
4

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,160
Go ahead and startup Android Studio, and you should see this
5

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,480
welcome screen here.
6

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,700
And we're going to click on Start a new Flutter project, and we're just going to select the default Flutter
7

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,230
application.
8

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,050
We're going to leave the project name as the default name, flutter_app, or you can rename it
9

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:32,980
to whatever you wish.
10

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,250
This is just going to be a demo.
11

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,010
We're just going to use this as a blank canvas.
12

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,590
Then if you want to change the place where you want to create your project,
13

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:47,410
so currently by default, it's created under a folder called Android Studio projects.
14

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,420
Now if you want to change that, then go ahead and click on that little icon, and you can select whichever
15

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,360
folder you want to create your project in.
16

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,630
Now I'm going to leave mine as the default.
17

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,770
I'm going to leave the description and then we're just going to click next, and then it's going to ask
18

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,170
you for a company domain.
19

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,770
So that means that if you have a company website, for example, ours is appbrewery.co, then go ahead and
20

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,300
just type that in there.
21

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,780
Now if you don't have a company, then just change this to your name.
22

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:24,070
So it could be angelayu.com. As long as this entire line can uniquely identify your app on the
23

24
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,810
App Store, then that's fine.
24

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,080
So I'm going to change that back to our company domain and then we're going to go ahead and click finish
25

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,300
and you're going to leave everything else as it is.
26

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,450
We'll talk about the different options a little bit later on.
27

28
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,230
For now, we just want to get set up and configure our Android Studio. Now the first thing we're going
28

29
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,750
to configure, is the appearance of Android Studio.
29

30
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,910
So especially if you're not used to working with Android Studio, there's a couple of things that I would
30

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,190
recommend to change to its appearance.
31

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,060
And the first thing is that the default appearance is this kind of white background.
32

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,260
And I don't know about you but I tend to find it easier to have a little bit more contrast in the code
33

34
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,800
so I can read the text with less effort.
34

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,430
And so we're going to change the theme to have a dark background. And to do that on a Mac,
35

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,550
you would go to Android Studio and click on preferences. And if you're want Windows, you're going to go
36

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:27,940
to file and you going to click on settings. And both of these things will take you to the same destination
37

38
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,710
which is the preferences window.
38

39
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,000
And over here if you select on appearance and behavior, and then click on that drop down and go to appearance,
39

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,640
you can change the theme.
40

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,760
So we're going to change a theme from light to dark which is also called Darcula in Android Studio.
41

42
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,010
And if you go ahead and click apply, you can see the changes applied everywhere.
42

43
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,390
So basically you have this dark menu system and dark windows.
43

44
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,810
Now if you're running Andrew studio on a Mac, and you're running an operating system that is Mac OS Mojave
44

45
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,090
or later, then you can also select this little tick box, that allows you to have dark window headers
45

46
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,530
as well.
46

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,170
So everything becomes black, essentially. Which is quite nice, because it means that all the text is a lot
47

48
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,250
more contrasty.
48

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,730
And I like to code at night a lot,
49

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,590
so it really really helps my eyes.
50

51
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,750
Now the next thing we gonna do to help our eyes a little bit while we're coding, is we're going to change
51

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:33,100
the font size and to do that, we're going to go into the editor and we're going to click on the drop down
52

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,940
list and go to font. Now here,
53

54
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,850
you want to change the font size to around 18.
54

55
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,980
And this just means that the text is just a little bit larger.
55

56
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,300
And after a little while coding, your eyes will start to get tired and it just makes it that much
56

57
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,350
easier.
57

58
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,410
And feel free to fiddle around with the appearance as much as you like.
58

59
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,910
But these are two things that I find really helpful.
59

60
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,880
Now the next thing we'll do, is we're going to set up some of the behavior of Android Studio, especially
60

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,120
relating to the Flutter plugin again.
61

62
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,810
Bring up your preferences pane however you do it.
62

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,340
If you scroll down to languages and frameworks and expand that, you'll see that we've got the settings
63

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,620
for Dart and Flutter.
64

65
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:26,220
Now these are here because we installed the Flutter and Dart plugins when we installed Android Studio.
65

66
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,390
Now there's just a few things I want you to check while you're here.
66

67
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:38,520
Make sure that the checkbox for Perform hot reload on save, is checked, and also, make sure that under
67

68
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,920
the general section, that Format code on save, is also checked. And then you can go ahead and click OK.
68

69
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,410
So this just means that every single time we hit save either through file and then clicking on save
69

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,630
all, or as you can see over here, we have a little shortcut which is on Mac, COMMAND + S, which just does
70

71
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,320
the saving.
71

72
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:09,760
And when we hit COMMAND + S, it will just reload our app and reformat our code. So that means that if I messed
72

73
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:17,230
up a lot of my tabbing, or a lot of my indentation, or I haven't really been paying attention to how neatly
73

74
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,760
I've been formatting my code,
74

75
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:26,650
as soon as I go ahead and click save, then Flutter will go ahead and reformat everything for me to make
75

76
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,910
it look pretty.
76

77
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,850
But more importantly make it easier to see what's actually going on in the code. Now that we're done
77

78
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,660
with the behavior of the Flutter plugin in Android Studio,
78

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,170
the final thing we're gonna configure is the key mapping. And the key map is simply just a really good
79

80
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:50,020
way of binding shortcuts on the keyboard to anything you use frequently.
80

81
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,990
Now most of people will have personal preferences as regarding key mapping, and you'll have to monitor
81

82
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:02,140
what are the things that you use very frequently, and to try and save time or just make it easier for
82

83
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,170
yourselves by binding a keystroke to it.
83

84
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,210
So pretty much anything that you see in the menus.
84

85
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:17,380
So for example if I wanted to go ahead and create a new flutter project, I would go to File, New, New Flutter
85

86
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,040
project.
86

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,400
Now I kind of took a while right?
87

88
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,880
What if I could simply have a shortcut that does that.
88

89
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:31,750
Well you can. If you go into again the preferences window, and go into key map then we can go ahead and
89

90
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,330
change the key bindings.
90

91
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,970
Now the easiest way is to simply search for what it is that you want to bind a key to.
91

92
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:47,320
So I want to make a shortcut for new Flutter project, and it's usually a good bet just typing in what
92

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,390
it is that you see in the menu,
93

94
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,660
the exact words and it should come up. So you can see here that in the main menu, when I go to file,
94

95
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,480
New, New Flutter project, there's actually no keys bound to this particular action.
95

96
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,990
So let's go ahead and right click on that, and then click on Add keyboard shortcut. And now we're
96

97
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,370
going to use our keyboard to type in the shortcut that I want.
97

98
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:19,390
Now if I wanted to, for example, use COMMAND + F to bind this shortcut to this action of creating a new
98

99
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,590
Flutter project,
99

100
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,680
so on Windows that would be CONTROL + F, and on Mac that's COMMAND + F. But you can see that I get a little
100

101
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:34,150
warning here, and it says that this keystroke, COMMAND + F is already assigned to find, and we know that from
101

102
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,020
using the computer, COMMAND + F or CONTROL + F pretty much everywhere is find.
102

103
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,780
So I don't recommend changing this behavior inside Android Studio.
103

104
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,060
It usually makes it very very confusing.
104

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,060
So try to come up with a keystroke that is not bound to something already.
105

106
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,830
So let's go ahead and change this.
106

107
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,070
So let's just click on this box and type in a new shortcut.
107

108
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,140
So I'm gonna go for a COMMAND + SHIFT + F, and you can see, I no longer get a warning because this shortcut
108

109
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,770
isn't used for anything else.
109

110
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:10,270
So I'm gonna set it to mean that I can create a new flatter project when I hold down SHIFT COMMAND and
110

111
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,110
F. So let's go ahead and click OK.
111

112
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,640
And you can see that added in here.
112

113
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:24,310
And now when I click apply and OK, and I hold down COMMAND SHIFT and F, you can see I create a new Flutter
113

114
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,030
project.
114

115
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,730
So as you go along using Android Studio and developing, you'll come across things that you do very very
115

116
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:37,750
frequently. And it's in those moments that you go into the key map and add shortcuts as you need.
116

117
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,060
So I'm going to leave that customization to you, sometime down the line when you find yourself wanting
117

118
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,370
some shortcuts.
118

119
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,140
And the final thing to mention on the key map is that whenever you go for something in the menu, say
119

120
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,710
for example I want to create a new Flutter project or I want to create a new Dart file,
120

121
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,680
you can see the key bindings that already exist for it.
121

122
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,710
And if there's nothing next to it then that means it's completely blank and you can set up your own
122

123
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,130
version. When you see a menu item that you often use,
123

124
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,780
you can simply just learn the existing shortcut for it, or you can override it and bind your own shortcut.
124

125
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,150
It's completely up to you.
125

126
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,320
And this really is more about your convenience and your preferences rather than any sort of hard and
126

127
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,540
fast rule.
127

128
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,840
That's all we need to do in order to configure Android Studio before we can get started.
128

129
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:38,170
Now you'll notice that Android Studio has a lot of tiny buttons and a lot of functionality and it's
129

130
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,600
a really really powerful editor.
130

131
