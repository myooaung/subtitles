All right guys.
1

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,800
Welcome back to a brand new module.
2

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,810
And in this module we're going to be building a to do list app called Todoey.
3

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,730
It's going to help us
4

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,790
and in the process of building it, we're going to learn all about state management.
5

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,090
Now this is what our app will look like.
6

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,810
It's gonna be pretty simple but I think it's got a pretty beautiful interface and it's going to allow
7

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:32,800
us to add new tasks, to check off tasks, as well as to delete tasks from our To Do list.
8

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,270
And in the process, we're going to be exploring what state is and how we use it in Flutter. And then we're
9

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:46,180
going to be looking at various ways of managing state as well as organizing the architecture of our
10

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,880
app.
11

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,790
So we're going to be looking at set state and stateful  widgets which we've already seen and we've
12

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,440
come to love.
13

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,230
But now in this module, we're going to take it one step further so that we'll know how to manage state
14

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,210
for more complex apps through the use of callbacks by learning about how to lift state up as well as
15

16
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:14,200
learning about the provider package, which is what the Google Flutter team recommends us to use when
16

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,280
we're thinking about state management.
17

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,900
And if you're wondering, "What is state and why do we have to manage it and exactly how do we do it?"
18

19
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,890
Well all of those questions will be answered very shortly in this module.
19

20
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,940
So once you already head over to the next lesson and let's get started.
