00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,200
All right.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,140
Welcome to a new module.
2

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:09,330
And in this module, we're going to be making a beautiful BMI calculator.
3

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,140
And in the process, we're going to learn all about how to customize Flutter widgets so that it will look
4

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:23,440
the way that we want it to, and be able to implement our custom user interface designs. And by the end
5

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,670
of the module, we will have something that looks like this. A beautiful app that has custom components
6

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:38,530
and styling, and it's going to help you calculate your BMI or your body mass index. The actual functionality
7

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,700
of the app is incredibly simple.
8

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,370
It's just a few lines of code.
9

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,860
But the important thing is we're going to learn how to not just use the widgets that come out of the
10

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:55,210
box that are made by the Flutter team, but we're also going to be building up and creating our very own
11

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,550
custom widgets. Now,
12

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,480
the design here is inspired by something I came across on Dribbble, which if you don't know about, it it's
13

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:11,070
a fantastic resource to get inspired by designs all created by some of the world's top designers. And
14

15
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,520
you can see these incredibly innovative and beautiful user interfaces that you could think about implementing.
15

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,780
And going through some of these websites, looking at what people are creating,
16

17
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,130
it really makes you want to step out of the box and go beyond what Apple or material design provides
17

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,850
you with, and to start experimenting and creating your own designs and your own branding and your own
18

19
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,620
look and feel for your apps.
19

20
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,750
And I'm going to show you in this module just how easy it is to do this using Flutter and Dart. So we're going
20

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,740
to be implementing the design from ribbon vaults.
21

22
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,570
And it looks really clean really beautiful and we're going to be doing our best to try and mimic the
22

23
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,680
look and feel that we see here. Once you are ready, head over to the next lesson and download the skeleton
23

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,870
project so we can get started right away.
