00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.780
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.650
Are you ready for your boss level challenge?
2

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.380
This is going to be the first one, and in this challenge you're going to be building an app by yourself.
3

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.090
But here's what it does,
4

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.950
it's a Magic 8 Ball app, which you can ask to answer all of your difficult life questions, such as should
5

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.410
I work or should I watch Netflix?
6

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.230
Okay. So it says I have no idea for that question.
7

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.190
But think about all of your other life questions.
8

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.990
This app has a whole bunch of random images.
9

10
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.580
And every time you tap on the Magic 8 Ball, it'll give you a new answer.
10

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.330
Now you'll find these starting files including all of the images that you'll need to create this app
11

12
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.450
ready for you in the course resources.
12

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.720
And once you are ready, get started building it and test out to see if you've understood everything that
13

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.700
we've covered so far.
14

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.750
Good luck on your journey.
15

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.280
And I'll see you on the next module.
