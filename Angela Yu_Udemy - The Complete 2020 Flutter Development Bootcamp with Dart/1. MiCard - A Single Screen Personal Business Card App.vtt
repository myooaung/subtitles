00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.750
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.290
So in the last lesson, we learned about how to create our very own Flutter app, completely from scratch.
2

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.630
And we built an 'I Am Rich' and 'I Am Poor' app.
3

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.860
But it is a module, we're going to take it much further.
4

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.310
We're going to learn how to design your app's user interface using Flutter's layout widgets. And by the
5

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.580
end of the module, you will have built a beautiful business card app, that has all of your contact details
6

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.940
on it, and you can get people to download it so that they'll have all your details on their phone.
7

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.140
It's a really simple app in terms of functionality, but by building it we're going to learn a lot about
8

9
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.680
how to layout user interface elements, onscreen, using various Flutter layout widgets. So once you're ready,
9

10
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:52.650
head over to this URL, github.com/londonappbrewery/mi_card_flutter
10

11
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.950
Now, of course, there's gonna be a link to this in the course resources, so you can also click on that
11

12
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.670
link.
12

13
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.130
Now, once you're here, you'll discover the skeleton project for this coming module. And it includes things
13

14
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:10.310
such as the app icons and images and resources that you'll need to be able to complete this module.
14

15
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.600
So, we're gonna go ahead and clone it onto your local system, by clicking on this green button 'Clone or
15

16
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.280
download' and then you're gonna click on this button to copy the URL of this repository. Now once you've
16

17
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.830
copied that, you're going to open up Android Studio, and on the welcome screen, you're going to click on
17

18
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.430
'Check out
18

19
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.120
project from Version Control'. And you're gonna select 'Git' as the provider. Now, where it says URL,
19

20
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.900
you're going to paste in that repository URL that you copied just now. And in the second part, where
20

21
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.580
it says directory, it's asking you, 'Where do you want this product to be cloned?'
21

22
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:57.170
So imagine that this process of cloning a repository being the same as say if I had emailed you a copy
22

23
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.330
of the starter project. And you had downloaded it, and you decided where to put it on your computer.
23

24
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.360
And this is effectively exactly the same thing, but it's so much more efficient. So choose where you want
24

25
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.220
your project to be saved. You can of course click on this little icon to change, that if you wanted to
25

26
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.830
save it onto your desktop or wherever.
26

27
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.250
Now once you're ready, go ahead and click on clone, for it to download that starter file, and put it onto
27

28
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.590
your computer.
28

29
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.270
Now at this point, you might get a popup that ask you whether if you want Android Studio to create a
29

30
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.790
project for you based on the files that you just downloaded, and you're going to select
30

31
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.570
No.
31

32
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.090
Instead, we're going to open up an existing Android Studio project. So we're going to click on that button,
32

33
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.620
and you're going to navigate to where you had cloned that previous project, mi_card_flutter.
33

34
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.660
So remember in my case, I put it into a folder called Android Studio project, and that's where I see it
34

35
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.120
now.
35

36
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.000
If you change that destination to your desktop or wherever maybe, that is also where you're going to
36

37
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.910
locate this particular project.
37

38
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.610
Now select on the folder that contains all of your project files, such as your lib, your iOS, your Android,
38

39
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.270
and then go ahead and click 'open'. An Android Studio is gonna do some magic behind the scenes, to open
39

40
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.160
up this project as a Flutter project.
40

41
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.790
Now, the first thing you see when you open it up, is a whole bunch of errors from Dart Analysis says, 'I
41

42
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.780
don't know about this, I don't know about that.'
42

43
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.020
And the reason is because before we do anything, we have to get our dependencies.
43

44
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.180
So remember that all Flutter project relies on a lot of the libraries and code from the Flutter team.
44

45
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.760
So if we click on get dependencies, that will download and get everything that we need in order for our
45

46
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.720
project to be setup.
46

47
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:55.100
So now we are all ready. We have no errors, no warnings and everything is all good to go.
47

48
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:03.140
So that was the entire process of taking a starter file, that I've created, and getting it downloaded
48

49
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:12.660
and set up on your local system. Now GitHub is one of the largest repositories for open source code.
49

50
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.980
So if you need some inspiration, and you wanted to see how other people's code look, you can go ahead
50

51
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.150
and just search for other Flutter projects. Say, just put in the word 'Flutter', and you can see that there's
51

52
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.810
25,000 repositories or 25,000 places where you can find other people's Flutter projects.
52

53
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.370
And if you scroll down this, you'll find really cool apps
53

54
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.650
other people have built. For example, 'The History of Everything' that was demoed at the Flutter conference
54

55
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.940
last year, where you can see all the animations, and timelines, and all sorts of crazy things that people
55

56
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.100
have generated using Flutter.
56

57
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.070
So, whenever you come across something that you quite like to see the code for, or you want to run it
57

58
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.260
locally, then you're going to go through that same process that we went through just now.
58

59
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.370
We're going to be doing it frequently when I give you starting files, with all the resources prepackaged.
59

60
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.220
So you're going to get used to this pretty soon.
60

61
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.070
Now back to Android Studio.
61

62
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.620
So we've set up our starting file, and we are ready to go. If you want to just check and confirm, then just
62

63
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.560
go ahead and run it on a device or simulator, just to make sure that everything works.
63

64
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.020
And once you're ready, head over to the next lesson where we're going to get started talking hot reload
64

65
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.910
and hot restart.
