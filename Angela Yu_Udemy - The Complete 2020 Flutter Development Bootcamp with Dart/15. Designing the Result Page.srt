0
1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,990
All right. So most of our input page is now complete and all of the components now work on this page
1

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,800
as expected.
2

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,520
Now there's just a couple of styling things to tidy up.
3

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,060
For example at the bottom here, we've got this calculate button and ideally we'd like to maybe format
4

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,820
that text to make it look a little bit better.
5

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,180
So let's go ahead and add a style to this.
6

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,940
And of course we're going to create it as a constant in here.
7

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:35,490
So I'm going to create a new const called kLargeButtonText style or you could call it anything
8

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,270
you like.
9

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,790
And it's going to be a text style widget.
10

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,890
And I'm going to set the font size as probably 25 and the font weight as bold.
11

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,920
And now I'm going to apply this constant to my text here.
12

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,190
So k It was LargeButtonText.
13

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,770
All right let's check that out.
14

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,340
So that looks a lot better.
15

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:13,710
And now all I need is to center my text into that container so that it's right in the middle here rather
16

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,230
than all the way to the left.
17

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,740
Now there's just one last thing which is our calculate text widget is just a little bit too close to
18

19
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,410
the bottom.
19

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,380
It would be nice, especially on an iPhone where we know that this is an interactive area,
20

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,960
it would be nice to bring that word up a little bit so that the user target area is a little bit higher
21

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,820
so they don't accidentally quit the app.
22

23
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:44,290
So in order to do that, we can add a little bit of padding to our container. And we're going to add some
23

24
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,200
padding that only adds it to the bottom.
24

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,830
And I'm going to put 20 pixels of padding here.
25

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,520
So now when I hit save, you can see it pushes it right up so that it's actually properly within the safe
26

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,720
area.
27

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,020
And that's pretty much our input page complete now.
28

29
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:08,260
So we're ready to move on to the next page in our application which is the result page.
29

30
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:13,270
So that's what we're going to be doing mostly in this lesson and we're going to be building it out so
30

31
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:20,350
that it can look like the one that we have in our demo here, where we have a card and we have the results
31

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,310
and we have another button to head back so that we can recalculate our result as necessary.
32

33
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,910
We've already created a result page that looks really really simple. And we can get to it to look at
33

34
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,860
it by clicking on the calculate button.
34

35
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,630
So we don't actually really need this text in the middle.
35

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,060
That was just to make sure that we can tell that this is the second screen.
36

37
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,790
But what we do need are all of the components that's going to make up this page.
37

38
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,740
So let's go ahead and build it out.
38

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,490
Firstly it's going to be a top-to-bottom vertical layout.
39

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:01,600
So I'm going to add my column as usual, and my column is going to be spaced out evenly.
40

41
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,540
So I'm going to go for a space evenly for my main axis alignment.
41

42
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,990
And if you forgot about what that does, just hit CONTROL + J or CONTROL  +
42

43
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:19,000
Q On Windows and it tells you exactly what it is that this particular selection will do.
43

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,960
Now we're ready to add our children to our column. And the first child is going to be an expanded widget
44

45
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:35,650
which is going to contain just a container. And our container is going to have a child that is a little
45

46
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,050
bit of text.
46

47
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,270
The text is just going to say the words 'Your Result'.
47

48
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,410
So if we hit save we can see that it just shows up as a little bit of body text.
48

49
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,050
So we're going to need to style it up a little bit.
49

50
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:56,980
Now while I'm going along creating the entire user interface for the second page, all that I'm doing is
50

51
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,350
just following along with the design that I'm seeing on this page. Although I've simplified it a little
51

52
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,810
bit so that we don't spend ages adding loads of little components, I still kept most of the design
52

53
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,010
consistent with what we see here.
53

54
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,210
Now if you want to simply create this design all by yourself then feel free to just use this screen
54

55
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,680
as your guide to create the design from scratch by yourself.
55

56
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,900
But if you want to follow along with me, then I'm gonna quickly style it out so that we have the same
56

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,000
code and we stay consistent with each other.
57

58
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,990
So now that I've added my text, I want to add a little bit of style. And when I'm adding a style, it's
58

59
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,240
easier to simply just add it to my constants because I might want to use it a little bit later on.
59

60
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,570
So let's add a little bit of style for that title.
60

61
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:54,490
So I'm going to add a const kTitleTextStyle and this is going to be a text style widget. And the
61

62
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:05,840
font size I'm going to set to quite large, maybe a 50 and then the font weight is going to be bold. All
62

63
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,000
right.
63

64
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:15,670
So now I can use this kTitleTextStyle  in my result page as long as I import the constants file.
64

65
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,700
So let's go ahead and add that in.
65

66
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,050
All right.
66

67
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:28,690
So now that I've added this we can check it out and it should look a lot bigger like this. Let's go ahead
67

68
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,930
and add our next widget inside our column.
68

69
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,930
So after the expanded widget, I'm going to add another expanded widget but this one is going to be a
69

70
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,830
lot larger.
70

71
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:45,550
I want it to take up more space in this column so that it takes up maybe five times as much as this one
71

72
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,020
or this one.
72

73
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,390
And in order to do that, I'm going to use the flex property.
73

74
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,670
So by default all expanded widgets get a flex of 1,
74

75
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,800
so they're laid out evenly.
75

76
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:05,140
But in this case I'm going to give this one a flex of 5, so that it takes up more space. And the child
76

77
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:11,050
that's going to be in this expanded widget is going to be a reusable card widget which we can only get
77

78
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,220
access to if we import the reusable card widget.
78

79
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,450
So we're only adding in the files that we actually need.
79

80
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,810
So let's create our reusable card
80

81
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,830
and it has color as a required property.
81

82
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,220
So I'm going to put in the constant that's the active card color.
82

83
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,850
Let's check that out and make sure that it's taking up as much space as we want it to.
83

84
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,530
So at the moment this is taking up 1 times the available space on the screen,
84

85
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,110
and this is going to take up five times the height of this one.
85

86
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,080
Now I'm ready to add a card child to my reusable card.
86

87
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,210
And this is going to contain another column.
87

88
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,350
So it's gonna be a column inside a column.
88

89
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,450
And in this column, we have a main axis that is going to be again spaced evenly.
89

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:06,970
And we're also going to add a cross alignment that is going to center everything in the horizontal axis.
90

91
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,060
And then we're ready to add our children which is going to be some text widgets.
91

92
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,140
So the first text widget is going to be the result of the BMI, so we'll say overweight, normal or underweight.
92

93
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,880
And then the second text widget is going to be the actual reading rounded to one decimal place.
93

94
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,490
And finally we have an interpretation for their weight so that the user can actually understand what
94

95
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,430
this BMI means.
95

96
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,320
Let's go ahead and add our first text widget which is simply going to be a result.
96

97
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:46,560
So I'm gonna start out with just the string of maybe normal over here. And then we're gonna give it a
97

98
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,060
style which is going to be relatively large and I'm going to call it resultTextStyle.
98

99
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:03,500
So this is going to be a green color as I've picked it out from this particular design.
99

100
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,890
So the color is going to be a custom hex code and it's going to be 0xFF, so fully opaque and then
100

101
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:22,270
24D876. And you can see that it shows up as a nice bright limy me sort of green.
101

102
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:29,620
Now I've got my color down, I'm going to add some font size. Let's keep it about 22, should do.
102

103
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,910
And then the font weight is going to be again bold.
103

104
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,700
Forgot to add the k here
104

105
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,380
so let's just change that to kResultTextStyle.
105

106
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,620
All right.
106

107
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,900
So now we can go ahead and apply this to our results page right here.
107

108
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,650
So it's going to be the kResultTextStyle.
108

109
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,500
Let's check that out.
109

110
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:55,910
All right.
110

111
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,390
So it's looking pretty good. But our card is now shrunken to a very small size.
111

112
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,560
So if we want to stretch it out, all we have to do is add a cross axis alignment property and make it
112

113
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,900
stretch across the screen.
113

114
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,920
So now our card will take up as much width as it possibly can.
114

115
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,190
And in the center we've got that normal interpretation.
115

116
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:26,210
So this is the first text widget and the second one is going to be the actual BMI reading,
116

117
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:34,360
so it's going to be another text widget inside the column. And let's start this one out with a , I don't know, 
117

118
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,530
18.3 or whatever number comes to your mind.
118

119
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,080
And it's going to be as a string rather than as a number because that's what we need inside the text
119

120
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,260
widget. And then we're going to style this one up as well,
120

121
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,800
and it's gonna go at the bottom here.
121

122
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:59,350
So this is going to be the kBMITextStyle and this is going to be quite large.
122

123
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:08,410
So we're going to change the font size to maybe about 100 just to make it super large and also change
123

124
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:17,960
the font weight to bold as well, just so that it has the biggest emphasis on the screen. So that's the
124

125
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:24,520
kBMITextStyle. And you can see it's absolutely massive.
125

126
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,060
You can't miss that when you head over to the screen.
126

127
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,610
Now all we need is the final text widget which is going to be the interpretation.
127

128
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:41,810
And in this case I'm just gonna write a little bit of 'Your BMI result is quite low.
128

129
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,520
You should eat more'.
129

130
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,520
And we're of course going to style this up as well.
130

131
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,830
So let's add a k
131

132
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,880
BodyTextStyle
132

133
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:06,320
and this is going to be a slightly smaller style so the font size is gonna be about 22 and we're not
133

134
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:16,570
gonna change anything else about it. So let's go ahead and add the KBodyTextStyle and if we hit save
134

135
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,570
right now, you can see that by default all text is aligned to the left.
135

136
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,670
So if we wanted to change the text alignment we have to do that inside the text widget.
136

137
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:36,390
So we'll check the text align and we'll will make it centered. And this way it goes right in the middle
137

138
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,180
so that it looks more consistent with our design. Now the final thing that we need is that button at
138

139
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,790
the bottom here telling the user that they can recalculate their BMI result if they think that they
139

140
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,740
inputted something wrong.
140

141
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,830
This is going to be exactly the same as the button that we had earlier which is the calculate button.
141

142
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,920
So instead of creating it from scratch again, let's go ahead and select the widget that we want to extract
142

143
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,250
and go into our Flutter outline
143

144
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,980
and it's also highlighted over here and you can see it the last one in our tree in our column.
144

145
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,480
So let's right click on it and extract our widget.
145

146
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,460
I'm simply going to call it the bottom button.
146

147
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,830
You can call anything else you like.
147

148
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,510
And we're going to click refactor.
148

149
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,290
So now it takes our bottom button out and we can delete that new keyword if it pops up for you.
149

150
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,490
If it doesn't, then it means the Flutter team updated the tooling and it's no longer using the earlier
150

151
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,180
version of Dart.
151

152
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,190
So the latest version Dart there is no new.
152

153
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:45,890
And then we're going to delete the the constructor for our bottom button and we're going to set it up
153

154
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:54,290
with a custom onTap and some custom text because these are the parts that will differ between the first
154

155
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,540
page and the second.
155

156
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,670
So let's go ahead and add some properties in here.
156

157
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,440
So we've got a final function that's going to be called onTap,
157

158
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,560
and we're also going to have a final string that's going to be the buttonTitle.
158

159
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:16,850
So now we can create our custom constructor which is going to be bottomButton
159

160
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:26,240
and this is going to take two inputs and both of them should be required because it's a button.
160

161
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,230
It probably needs some text and it probably needs to handle a tap.
161

162
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:38,710
So this.onTap and also add required this.buttonTitle.
162

163
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:46,660
Now we can go into our gesture detector and I'm going to simply cut out all of this because I'm going
163

164
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,400
to need it a little bit later on. And instead I'm going to use the onTap that gets passed in to the
164

165
00:13:52,460 --> 00:14:00,040
bottomButton. And I'm also going to use the text that's passed in from the buttonTitle.
165

166
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,530
Now this is completely refactored.
166

167
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,370
We can go into here and add those properties in.
167

168
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:13,600
So we've got our button title which is going to be the word CALCULATE in all caps, and then we're going
168

169
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,790
to have onTap which is where I'm going to paste in everything that I had from before.
169

170
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:26,800
So it's that callback which pushes the next screen, which is the result page, onto the navigation stack.
170

171
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:34,230
And if you find it helpful, you can add some commas so that Dart will reformat it properly for you.
171

172
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,250
So now I'm going to take all of this out of my input page. And let's create a new Dart file and we'll
172

173
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:50,860
call it bottom_button and now I'm going to be have to paste in that entire class.
173

174
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,840
So let's add that into here.
174

175
00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:01,930
And again import our material package so that everything works and also import our constants so that
175

176
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,680
we know what these colors and sizes and styles are.
176

177
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,190
And while I'm at it, I might as well separate out my round icon button as well just in case I need it
177

178
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,190
somewhere else too.
178

179
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,720
Doesn't make sense to keep it inside the input page and hold on to it there.
179

180
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:27,750
So let's create our round_icon_button and here I'm going to cut this out and paste it into this new
180

181
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,090
file.
181

182
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,190
Now we can again import our material package and that's all we need.
182

183
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:46,230
Now I can go into my import page and import the bottom_button.dart so that it knows what the bottom
183

184
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:55,530
button is, and also import my round_icon_button.dart file so that it knows what the round buttons
184

185
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:55,710
are.
185

186
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:03,210
So we have no more errors in this page and this entire page is now dedicated to the user interface and
186

187
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,770
the functionality of the inputs screen in our app.
187

188
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:14,070
If you want you can actually quite easily add a folder to organize your lib because as you can imagine,
188

189
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,510
as you create more custom components and more screens it can get a little bit messy. So you can go into
189

190
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:30,150
file, new and we can select new directory. And we can call this maybe components, and we can also create
190

191
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:36,800
a new one that is going to hold on to our screens so we'll call this one screens.
191

192
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:44,700
And now we can move our input page and our result page into screens and make sure that you keep the
192

193
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,320
search for references checked so that everything gets moved along correctly.
193

194
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,530
And we're also going to move our components,
194

195
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,890
so the bottom button, the icon content, the reusable card and round icon button into our components
195

196
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,300
folder just so that everything looks a lot neater.
196

197
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,290
We've got components,
197

198
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,990
we've got our screens but we've also got some errors. And the errors are because it no longer can see
198

199
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,320
constants in the same folder
199

200
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:12,640
right?
200

201
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:20,280
Whereas previously, the bottom_button.dart and the constants, they were all inside the same folder.
201

202
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,890
Now it's actually at a different level.
202

203
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,420
So all you have to do is delete that and retype it.
203

204
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:34,200
So start out with constants and we can search for it and we'll be able to find it inside our package
204

205
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,390
bmi_calculator/constants and now all your errors will go away.
205

206
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:46,530
So let's go ahead and copy this and replace it everywhere where there's an error for finding the constants
206

207
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,200
file and even in our screens we've got also the same issue up here.
207

208
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,010
We've got our icon content that is now moved inside the components folder,
208

209
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,650
the reusable card that's been moved
209

210
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,770
so we have to restructure all of these
210

211
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:12,560
and also do the same for all of the other places where we're using components.
211

212
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,790
So now we no longer have any errors with our imports and all our code will work just fine.
212

213
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,430
So the final one is our results page.
213

214
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:31,740
So let's go ahead and add the location of our constants and also our reusable card.
214

215
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,340
All right.
215

216
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:39,390
So now that we've refactored and tidied everything up, it's now time to actually add in that final component
216

217
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,740
into our column here.
217

218
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,980
So after that last expanded widget, we're going to add that bottom button.
218

219
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:53,100
So again we have to import that bottom button that's inside our components folder, and we'll be able
219

220
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,820
to use it down here to add a bottom button widget.
220

221
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:05,370
And we're going to add a button title which is going to say RE-CALCULATE.
221

222
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,600
So a little bit different
222

223
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:14,830
so it indicates that we go back. And then we're going to have a onTap which is going to have a callback.
223

224
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:22,590
Now when the user taps on this bottom button, what we want to happen is to pop off this second screen,
224

225
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:30,080
this result screen, and go back to this previous screen so that they can add new inputs and recalculate.
225

226
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:36,690
So as we saw earlier when we learned about navigation and route, it's really really simple to destroy
226

227
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,560
and pop off the screen that's at the very top.
227

228
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,270
All we need to do is write Navigator.pop and pass in the current context.
228

229
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,730
So now if we hit save and we calculate our BMI, we click on recalculate,
229

230
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:57,780
we can go back to the input screen. The very last thing that we're going to do is simply to just tweak
230

231
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,780
this top text widget just so that it comes down a little bit closer to the card and have a little bit
231

232
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,640
of margin from the left.
232

233
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:13,980
So let's go into that container widget and let's go ahead and add some padding, maybe around 15 of padding
233

234
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:22,700
so that it comes away a little bit from the top and the left. And then I'm also going to add some alignment
234

235
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,910
just so that it goes down a little bit maybe down to the bottom left.
235

236
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,300
So now let's hit save.
236

237
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:36,970
And now it looks a lot more coherent. It's closer to the card and further away from the top and it looks
237

238
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,460
like it's all grouped nicely together.
238

239
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:46,420
Now that we have pretty much all of our design done both for the input page as well as for the result
239

240
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:52,960
page, there's only one thing that's missing and that's some actual functionality. The actual ability to
240

241
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,260
calculate the BMI.
241

242
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,580
So for all of that and more, I see on the next lesson.
