00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,070
All right. So in this lesson, we're going to show you how to install and set up Android Studio for Flutter
1

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,940
and Dart.
2

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,360
So if you have Android Studio already installed, be sure that you updated to the latest version and follow
3

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,400
along with the rest of this video lesson because we're going to show you how to add the Flutter and
4

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,350
Dart packages to Android Studio.
5

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,090
Now if you don't have Android Studio installed, be sure to click on the link in the Flutter installation
6

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,740
instructions and go ahead and click on Download Android Studio. And once it's downloaded, simply go ahead
7

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,730
and install Android Studio onto your Windows machine.
8

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,240
Now once you've installed Android Studio,
9

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,270
be sure to go through the Android Studio setup wizard.
10

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,600
This installs the latest Android SDK, Android SDK platform tools, and Android SDK build tools which are
11

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,890
going to be required by Flutter when it's building your Android app.
12

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,890
Now it's kind of strange that you download a software and then you have to download some more stuff.
13

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,100
But this is how Android Studio works and you'll start to get used to it.
14

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,680
But once you're done, then you should be able to open up Android Studio and you'll see the welcome screen
15

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:20,000
like this. And you're gonna go to configure and go to settings, and we're gonna go to the plugin tab.
16

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:27,260
Now in order to install Flutter and Dart plugins, you're going to go over to browse repositories, and
17

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,080
you're going to search for Flutter.
18

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,780
And it should be the one that has simply just the name Flutter in it and you're gonna go ahead and click
19

20
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:44,350
on install. And be sure to accept any popups that come up. Now when you install the Flutter plugin.
20

21
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,990
It's also going to install the Dart plugin together. So you can go ahead and click yes for that pop
21

22
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,160
up too. Now,
22

23
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:59,160
once it's done, you have to restart Android Studio for the effects to take place. So be sure to click
23

24
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:07,460
restart when it prompts you to restart Android Studio and activate the changes in our plugins. And now
24

25
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,910
once that's done, you'll be at to see a new menu item in the welcome screen where it says to start a
25

26
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,560
new Flutter project.
26

27
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,550
So if you can see this in the welcome screen then consider this lesson successful. You're now set up to
27

28
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,180
use Flutter and Dart to develop Flutter apps for Android.
28

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,950
So in the next lesson, I'm going to show you how to setup the Android emulator and build a new Flutter
29

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,900
project to run it and test it out.
30

31
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,690
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
