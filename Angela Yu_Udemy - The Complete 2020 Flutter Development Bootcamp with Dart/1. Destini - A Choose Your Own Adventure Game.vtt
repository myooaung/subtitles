All right.
1

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.590
So in the past few modules, we've covered quite a few new Dart concepts. So it's time to solidify what
2

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.290
you've learned by completing your second boss challenge.
3

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.120
And in this challenge, we're going to be building an app called Destini. And the app is a choose-your
4

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.690
-own-adventure game like Bandersnatch. Choose-your-own-adventure games were quite popular in the 80s and
5

6
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.640
they used to take on a book format where you would read part of the story and then you would decide
6

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.350
what would happen next
7

8
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.110
by choosing a path to go down. And Bandersnatch,
8

9
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.970
the recent episode of Black Mirror, showed this in a modern format.
9

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.240
Basically you would have a story that was shown in a video format, and then you could choose one of two
10

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.880
choices and depending on your choice, the rest the story would change and unfold depending on that choice.
11

12
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.330
Our app is going to be somewhere in between the book and the modern TV version.
12

13
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.960
It's going to be an app.
13

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.330
And here, there will be a story and after each story there'll be two choices. And depending on which choice
14

15
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.250
the user would choose, the story would unfold in different ways.
15

16
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.070
And we're going to map out this storyline and also let the user play this as a game.
16

17
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.360
So if you've come across these choose-yourownadventure games on the App Store, for example one of my
17

18
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.530
favorite is Lifeline, which is a space themed story,
18

19
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.300
but there's loads more out there. In order to complete this challenge,
19

20
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.720
we've set a whole bunch of to-dos for you inside a starting file.
20

21
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.310
So in the coming lessons, I'm going to be guiding you through how to download the starting file, how to
21

22
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:52.220
go through the to-dos one by one checking them off and building out this final app. In the coming lessons,
22

23
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.590
I'm going to be guiding you step by step through how to go through each of these to-dos in all of the
23

24
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.430
different files in this project. And we're going to be building out our entire app through a series of
24

25
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310
29 steps.
25

26
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.580
So once you're ready you've loaded up on coffee, head over to the next lesson and get started.
26

27
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.420
I wish you all the best of luck and I'll see you on the other side.
