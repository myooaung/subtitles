00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,040
Before we get started installing Flutter, let's first go through what it is that you'll need in order
1

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,890
to be able to work with Flutter and also run your apps on iOS and Android.
2

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,200
Now, first things first, you're going to need a computer of some sort, to be able to develop for Flutter
3

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,960
and it can either be Windows or Mac.
4

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,060
It doesn't really matter at this stage.
5

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,530
In order to create Flutter apps, you can do it on both platforms.
6

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:32,830
The next step of being able to develop Flutter apps requires us having some sort of code editor to be
7

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,340
able to create Dart code so that we can build Flutter apps.
8

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:43,360
And, the two contenders that you should consider are Android Studio and VS Code and they're both pretty
9

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,420
capable in terms of developing for Flutter.
10

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,840
Now personal preferences aside, we're going to be using Android Studio for this course. And there's many
11

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,390
reasons including it makes it easier to work with the emulator,
12

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:03,580
it allows us to upgrade to Android X or Jetpack really easily, and down the line, even if you're using
13

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,180
VS code,
14

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,820
there will be places where you'll need to use Android Studio anyways.
15

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,360
So we might as well commit to one platform and the one that we've chosen is Android Studio.
16

17
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:20,170
Now if you have a preference for VS Code, you can use it for this course but just be aware that when
17

18
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,300
we're using certain specialized tools that have been developed for Android Studio, you might have to
18

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,330
have a quick google and see what the equivalent is for VS Code.
19

20
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,590
Now outside of Android Studio, IntelliJ and VS code, I wouldn't recommend using any other type of
20

21
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,980
code editor. And it's because we really do need a fully powered IDE to be able to hint and suggest code
21

22
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:48,310
to us, to be able to do code completion, and to be able to work seamlessly with our emulators, simulators
22

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,090
and running our apps on devices.
23

24
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,340
Now the next thing is testing our apps.
24

25
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,480
So when we create a Flutter app, we can build it either as an Android app or as an iOS app. And as a
25

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,780
Windows or a Mac user, you'll find it incredibly easy to run the Android counterpart of your Flutter
26

27
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:15,680
app. All you need is either a physical device running Android or a emulator which I'm going to shortly
27

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,430
show you how to download and how to setup, and that is a pretend version of a Android phone that's going
28

29
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,770
to run on your computer and both work just as well for the purposes of this course.
29

30
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,850
Now on the other hand, if you want to test the iOS counterpart of your Flutter app, things get a little
30

31
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,280
bit more tricky.
31

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,450
Now traditionally, Apple has always been very sandbox.
32

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,080
So in order to develop an app and run it, either on a physical iPhone device or on an iOS simulator,
33

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,060
you will need a Mac.
34

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,700
And this is the part that's quite difficult to get around.
35

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,480
The reason being that Apple has something called Code Signing and this is done for security reasons,
36

37
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,330
so that when people download or sideload an app onto their iPhone, that there isn't something malicious
37

38
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:13,760
on them. And every app that gets deployed onto a device requires a certificate issued by Apple and to
38

39
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,470
issue that certificate,
39

40
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,830
you're going to need a Mac of some sort.
40

41
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,880
Now what about the simulator, because similar to an Android emulator, it's also just a computer program
41

42
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,270
that runs on your laptop or your desktop and it simulates a real iPhone device.
42

43
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:39,250
Now in this case, you're not loading it onto a physical device so you won't need a certificate for it.
43

44
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,740
But the iOS simulator is a program that will only run on a Mac.
44

45
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,550
So basically, you'll find that in order to work with the iOS app to be able to test it, to be able to
45

46
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:55,670
build it, and to be able to put it onto the iOS App Store, you will make your life infinitely easier by
46

47
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,800
simply getting a either a second hand Mac if you don't have one or you might just have to borrow it
47

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,800
from a friend for a couple of days while you do your testing and while you upload your app to the App
48

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,560
Store. Because for the most part we're going to be doing our development using Flutter and that is platform
49

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,080
agnostic, so we can do that on Windows or on Mac and it doesn't matter. But it's the testing on iOS part
50

51
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,170
that's the tricky part.
51

52
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,760
Now Flutter has created some tools to make this a little bit easier.
52

53
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:32,440
So for example here, you can see that I'm running an app on the Android emulator on the right here and
53

54
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:39,820
inside the Flutter Inspector, there's a platform that toggles the rendering to switch from Android to
54

55
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:46,720
iOS and you can see that this top bar changes in appearance to show you roughly what it would look
55

56
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,240
like if this was being run on iOS.
56

57
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,600
And this is great while you're testing and you don't want to have both a simulator and an emulator up
57

58
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,930
or both an iPhone and Android phone running the app at the same time.
58

59
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:06,040
So this is a really neat trick that you'll surely find useful if you're working on Windows with an Android
59

60
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,940
emulator. Now there's also tools like Codemagic, which allow you to use continuous integration, build,
60

61
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,670
test and deliver your Flutter apps straight to the App Store.
61

62
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:24,830
But again, I wouldn't recommend building an iOS app without ever having tested it on a real iOS device.
62

63
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:30,740
Even if you need to borrow one or get a secondhand one, it's worth doing just to ensure that you get
63

64
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,030
the best user experience and you've tested the app fully before you put it onto the app store.
64

65
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,480
So, as a summary in order to develop Android apps with Flutter, you can use a Mac or a PC. You'll need to
65

66
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,790
download Android Studio and you're gonna need an android emulator or a physical device. In order to build
66

67
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,350
iOS apps with Flutter,
67

68
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,640
I recommend that you have a Mac that you can work with.
68

69
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,740
And again we're going to be using Android Studio and you'll need an iOS simulator or a physical device
69

70
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,380
to be able to test your iOS apps.
70

71
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:09,020
Now in the coming lessons, we're going to be showing you step by step guidance on how to install Flutter,
71

72
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:15,340
install Android Studio and set everything up to ensure that you're ready to get started with development.
72

73
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,930
So once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and choose your track based on which system you're
73

74
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,370
running, Mac or PC.
