00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.590
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.700
So we you mentioned in the lesson, it's now time for a challenge.
2

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.800
And in this challenge, I want you to use what you've learned about using packages from the Flutter packages
3

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.240
website and incorporating them into our quiz app.
4

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.220
The package that we're going to be interested in is this thing called RFlutter Alert. And what it does
5

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.600
is it's a super simple way of adding in alerts, basic ones or even really fancy ones.
6

7
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.750
And it can be implemented just in a single line
7

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.470
if we're just after the basic alert. And that's exactly what we want in this case. We want to be able
8

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.440
to show the user that they've reached the end of the quiz and just show them the alert to tell them
9

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.990
that this is the end, and then we're going to reset the question banked and then go back to the beginning
10

11
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.610
of the quiz.
11

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.780
So in this lesson, you will be able to download the starting file for this challenge and it's got everything
12

13
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.320
that we've done so far.
13

14
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.730
But it just means that we're all on the same page.
14

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.430
But more importantly, I've added in a whole bunch of to dos in here so that you can go into the to-do
15

16
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.480
pane, and you should be able to follow each of the to-dos step by step. So you can see that we currently
16

17
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.040
have six to-dos in our project.
17

18
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.280
And if you expand all of the places where they exist, you'll see them laid out like this.
18

19
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.300
Now if you go ahead and start on step 1 and just double click on the to-do, it will take you to the file
19

20
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.080
and the location of where that to-do needs to happen.
20

21
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.860
So whenever you see one of these, go ahead and select the to-do line, delete it,
21

22
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.070
and this is where we want you to create the code and solve the challenge.
22

23
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.620
So the first few steps are quite easy
23

24
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.670
and then it gets a little bit harder later on.
24

25
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.570
But once you've completed all of the steps in the challenge, you should be able to run the app and we
25

26
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.640
should continue as we did before.
26

27
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.790
So we go through all the questions and we accumulate our scorekeeper and then once we get to the end,
27

28
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.760
the last question, once we've answered this question, we should get a popup that tells us that we've
28

29
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.180
finished the quiz and we've reached the end.
29

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.260
And then if you click on the cross or the cancel button, it should take you back to the beginning of
30

31
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.930
the quiz and empty out the score keeper.
31

32
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.360
So that's the goal.
32

33
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.940
And there's just a couple of tips that I want to talk about before you get started.
33

34
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.310
Firstly is that some of the to-dos are quite long.
34

35
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.970
So if they're going all the way to the end and you're having to scroll around to be able to see it,
35

36
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.710
a quick tip is just to right click in the gutter here, and click on a soft-wrap either all files or current
36

37
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.650
file just so that we get this little arrow and instead of it being on one line, it comes down and shows
37

38
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.230
it to you all on many lines and you can see all of it all in one go.
38

39
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.150
That just makes it a little bit easier for you.
39

40
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.070
And once you've completed the challenge and you're happy with what you've done, then you can also check
40

41
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.720
out the solution which I will add to the next lesson.
41

42
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.640
But I really recommend having a good go at the challenge and knocking out those to-dos step by step.
42

43
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.780
And I hope it will be fun.
43

44
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.980
So once you really, get started by downloading the starting project.
