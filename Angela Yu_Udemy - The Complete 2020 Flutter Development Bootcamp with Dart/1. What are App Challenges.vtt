00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.180
Now that we've built our very first app using Flutter, it's already time for a challenge.
1

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.460
Now it's really important that we challenge ourselves through this entire process, because it's only
2

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.410
through struggle do we actually learn. Now the way that we structure our tutorials
3

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.690
is kind of like, a slope.
4

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.540
So imagine you're hiking up a hill.
5

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.300
It's kind of the same thing, right?
6

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.850
The second app will be a little bit harder than the first one,
7

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.700
and the third one will be a little bit harder than the second one.
8

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.190
Now the curriculum for the course is designed so that the apps build on each other. Then the knowledge
9

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.850
that you learn gets tested and reused and repeated, as you go on throughout the course but also as you
10

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.950
pick up new skills and new techniques.
11

12
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.850
Now it's really important that you've made sure that you actually understand what is the main point
12

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.650
that we're trying to get across in each of these modules.
13

14
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.320
And in order to do this, in the course you'll find a number of challenges.
14

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.130
And in this first challenge, I want you to solidify what you've learned in the last module. The 'I Am Rich'
15

16
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.900
module, where we built an app from scratch, and we added an app bar, we customized it
16

17
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.100
we added an image using an asset, and we gave it an app icon.
17

18
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.110
Now this is just a guide.
18

19
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.550
But for example, you could make an 'I Am Poor' app.
19

20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.250
You've been rich.
20

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.810
Now it's time to make an app that sort of achieves the opposite of the 'I Am Rich' app and show people
21

22
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.280
that actually, 'please don't rob me.
22

23
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.240
I'm actually really poor.'
23

24
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580
All I have is coal.
24

25
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.050
So this is completely up to you.
25

26
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.870
You can make an app on anything you want.
26

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.480
And it's really important that you customize it. You make it your own.
27

28
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
Find an image that you like, change the color scheme to something that you prefer.
28

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.060
Give it a different title, give it a different app icon. And in the coming lessons, there's going to be
29

30
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.760
steps that will guide you through the things that we want you to achieve and incorporate, in this challenge
30

31
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.280
app.
31

32
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.520
But the emphasis here, is really about making it your own.
32

33
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.150
So if you want to find beautiful images or assets or icons to incorporate into your app, I want to show
33

34
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.490
you some of my favorite resources.
34

35
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.500
One is called icons8, and they basically allow you to have free-for-commercial-use images, such as these
35

36
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.160
beautiful illustrations that were done by really really talented artists that you can incorporate into
36

37
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.510
any of your apps for free, as long as you link back to the icons
37

38
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.850
8 website.
38

39
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.760
Now, there's also another one called vecteezy which has a larger list of icons that you can simply
39

40
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.360
search for.
40

41
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.300
For example if you searched for 'coal', then you'll come up with some images that are related to coal, or
41

42
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.700
mining. But you can also just create your own.
42

43
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.730
If you're a designer, if you know how to use Sketch or Photoshop or Illustrator, then you can just draw
43

44
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.820
up your own icons and incorporate it into your app.
44

45
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.340
Alternatively, if you don't really know how to work with those large pieces of design software, you can
45

46
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.570
use one of my favorite tools which is Canva.
46

47
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.110
And you can sign up completely for free, and you can simply start creating a design.
47

48
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.820
So let's create a design with custom dimensions, let's say maybe 1000 x 1000 pixel.
48

49
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.220
And here we can just start designing.
49

50
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.220
You can see that they have a whole bunch of pre-made designs that are kind of meant to be there to inspire
50

51
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.960
you. But you can also just drag on your own shapes like, let's put in a circle on the screen and you can
51

52
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:48.270
change its colors, or maybe add another sort of item on top of the circle. And there, we have sort of a
52

53
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:56.190
cool app icon. But just mess around with it. Add pieces of text, or add different backgrounds or
53

54
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.540
add different elements, and really it's your playground.
54

55
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.690
So, either find something that you like, or design something that is perfect for you.
55

56
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.020
It doesn't really matter what the end outcome looks like, as long as you've gained the skills and you've
56

57
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.680
managed to create your very own app from scratch. Then consider yourself successful.
57

58
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.460
So once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and we'll guide you through step by step, all the challenges
58

59
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.920
that we want you to achieve.
59

60
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.050
So good luck, and I'll see you on the other side.
