All right guys.
1

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,030
Welcome to the Bitcoin Ticker app module and this module is going to be half tutorial and half a challenge.
2

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,720
So what we're going to build by the end of the module is something that looks like this.
3

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:21,000
So it's a app that is going to tell us the current price in various currencies such as euros or pounds
4

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,610
or dollars for various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum  and Lite coins.
5

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,930
And through making these apps, we're going to be revising a lot of the concepts that we learned in the
6

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:38,220
last modules such as networking, async await and also getting live data off the Internet using APIs.
7

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,850
But we're also going to be learning how we can implement a different user interface for different platforms
8

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,700
so that on Android, we have a drop down menu to select the currency and on iOS we're going to have this
9

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,760
iOS style picker view.
10

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,260
So we're going to be learning all of that and you're going to be challenged also through building this
11

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,460
app.
12

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,290
So once you're ready, we're going to head over to the GitHub page where the starting code for this module
13

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,000
is hosted.
14

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,610
Now first things first, we're going to download the project stub from GitHub,
15

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:17,730
so londonappbrewery/bitcoin-ticker-flutter. And we're going to clone it into our local system using
16

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,860
Android Studio.
17

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,400
So as per usual, we paste in the URL that we want to clone from and then we're going to open up our project
18

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,020
inside Android Studio.
19

20
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,710
And then we of course get our dependencies and wait for everything to load.
20

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,000
Now the first thing, we're going to do is we're going to run our app and see what it looks like. So to
21

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,790
begin with, our app looks incredibly simple.
22

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:56,830
It's got a single card inside the scaffold body which is going to eventually tell us how much one Bitcoin
23

24
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,610
is worth in US dollars.
24

25
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,600
And this is all we have to begin with.
25

26
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,230
So take a look through the price_screen.dart, the coin_data.dart
26

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,360
and the main.dart to see how we've actually laid out the screen so far.
27

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,660
And there's nothing really particularly new.
28

29
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,270
And we've kept the user interface relatively simple so that in the coming lessons when you're attempting
29

30
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,410
the challenge, it won't distract you from the code that you have to write. Now
30

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,130
once you're ready, we're going to get started creating a dropdown button right here so that we can start
31

32
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,560
selecting various different currencies to check the bitcoin price for.
32

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,320
So for all that and more, I see on the next lesson.
