0
1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,340
So now that we've got the majority of our functionality down, it's finally time to put back our icons
1

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,650
at the bottom to be at the track the user's score.
2

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,760
So the part where we're actually figuring out if the user got the question right or wrong is right here.
3

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,270
And you can see that at the moment, it's repeated in two places
4

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,860
right?
5

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,130
When the user picks false and also when the user picks
6

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:26,760
true.
7

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,200
So let's consolidate all of that code together into a single function.
8

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,700
So we'll do it right up here just below where we have our scorekeeper. And we're going to call that method
9

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,260
because we're inside a class.
10

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,630
So this is going to be a method that's associated with the class. And this method is gonna be called
11

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,940
checkAnswer. And checkAnswer is going to take a single input and the parameter is going to be a boolean
12

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:02,160
type that's going to be called userPickedAnswer. And then inside the parentheses, we're going to actually
13

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,900
go about checking the answer.
14

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,640
So we'll need to transplant some of this functionality over.
15

16
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:16,890
So I'm gonna go ahead and take all of this and take it out of here and put it into checkAnswer.
16

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:25,530
So essentially, when we call checkAnswer, we're gonna pass in the picked answer and then we can check to
17

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,990
see if it's the same as the correct answer.
18

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,740
So instead of checking if correct answer equals true, we're going to be checking if userPickedAnswer
19

20
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,440
is equals
20

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,380
,so double equals, to correctAnswer.
21

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,500
And remember that a single equals sign is assignment.
22

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,640
So left hand side should now equal right hand side and a double equal sign is a check for equality.
23

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,880
So we're checking to see if the left hand side is equal to the right hand side.
24

25
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,700
And if it's true, then print user got it right
25

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,710
else print user got it wrong.
26

27
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:09,540
So now down here when the user actually presses the true button, we're simply going to call that method
27

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,890
checkAnswer and
28

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,970
we're going to pass in the userPickedAnswer which is true in this case. But down here, instead of all
29

30
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,530
of this code, we can actually simply just call checkAnswer again, and we're going to pass in false.
30

31
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,250
So now we should have exactly the same functionality as before but we've just moved it out into a separate
31

32
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,240
method.
32

33
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:41,070
So if you want to test it again, let's hit save and just click run and we should still be getting the
33

34
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,450
right answers or the wrong answers into our console.
34

35
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:54,000
Now instead of getting these print statements, we want to be able to add our icons into our scorekeeper
35

36
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:02,880
which we know is being rendered onscreen at the bottom, as a row. And as we have more icons as children
36

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,020
of this row, they should build up along the very bottom.
37

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:14,280
So as a challenge, can you figure out how to, instead of having these print statements, have our little
38

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:22,800
ticks and crosses show up to track the user's score? Pause the video and try to complete the challenge.
39

40
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,360
All right.
40

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,750
So we know that we have this list called scorekeeper.
41

42
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,470
And at the moment it's completely empty.
42

43
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:39,470
We know that we can add to the list by simply just adding an icon which is a check icon or a close icon.
43

44
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:48,500
And we can also give the icon style such as a color or size etc. But we don't really want to do it here.
44

45
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,820
We want to do it when the user actually gets it right or wrong,
45

46
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,380
so inside these IF and ELSE statements.
46

47
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:01,520
So if the user got it right, instead of printing it, we're going to add to our scorekeeper.
47

48
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,860
So we're going to say scorekeeper.add. And the icon that we're going to add in there is going to be
48

49
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,890
a check icon,
49

50
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,870
so icons.check.
50

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:25,140
And it's also going to have a color property, and the color is going to be colors.green. And then
51

52
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,630
we've got our ELSE.
52

53
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:35,340
So when the user gets it wrong, then scorekeeper is going to get a new icon and that icon is going to
53

54
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,190
be the close icon.
54

55
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:49,320
So icons.close. And this icon is going to have a color property of red. We have to make sure I spell
55

56
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,440
it the American way, colors.red.
56

57
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,150
Okay.
57

58
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:02,430
So now all we have to do is to include all of this stuff which we know updates something that's being
58

59
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:11,550
displayed onscreen inside our set state, so that when the scorekeeper list gets updated, our app knows
59

60
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:18,150
to update the row over here and show up new icons as they get added.
60

61
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,840
All I'm going to do is just to cut this first line of set state and I'm going to put it right up here just
61

62
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,870
before IF statement where we change our scorekeeper list.
62

63
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:36,780
So now inside our set state, you can see that includes changing the scorekeeper and also calling quiz
63

64
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,020
Brain.nextQuestion which we know is going to bring us the next question in the question bank
64

65
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,960
and it will put it into our text widget
65

66
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,290
here.
66

67
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,020
So now let's hit save and hot reload and test it out.
67

68
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,310
So some cats are actually allergic to humans.
68

69
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,570
It's true.
69

70
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,410
You can lead a cow downstairs but not upstairs.
70

71
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,040
Maybe it's false.
71

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:13,080
And as you go through this list of questions, you can see that we get our progress indicated
72

73
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,840
and it also keeps track of which question we got wrong and which ones we got right.
73

74
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,260
So our question bank ends on the last question
74

75
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:30,210
and our app no longer goes forwards. But if we keep going, our question, even though we end on this one
75

76
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:37,770
and it won't progress and our app won't crash, but notice down here we're still getting icons added depending
76

77
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,900
on whether if we got this question right.
77

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,810
So our quiz still hasn't fully ended. In order to fix this,
78

79
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,190
we have a challenge for you. And once you're ready, I'll see you on the next lesson.
