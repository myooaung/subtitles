Well done for completing the last module.
1

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,440
It wasn't easy but you got it done.
2

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,070
Now I want to take this opportunity to share with you some of the things that I've learnt that I wish
3

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,180
somebody had told me while I was learning programming and learning other things as well in fact.
4

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,940
And one of those things is the ability to get rid of distractions because let's face it my phone probably
5

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,060
has a million notifications. The other day I almost fell down the stairs because a notification came on
6

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,500
the Apple Watch and I was looking at it while I was going down the stairs and I actually like missed
7

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,420
a step. And these little moments of distraction,
8

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,710
even though they seem like it's very quick to take a look at your phone, see what it's trying to tell
9

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,370
you and then get back to work and then get back to what you're doing,
10

11
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:04,140
you won't believe how long it actually takes for you to get back into the same level of focus as you
11

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,290
had before.
12

13
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,980
In fact some scientists actually did a study on this and they showed that for a distraction that is
13

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,870
as short as 1 minute,
14

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,650
let’s say somebody asking you, “Hey, do you want a cup of tea?
15

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,030
I'll make you one.” And you say, “Yeah sure.”
16

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,600
And then you get back to your work. For some people it can take up to twenty five minutes to be able
17

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,960
to get back to the level of focus that they had before.
18

19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,860
So a really really useful thing is, when I start working, I put my phone into airplane mode and I put
19

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,910
it into a drawer, because every time I see it I want to touch it.
20

21
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,270
It's like some sort of weird spell it's got on me.
21

22
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,330
So I put it away and it doesn't bother me, it doesn't make noises and, you know, maybe other people will
22

23
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,010
have emergencies but there's always other ways that people can reach you.
23

24
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,670
So get rid of your distraction.
24

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,910
It might not be the phone.
25

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,960
It might be
26

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,250
you need to shut yourself in a room so that other people don't distract you.
27

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,900
Or it might be that you need to find a quiet time when you can actually do this,
28

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,470
like early in the morning or late in the evening. But see how you can remove those distractions and see
29

30
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:21,250
your level of focus and see your level of focus go up and see how much more you're able to do.
30

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,940
So I hope that was helpful.
31

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,810
And I've got plenty more of these for you coming along the way.
32

33
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,530
So keep going.
