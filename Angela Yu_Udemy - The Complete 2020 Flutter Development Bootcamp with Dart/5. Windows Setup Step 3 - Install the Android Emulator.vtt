1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.810
Now in the last lesson, we installed Android Studio, and we installed the Flutter and Dart plugins. So if
1

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.740
you missed out on that,
2

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.290
be sure to head back to the last lesson to see how we now have this link on the Android Studio welcome
3

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.220
screen, which allows us to start a new Flutter project.
4

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.430
So once you're ready, go ahead and click on this to build your very first Flutter app.
5

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.620
So we're gonna choose a Flutter application, and click next. And you're gonna give your project a name.
6

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.460
Let's just call it testing_app and then make sure that the Flutter SDK path is listed here
7

8
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.580
as the one that matches what you have on your system.
8

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.290
So Android Studio is usually clever enough to pick up what the path is that you said in your path variable,
9

10
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.640
two lessons ago.
10

11
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.200
And if you haven't, then be sure to take a look at that video to see how we set this up.
11

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.010
Alternatively, you can also specify a path by clicking on these three dots and you can choose the location
12

13
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.080
where your Flutter SDK is located.
13

14
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.780
But either way, just be sure that it can get access to the Flutter package.
14

15
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.990
Now the project location is where this current project is going to be saved and it doesn't really matter
15

16
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.220
where you save it because we're going to delete it shortly anyways.
16

17
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.870
This is just for testing to see if we can get it all up and running and make sure that we've done all
17

18
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.260
the setup correctly.
18

19
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.060
So once you're ready, click on next, and you can leave the company domain as example.com and go ahead
19

20
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.050
and click finish to build your first Flutter app.
20

21
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.070
Now,
21

22
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.880
once that's done, you should see a file called main.dart open up in Android Studio, and this already
22

23
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.410
has some sample code that the Flutter team has written to be able to build a really simple counter app.
23

24
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.600
Now in order to run it on Android, we're going to need an emulator. And the way that we get an emulator
24

25
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.940
is by going to the AVD manager.
25

26
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.670
So it's the one right over here.
26

27
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.810
It's got the little Android icon and little phone icon combined.
27

28
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.360
And if you click on, it it should take you to setup a new virtual device.
28

29
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.530
Now in terms of performance, I recommend choosing a Nexus device.
29

30
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.100
So for example the Nexus 6 or the 6P.
30

31
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.310
Once you've chosen it, go ahead and click next.
31

32
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.640
And now you get to choose a operating system.
32

33
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.420
Now if you've already installed an operating system, then you should be able to simply selected and click
33

34
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.920
next.
34

35
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.890
But otherwise, simply click on the download button for the operating system of your choice and just let
35

36
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.920
it download and install.
36

37
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.710
Now, this might take about 5 to 10 minutes, but just be patient and it should be done soon.
37

38
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.990
Now once that's complete go ahead and click finish, and you can now choose that new operating system
38

39
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.140
that you downloaded and installed.
39

40
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.500
So now we can go ahead and click next. And here, you can give you AVD a name, or choose whether if you
40

41
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.280
want to have the device frame.
41

42
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.380
But most importantly, you're going to enable hardware acceleration by going under the emulated performance
42

43
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.150
dropdown list and switching your graphics from automatic to hardware accelerated.
43

44
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.330
And this is going to make your emulator run so much faster.
44

45
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.810
So this is why we chose a Nexus device rather than a pixel device.
45

46
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.760
So once you're done over here, go ahead and click finish, and you're now all done with setting up your
46

47
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.050
virtual device.
47

48
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.660
Now if you want to give it a go and see what it looks like, then go ahead and click on the play button
48

49
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.310
right here, and your chosen emulator should now launch. And here it is.
49

50
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.790
Here's our brand new emulated device.
50

51
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.000
So now I'm going to close down this window.
51

52
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.230
But remember you can always get back to it just by clicking on that icon over there which is your AVD
52

53
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.340
manager.
53

54
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.530
Now at this point, I want to test out this sample code that the Flutter team has created and I'm going
54

55
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.480
to test it onto my virtual device.
55

56
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.960
So over here is where you choose the device that you want to test it onto. A little bit later on, after
56

57
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.280
we create our first app, we're going to launch our app onto a physical device as well.
57

58
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.050
And I'll walk you through the steps that are required a little bit later on.
58

59
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.500
Now if you have more than one emulator device, you'll see them show up here, so select the one that you
59

60
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.470
want to build your app for, and then go ahead and click on the play button.
60

61
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.980
Now in order to see the progress of the running of your app, you'll see it inside your console down here
61

62
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.530
and you'll see the various stages that it's going through. And the part where initializes gradle
62

63
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.270
usually takes longest.
63

64
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.140
So, give it a few minutes and it should launch automatically onto the phone.
64

65
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.450
Now once it's done, the loading bar down here will disappear and you should see the Flutter demo app
65

66
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.280
show up on screen.
66

67
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.560
Now this is a really simple counter app.
67

68
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.340
As soon as you push the button then the counter goes up and that's pretty much all it does.
68

69
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:21.340
But if you've gotten this far, then congratulations, you have completed all of the steps in Windows setup
69

70
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.260
and you are now ready to start building Flutter apps for Android development.
70

71
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.960
Now in the coming lessons I'll be running most of the apps in the iOS simulator but it's effectively
71

72
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.810
the same if you're using the Android emulator.
72

73
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.720
Now if you're ready you can go ahead and delete this testing app, and head over to the start of the course
73

74
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.030
where we'll build our very first app.
