00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.090
So the next step involves installing Xcode, and I recommend that you go ahead and download it from the
1

2
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.940
Mac App Store.
2

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.260
So if you click on this link, then I'll take you to the Mac App Store preview, and if you click right
3

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:23.580
here then it'll take you straight over to the Mac App Store. And here is where you're going to click
4

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.840
on get, to be able to download Xcode.
5

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.940
Now I've already got Xcode downloaded, so I can't download it again, but it's as simple as downloading
6

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.460
any other app on the Mac App Store.
7

8
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.700
Now this will take a while and historically it takes anywhere between 20 minutes to maybe two hours.
8

9
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.550
So grab yourself a cup of tea and once you're done, come back to this video and we'll show you the next
9

10
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.650
steps.
10

11
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.420
So once you've got Xcode downloaded, it's really important that you open it at least once and you can
11

12
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.970
open it by simply searching for it in spotlight.
12

13
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.590
So searching for the Xcode.app
13

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.370
and if you double click on it, it should open up.
14

15
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.830
And the first time you open, it I'll ask you for a whole bunch of things such as agreeing to this, agreeing
15

16
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.140
to that, agreeing to give away your firstborn, just click yes to everything
16

17
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.220
and Apple will leave you alone.
17

18
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.490
So in addition to setting it up in terms of the user interface, we also have to set up some the Xcode
18

19
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.090
command line tools.
19

20
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.810
So again, you're going to go ahead and open up terminal, and you're going to go back to that Mac OS installation
20

21
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.480
page and you'll simply just going to copy this line of code either by clicking here or highlighting
21

22
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.070
and copying and you're going to paste it into your terminal and hit ENTER.
22

23
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.980
Now because we're using the keyword sudo, which requires admin privileges, it stands for super user
23

24
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.750
do, you have to put in your password that you use to log into your Mac and because it's trying to be
24

25
00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.740
super secure,
25

26
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.410
it won't actually show you what you're typing so you're basically typing blind. And it's only when you
26

27
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.410
get it right that you see your prompt again.
27

28
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.140
So that dollar sign and your name.
28

29
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.800
But otherwise it'll tell you 'Sorry,
29

30
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.320
try again.'
30

31
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.090
So keep going until you get it right.
31

32
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.180
But this is essentially the password that you use to log on to your Mac.
32

33
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.520
All right.
33

34
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.340
So now that we're all set up and ready to go, then we can quit terminal again and we can quit Xcode
34

35
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.730
as well.
