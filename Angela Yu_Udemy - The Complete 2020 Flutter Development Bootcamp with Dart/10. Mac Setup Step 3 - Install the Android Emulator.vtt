00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.790
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.290
Now in the last lesson, we installed and set up Android Studio to be able to start creating Flutter apps.
2

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.640
And, in this lesson, we're going to show you how you can run this sample Flutter app, the Flutter demo, as
3

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.050
a Android app.
4

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.980
So first thing that we need to do, is to go into the Android virtual device manager. So you can locate
5

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.380
it under this button right here.
6

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.350
Alternatively, you can find the virtual device manager under the Tools menu here.
7

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:38.910
And once that opens, we get to create a new virtual device. Be it a watch or a phone or a tablet.
8

9
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.790
Now, I know that some of you guys have slightly all the devices, and the Android emulator is known to
9

10
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.890
be quite a resource hog anyways.
10

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.110
So my recommendation is to select the Nexus 6 as your chosen device, because this will allow us to easily
11

12
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.400
accelerate it using hardware acceleration which I'll show you a little bit later on.
12

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.970
So once you've selected your device, go ahead and click next.
13

14
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.380
And now you get to specify which operating system you want to run on that device.
14

15
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.380
Now I recommend going for Android P or Pie, and because we don't yet have that operating system downloaded,
15

16
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.620
we have to click on the download button and this might take anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes, but
16

17
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.790
once it's done, then we'll be able to equip our new virtual device or emulator with the Android Pie operating
17

18
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.380
system.
18

19
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.440
Now once it's done, you can go ahead and click finish, and you'll now be able to choose Android Pie as
19

20
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.670
the operating system to equip your virtual device.
20

21
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.980
So let's go ahead and click next. And now we get to either change or virtual devices name,
21

22
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.880
but the most important thing here is to choose hardware for the graphics.
22

23
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.310
And this way, we'll be able to use the computer's graphics card for faster rendering.
23

24
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.440
And this is going to vastly speed up your Android emulator.
24

25
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.440
So now we're all done and we can click finish.
25

26
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.370
And now we should see that we have one virtual device that's set up and ready to go.
26

27
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.600
So in order to launch it, all you have to do is click on this little play button right here.
27

28
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.460
And once it's done launching, here's our brand new Nexus device.
28

29
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.400
So in order to test it, we're going to use that app that was created by the Flutter team, and we're going
29

30
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.950
to run it onto our new Android virtual device.
30

31
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.910
So in order to select the virtual device, we're going to go over here, and we're going to select the Android
31

32
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.330
SDK that is going to be the target.
32

33
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.540
And now we can click on the play button to run this code onto our Android emulator.
33

34
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.650
Now you can watch as it goes along its different stages of building.
34

35
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.100
Now the initial part takes a little bit longer but it will usually be done within 5 to 10 minutes
35

36
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.880
and you can watch its progress down here.
36

37
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.390
Now once your patients has been sufficiently tested, the app will load and you should be looking at the
37

38
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.030
Flutter demo app here and all it does is keep count of how many times you push this button.
38

39
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.930
So every time you push it, the number goes up and that's all it is.
39

40
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.320
But this is just here to demonstrate that we've actually got our Android Studio installed and set up,
40

41
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.980
we've got the Flutter SDK installed and we've now also got the android emulator up and running.
41

42
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.330
So all we have to do is to setup the iOS part of things.
42

43
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.090
So in the next lesson, we're going to look at how we can install Xcode and setup Flutter to work for
43

44
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.020
the iOS platform.
