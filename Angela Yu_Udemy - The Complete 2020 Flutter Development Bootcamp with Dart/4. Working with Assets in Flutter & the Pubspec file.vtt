00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.010
Now in the last lesson, we've already created the main structure of our app.
1

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.610
But in this lesson, I want to show you how you can work with image assets that you load into your app,
2

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.500
so you don't have to fetch it from the Internet and you'll be able to use it anywhere inside your app
3

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.770
without needing an internet connection.
4

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.470
So first things first, we're going to click on the project folder so you can see our project here is
5

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.740
called 'I Am Rich' and it's the root of all of our other folders. And we're going to right click on that,
6

7
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.300
and we're going to create a new directory.
7

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.460
We're going to call this directory, images. Inside this folder is where we're gonna put all of the images
8

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.410
that we're going to use to work with our app.
9

10
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.880
And if you look inside this current lesson you should be able to see a downloadable file called diamond
10

11
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.720
.png
11

12
00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.140
And once you've downloaded that image, I want you to click and drag that image into that images folder
12

13
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.090
that we created just now. And it'll have a little red line around the folder so that you know that it's
13

14
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:15.280
going into the right one. And then we're going to go ahead and click OK to move that file into there.
14

15
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.350
So now that we've incorporated that image into our project, it's time to tell Flutter that the image
15

16
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.670
exists. And to do that, we're going to go into the configuration file, which is our pubspec.yaml
16

17
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.880
file. And if you scroll down, you'll see that it even tells you in a comment, that this is how you add
17

18
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420
assets to your application.
18

19
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.690
We have to create an asset section like this.
19

20
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.280
So let's go ahead and uncomment this by holding down COMMAND + /.
20

21
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.800
And we now have a assets section. Now inside our assets section,
21

22
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.040
we're going to add our image. Instead of a.burr.jpeg
22

23
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.890
we're going to add images/
23

24
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.340
So that refers to our images folder, and then /diamond. png
24

25
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.430
And this tells our Flutter project about this particular asset.
25

26
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.160
And once it knows about it, we'll be have to use it inside our main.dart or any other code files that's
26

27
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.440
in our Flutter project.
27

28
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.330
Now you'll notice that inside this pubspec.yaml
28

29
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.440
the comments don't start with two forward slashes.
29

30
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.990
And in fact you tried that,
30

31
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.280
it doesn't actually work.
31

32
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.770
That's not treated as a comment.
32

33
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.900
And this is because this is a special type of file.
33

34
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.750
It's a YAML file, and YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language.
34

35
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.920
It's meant to be this very human readable type of language that machines can also understand, to interpret
35

36
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.960
how you want to configure certain things, such as our Flutter project.
36

37
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.310
Now that's all very well and good but there's just one problem.
37

38
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.910
It relies really heavily on indentations.
38

39
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:18.060
So for example every section inside this configuration file is right next to an up to the margin or
39

40
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.650
the gutter right in the left.
40

41
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.460
You can see that the name of our project or the description for our project,
41

42
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.840
they don't have any spaces
42

43
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.920
next to the left.
43

44
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.840
And if they did, they wouldn't be treated as a new section. They would be treated as a child embedded
44

45
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.450
in another section. Like this.
45

46
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:46.770
So if you have two spaces next to something, then this is treated as a child inside this thing.
46

47
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.520
So that means we have to be really careful when we're writing code in our pubspec.yaml because
47

48
00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.690
as it is, this doesn't work. So well we can do to make our lives just a little bit easier is to actually
48

49
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.280
delete all of these comments that came in the configuration file. And a lot of these comments are useful
49

50
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.430
because the Flutter team is trying to tell us what we can do with the configurations here, but it also
50

51
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.760
clutters up the page and makes it really hard to see at a glance, what's actually going on.
51

52
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:26.640
And so if we take a look now, you can see that we've got several top level properties such as the name
52

53
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.570
of the project, description or version. And then we've got other things which are children of these top
53

54
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.610
level items. Over here, we've got a couple of settings for our Flutter app.
54

55
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.420
One is that it uses material design and the other are the assets that it wants to use.
55

56
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.940
Now you can see that this asset is kind of out of sync with the indentation. It's currently indented by
56

57
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:59.280
one, two, three spaces, and that doesn't actually mean anything in YAML because each indentation level,
57

58
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.060
is two spaces.
58

59
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:08.020
So if we hit backspace and move it back just by one, so that it's now indented by two spaces, from the
59

60
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.630
top level Flutter key, then this is now pretty much valid YAML code.
60

61
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.990
And this tells our configuration file that our assets are children of our Flutter project.
61

62
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.780
So here's a top tip. When you're working with the pubspec.yaml file, your configuration file for
62

63
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.190
your Flutter project,
63

64
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:35.070
be really careful about the indentation. And remember that every indent is two spaces.
64

65
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.680
So when your coding along with me, make sure that you have the same indentation levels as you see on
65

66
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.270
screen.
66

67
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.520
Otherwise you might get into trouble that you don't really need.
67

68
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.190
Now that we've set up our configuration file to tell our project that we want to use assets, and our
68

69
00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:01.330
assets live in a folder called images, and the file is called diamond.png then we're ready to incorporate
69

70
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.720
these files into our project, ready for use.
70

71
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.540
So we're going to hit save with COMMAND + S or CONTROL + S. Aand we're going to click on this link here
71

72
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.410
where it says 'Packages get' and that will incorporate the images that's inside our project ready for
72

73
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.330
use within our main.dart or any of our other project files.
73

74
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:30.550
So now, we can head back to our main.dart file, and instead of using a network image, we're going to
74

75
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.000
use a different type of image.
75

76
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:40.810
We're going to use an asset image. And as you can imagine, an asset image comes from our assets, which
76

77
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.910
are defined in our configuration file.
77

78
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:51.280
So we're now able to provide the name of the asset which is going to be exactly what we specified in
78

79
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.470
here.
79

80
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.480
So now let's head back into our main.dart file and we can specify the name of our image. And it's
80

81
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.490
going to be images/diamond.png
81

82
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:09.820
And that is all we need to do to be to use the image that we've incorporated under the images folder
82

83
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.380
with the name of diamond.png and it will know what images/diamond.png is, because we added
83

84
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.730
it to the configuration pubspec.yaml file.
84

85
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.900
So now all we have to do is run our app and test it.
85

86
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:33.400
So let's click the play button, and you can see our app now has our image asset that comes from our images
86

87
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:42.280
folder namely the diamond.png image incorporated into our image placeholder in the center of the body
87

88
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.510
of our app.
88

89
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.800
Now for the cute minds amongst you, you might realize a slight problem.
89

90
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.240
What if you had a 20 or 30 or 40 images inside your images folder?
90

91
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.570
Are you really going to write them out line by line making sure that you've indented the correct number
91

92
00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.620
of spaces?
92

93
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.030
That's quite painful right.
93

94
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:09.820
What you can also do, is instead of specifying the precise file name, you can also just specify the folder
94

95
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.970
where all of your image files are located, and then add a '/'  to say that I want to incorporate
95

96
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.740
everything that's inside that folder into my project.
96

97
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:27.880
And if you go ahead and run 'Packages get' again, and you run your app then absolutely nothing should have
97

98
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.430
changed.
98

99
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.240
Everything should have been exactly the same because we're saying now we are adding everything inside
99

100
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:42.660
the images folder as an asset that we're going to use inside our app. So as long as your images go into
100

101
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:48.030
the folder that's called images, and not inside say a sub folder or you know, a folder of a folder.
101

102
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:54.640
As long as they're inside the images folder, then you will be able to use it like so.
102

103
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.330
And that also means you won't have to touch these indents after the first time you make them.
103

104
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.330
So makes you life a little bit easier.
104

105
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:10.140
Now this just one last thing that we need to fix which is when we take a look at our app icon. It still
105

106
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.770
has the Flutter default app icon. And this will get placed for every single app that you create with
106

107
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.960
Flutter, unless we update the app icon.
107

108
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.700
So to learn how to do that and more, I will see you on the next lesson.
