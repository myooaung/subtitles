Hey. It’s Angela here again.
1

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,740
And I'm here to give you a virtual pat on the back for getting this far and completing the last module.
2

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,950
Now, today I want to talk about what you should do when you feel really frustrated, like when you feel
3

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:24,990
overwhelmed with all the things that you need to know and they all seem impossible,
4

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,380
and you’re getting stuck on like, you know, thing after thing, and you just feel like frustrated.
5

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,920
What should you do?
6

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,500
The first thing you should do is take a break.
7

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,270
You've probably been staring at that piece of code for too long.
8

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,500
And, you know, like sometimes when I stare at my own name like for too long it starts looking weird, like
9

10
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,100
is that really how you spell Angela, like A n g l?
10

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,730
Like you know like if you are not getting a moment to just let your brain think about something else
11

12
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,420
it will get stuck much much easier.
12

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,430
So take a break.
13

14
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,730
You know, sometimes sleep on it.
14

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,210
The best solutions come to me when I think about my problem
15

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,560
before I go to sleep, and then the next morning I wake up and I try to tackle that thing that I got stuck
16

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,130
on yesterday. For some miraculous reason it's like I set my brain is like working on it while I'm sleeping.
17

18
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,750
But the next day solutions come to me just so much easier.
18

19
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:34,900
So take a break, let your brain rest, go and exercise, go for like a jog around the block, or, you know, a
19

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:43,840
fast paced walk if you're not already into jogging like I am. I try to go for like a 30 minute swim at the
20

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:54,490
local pool if I can and just like the sort of silence underwater when I'm swimming and just being enveloped
21

22
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:04,390
by water somehow really helps me clear my thoughts and it makes me feel more calm and when I come back
22

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,690
to my problem I just seem to be better at solving it.
23

24
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,220
So don't be so hard on yourself. Don’t just sit there and rip your hair out and be like “Why can't I do
24

25
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,700
this? Why is my code not working?”
25

26
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,410
We've all been there before but it's not the right thing to do.
26

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,040
Take a break.
27

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,220
Have a moment to yourself.
28

29
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,450
Think about something else.
29

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,830
Look at something else and then come back to it.
30

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,340
It’s always going to be there for you.
31

32
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,640
Your problems don’t just run away.
