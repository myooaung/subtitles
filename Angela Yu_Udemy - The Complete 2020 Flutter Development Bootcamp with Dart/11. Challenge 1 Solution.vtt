00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:00.760
All right.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.430
So how did you get on with that challenge?
2

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.160
This should be quite simple because we've already done it once for the left dice. But it's important
3

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.230
that you understand how it all links together, which is why I wanted you to complete the challenge.
4

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.320
The first thing that we need to do is we've got a variable that's tracking the value for our leftDice
5

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.910
Number. And it's updating it when the button is pressed. So that it can display a new image in that image
6

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.770
widget.
7

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.300
Now in order to do the same for the right dice, we're going to need to create a new variable. And we'll
8

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.990
just call this rightDice
9

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.730
Number, because not feeling too imaginative today.
10

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.810
Now once we've got our variable, then we can go about changing it to a random number, when the flap button
11

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.140
is pressed. Inside our onPressed,
12

13
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.750
the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to say that our rightDiceNumber is going to equal to
13

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.700
a number that's generated from a random number generator.
14

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.180
And the specific type of number we want to generate is an integer,
15

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.610
so a whole number. And we're going to set the max to six.
16

17
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.050
So we generate random numbers between 0 and 5. And then we'll just add 1 to any of those numbers to bring
17

18
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.470
it up to 1 - 6, which matches with the dice numbers that we have in our images.
18

19
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.470
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to update the place where we use that rightDiceNumber.
19

20
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.820
Instead of pulling up the images/dice1.png, which is pretty much hardcoded, it's always going
20

21
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.610
to be the first image shown. We're going to delete that one, and instead we're going to use a string interpolation
21

22
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.740
to insert the rightDiceNumber inside there. And it's going to be inserted using that little dollar
22

23
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.210
sign there that we saw previously.
23

24
00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:02.130
Now all we have to do is to say that when the rightDiceNumber changes, we should update all the places
24

25
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.720
where it's used.
25

26
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.070
So in order to do that, we have to call that method called set state.
26

27
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.700
And this simply says that this change in the rightDiceNumber's value is going to need to trigger a
27

28
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.620
rebuild of our stateful widget, so that the part where it's used can update on the screen.
28

29
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.390
Let's hit save and for those changes to go through to our app, and let's test it by... we already know the
29

30
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.800
left side works.
30

31
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.670
And now if we click on the right side, it also works. And it gives us all the numbers that we could possibly
31

32
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.930
want.
32

33
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.790
And we now have two separate dice that we can roll on our dice app.
33

34
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.880
Now what if we wanted both dice to change when one of the buttons is pressed?
34

35
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.840
So what if I wanted both of these buttons to update when I click on any one of those buttons?
35

36
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.180
Here is your challenge.
36

37
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.420
Try and get this behavior in your app. So pause the video and try to complete this challenge.
37

38
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.180
And I'll share with you the solution in the next lesson.
