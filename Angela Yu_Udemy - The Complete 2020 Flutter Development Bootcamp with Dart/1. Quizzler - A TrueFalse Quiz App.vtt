00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.440
All right,
1

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.140
so it's time to build a new app.
2

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.980
And in this module, we're going to be building a quiz app where the user has to answer questions and
3

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.140
we'll tell them how many they got right.
4

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.420
And while we build that, we're going to learn all about classes and objects and how to create them using
5

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.740
Dart.
6

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.810
Now by the end the module, you're going to have a app that looks like this.
7

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.060
It keeps track of the users score, and it lets them answer true and false questions. Even though the app
8

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.270
looks simple, under the hood,
9

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.140
we're going to be tackling some more intermediate programming concepts. And also figure out how we can
10

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.780
better structure our app.
11

12
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.110
So as always, first things first, let's get set up using the GitHub repository that we've got as the
12

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.670
starting file.
13

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.930
This is the starting project for our Quizzler app.
14

15
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.450
And as always, we're going to copy the URL and we're going to go into Android Studio, and we're going
15

16
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.900
to check out our project from version control, gonna select Git, and then we'll paste in that URL that
16

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.260
we got previously, and clone our projects. And we gonna select no as always.
17

18
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.470
Instead we're going to choose to open it up where we saved it, which is inside my Android Studio projects.
18

19
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.780
And we have to click on Get dependencies in order for it to pull in all of our Flutter packages, and
19

20
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.370
setup our project for Flutter development.
20

21
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.850
So as always, we have our main.dart which contains all of the starting code.
21

22
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.900
And in this case actually, we haven't made any changes in the pubspec,
22

23
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:46.030
we've actually left it as it is. And there's no resources that we've added, no images, other than the app
23

24
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.740
icons for the Android and iOS side.
24

25
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.400
But the main reason why we have the starting file for you is because we've actually gone ahead and created
25

26
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.800
a very simple user interface.
26

27
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.630
So once you clone the project, go ahead and run it to see what we've done. Once the app has run,
27

28
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.080
this is what you should see.
28

29
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.890
There is a dark background and there's some white text. And exactly as what it says,
29

30
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.040
this is where our questions will go and these are the true and false buttons that the user will be able
30

31
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.010
to click on to select their answer.
31

32
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.120
And this is all that we've done. And it's simply a text widget and two flat button widgets. And they
32

33
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.250
are of course embedded inside expanded widgets in a column so that they take up the right amount of
33

34
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.140
space.
34

35
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.310
Now if you want to create this user interface completely from scratch yourself just to get extra practice,
35

36
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.160
then feel free to create a new project from scratch.
36

37
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.760
There's no images that you need and there's no changes in the pubspec. But given that we're going to
37

38
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.280
learn quite a lot in this module, I thought it was a good idea that we gave you these starting components
38

39
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.960
so that we don't have to spend a lot of time creating things and doing things that we already know how
39

40
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.410
to do.
40

41
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.150
So once you've reviewed the code and seen how the widgets are set up, then you're pretty much ready to
41

42
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.550
go to the next lesson and we're going to start building our scorekeeper.
42

43
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.250
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
