00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.220
So now that we're pretty much done with the design of our user interface, there's only one thing that
1

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.380
looks a little bit different from our original intention.
2

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.420
It's the fact that the dice images should probably be in the center of the screen. And it should have a
3

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.750
little bit of padding from the edges.
4

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.420
Let's go ahead and implement those changes.
5

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.320
Previously whenever we needed to embed a widget inside another widget, or add another widget somewhere
6

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.810
into the widget tree, we've always taken our widget out say, remove our row widget here and all its children
7

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.880
and instead return something like a center widget, which has a child which is now going to be the row
8

9
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.890
widget. And you can see that when I put that in there, and I delete all the parts I don't need, and I move
9

10
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.530
that semicolon down to the closing bracket for center, and add a comma there,
10

11
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.380
then you can see that this does what I need to do, which is to move our row into the center of the screen.
11

12
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.970
But that was kind of fiddly and especially messing around with the semicolons and commas.
12

13
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.870
You're bound to have issues eventually down the road.
13

14
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.290
So I want to show you a much easier way, and you're going to be using this a lot once you discover it.
14

15
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.000
Now it's important to first show you what the pain points are, which is why I've kept this in the secret
15

16
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.560
bag until now.
16

17
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.350
Let's say that we want to do the same thing as we did before.
17

18
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.370
We want to move our row from the top left corner of the body, which is this part below the app bar, all the
18

19
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.980
way to take up the center of the space.
19

20
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.210
So we need a center widget around our row.
20

21
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.310
And essentially, what we want to do, is to insert a center widget at this point here.
21

22
00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.720
So below the scaffold but above the row, so that all of the row and the expanded widgets and dice images
22

23
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.750
are contained inside this center widget. So the widget that we want to embed inside a new widget is the
23

24
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.450
row.
24

25
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.100
And instead of cutting it out and moving it somewhere else before replanting it back here, we can simply
25

26
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.050
select it.
26

27
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.340
So put our cursor anywhere on the word row, and then go into our Flutter outline and we can click on
27

28
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.400
this button right here.
28

29
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.680
And if you hover over it for long enough, it'll tell you this button will center the widget that you've
29

30
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.390
currently got selected.
30

31
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.720
So in the outline you can see we've got the rows selected. When you click on it in the code,
31

32
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.750
It will move the selection in the tree.
32

33
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.030
But this is what we want to select and we're going to click on this button, and it will automatically
33

34
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.590
add that center widget around the row, which is almost like wizardry.
34

35
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.600
The beauty of this is that it'll move the semicolons or commas as needed.
35

36
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.640
It'll add that child property and we don't have to do anything other than just click on a button.
36

37
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.150
Now, there's many ways of actually getting Flutter to embed or add, and there's other things that we can
37

38
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.740
do automatically as well.
38

39
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:28.420
For example, if we wanted to embed our, I don't know, row inside a column, we could simply click on this 'wrap
39

40
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.770
with column' button, and now our row is inside a column.
40

41
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.990
I'm going to hit COMMAND + Z to go back before we get really lost in messing around with all the buttons.
41

42
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:45.370
But, another way of doing this is you can simply select the element inside the widget tree here, and you
42

43
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.430
can right click on it to send to the widget or add padding or wrap with column, wrap with row, wrap with
43

44
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.840
container.
44

45
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.150
And these are pretty much all of the most common things that you will want to do.
45

46
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.030
But sometimes, you might want to do something that's a little bit more specific, such as what if we wanted
46

47
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.210
to remove this expanded widget out of the tree.
47

48
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.980
But I wanted to leave the image widget where it is. Essentially,
48

49
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.740
I want to simply pluck that expanded widget out of the tree, and make the dice1 image a child of the
49

50
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.820
row, without having an expanded widget around it. Again,
50

51
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.350
normally that would be really really painful.
51

52
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.630
And over here you can't actually really do it when you right click, right?
52

53
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.600
What I need is a delete widget.
53

54
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.290
Now you can get access to that if you click in your code and you go over to that light bulb that shows
54

55
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.730
up.
55

56
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.420
And if you click on the dropdown list, you can see, oh we have more things that we can do.
56

57
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.500
We can remove our widget.
57

58
00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:01.270
We can move our widget down, so that this one becomes the second child in the row, and it gets moved over
58

59
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.830
to the right of the row. Or we can remove widget.
59

60
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.560
And that achieves exactly what we were talking about which is removing the expanded widget from the
60

61
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.330
tree, but leaving the image where it is inside the row.
61

62
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:24.280
Now, I didn't actually want to do that because our design now looks like this. But I wanted to be able
62

63
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.200
to show you what you can do by tapping into these so called intention actions.
63

64
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.690
You can add padding, you can send to the widget, everything that we saw over here and there's more,
64

65
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.450
right?
65

66
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.600
For example, let me remove my expanded widget, and go back to the scenario where I wanted to wrap our
66

67
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:50.170
image inside an expanded widget. Instead of cutting it out, moving it around, doing all sorts of complicated
67

68
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.720
things,
68

69
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.580
I could have just clicked on the light bulb and clicked on 'wrap with new widget' and it will wrap my widget
69

70
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.300
inside a new widget at that position in the tree.
70

71
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.920
And now I get to type 'expanded' and it does exactly the same thing. My widget is now inserted into the
71

72
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:18.220
tree, and my image now looks as it should. The light bulb will show up
72

73
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.990
once you click on something that has these intention actions. So namely, in Android Studio,
73

74
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.950
if you have the dark mode enabled, it'll be something yellow, like center or row or expanded. One of the
74

75
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.390
widgets
75

76
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.750
basically. If you wanted to pull up that menu without needing your mouse, then you can move your cursor
76

77
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:44.190
to the widget that you want to embed or delete or do something to, and then hold down OPTION or ALT
77

78
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.000
and hit ENTER.
78

79
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.690
So it'll be ALT + ENTER for Windows, and OPTION + ENTER for Mac. and then you pull up that menu anyways and
79

80
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:59.680
this will be a really fast way of adding padding, of removing widgets, of doing all of these intention
80

81
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.340
actions.
81

82
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:07.960
And actually, what I want to do right now, is to add some padding around our dice images, so our expanded
82

83
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.130
widgets, in order for it to look a bit more like this.
83

84
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.850
So there's a bit of space in between the images and also from the sides of the screen.
84

85
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:25.570
So using the intention actions menu that we just talked about, can you insert 16 pixels of padding around
85

86
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.980
both dice, so that they end up looking like this. Pause video, and try and complete this challenge.
86

87
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.000
We've got our two image widgets, which we need padding around.
87

88
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.150
So all we need to do, is to put our cursor onto the widget that we need to pad, and we're going to hold
88

89
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:53.390
down OPTION or ALT, and hit ENTER. And then we're gonna select add padding. And automatically, a whole
89

90
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.290
bunch of code gets written for us.
90

91
00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.640
And it's so simple that you could almost just hit TAB all day long, and get all your code written.
91

92
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.100
Now by default, when we insert padding it adds eight pixels of padding around all four edges, but that's
92

93
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.080
not enough for us.
93

94
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.680
So we're going to change that to 16.
94

95
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.140
And now, we have our images nicely padded.
95

96
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:20.910
And I can do the same thing to my other image. Add padding and change it to 16.
96

97
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.660
So now that we've achieved the look that we want, we're finally ready to start adding functionality to
97

98
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.380
our app.
98

99
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.200
So for all of that and more, I see on the next lesson.
