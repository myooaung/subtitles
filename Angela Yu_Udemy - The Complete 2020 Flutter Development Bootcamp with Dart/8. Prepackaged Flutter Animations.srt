Now Previously we saw how we can use different types of animations custom or out-of-the-box hero animations
1

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,420
and we can see how we can control all aspects of the animation by digging deep into the animation controller
2

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,760
and the animation objects.
3

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,550
Now in this lesson, I want to show you that there's also prepackaged animations. So if we head over to
4

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,670
our Flutter packages and if you search for animate, you'll find a whole bunch of things that you can
5

6
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:38,490
use to add instant animation into your app. So there's the flutter_sequence_animation for you to 
6

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:38,570
define
7

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,120
whole bunch of animations that should happen in the sequence, so change color then change shape then
8

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,590
change size etc..
9

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:56,240
There's also animation that can be applied to widgets or components like this elastic bottom menu that
10

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:04,770
you can implement. There are springy animations like the sprung package which are easily implemented
11

12
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,800
and calculated from complex physics.
12

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,780
Now the package that I want to show you in our case that we're going to implement is something called
13

14
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,910
the animated_text_kit. And it has a series of beautiful text animations that pretty much are just add
14

15
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:27,960
water animations. They're so easy to use and you instantly get these really cool effects like the typewriter
15

16
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:36,060
or the scale change or the colorize etc. So let's go ahead and implement this into our code and see
16

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,720
how we're going from both ends of the extreme of animations, from fully customizable to using something
17

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,450
that's already prepackaged and ready made.
18

19
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,170
So let's go ahead and depend on this animated text kit.
19

20
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,300
So let's go into our pubspex.yaml and below cupertino icons, let's add our animated text kit. And let's
20

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:04,440
make sure we run packages.gets so that we grab that package and now we can import it wherever we
21

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,000
need it.
22

23
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:12,880
So we're going to import it at the top of our welcome screen and it's called animated_text_kit
23

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,060
.dart.
24

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,740
So now right here where we have our text in our Flash chat text widget, we can change that from a normal
25

26
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,660
text widget to a animated text widget and we can choose the type of animation we want.
26

27
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:37,380
So in my case I'm going to choose the typewriter so I can now replace that text widget with a Typewriter
27

28
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:46,980
AnimatedTextKit. And TypewriterAnimatedTextKit expects a list of strings which is going to come under
28

29
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,720
the text property.
29

30
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,140
So instead of having just a normal string, I'm going to create a list of strings and it's only going
30

31
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,540
to be a list of one string in this case.
31

32
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,500
But of course you can have more if you want it to,
32

33
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,570
and the property name is called text. So if you had  four lines of text for example then you could have
33

34
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:15,730
a list of  four strings, each of which is going to be printed out one by one using the typewriter animation.
34

35
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:22,240
And the last thing we have to change is that the style property is the same as the style property for
35

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,480
the text widget, but it simply has a different name it's called TextStyle and we can still apply our
36

37
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,170
TextStyle widget to the text that's being animated. And that's it. That's all we have to do to implement
37

38
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:43,440
that animation and we can now check it out. And so this is what it looks like. It'll type out the text,
38

39
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,980
it'll flash a few times before it goes back to type out the text again. And I think this looks really
39

40
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,230
really beautiful and I just wanted to show you how
40

41
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:59,280
there are lots of ready made animations that you can simply apply to your Flutter apps because brilliant
41

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,270
developers have created things and they've shared it with us on the Flutter packages. And we've also
42

43
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:12,370
got our fully customizable animation controllers and animations that we can build ourselves.
43

44
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,080
And this is where you have the most control over how it looks, how it behaves, what it does and you can
44

45
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,040
have a lot of control.
45

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,390
So those are the two sides of the coin and I hope that our deep dive into Flutter animations is going
46

47
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,780
to get you excited about putting animations in your next app.
