0
1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,700
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,860
So now that we've pretty much created all of the interface of our 'I Am Rich' app, we have a scaffold with
2

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,010
a app bar, a body, an image that comes from our assets in our images folder.
3

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:21,690
But there's just one thing that we still haven't got. We haven't got a custom app icon. For every single
4

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,640
app that you create using Flutter,
5

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,130
you get a default Flutter logo as your app icon.
6

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,290
Now if you start creating lots of apps, they can get very confusing very quickly. And besides, when you're uploading
7

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,500
it to the App Store, you don't want it to look like a default Flutter app.
8

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,330
Right?
9

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,090
So how do we give our apps an app icon.
10

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,410
Now first things first.
11

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,100
I want you to go ahead and download the 'I Am Rich' app icon from this current lesson.
12

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,290
There's a file that you can download and once you've downloaded it and open it, you should see an image
13

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,720
that looks something like this.
14

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,060
And then what you're going to do is you're gonna go to a website called appicon.co
15

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,680
And you're going to drag and drop your image
16

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,260
that's pretty large, into the place holder there.
17

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,670
And then we're going to select for all the platforms that we want to create an app icon for.
18

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,570
So we're going to uncheck iPad, watch and Mac. We're only going to generate icons for the iPhone and
19

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,520
Android.
20

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,570
Go ahead and click generate.
21

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,440
And you should be able download a zipped file that contains all of the icons that they've generated
22

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,430
for you.
23

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,880
If you have a peek inside here, you can see inside Android,
24

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,280
we've got some folders that contain different sized icons.
25

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,470
So for example this one is the smallest.
26

27
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:50,410
And this one is the largest Android icon. And it's done the same for iOS as well.
27

28
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,300
And it's inside the assets.xcassets folder.
28

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:01,950
The next thing we have to do is to actually move these assets into our current project. And to do that,
29

30
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,310
we're going to need the project navigator over here.
30

31
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:14,010
So remember I said that we have our iOS folder which contains all the files of our iOS  app, and our Android
31

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:21,720
folder that contains all the files of our Android app. And these files include the actual launcher icon
32

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,070
or the app icon if you will.
33

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,330
So let's first start with the Android app.
34

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,910
If you go into the app folder, then you go into src, then you go into main, and finally you go into
35

36
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,520
res.
36

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:43,900
You can see that we've got a whole bunch of folders here. And all of these that start with a mipmap 
37

38
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,130
are your app icon folders.
38

39
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:53,930
So if you select the res folder, right click and open 'Reveal in Finder',
39

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,630
it will locate that folder for you.
40

41
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,920
And if you're working on Windows, then when you right click on the folder, you should find something that
41

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,610
says, 'Show in Explorer' which is the equivalent of Finder on Windows.
42

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:15,230
But once we've got that folder found and we can open it up, we can have it side by side with the downloads
43

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,120
that we had from the app
44

45
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,320
icon.co website. And we open up the Android folder,
45

46
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,000
you can see that there's a couple of files that look pretty much the same as over here.
46

47
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,610
Right.
47

48
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,930
We've got a lot of mipmap folders.
48

49
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,890
So what I want you to do is to select everything inside the res folder that says mipmap, and you're
49

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,490
going to move it into your trash.
50

51
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,400
Now instead you're going to select all the ones that came from your android folder, your download off
51

52
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,240
of the appicon website, and you're going to drag it in.
52

53
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,240
And now that adds all of the app icons that were generated from our website, into our project.
53

54
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,460
So we're done with our Android project and we can collapse it. So onto the iOS project.
54

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,660
Now inside the iOS folder, we're going to open up the folder that's called Runner, not runner.xco
55

56
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,790
project, not runner
56

57
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,000
.xcoworkspace
57

58
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:18,210
but the actual runner folder. And here, we have something called assets.xcassets which is where our
58

59
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,850
app icons actually live.
59

60
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:27,540
And you can see that at the moment, there are different resolutions of the Flutter default icon.
60

61
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,380
So let's change that.
61

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,630
We're going to right click on the assets.xcassets folder, and we're going to, again 'Reveal in Finder'
62

63
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,980
or 'Show in Explorer' and we're going to have our windows side by side again.
63

64
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,530
And on the left the Runner is of course, our iOS app.
64

65
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,650
And on the right we've got the images from our app icons download.
65

66
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,630
And then we're going to delete the assets.xcassets folder from our Runner over here.
66

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,500
So we're just going to drag that again to trash or COMMAND + backspace, to delete. And then I'm going to
67

68
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,060
drag the same one from the downloaded file into here.
68

69
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:15,310
And if you've done everything that I've just said we should now have app icons for both our iOS and Android
69

70
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,880
app.
70

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,070
I'm going to go ahead and launch my Android emulator.
71

72
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,290
So now I'm going to make sure I've got my Android emulator selected, and I'm going to go ahead and click
72

73
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,660
run.
73

74
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,730
And we now have our app showing up on our Android phone.
74

75
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,090
And if I click on the home button,
75

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:45,240
and drag up to show all of my apps, you can see that we've got our 'I Am Rich' app right here with the
76

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,710
custom icon.
77

78
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,800
Now if you're an Android user, you might have noticed that within the past few years, Google has pretty
78

79
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,240
dramatically changed the styling of the app icons.
79

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,770
What used to be square icons with transparencies and different shapes, has now been pretty much unified
80

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,000
into these circular icons. And you can see with our 'I Am Rich' icon even though we're providing the right
81

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,030
sized assets for the app icon,
82

83
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,970
it gets this white circle around it which some of you may or may not like.
83

84
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,040
And in the wild, I've seen some app designers deciding to go along with this style, but others have decided
84

85
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,230
to embrace the circular icon.
85

86
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,680
So I want to quickly show you how you can do this
86

87
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:42,240
also. Inside our project folder, if we expand the Android folder and we go to app, source, main, then we're
87

88
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,540
going to right click on the res folder, gonna click on new and were gonna select 'Image Asset'. And then
88

89
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:56,480
we get into our image asset configuration wizard. And we get to pick a path, or namely the starting image.
89

90
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,690
I'm gonna go ahead and pick our 'I Am Rich' app icon, and I'm going to click on open and then it's going
90

91
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,460
to show you your icon in all sorts of different configurations.
91

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,070
Square, rounded square, square called circle etc.
92

93
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:18,930
And what you can do is you can resize the image so that it fits into the space that you want it to be
93

94
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,550
seen in.
94

95
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,580
If you're going for your round icon, or your legacy icon, you can see in all of these scenarios, it still
95

96
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,690
looks good.
96

97
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,840
The diamond is still within the circle.
97

98
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,030
So once you're done adjusting, go ahead and click next. And then it's going to replace all of the places
98

99
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,440
we had our previous images with the new ones.
99

100
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,610
It's going to be overwritten by this.
100

101
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,990
And that's exactly what we want.
101

102
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,900
So go ahead and click finish.
102

103
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:55,080
And now it added the files that we've edited, and we can go ahead and run our up again. Now that our app
103

104
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,040
has started again,
104

105
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,800
I'm going to click on the home button, and when we drag up our menu, you can see our new icon fills the
105

106
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
entire space of the circle.
106

107
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,400
And to my eyes at least, I think that looks a lot better.
107

108
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,650
It's up to you which style you want to choose.
108

109
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:16,230
You can go for sort of like the calculator app, the calendar app style, where you've got your square icon
109

110
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,670
within a circle, or you can fill up the entire circle with your design.
110

111
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,810
But these are the two ways that you can incorporate your Android app icon.
111

112
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:34,280
And if I run the app on the iPhone, you can see that my app icon has also updated to the one that I want.
112

113
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,100
So this is a really easy way of updating your Android and iOS app icons.
113

114
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:47,480
And if you want different app icons, then you can simply use a different image and only generate the
114

115
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,840
iPhone sets, or only generate the Android sets and replace them as you need to.
115

116
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,250
So this has been pretty fun.
116

117
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:02,030
We've built an app complete with an app icon, with image assets, and all the good parts of any mobile
117

118
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,700
app.
118

119
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,890
So now we have to do is to run it on a physical device. For all of that and more,  I'll see on the next lesson.
