00:00.480 --> 00:01.800
Hey what's up guys.

00:01.940 --> 00:05.220
Well come to one more lesson in today's lesson.

00:05.250 --> 00:13.050
You're going to learn what is the famous word press loop and how it works before we really get into

00:13.050 --> 00:15.810
the explanation of what the loop is.

00:15.830 --> 00:19.860
I'm going to show you what I prepared to streamline this lesson.

00:20.070 --> 00:26.190
So here is the index that BHB file I have already added the classes related to bootstrap.

00:26.340 --> 00:34.530
You can see here that I just added the containers rows and columns related to classes for each section

00:34.590 --> 00:35.590
of the file.

00:35.670 --> 00:39.700
You have already learned how to do that in the previous lessons.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.590
Thus I really don't think there's any more secret for you here.

00:43.860 --> 00:49.070
Here in the food pitch file I've created a device called copyright.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.380
Also inside the bootstrap structure.

00:51.540 --> 00:57.540
So there's nothing really new here only age email tags and CSSA classes.

00:57.810 --> 01:05.960
And we have created a new menu to this for us left as an exercise in our last lesson remember and see

01:05.960 --> 01:07.950
if your solution looks like mine.

01:08.130 --> 01:14.820
If it's not you can't pass this video and correct it or you can copy this line of code from the files

01:14.820 --> 01:21.030
available for download as you know they are all available in the first section of discourse.

01:21.090 --> 01:27.530
In my case the menus like is footer underscore menu but yours may have a different name.

01:27.540 --> 01:33.090
No problem as long as this look is the same as defined in the functions file.

01:33.150 --> 01:39.160
So just like here must be the same as the string we have here.

01:39.180 --> 01:46.020
I also added this new menu in the CSSA file so it will display in line as well.

01:46.020 --> 01:51.460
Another thing we did was create in the administration three new posts.

01:51.480 --> 01:55.900
These are only simple posts with some dummy content.

01:55.950 --> 02:04.230
Each of them are within some categories which have also created and they have a couple of tags to help

02:04.230 --> 02:08.790
us show the post content which is the purpose of today's lesson.

02:08.790 --> 02:10.990
You should then create your own posts.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.580
Ok I believe you know how to do that.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.880
Just go over to the boss menu and create your post there.

02:17.910 --> 02:21.880
That said let's move on to today's lesson.

02:21.890 --> 02:25.980
Today we're going to learn how to make our theme more dynamic.

02:26.010 --> 02:32.160
It will be then the first time something will really happen when they click on any link and change the

02:32.160 --> 02:34.740
content of boards and pages.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.000
So what is the word.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.130
BRESLOW if you look at the Wordpress codecs you'll find the explanation there.

02:42.590 --> 02:51.710
So here WordPress theme says that the loop is a peach code used by WordPress to display posts and here's

02:51.710 --> 02:53.060
a quick question.

02:53.180 --> 03:01.640
What do we mean by posts posts and not just regular posts but static pages are considered to be post

03:01.660 --> 03:04.820
to for example the about us page.

03:04.850 --> 03:06.740
The contact page etc..

03:08.990 --> 03:17.060
Using the loop WordPress processes each post to be displayed on the current page and FIRMAT set according

03:17.060 --> 03:23.070
to how it matches specified criteria within the loop tags within the loop.

03:23.090 --> 03:28.850
We can tell WordPress to show the title of each post the content of the entire post.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.360
Or is Nippert of this content.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.680
The docs used the categories of this posts.

03:34.740 --> 03:43.250
All this is done with a combination of ational text and ph comments any male or BHB code in the loop

03:43.550 --> 03:46.190
will be processed on each post.

03:46.190 --> 03:50.020
Then it should serve as a template to display your posts.

03:50.240 --> 03:56.840
Well to illustrate what this loop will be in practice that's open the Wordpress themes repository page

04:02.440 --> 04:03.900
here on the page.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.130
I want to find a theme called fluey the

04:09.150 --> 04:10.540
and here it is.

04:10.650 --> 04:15.750
I'll go ahead and click on More info and then on preview.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.740
At the top of the theme.

04:20.770 --> 04:26.660
There are several examples of what a loop looks like but let's scroll down to the bottom of the page

04:32.080 --> 04:39.620
this region shown here which shows the category the post-Idol the author the publication date.

04:39.670 --> 04:46.030
An excerpt from The Post and the ellipsis and a link that leads to the full post.

04:46.210 --> 04:51.120
As you can see is repeated in several other parts of the site.

04:51.130 --> 04:54.750
All of this can be created inside the Word Press.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.800
Let's go back to subline them.

04:57.750 --> 05:03.490
We'll be creating our loop right here where we have the word news.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.090
Let's make some space here.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.510
And let's start creating.

05:07.510 --> 05:10.760
Look inside pitch tags.

05:10.770 --> 05:14.360
Let's start by saying the following is WordPress.

05:14.370 --> 05:19.230
Have any posts if Heff posts.

05:20.580 --> 05:27.040
Run for president something while there are posts do something else.

05:27.060 --> 05:40.050
So while half posts and that something else is simply bringing in the post for us the post so while

05:40.050 --> 05:47.100
has Bouffes the post let's just type in some comments to make it easier to understand what is going

05:47.100 --> 05:49.190
on.

05:49.230 --> 05:56.220
So if you have any post published why WordPress can't find those posts it will show them on screen.

05:56.250 --> 06:03.870
Regardless of how many posts are found in the database later on you'll see that we can't even control

06:03.870 --> 06:11.490
the amount of posts returned by the database and those posts will be called here in this exact space

06:11.490 --> 06:12.000
here.

06:12.180 --> 06:16.840
But according to some formit and that for we are going to define it soon.

06:17.070 --> 06:20.890
But in case no post was found we have to predict this too.

06:21.330 --> 06:24.550
Let's reopen the page bit here below.

06:25.140 --> 06:28.450
And why comment which started up here.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.630
And just below.

06:30.700 --> 06:36.600
We're going to use the else command to determine what will happen if no posts are found.

06:36.610 --> 06:38.500
So let's open a paragraph below.

06:41.310 --> 06:42.280
Or something like that.

06:44.140 --> 06:52.980
And finally let's close out the east block that we started here and is.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.270
So let's recap.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.670
I want this to be very clear to you.

06:56.670 --> 06:57.150
OK.

06:57.340 --> 07:02.780
We started the dynamic Harington WordPress to check for posts in the database.

07:02.890 --> 07:10.140
For now let's not worry about the kind of post that will be returned if there are posts then they start

07:10.140 --> 07:15.930
our do in fact loop itself goes from this why is statement here and why.

07:16.260 --> 07:19.190
Why all posts are found in the database.

07:19.280 --> 07:24.330
Will tell Word Press to show each post found one at a time.

07:24.640 --> 07:27.920
So let's say that two posts are found.

07:28.030 --> 07:34.240
The data from the first post will be loaded and shown on the screen according to a specific form with

07:34.690 --> 07:41.920
which we have not yet defined but you Hughson the code will reach the end while person and check that

07:41.920 --> 07:45.550
there is still one post left to be loaded.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.410
It will then go back up here.

07:47.680 --> 07:55.150
Starting a new loop and all the data from the second post when there are no more posts to look comes

07:55.150 --> 07:58.040
to its And and the code continues on.

07:58.090 --> 08:04.480
In our case the code will continue running and which this person here where later on will have a map

08:04.900 --> 08:06.540
and the story goes on.

08:06.910 --> 08:15.280
I know it's so wonderful a here I must agree but if there are no balls to play the loop doesn't even

08:15.430 --> 08:17.130
start running.

08:17.140 --> 08:23.150
The code jumps directly to the else block and shows this small message here.

08:23.560 --> 08:29.660
OK but the way it is at the moment our code still doesn't show any content on the screen.

08:29.800 --> 08:35.540
We still need to define how we want the parts to be presented so we need to add a new channel markup

08:35.560 --> 08:42.930
here and then display the content for each M.Tech dynamically using some WordPress functions WordPress

08:42.970 --> 08:50.860
has some buten functions to print the post-Idol the author tags the publication date and several other

08:50.860 --> 08:56.160
information from books were pressed simply call them template tags.

08:56.170 --> 09:01.710
There are a large number of them but for this lesson we are going to use only the main ones.

09:01.960 --> 09:07.700
I started by creating an email article tag within this article.

09:07.720 --> 09:15.160
You're going to create a page to tag 681 tags you already be used in the headers of each section just

09:15.160 --> 09:16.480
below a paragraph.

09:16.490 --> 09:17.900
Let's type in here.

09:18.120 --> 09:25.430
Posted in by and three more paragraphs below this

09:30.740 --> 09:39.020
in the first one I want to type in categories and later on you'll see what the last two paragraphs are

09:39.020 --> 09:39.670
for.

09:39.930 --> 09:44.570
OK first content we want here is the post-Idol to do this dynamically.

09:44.570 --> 09:48.300
We need to use the Wordpress function called the title.

09:48.500 --> 09:58.140
So let's type in here the underscore title within the page besides for the dates you're going to use

09:58.140 --> 10:03.630
an other function called Get to date.

10:03.830 --> 10:07.210
But in order for it to work you have to act out.

10:07.400 --> 10:14.780
Here's a tip for you guys usually WordPress functions that start with the word get need to be Echo out

10:15.350 --> 10:22.030
there only use to retrieve a certain value but don't display that value on the screen to show it when

10:22.060 --> 10:25.160
need you use the echo command.

10:25.160 --> 10:31.480
Now we want to show a link that can be used to take us to our first page for that particular post.

10:31.820 --> 10:38.590
And for this let's use the owl for post link function for categories.

10:38.830 --> 10:45.160
We use a template tag called the category.

10:45.260 --> 10:50.900
One other thing I forgot to say is that some of these functions accept parameters that we can pass inside

10:50.900 --> 10:52.030
the prince.

10:52.460 --> 10:59.420
This function call the categories one of them the first parameter that this function accepts is a separator

10:59.800 --> 11:03.990
since posts in one breast can belong to more than one category.

11:04.250 --> 11:10.640
If you want to separate the names of all categories by space you can type out the space inside single

11:10.640 --> 11:11.850
quotation marks.

11:11.930 --> 11:17.870
And this corresponds to the first parameter of the function which is separator.

11:17.870 --> 11:24.470
Now in the next paragraph let's make a list of Dag's the function this time is stag's.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.590
It also accepts parameters.

11:26.660 --> 11:33.590
The first one is any text that will be shown before the list of tags as type in here tags.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.500
And the second is the separator.

11:36.770 --> 11:38.870
Let's use a comma as separator.

11:38.870 --> 11:39.570
OK.

11:40.160 --> 11:46.400
And finally the last paragraph will be used to show the post content itself which is everything we insert

11:46.460 --> 11:49.070
into the bay post editing area.

11:49.340 --> 11:53.910
For this let's call a function name the content.

11:53.920 --> 11:59.580
Now the FIRMAT is complete and we can see if our first loop will actually work.

11:59.590 --> 12:01.360
Keep your fingers crossed.

12:01.570 --> 12:04.350
And we want to refresh the front end.

12:05.290 --> 12:08.090
And here it is our loop is working.

12:08.230 --> 12:16.390
You realize that as I told you the loop was executed three times bringing Tripos from the database.

12:16.530 --> 12:22.330
Each of them with the format that we defined as go ahead and inspect one of them

12:28.580 --> 12:38.710
and look we have the article and within that the content of each post with Chido publication date also

12:38.760 --> 12:42.680
link content here in the content.

12:42.690 --> 12:48.240
You'll see that we have a list of categories when you have more than one.

12:48.270 --> 12:50.950
There was a space separating each item.

12:51.150 --> 12:54.960
Same thing for the comma separated list of tags.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.700
Now there is one more test.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.570
What happens when there is no pause to be shown.

12:59.670 --> 13:05.480
Let's do this let's go back to the dashboard sent all to trash

13:08.610 --> 13:10.750
and let's refresh our page again.

13:12.470 --> 13:16.040
And perfect.

13:16.390 --> 13:25.420
Now as no published false has been found we have this message popping up well let's restore our posts

13:25.540 --> 13:28.150
as we will need them for the next lessons.

13:32.310 --> 13:37.040
Well but we still have two big problems to solve here.

13:37.140 --> 13:43.460
The first one you notice when we click the links to each page of the site for example is actually here

13:43.460 --> 13:52.030
on about is notice that we also have a loop here and the loop is printing out the post-Idol which in

13:52.030 --> 13:59.020
this case is the best idol since pages are also considered types of posts by WordPress.

13:59.620 --> 14:06.970
We have here the word categories where we don't have any category because pages don't have categories.

14:07.150 --> 14:19.310
Publication Date Author and the page contain the same thing happens if you click on blog or on contact.

14:19.540 --> 14:21.660
But that's not what you want.

14:21.880 --> 14:25.600
We want the content of this inner pages to be different.

14:25.960 --> 14:31.040
Let's go to the second problem the home page shows us a list of posts.

14:31.150 --> 14:34.660
This listing should only appear on the blog page.

14:34.660 --> 14:41.070
However the blog page currently only shows the content we've included on a page called Blog.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.670
That is the role of this two pages.

14:43.690 --> 14:45.560
It's totally inverted.

14:45.850 --> 14:58.510
To solve this we go over to our dashboard settings menu reading now here where it says front page displays.

14:58.680 --> 15:07.790
Let's say that the home page will show a static page this page is going to be our home page and the

15:07.790 --> 15:12.330
Post page is going to be the blog page.

15:12.380 --> 15:20.060
Go ahead and save this and now when we visit the home page we see the contents of that WordPress static

15:20.060 --> 15:24.510
page called home and then click on blog.

15:24.650 --> 15:30.380
We have a listing of all the posts Great saw for this lesson.

15:30.550 --> 15:31.710
I hope you enjoyed it.

15:31.750 --> 15:35.370
And I also hope you feel like you learned something new today.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.850
But as ever it doesn't end here in the next lesson.

15:38.860 --> 15:41.710
We'll have more of them.

15:41.890 --> 15:42.350
Coding.
