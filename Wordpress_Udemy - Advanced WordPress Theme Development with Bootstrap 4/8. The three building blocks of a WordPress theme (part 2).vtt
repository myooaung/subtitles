00:00.550 --> 00:06.880
Hey what's going on guys in this lesson we go ahead and keep creating our basic building blocks for

00:06.880 --> 00:08.070
the word breastfeeding.

00:08.410 --> 00:11.590
So picking up where we left off in the last lesson.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.370
I'm going to start by selecting this region that will become later on the thing.

00:16.370 --> 00:22.220
Heller the selection will have to go from the beginning of the age amount should the end of the header

00:22.230 --> 00:26.650
tag is part of the code is going to be repeated on every page.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.620
So let's cut out the selection

00:32.630 --> 00:42.610
save file and create a new one the name of this new file is going to be header heterodoxy BHB Rosello

00:42.730 --> 00:50.160
that's the name of this file have to be header B yet it must be header that BHB.

00:50.210 --> 00:56.930
And later on you understand why no need to paste everything you just copy it in there.

00:57.100 --> 01:03.910
And now we have our header that will repeat at the top for all pages are in.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.270
Let's go back to the next that.

01:07.670 --> 01:12.100
In the next election we go from the footer tag to the end of the file.

01:13.010 --> 01:22.240
Let's select and cut again and let's create another file called footer that BHP and again integration

01:22.330 --> 01:23.910
doesn't have to be footer.

01:24.130 --> 01:27.730
Yes it must be footer that the edge be

01:31.230 --> 01:32.170
what is left now.

01:32.220 --> 01:37.080
We correspond to our index that BGP file the dynamic part of the scene.

01:37.080 --> 01:37.770
OK.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.970
Well what happens if you open the home page right now.

01:42.970 --> 01:48.170
So let's flip tabs now and go over to our browser.

01:48.430 --> 01:55.810
By the way for now and the end of the scores I'll be using Firefox Developer Edition as our main browser.

01:55.810 --> 02:00.300
I believe it's a good choice since it's a browser tailored for web developers.

02:00.310 --> 02:04.600
So let's give it a try as you can see.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.080
Nothing came up.

02:06.280 --> 02:14.240
But if we inspect the code you'll see that we have the HDMI else structure with abody the content the

02:14.280 --> 02:15.740
tags.

02:15.820 --> 02:22.540
But look do you remember that we had left the paragraphs we serve as a reference to us where is that

02:22.540 --> 02:30.280
paragraph and I thing I told you about a class function with some classes inside the body tag.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.990
Hey Marcello I think it didn't work.

02:33.040 --> 02:42.450
You may see there are all of those glasses everyone who has a basic understanding of BHB knows that

02:42.450 --> 02:49.590
we can load bytes of a PH file with the include command where press has some functions similar to this

02:49.620 --> 02:51.600
but a bit different.

02:51.630 --> 02:58.290
There are very specific WordPress functions that can load the header and the food in our index that

02:58.310 --> 03:04.970
BHP will load the headers from here up and the footer from here down.

03:05.280 --> 03:10.220
So we have to load them here and here.

03:10.710 --> 03:11.970
But how we do that.

03:12.240 --> 03:20.310
All right we'll be using two basic WordPress functions that are get on the score header misfunction

03:20.490 --> 03:23.640
loads a file that is named header that page.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.770
And now you understand why this file must be called header.

03:27.890 --> 03:29.760
Please be OK.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.680
And the other function.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.660
Can you imagine what it's called.

03:33.870 --> 03:34.430
Yes.

03:34.550 --> 03:37.200
Get on the score footer.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.630
Let's see if it all this works.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.100
So let's go back to Firefox.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.430
And refresh the homepage.

03:45.610 --> 03:46.480
And here it is.

03:46.480 --> 03:53.710
Now our paragraph is showing that referenced paragraph from the header file and also the name of the

03:53.710 --> 04:03.670
page is showing up coming from the age H.M. title tag and inspect the page as I told you that function

04:03.700 --> 04:05.750
in the body finally word.

04:06.100 --> 04:06.840
Look here.

04:06.940 --> 04:10.160
Class home and blog.

04:10.300 --> 04:18.550
So the home page has these two classes we could use CSSA and create a specific Karylle for all H-1 paragraphs

04:18.850 --> 04:20.230
which belong to the home page.

04:20.230 --> 04:26.260
For example they would be different from those on the inner pages on thing.

04:26.380 --> 04:31.880
This is just a very simple example but it can make even more complex things.

04:31.900 --> 04:38.290
So Marcello does it mean that if I download the thing from the Internet let's say a pure HVM Alphyn

04:38.650 --> 04:43.360
not created for Wordpress or that template I created myself.

04:43.360 --> 04:49.380
Also in pure age email baseplate them the way you just start to work.

04:49.530 --> 04:50.980
Of course that will work.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.530
But first you have to be aware of a couple of things.

04:54.550 --> 05:02.050
For example you have to create a new folder create a new style that says file with the rules.

05:02.050 --> 05:08.500
I explained in the previous lessons and split the template index file into three.

05:08.830 --> 05:15.490
I'm going to use as an example a template that I downloaded from a free ational template Web site.

05:15.540 --> 05:19.590
It will be available to you as additional material for this course.

05:19.590 --> 05:20.240
OK.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.790
The same page has an index that H.M.S. on file.

05:24.040 --> 05:31.900
If you open up this file we will visually see that the same page also has a header that repeats on all

05:31.900 --> 05:34.210
pages.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.970
It has a whole page going down.

05:38.970 --> 05:43.210
I have the whole home page and then the footer.

05:43.770 --> 05:48.310
If we click to open a new page we have the same footer here.

05:51.470 --> 05:55.250
Let's go ahead and inspect the code.

05:55.340 --> 06:02.170
We can see that this upper area here has a class of Nerf bar.

06:02.240 --> 06:11.460
If we open the index that H.M. file in sublime I see if we can't find this nav bar class.

06:11.600 --> 06:17.150
Now pay attention this whole region here would correspond to the head of that speech file.

06:17.150 --> 06:25.120
If we were in a WordPress theme let's cut out this whole part and replace the contents of the head of

06:25.130 --> 06:26.840
that file.

06:31.930 --> 06:35.460
Now let's identify where our footer starts.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.540
It starts here in the tag.

06:40.740 --> 06:44.760
Let's look for the stack in the index not a G-mail file.

06:47.710 --> 06:49.290
So we found it here.

06:49.780 --> 06:56.290
Now let's get out this whole region here and pasted inside different Abebe of our theme

07:00.560 --> 07:05.080
and the remainder of the code will be relative to the next that page.

07:05.670 --> 07:09.720
Let's cut it out and replace the next dot BHB.

07:10.340 --> 07:16.830
But of course let's just leave the cost to the get header and get footer functions.

07:20.110 --> 07:23.860
Now if you look at the home page again let's refresh the page

07:29.810 --> 07:36.690
I can see that what is showing here is the structure of that 20:00 template that we downloaded.

07:36.960 --> 07:44.340
Well of course as you can see here the base is completely broken and one because the files from this

07:44.340 --> 07:48.740
downloaded thing don't exist in our themes folder.

07:48.810 --> 07:56.430
If we check the header database file you'll see that the path of the CSSA files points to files that

07:56.430 --> 07:59.220
don't exist that we simply don't have.

07:59.610 --> 08:02.420
But the basic idea is here given to you.

08:02.520 --> 08:09.450
But of course if it's your intention you have to make no adjustments to make the code work within Wordpress

08:10.170 --> 08:13.240
and that's it in the next lesson.

08:13.250 --> 08:18.320
You're going to learn how to load starship's that in wordpress the right way.

08:18.530 --> 08:20.930
So see then happy coding.
