Little guys in our last lesson as you remember we started working with a search template file based

00:08.050 --> 00:09.090
on our tests.

00:09.130 --> 00:12.830
We can say it's fully functional but there's still the question.

00:13.090 --> 00:16.850
Is it possible to change the appearance of the search box itself.

00:17.230 --> 00:22.760
This is an important question since we didn't even create a form for this search box yet.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.880
So how can we change the appearance of a thing.

00:25.930 --> 00:29.160
We didn't create just start talking about that.

00:29.290 --> 00:33.540
We're going to have to dig into some theory but I promise it won't hurt.

00:33.580 --> 00:34.180
OK.

00:35.830 --> 00:41.980
Now you remember from the previous lesson that if you want to include a search box in our thing used

00:42.010 --> 00:47.460
to get search form function but in fact what does this function do.

00:47.610 --> 00:51.770
She answer that they have to take a look at the word Codex.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.570
So let's search for this function

01:01.680 --> 01:03.870
and click on the first search result.

01:05.580 --> 01:13.890
Well here it says display search form will first attempt to locate the search from that page profile

01:14.190 --> 01:20.140
in either the child or the parent they mean child or parent themes here.

01:20.160 --> 01:26.340
Then below that if it does not exist then the default search for will be displayed.

01:26.370 --> 01:30.450
In fact that default search form is what you're currently loading.

01:30.510 --> 01:36.360
Since we don't have any file called search form that page be in our thing do we.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.480
No we don't.

01:37.530 --> 01:42.660
So by logic it's enough if we just create that file in our theme.

01:42.960 --> 01:48.420
By doing that we will be able to modify our search from our search box.

01:48.450 --> 01:50.180
So let's go ahead and create the file

01:56.190 --> 01:58.040
and see if it's working.

01:58.370 --> 02:02.110
If it's working anything we type in here it will be displayed.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.840
In place of our search form.

02:04.690 --> 02:10.360
That's just typing test and let's see what happens.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.420
OK perfect.

02:15.420 --> 02:21.360
This means that we can't create a brand new form within this file with a different markup etc..

02:22.090 --> 02:29.620
What before I do that a hint if you don't want to have a lot of work to do this which is always interesting

02:30.220 --> 02:36.210
it can open the search form that page profile of any native WordPress theme and copy it.

02:36.250 --> 02:43.000
For example let's look at a 26 things things folder and let's copy what's inside the search form that

02:43.000 --> 02:47.830
page file space everything in our new file.

02:48.850 --> 02:53.090
And now we can define what we want to exclude or to include here.

02:53.110 --> 02:59.480
For example we want to remove this label search for and the rest will stay.

02:59.550 --> 03:04.530
All you have here is a form that uses the get method to perform a search.

03:04.530 --> 03:10.350
Notice that the tag has a function called Get search query.

03:10.350 --> 03:13.350
This will bring the search term back into the form.

03:13.440 --> 03:20.820
At every new search this function is very useful later on the scores we'll see more about it.

03:20.940 --> 03:27.530
So let's save and then reload the page.

03:27.550 --> 03:33.700
Not bad but as you can see the appearance is still a little ugly.

03:33.700 --> 03:38.100
To fix that let's modify our boot CSSA classes a little

03:46.550 --> 03:56.050
and let's also replace this word here with an OK let's just save everything and go back to the thing

03:57.200 --> 03:59.700
reload page.

03:59.830 --> 04:02.130
So now it's much better.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.670
Ok that's it.

04:03.670 --> 04:06.430
Now I have a very simple search form.

04:06.670 --> 04:12.970
If you want it we could also remove this button which will force the user to use the Enter key to do

04:12.970 --> 04:15.840
the search but do not do that.

04:16.250 --> 04:19.280
OK I have two exercises to propose to you.

04:19.420 --> 04:24.180
The first one is to try to load the search form here at the sidebar.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.340
That's easy but I think a little.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.850
How could you do that.

04:28.930 --> 04:35.590
The second one is a bit more complicated and I'll bring the correct answer in the next lesson.

04:35.590 --> 04:44.230
Notice that among the search results we also have pages not just posts as you know pages don't have

04:44.230 --> 04:51.220
categories so in the search results we have the word category followed by an empty space.

04:51.220 --> 04:53.740
How did you remove this snippet here.

04:53.800 --> 05:03.200
For every search results related to a page I can't search for a WordPress function called has category.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.760
In the next lesson I'll be back with the answer.

05:06.850 --> 05:08.970
Joe then unhappy calling.
