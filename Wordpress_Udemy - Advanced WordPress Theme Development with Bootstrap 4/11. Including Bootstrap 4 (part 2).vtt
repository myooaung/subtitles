Hello guys in this lesson we are going to test our first bootstrap classes.

00:05.940 --> 00:11.610
Let's check if everything that is in the last lesson plan included bootstrapped for in our theme.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.080
It's really working.

00:14.050 --> 00:19.810
Before testing whether bootstrap is working we need to add a new tag in the head of that speech peafowl

00:20.050 --> 00:26.080
that tag is relative to the viewport which is the visible part of the screen Anvar eyes from device

00:26.080 --> 00:32.800
to device the viewpoints and ensures that the site content will respond correctly regardless of the

00:32.800 --> 00:33.880
viewport.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.710
In fact I already have that tag at hand.

00:36.910 --> 00:43.000
To be honest I just copied the Dagh from one of the native world's best features and you can do the

00:43.000 --> 00:43.830
same.

00:43.840 --> 00:50.470
In fact I recommend that you do the same because it's faster and it's reliable.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.560
So let's face it here.

00:52.960 --> 01:00.070
Well I will not explain in detail what each of these properties mean but it's important that you include

01:00.070 --> 01:01.210
that tag right.

01:01.270 --> 01:06.230
Otherwise your site may look totally weird on a phone or on a tablet.

01:06.370 --> 01:07.360
And we don't want this.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.030
OK.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.810
So let's go ahead and save this file.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.430
And now we can test bootstrap using this file the header dot pitch.

01:16.960 --> 01:21.090
Let's remove this paragraph because we don't need it any more.

01:22.100 --> 01:26.600
Now how does bootstrap work to help us understand.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.680
I'm going to show you an image from the design model website.

01:31.250 --> 01:39.080
Well as you see in the image briefly the basis of this tool is a great system must draft columns in

01:39.080 --> 01:44.870
which we can distribute the content of the site the content itself is centered within a special class

01:44.870 --> 01:52.610
called container sized eyes according to the device that is used to view the site content inside these

01:52.610 --> 01:53.520
containers.

01:53.540 --> 02:02.000
We have the rogues and those roles can be distributed over 12 columns all of the sizes are controlled

02:02.000 --> 02:03.860
by CSX classes.

02:03.860 --> 02:08.180
That's why we've included the new sensors file in our functions file.

02:08.270 --> 02:16.280
In the last lesson there was a CSSA class for the container for the row and for the column sizes.

02:16.490 --> 02:23.560
We can also define specific column sizes for large medium small and extra small devices.

02:23.690 --> 02:27.260
Great but let's see that in practice.

02:27.500 --> 02:35.850
Let's create a new DIV tag inside the top bar section and we want to add the container class to it.

02:37.130 --> 02:44.570
That class is specific to bootstrap to use it you just need to add it to the elements you want within

02:44.570 --> 02:55.470
the Stith you want to create a new one with the row class.

02:55.480 --> 03:04.270
Now let's say that social media will have a leave of 10 columns in extra large devices eight columns

03:04.330 --> 03:11.460
in medium sized and small devices and a width of six columns for extra small devices like smartphones

03:11.470 --> 03:12.880
for example.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.570
To do this let's add the call Xcel 10

03:19.490 --> 03:31.890
code and the eight call as am 8 and code six classes to the social media icons Steve as to the same

03:31.890 --> 03:37.870
for the search death but now we want to set and other values for extra large size.

03:37.890 --> 03:44.670
We are going to have two columns for medium and small sizes for Callum's

03:47.880 --> 03:53.010
and then for the extras small size six columns.

03:53.520 --> 03:58.730
Notice that the sum of all columns within the same row never exceeds 12.

03:58.950 --> 04:03.930
So ten and two or six and six equals 12.

04:04.220 --> 04:09.330
Is that another special bootstrap class to the search diff text right.

04:09.420 --> 04:15.630
And this class because this there flows to the right but can also add some more rules to the census

04:15.630 --> 04:22.410
file which will only help us notice the difference between these two areas here as open up the template

04:22.410 --> 04:26.490
that says file and add the following lines.

04:26.580 --> 04:38.620
Social media icons background green hide 30 pixels search

04:43.800 --> 04:52.190
background yellow high 30 pixels I save the file.

04:52.220 --> 05:02.980
And finally previewed the changes and when really low the page Herodias everything is working its def

05:03.020 --> 05:06.850
has the sizes specified and the color was set.

05:06.860 --> 05:12.320
Now if you resize the browser you see that the columns are stacking correctly as well.

05:13.430 --> 05:15.800
It's like magic isn't it.

05:15.810 --> 05:19.700
So you can test that out later on your own one right.

05:19.710 --> 05:24.870
For example you can change the bootstrap classes and new ones you name it.

05:24.990 --> 05:27.470
It can be a very good exercise.

05:28.570 --> 05:29.870
Well that's for now.

05:29.950 --> 05:33.460
I hope you like this lesson and I see you in the next one.
