00:00.540 --> 00:09.030
Hello again and welcome back in the last lesson we started creating our first style that CSSA file in

00:09.030 --> 00:10.090
today's lesson.

00:10.170 --> 00:11.600
Go ahead inactivate.

00:11.610 --> 00:19.860
Our first thing in the world press and I mean so let's begin as go ahead and continue editing the style

00:19.860 --> 00:23.140
that says file this time we'll type in here.

00:23.190 --> 00:32.020
The themes version something that we don't have yet mistyping here version our version would be one

00:32.200 --> 00:32.850
point.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.560
For now since this is the first version of the thing.

00:36.780 --> 00:38.930
But what for.

00:39.040 --> 00:45.410
Let's imagine you send this thing to the Wordpress repository and make it available for download.

00:45.640 --> 00:51.640
When you the author release a new version of the theme we're press you'll be able to recognize that

00:51.700 --> 00:58.020
there is a new version available and ask the site owner to activate the thing on the dashboard.

00:58.270 --> 01:05.530
If you visit the page where WordPress offers the free things you'll notice that all the things that

01:05.530 --> 01:07.470
are there follow this rule.

01:07.780 --> 01:16.620
So let's open up our browser and the address is WordPress dot o or G for Slash themes.

01:21.830 --> 01:25.260
And here we have a list of many many things.

01:25.730 --> 01:32.110
If you click on More info for any of these themes you'll see that they all have a screenshot.

01:32.150 --> 01:37.830
The Sims update information seems your L and the description of.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.610
Are the things that we can't see here.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.730
Are tags but what are they for.

01:43.900 --> 01:51.100
Basically Blistex act as search facilitators So anyone looking for something with certain characteristics

01:51.100 --> 01:55.950
can find it easier since they are all identified by these tags.

01:55.960 --> 02:02.800
For example let's assume you want to download a thing that has a left sidebar or is either a single

02:02.800 --> 02:08.560
page or is a thing that targets educational websites or has two columns.

02:08.590 --> 02:15.250
Anyway it's fodder for and it can do that for our film as well as go back to the editor.

02:15.490 --> 02:22.970
We type in here Daggs and start inserting our tags but not that fast.

02:23.020 --> 02:25.150
There are some rules to follow here.

02:25.300 --> 02:32.350
If this is a thing you are uploading to the Wordpress repository you should follow the list of tags

02:32.440 --> 02:33.640
available on the site.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.440
Will be visiting now.

02:35.530 --> 02:40.270
By the way I'll make this link available as an additional information for this lesson OK.

02:40.540 --> 02:48.310
But again see if we scroll down a bit that we have a list of tags I think can use and the rules.

02:48.310 --> 02:52.690
The thing that should fulfill should be allowed to use that tag.

02:52.690 --> 02:56.440
So it's not enough just to have a list of tags.

02:56.440 --> 03:03.330
For example if your field has a text called full with template it must be in this format.

03:03.340 --> 03:11.080
I mean it really must have a full width template is not enough to just write or create a list of tags

03:11.200 --> 03:12.680
out of nothing.

03:12.800 --> 03:18.360
So let's go back once again to the editor and write out a list of tags here.

03:18.370 --> 03:23.220
According to our So two columns

03:27.130 --> 03:35.430
left sidebar custom Hatter custom menu

03:37.900 --> 03:39.220
custom logo

03:42.770 --> 03:50.230
blog if you say desire and go back to the admin area you'll see that this information becomes available

03:50.560 --> 03:53.710
once we submit this thing to WordPress.

03:53.710 --> 03:56.590
If this is your intention of course the word breasting.

03:56.620 --> 04:03.420
We also receive that information as you can see our tags are all here now.

04:03.580 --> 04:07.140
And also the version that we just informed.

04:07.600 --> 04:12.740
So this is the easiest way to create a theme WordPress look at this.

04:12.760 --> 04:19.100
It didn't hurt at all and we have our first theme created within the Wordpress admin area.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.670
Isn't that cool.

04:20.980 --> 04:21.480
Great.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.490
We have our phone ready.

04:23.530 --> 04:29.900
Now we can go ahead and activate it and previewed on the home page also called the front end.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.800
But what will happen when we visit the home page.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.590
Let's check that out.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.370
Wow what a shame.

04:37.530 --> 04:38.870
There's nothing.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.270
It's completely empty.

04:41.410 --> 04:42.820
Why it is a..

04:42.820 --> 04:44.200
The answer is quite simple.

04:44.260 --> 04:46.400
You must already imagine what's the matter.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.790
Because our index that BHB file is also empty.

04:50.980 --> 04:54.170
Or maybe this file is not working OK.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.540
We cannot be in doubt.

04:55.720 --> 05:02.980
So let's do a little test in our index that be happy to see if it's really working as and create a basic

05:03.670 --> 05:05.790
structure within this file.

05:08.270 --> 05:11.540
So a lot of you asked me how can I do that.

05:11.540 --> 05:16.680
I just typed this exclamation mark and I have this whole H.M.S. structure.

05:16.680 --> 05:17.750
How do I do that.

05:18.080 --> 05:25.160
Well in our sublime text editor a fairly easy way to create a structure is to use an extension called

05:25.280 --> 05:25.930
M-ID.

05:26.150 --> 05:32.610
I'll make available to you the link of a very interesting tutorial that they choose how to install it.

05:32.780 --> 05:40.430
If you are using subline text this extension greatly streamlines the life of the Web developer making

05:40.430 --> 05:43.420
it easier to write comments.

05:43.520 --> 05:50.260
In our case let's just type an exclamation point or exclamation mark and hit the tab key.

05:50.330 --> 05:58.580
Very very easy Sidor magic the substrate auto completes and prints out the complete HMO file structure

05:59.060 --> 06:00.830
on the screen for us.

06:00.830 --> 06:03.220
So what am I going to do here.

06:03.490 --> 06:06.010
I am going to change informations.

06:06.370 --> 06:11.410
I'll be adding just title to the site and also a new paragraph

06:17.320 --> 06:24.880
no one to save that file and go back to the home page.

06:24.890 --> 06:31.770
Now you'll notice that the browser is already showing the base title as I form in the mail.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.950
The content of the paragraph is also shown here and that confirms that our file.

06:37.130 --> 06:45.950
The next page is really working and are famous well so we already have our first word pressing available

06:45.950 --> 06:47.660
within the admin area.

06:47.660 --> 06:51.050
Activated and easily identifiable.

06:51.050 --> 06:54.130
We also have a working index that page file.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.490
We then created our first WordPress theme.

06:57.770 --> 07:04.630
But of course we will not stop here in the next lesson we will learn how to make the index that BP file

07:04.640 --> 07:06.670
much more versatile.

07:06.850 --> 07:11.530
Saw it for you in the next lesson again and then and.
