00:01.150 --> 00:05.940
Hello how is it going up where we left off in the last lesson.

00:06.010 --> 00:10.330
Today we're going to include pagination on the search results page.

00:10.360 --> 00:14.440
Well this time going to be the numeric pagination.

00:14.440 --> 00:21.100
Those who didn't like the pagination we created in the last lesson you'll surely like this new one because

00:21.160 --> 00:25.550
it's much easier to create and you understand to begin with.

00:25.570 --> 00:31.390
Let's open up the search that page file which is the template fire for displaying search results.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.810
And again once you create the pagination as soon as the loop completes.

00:36.890 --> 00:43.900
But this time we don't need to break the peach tags because the code we are going to write here is pure

00:44.010 --> 00:44.880
THP.

00:45.030 --> 00:54.950
OK the function that does all the magic force is called the pause pagination pay close attention to

00:54.950 --> 00:57.200
the names of these functions.

00:57.260 --> 01:02.390
In this case the correct is the posts not the post.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.310
Ok inside let's open an array.

01:07.340 --> 01:13.460
This function has its own set of arguments so let's go ahead and add them here.

01:13.550 --> 01:19.730
If we look for the function in the Wordpress Codex we will see that we have four possible arguments

01:19.730 --> 01:20.600
for it.

01:20.670 --> 01:29.180
Are we going to use only CEU for now that are the following prev text and next text.

01:29.210 --> 01:30.980
The logic is not inverted here.

01:30.980 --> 01:37.310
OK for the breath tax argument let's IPN a tax that we want should be displayed and that can lead us

01:37.310 --> 01:39.360
to the previous page.

01:39.410 --> 01:40.930
So let's dive in here.

01:41.020 --> 01:45.320
Previous and next text.

01:46.090 --> 01:47.880
Last IPN.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.120
Next we only this.

01:50.130 --> 02:04.790
We already have a very functional pagination let's say Now let's search again for the letter A.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.070
And there it is.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.850
Awesome.

02:07.850 --> 02:11.260
Finally you can browse through our search results.

02:12.530 --> 02:19.280
As you can see here we have this text but it can change it using one of the arguments of this function.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.590
This of course will be an exercise for you guys.

02:22.910 --> 02:29.240
If you visit the link for the Wordpress Codex the one that we visit in this lesson you'll know exactly

02:29.240 --> 02:30.920
which arguments you use.

02:30.920 --> 02:36.140
Just be sure to add another comma after the last element of the array we created.

02:36.380 --> 02:39.680
Otherwise you certainly stumble upon and never OK.

02:40.780 --> 02:46.470
Well bonus for this lesson I will teach you how to implement a post navigation.

02:46.480 --> 02:52.630
That is a sort of pagination some WordPress themes display within posts for you.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.460
Guess you have an idea of what I'm talking about.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.260
Let's take this Web site here as an example.

02:59.070 --> 03:06.640
I am inside the post and if I scroll down to the bottom of the page I have here a link that points to

03:06.640 --> 03:12.090
the previous post and another link that points to the next post.

03:12.090 --> 03:13.650
How can it do that.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.580
In fact it's very easy to begin with.

03:16.590 --> 03:24.570
Let's open up the single that page beefalo have it open here this time we're going to add this pagination

03:24.570 --> 03:30.230
inside the loop not outside the loop as we did in the two previous cases.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.560
We want this link to be positioned before the comments form.

03:34.620 --> 03:43.400
So let's open any post and I want you explain again what we're going to do.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.730
Take a close look.

03:44.940 --> 03:48.200
The links will stay right here in this space here.

03:48.330 --> 03:53.510
Before the comments form OK so here is the file.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.950
Let's close the beach be here.

03:56.690 --> 04:02.770
Reopen it and here is going to create the H-E email structure for the links.

04:02.980 --> 04:12.120
First we need a new row and here you're going to have to the first one we received the pages class.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.050
This is our name I chose to use.

04:14.040 --> 04:14.570
OK.

04:14.900 --> 04:20.470
It's not any specific class that is you can use whatever name you want.

04:20.480 --> 04:27.020
Now we are going to have a bootstrap class and since this first link will flow to the left you'll be

04:27.020 --> 04:29.400
using the text left bootstrap class

04:32.510 --> 04:33.900
let's copy this here.

04:36.800 --> 04:44.700
And we're going to change here to text right and change the text to.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.070
Now let's see what we have for now.

04:51.430 --> 04:53.390
OK is it's displaying correctly.

04:53.740 --> 04:58.720
Now we need to know what WordPress functions we need here to generate each link.

04:59.430 --> 05:04.560
The logic is pretty much the same as the one we applied on the blog page.

05:04.560 --> 05:11.460
So for the last link we use the next post link function and for the right link.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.940
We're going to use previous post link function.

05:14.960 --> 05:23.420
Pay close attention to this detail the word post in this functions is in the singular so whenever you're

05:23.450 --> 05:25.430
creating posts navigation links.

05:25.430 --> 05:27.880
Remember that the function is in the singular.

05:27.890 --> 05:28.480
OK.

05:28.970 --> 05:35.620
By doing this you already have a great result.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.960
Look at us now we can navigate between posts.

05:39.220 --> 05:41.130
Excellent.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.810
One thing I usually do is change the direction of this arrows here.

05:45.810 --> 05:49.770
For this I can use the first parameter of these two functions.

05:49.770 --> 05:53.130
It allows us to format the link and the way we want.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.130
For example here in the next post link.

05:56.130 --> 05:58.730
I'm going to pass the string with this value here.

05:59.750 --> 06:07.010
That is an arrow pointing to the left followed by the link and for the previous post link at best.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.120
Another string.

06:09.430 --> 06:14.000
That is first the link and then they're all pointing to the right side.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.650
It's much better now more intuitive.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.270
You think then that's it.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.970
I hope you enjoyed this lesson.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.150
See you next time.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.100
