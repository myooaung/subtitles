Hello everyone and welcome back you're back here for another lesson and for a new section of our course.

00:08.690 --> 00:11.970
And today you're going to start talking about the film customized.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.370
One of the most interesting development tools for Wordpress themes.

00:16.730 --> 00:21.620
Well before we start talking about it I just want to show you a couple of simple modifications I made

00:21.620 --> 00:22.570
to the film.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.960
As you can see on the home page the search form is a little different.

00:28.420 --> 00:31.150
As well as the contact form.

00:31.150 --> 00:36.630
There are also other areas of the theme that have been modified but nothing too important.

00:36.670 --> 00:43.770
These are only small CSSA changes as you know you can find them all in our services file.

00:43.780 --> 00:49.170
You see there all this says for the theme in a very well organized file.

00:49.350 --> 00:56.950
Also I decided to change the HMO markup for this middle area here a bit before the sidebar had only

00:56.950 --> 01:05.890
three columns and now it has four columns with that the news div has been reduced to eight columns and

01:05.890 --> 01:13.150
there's also this hatting tech here and here on archive that page be an index that page.

01:13.390 --> 01:17.980
Also changed the pagination the tags before we have the call.

01:18.010 --> 01:26.530
And these six classes and now we have only code six that means the students here will always have a

01:26.530 --> 01:32.410
whiff of 50 percent each regardless of the screen resolution OK.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.360
Back to today's subject.

01:34.520 --> 01:39.690
Let's remember that we have some sections on the thing that are not finished yet.

01:40.010 --> 01:47.610
So here on the home page we have this area that would be a place for the logo the copyright area.

01:47.870 --> 01:53.920
All of these areas are still unchanged and you'll be using the think customized to deal with them.

01:53.930 --> 02:00.060
It could of course do all that manually using only a shemale called BHP et cetera.

02:00.230 --> 02:06.680
But the point is that if you do that our film will get hard to maintain to make changes to the code.

02:06.770 --> 02:09.850
The site owner will have to understand about programming.

02:09.980 --> 02:16.370
But of course this is not a reality that we have to take into consideration because not everyone knows

02:16.370 --> 02:17.890
how to write code.

02:17.930 --> 02:23.310
So our task is to build the whole thing in the most dynamic way possible.

02:24.140 --> 02:29.960
Well before we started grading and think I'm going to show you of course how this WordPress tool works

02:30.440 --> 02:33.580
especially for those who still don't know it first.

02:33.710 --> 02:35.780
Let's go over to the Wordpress dashboard

02:38.370 --> 02:48.660
appearance menu customize or as the site administrator you also have the possibility to access the same

02:48.660 --> 02:50.540
screen via the front end.

02:52.250 --> 02:59.750
By clicking on this I can hear this tool is very versatile and allows us to make changes to the thing

03:00.020 --> 03:03.690
while viewing these changes on the right side of the screen.

03:03.950 --> 03:08.000
So this is the great potential we have when we use it.

03:08.290 --> 03:11.640
Well let's explain how it works in more detail.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.670
You're on the right side.

03:12.680 --> 03:17.850
We have this big rectangular area where you can see the actual thing.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.850
This area is highly dynamic.

03:19.850 --> 03:28.660
So for example if I click on this link actually can go to a new page and on the left side we have several

03:28.660 --> 03:32.640
controls that are used to modify specific areas of the theme.

03:32.950 --> 03:36.090
Well let's give names to those things.

03:36.250 --> 03:40.470
The controls you see on the left are called sections.

03:40.490 --> 03:47.530
Here we have for example the site identity's section the color section beheader a major section that

03:47.530 --> 03:50.760
is no acquaintance of us from previous lessons.

03:50.760 --> 03:55.710
Remember within each section we have the controls.

03:55.720 --> 04:03.010
For example if you click here on site identity we have all the controls that relate to the site's identity

04:03.220 --> 04:10.270
suggest the title description and other fields to this controls can be of different types.

04:10.270 --> 04:15.620
They can be text fields check boxes Appolo buttons color pictures.

04:15.670 --> 04:22.640
There are many possibilities and with each version the word team brings more items to the customization.

04:22.780 --> 04:28.690
Not to mention some custom libraries that have fused that are not yet in the native version of Wordpress

04:29.790 --> 04:34.270
and other thing we can do here is also to change the thing that we are viewing.

04:34.550 --> 04:38.300
Just click here and choose another thing to customize it.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.490
I'm going to choose for example the 20:17 thing.

04:43.100 --> 04:50.080
This theme also features a few sections and I can also make modifications and I already see that modifications

04:50.180 --> 04:55.700
reflected on the right side of the tool so I switch things again.

04:58.090 --> 05:04.330
Well another very interesting thing in this too is the possibility to see Howard lay out will be presented

05:04.420 --> 05:06.340
in several different devices.

05:06.640 --> 05:14.140
So here on the right side unveiling the themes desktop version if I click on this button here I can

05:14.140 --> 05:16.830
see how the site is on a tablet like device.

05:17.720 --> 05:22.740
And if you click on this other button here you can see how the field behaves.

05:22.750 --> 05:28.350
Almost smartphone as you can see with the changes we made in previous lessons.

05:28.430 --> 05:30.700
Our think is totally responsive.

05:30.710 --> 05:34.190
We even see the responses menu here at the top of the thing.

05:36.010 --> 05:37.000
Now let's see it.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.170
Basically it's what they got in the customizing.

05:40.450 --> 05:46.890
This is a very powerful tool not only for you the sim developer but also for your clients.

05:46.930 --> 05:51.450
It allows us to make customisations in a very practical and fast way.

05:51.820 --> 05:56.200
And without the need for the end user to know how to write code.

05:56.290 --> 06:02.380
So what I want you to understand in this lesson is basically how this tool is made up.

06:02.380 --> 06:04.150
So remember the following.

06:04.150 --> 06:12.610
These left side structures here are called sections and each section can contain many controls which

06:12.610 --> 06:18.990
can be of various types from simple text boxes to check boxes upload buttons etc..

06:19.360 --> 06:24.570
Ok so in the next lesson we're going to start writing some code for the customization.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.800
And you'll then be coding.
