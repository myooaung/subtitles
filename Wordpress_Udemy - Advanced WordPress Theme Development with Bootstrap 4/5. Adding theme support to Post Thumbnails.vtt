00:00.360 --> 00:01.530
Hey what's up.

00:01.530 --> 00:02.610
Welcome back again.

00:03.830 --> 00:11.060
As mentioned in the last lesson in today's lesson we will continue to talk about the ADD support function

00:12.200 --> 00:13.340
in the last lesson.

00:13.400 --> 00:21.220
We declared support for custom headers and in this new lesson we're going to talk about the thumbnails.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.490
We actually began this lesson.

00:23.490 --> 00:30.580
I want to show you one of the themes available for download in the Wordpress repository seems like this

00:30.580 --> 00:38.130
one are very good for understanding what our thumbnails and how we can use them in wordpress.

00:38.590 --> 00:41.940
As you can see this is a kind of news portal.

00:41.980 --> 00:50.080
It is divided into several sections and for each section got loops with the posts and the featured image

00:50.140 --> 00:55.030
in them there are moments when this image is very small.

00:55.030 --> 00:57.370
Others are a little bigger.

00:57.450 --> 01:03.340
Together in this scene it seems like there are four of five different image sizes.

01:03.610 --> 01:09.080
These images here are what WordPress calls thumbnails.

01:09.130 --> 01:15.250
The question here is how can we add those images those thumbnails to a WordPress post.

01:15.610 --> 01:23.440
If we look at our current blog listing here on the blog page we see that loop has only text content

01:23.560 --> 01:24.940
nothing else.

01:24.940 --> 01:33.750
At the same time if you go over to the dashboard and open some of those posts for example let's open

01:33.750 --> 01:41.690
up this post here will see that there is no place here in the Adager Very can include a thumbnail that

01:41.730 --> 01:47.620
is a Ni-MH that represents this particular post and differentiate it from the others.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.160
And this is why we are going to do in this lesson.

01:51.480 --> 01:58.320
So let's go back to Sublime Text and we want to open our functions far continuing where we left off

01:58.350 --> 01:59.420
in the last lesson.

02:00.250 --> 02:06.910
Well to add thumbnail support we got to use the same function we used in the last lesson called ADD

02:07.180 --> 02:07.850
support.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.190
Except this time we're going to be passing a new argument.

02:11.310 --> 02:17.570
So still think our configuration function less typing at thing supports

02:21.460 --> 02:30.550
and pass a new argument in here in single quotes as a string less typing post hyphen something else

02:35.130 --> 02:38.520
Rosello can I add this ADD thing support.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.640
Out of this configuration function.

02:40.980 --> 02:49.200
Yes you can but as I want my code to be well organized I'll be writing it right inside this function.

02:49.350 --> 02:57.790
When we save this file and return to the Post editor refresh the page we can see that here on the right

02:57.790 --> 03:06.400
side we have a new box would press close of these boxes metal boxes and now I have a link that allows

03:06.400 --> 03:13.220
me to choose a feature image from my post as go having click here and see how it works.

03:14.130 --> 03:16.050
Go ahead and upload any image

03:19.870 --> 03:26.360
and to set it as a future image for this post and then you click on this blue button.

03:26.520 --> 03:32.820
Now you can see that it would appear here in the matter box as a future post image.

03:32.850 --> 03:38.840
Go ahead and update the post and I'm going to do the same for the other posts.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.030
So far so good.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.270
I just updated last post with the featured image.

04:00.410 --> 04:01.820
What are you going to do now.

04:02.020 --> 04:06.800
Well let's check our pulseless to see what we have in now.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.480
Reload the page and nothing happened and why.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.240
Well the answer is always the same.

04:16.350 --> 04:23.270
We need to make clear in our files where we want the filtered image to appear in our case.

04:23.270 --> 04:27.100
We wanted to position it between the title and the publication date.

04:27.110 --> 04:33.470
Floating to the left but before explaining this to you I wanted to explain how WordPress controls the

04:33.470 --> 04:38.540
size of thumbnails and what a thumbnail really means for wordpress.

04:38.540 --> 04:46.020
If it had overture settings media we see that there was a space where we can define the size of all

04:46.020 --> 04:47.420
the images.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.170
First item is thumbnail size.

04:50.420 --> 04:55.400
By default the size is 150 by 150.

04:55.400 --> 05:03.890
That is a square thumbnail then we have the medium size which has a maximum width of 300 pixels large

05:03.890 --> 05:12.440
size maximum width of 10:24 pixels and there is still an intermediate size that is not showing up here

05:12.530 --> 05:14.360
in THE LIST today.

05:14.390 --> 05:18.850
We're going to learn how to have greater control over the sizes.

05:19.070 --> 05:25.070
You see that it's quite simple it's probably something that probably the author of this theme here must

05:25.070 --> 05:26.080
have done.

05:26.190 --> 05:30.710
I say this even without looking at the code scenes as you can see.

05:30.860 --> 05:35.140
There are four or five different image sizes throughout the scene.

05:35.270 --> 05:42.660
Of course we can make a couple of changes even here in the Wordpress admin for example if you want all

05:42.660 --> 05:46.750
those small size images to have a maximum of 100 pixels.

05:46.850 --> 05:51.930
We can find this here but we can have even more control.

05:51.950 --> 05:56.300
This is the great advantage of knowing how to create things ourselves.

05:56.510 --> 05:58.980
Let's see how we can do it for this.

05:59.030 --> 06:05.450
We're going to edit our index that page peafowl which is the default template and is the file that is

06:05.450 --> 06:07.380
generated in this post Alison.

06:07.640 --> 06:14.630
But the basic idea that I'm going to present to you can be used whenever you want to include those thumbnails

06:15.170 --> 06:19.460
first let's find out where exactly we want to do the thumbnail.

06:19.490 --> 06:25.980
In our case it's going to be placed between that H2 tag and the publication date here.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.780
We want to call a function inside the BJP tags.

06:29.930 --> 06:34.400
This function is called the Post found now.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.610
After that we can save the file

06:42.940 --> 06:44.050
reload the page

06:46.960 --> 06:55.130
and look we have the featured image for the first item for the second for the third.

06:55.530 --> 06:59.730
But notice however that each image has a different size.

06:59.730 --> 07:05.290
Some of them are so big that they generate this horrible scroll bar.

07:05.370 --> 07:13.860
So why does it happen simply because we need to tell WordPress what thumbnail size we want and go back

07:13.860 --> 07:23.370
to the next page we file and let's do it then well as we've seen in the Wordpress admin area there are

07:23.370 --> 07:26.040
four predefined image sizes.

07:26.250 --> 07:32.420
We have the thumbnail itself that is the smallest featured image size for a post.

07:32.490 --> 07:41.300
We have the medium size is large size is and also full size is best.

07:41.300 --> 07:48.210
The first image size inside branches and that will be thumbnail.

07:48.360 --> 07:55.950
Now when you reload the page you can see that our images have the same size the size is the default

07:55.950 --> 08:02.240
size of the thumbnail 150 by 150 pixels.

08:02.310 --> 08:04.270
So what is happening here.

08:04.500 --> 08:11.060
Well the moment we upload an image WordPress creates several copies of the same image each one with

08:11.060 --> 08:12.870
a specific size.

08:12.870 --> 08:21.540
If we expand uploads folder we will see that for the same file there is the original image and image

08:21.600 --> 08:25.200
of 150 by 150.

08:25.200 --> 08:34.390
Another image with a maximum with 300 pixels 768 pixels and then 24 pixels.

08:34.470 --> 08:38.430
This helps us choose the correct size of the future image to be used.

08:38.640 --> 08:46.680
If for example I choose the medium size I will end up with an image with a maximum width of 300 pixels.

08:46.710 --> 08:54.030
We can also choose the large which will be a slightly larger size or for that is the original image

08:54.190 --> 08:58.790
for with not cropped but the whole thing doesn't stop here.

08:58.950 --> 09:04.140
We can be even more specific and create new image sizes on the fly.

09:04.140 --> 09:14.910
For example lets say that in that position of the page I need an image that has 275 by 275 pixels for

09:14.910 --> 09:15.530
this.

09:15.530 --> 09:21.980
When you create an array inside a function and separate the by colors are going to pass the width and

09:21.980 --> 09:23.330
the height that you want

09:33.390 --> 09:37.220
to look at is now the image is slightly bigger.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.500
And this is just the beginning.

09:39.550 --> 09:48.220
If you visit the Codex you can find even more advanced examples where you finish out Riego and you apply

09:48.220 --> 09:53.980
some CSSA to the images because we want our images to look a bit better.

09:54.010 --> 09:58.480
First of all let's inspect this element.

09:58.630 --> 10:06.160
Notice here that the feature image in wordpress automatically receives a class called W.P. post image.

10:06.250 --> 10:17.670
We can create a new successful based on this class.

10:17.890 --> 10:26.350
But suppose for example that it will flow to the left and it will have the following margin values.

10:28.610 --> 10:35.520
And we can also say that the article tags will have a different display.

10:35.680 --> 10:41.530
Cause the article tags to display one underneath the other separated by a space

10:46.430 --> 10:46.770
OK.

10:46.770 --> 10:53.070
Now we have a slightly more acceptable look and I think that's all for this lesson.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.070
I hope you enjoyed it as I told you.

10:56.070 --> 10:59.460
We just scratched the surface of this argument.

10:59.610 --> 11:01.650
That adds thumbnail support.

11:02.010 --> 11:05.230
There is much more to be learned in the codex.

11:05.280 --> 11:10.300
So don't be lazy go ahead and take a look at the Wordpress documentation.

11:10.310 --> 11:12.330
OK so peace out.

11:12.330 --> 11:18.600
Guys thanks for watching and I'll wait for you in our next lesson by.
