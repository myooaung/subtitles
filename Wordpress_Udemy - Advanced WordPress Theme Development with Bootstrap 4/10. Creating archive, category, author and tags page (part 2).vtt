Hello guys in the last lesson we learn about the archive that P2P file.

00:06.250 --> 00:13.600
Now you know that it's used when visitors request post by category for tag or date.

00:13.810 --> 00:21.450
I started reading this file even Sublime Text or in your favorite editor are going to create a new file

00:21.480 --> 00:23.040
and call it archive.

00:23.090 --> 00:27.930
PH be of course to speed things up a bit.

00:28.100 --> 00:33.680
Let's copy the contents of the index that BHP file taken care to replace the class for the main div

00:33.680 --> 00:37.270
tag that include a class called archive.

00:37.380 --> 00:40.290
But of course that may be whatever name you want.

00:41.860 --> 00:47.240
And here the name of the content file is going to be content hyphen archive.

00:47.340 --> 00:53.430
That page be let's create this file inside the corresponding folder.

00:57.300 --> 01:04.510
And to speed up to copy what's inside the content that BGP file.

01:04.760 --> 01:12.580
Let's replace the content function with the excerpt and just make the view a little different from the

01:12.580 --> 01:13.540
other views.

01:13.540 --> 01:18.990
Let's remove the category from here and I start off the test then.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.550
Let's open up our thing.

01:22.180 --> 01:30.550
Go to the blog page and we're going to click on one of the months that we have here in the sidebar as

01:30.550 --> 01:33.380
you can see when we click on a specific month.

01:33.580 --> 01:38.300
We have only news from the month corresponding to the one we clicked on.

01:38.770 --> 01:39.720
Well that's correct.

01:39.740 --> 01:42.750
But let's make that a little better.

01:42.820 --> 01:48.150
We can create for example tie to above the post that will be showing the name of the month.

01:48.280 --> 01:53.730
So the visitor will not be lost and this should also be useful for our third category.

01:53.770 --> 01:58.020
And that pages is called a WordPress function here.

01:58.180 --> 02:08.240
Before starting the if else block this time the function is going to be the archive title this function

02:08.300 --> 02:15.950
allows us to pass to formatting parameters that are email text reading which text will stay the first

02:15.950 --> 02:18.160
parameter is the opening tag.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.700
Let's use an H1 heading tag.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.630
The archive title class

02:26.570 --> 02:28.760
and the second is the closing tag

02:31.490 --> 02:33.620
save and see what happens.

02:36.130 --> 02:36.510
OK.

02:36.530 --> 02:38.240
Fantastic.

02:38.240 --> 02:44.600
Now we have the name of the month and this will greatly help people who are visiting a website that

02:44.600 --> 02:52.830
uses the learned W.P. theme Arfin And I think we can do is also load the archive description.

02:52.860 --> 03:00.120
This will not work everywhere just in categories and tag pages but it can be of help in some occasions.

03:00.470 --> 03:05.990
So let's call the function down here and its name is the archive description

03:08.680 --> 03:25.280
as go to the admin area and add a description in one of our categories.

03:25.440 --> 03:32.800
And now when we click on one of the links in this category we see that we now have the description aswell

03:33.300 --> 03:34.280
codes in it.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.590
I also think that sex alent.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.880
Now just a complete example.

03:38.980 --> 03:40.530
Let's see if everything's working.

03:40.550 --> 03:49.060
Oh so when we click on another link or attack I go ahead and pick your own the author link and look

03:49.800 --> 03:53.180
at big file load that is archived on page B.

03:53.230 --> 03:54.200
That's correct.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.950
And I also got the description just above.

03:57.340 --> 04:06.510
Now a tag same thing that is everything's working perfectly and it has to agree with me.

04:06.510 --> 04:07.910
That wasn't so hard.

04:09.050 --> 04:12.020
Great but I have a challenge for you.

04:12.040 --> 04:16.900
How about making your thing even more specialized to do this.

04:16.960 --> 04:22.120
You need to create the three specialized templates files that you didn't create in this lesson.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.930
Remember those files are optional.

04:24.940 --> 04:31.600
That's why I won't be creating them with you but they can make your theme much more interesting.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.700
It's pretty easy.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.110
All you need is to create a file called tag dot page.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.280
Another one called category dot page.

04:40.700 --> 04:47.980
And the last file called date that you can copy the contents of the index that be and content that speech

04:48.020 --> 04:50.500
be as I did in this lesson.

04:50.500 --> 04:56.530
Just be careful to modify the names of the tags OK as you do this exercise.

04:56.650 --> 05:03.100
Checking the plugin if the template name changes your goal is to make the template file name changes

05:03.100 --> 05:08.960
to tag that BHB category that page B and they start page.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.180
So I'll see it again in the next lesson.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.090
Happy coding.
