Hey what's up guys.

00:02.510 --> 00:08.900
And the last lesson I yes do to solve a problem that popped up in the search page template among the

00:08.900 --> 00:09.980
search results.

00:09.980 --> 00:17.810
We also have pages and as you can see they don't have any information about categories simply because

00:18.140 --> 00:23.540
they are pages and not posts and pages don't have categories.

00:23.570 --> 00:29.840
So how did you remove this snippet here for research results related to your page.

00:29.930 --> 00:36.920
I asked to just search for a WordPress function called has category This function returns true if the

00:36.920 --> 00:44.870
post within the loop has a given category or if no category specified if it also returns true if it

00:44.870 --> 00:46.820
has any category.

00:47.240 --> 00:54.190
Let's open up the content search for each file and let's play around that this function a bit.

00:54.320 --> 01:00.950
We want to make some changes here then we're loading the category the way it is now we are displaying

01:00.980 --> 01:07.490
text category regardless of whether or not we have categories within the loop to solve this.

01:07.490 --> 01:09.090
Let's create anything else.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.460
BLOCK Right here.

01:15.710 --> 01:19.760
And inside the lock at the hask category function

01:24.490 --> 01:28.560
if it returns True we're going to show you the category.

01:28.690 --> 01:33.730
This will always happen footboards at least for those that have categories.

01:33.900 --> 01:38.250
What most of the time is true if it returns false.

01:38.410 --> 01:43.040
The code snippet that shows the category will not even be displayed.

01:43.450 --> 01:45.000
That's the result we want.

01:45.340 --> 01:46.990
So let's test that out.

01:52.230 --> 01:57.470
Now for all page related results like this one the category doesn't appear.

01:57.690 --> 01:59.050
Excellent.

01:59.120 --> 01:59.460
OK.

01:59.480 --> 02:03.510
But we can improve our results page a bit more.

02:03.510 --> 02:09.330
One of the things that WordPress recommends for thing developers is that the results page also has a

02:09.330 --> 02:10.770
search form.

02:10.770 --> 02:17.310
So if the user wants to repeat the search using another term we can help as open our search that page

02:17.330 --> 02:21.330
before and before our loop starts.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.860
It can include the search form again.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.770
This is very easy.

02:25.790 --> 02:30.290
It's enough if we just call the get search form function again.

02:31.550 --> 02:35.540
By doing so you're going to have the form at the top of the page again.

02:35.840 --> 02:41.720
Another thing we can do is to create something that shows more clearly what is the search term for this

02:41.720 --> 02:42.670
page.

02:42.770 --> 02:46.310
We can include that before the second search form.

02:46.340 --> 02:58.190
For example we can say search results for and here specify what is the query string to repeat the search

02:58.190 --> 03:05.210
query string use the function we learned in the last lesson called Get search query Let's do that.

03:07.810 --> 03:17.870
We must actually dhows and now reload the search page and we get the query string here.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.890
That's very cool.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.410
Now we only have one big problem.

03:22.550 --> 03:26.530
Incidentally a huge problem if you search only for it.

03:26.590 --> 03:27.100
A.

03:27.320 --> 03:27.810
Yes.

03:27.890 --> 03:32.430
And Nailor only 10 search results will appear.

03:33.390 --> 03:38.900
But surely we have several posts and pages that have the letter A in their content.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.900
Whether or not these other pages explain the answer to this is quite simple.

03:43.900 --> 03:51.040
They are hitting to reveal them when you find a way for Wordpress to show the other pages that do this.

03:51.040 --> 03:57.880
We need to understand how pagination works in wordpress but that's a subject for the next lessons.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.510
So for now this out guys my.
