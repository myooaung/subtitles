00:00.750 --> 00:07.380
Fellow guys in the last lesson they begin configuring our first slider which should be included on the

00:07.380 --> 00:13.070
home page of everything in this lesson you'll be picking up where we left off.

00:13.070 --> 00:19.870
Let's start by setting up the items in the slider now that you have all sliders settings saved.

00:19.950 --> 00:23.570
You can go ahead and click here on this edit template button.

00:28.710 --> 00:35.790
Or if you are on the plug in the home page click on the name of the slider or on the editing button.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.530
Feel free to choose what's best you.

00:38.880 --> 00:43.750
The screen will be slightly different depending on the type of your chosen.

00:44.070 --> 00:46.200
Since we choose both slider.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.560
We don't have some ideas.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.160
We would have for a custom slider.

00:50.220 --> 00:56.670
The basic difference is that when we edit the post slider We are editing slides template.

00:56.940 --> 01:03.130
On the other hand if we had a custom slider we could edit it slide individually.

01:03.600 --> 01:08.400
I believe that explaining the difference now might confuse you a little.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.320
So let's follow the explanation without getting out of focus for now.

01:12.570 --> 01:18.240
And I propose that later on you go ahead and create a custom slider as an exercise to see the difference.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.040
OK.

01:19.620 --> 01:22.360
So let's go here in the same place.

01:22.540 --> 01:28.100
One of the most important things to choose is what will appear at the bottom of each slide.

01:28.440 --> 01:35.280
You can have a color or a gradient of colors for the background but to be honest I don't see much sense

01:35.280 --> 01:39.600
in this because what really prevails is what we choose here.

01:39.610 --> 01:46.500
Under this image option we can choose the featured image of the post being displayed or an item from

01:46.560 --> 01:55.470
our media library or an external link and outer image of the first image found in the post.

01:56.670 --> 01:59.730
Notice for example if I choose an image from the library.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.000
This image will appear at the bottom of all posts.

02:03.070 --> 02:08.690
It will always be repeated since I want the message to never be the same.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.720
I'm going to choose the featured image of each post.

02:12.730 --> 02:19.580
Notice that as each pose as a different feature image those images are not displayed here below.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.530
And here I can set the positioning for this image.

02:24.690 --> 02:29.200
And also choose a video which should be running in the background.

02:30.370 --> 02:34.780
OK and what are these items here in the preview area.

02:35.230 --> 02:41.530
Well these items refer to text fields with values that come directly from each post.

02:41.530 --> 02:48.760
You can add several of these elements inside the slide in the same way that we can insert buttons images

02:48.910 --> 02:49.940
and videos.

02:50.890 --> 02:58.610
As you are using that viewing post slider previously boarded we already have these two fields here one

02:58.610 --> 03:04.170
that shows the post-Idol and another that shows the post excerpt.

03:04.610 --> 03:09.980
We can add one more below to show for example the post publication date.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.670
Click here in as text.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.400
This one here or here.

03:19.180 --> 03:24.540
In content you have to define which element of the post this item refers to.

03:24.950 --> 03:35.550
Let's delete this text here and click HERE where it says insert macros scroll down a little and we find

03:35.790 --> 03:38.920
the published date.

03:38.930 --> 03:43.510
Now you can click and drag this item just below the excerpt.

03:43.550 --> 03:50.520
In my experience even with this blue lines that serve as a guide this text that we have just a line

03:50.750 --> 03:55.070
will not be positioned correctly to get the correct alignment.

03:55.070 --> 04:03.860
CLICK HERE ON position and size align it on the top left and now we can drag it down.

04:07.010 --> 04:10.980
You can also enter values for the x and y axis manually.

04:11.120 --> 04:19.940
For example let's increase the Y-axis value to 420 Cantab the value directly or use the keyboard navigation

04:19.950 --> 04:20.500
there is.

04:20.510 --> 04:27.860
By moving the items up and down lets do the same for the other two elements.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.080
What a title.

04:29.140 --> 04:33.490
Let's set the Y-axis to 150.

04:33.510 --> 04:37.280
We can also change the font size here on style.

04:37.320 --> 04:42.810
Let's set it to 40 pieces I learned to write

04:46.030 --> 04:58.190
and for the excerpt the Y-axis is going to be 250 and font size 20 pixels OK I guess with that you can

04:58.200 --> 05:01.010
read it have something to show in the slider.

05:01.100 --> 05:06.330
I saved the template and let's finally see Howard's slide shows this plane.

05:06.610 --> 05:10.530
We're going to click here on close.

05:10.630 --> 05:14.770
And now to show this ladder on the screen they have two options.

05:14.890 --> 05:20.980
If you are adding the slider directly to a Word Press post or page you simply copy the short code and

05:21.010 --> 05:23.320
paste it into the content.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.630
In our case we need to insert the slider.

05:25.660 --> 05:28.780
Not in a post but in a pitch file.

05:28.810 --> 05:32.190
In order to do that we need the second structure here.

05:32.540 --> 05:40.090
Let's go out and open the page home that pitch file that's replaced this content here with the code

05:40.100 --> 05:45.010
we just copied and of course we have to change the name of the allies.

05:45.470 --> 05:51.190
In our case let's go back here to WordPress and this is our allies

05:54.240 --> 05:56.290
OK we're safe.

05:56.630 --> 05:59.420
And let's see what they got on the theme home page

06:05.790 --> 06:08.000
great almost perfect.

06:08.240 --> 06:15.780
We have here post featured EMH the title the excerpt and also the publication date.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.610
Let the slide show bring the second item

06:22.540 --> 06:29.440
Well here we have the same thing that featured image in the background the title the excerpt and the

06:29.440 --> 06:30.490
publication date.

06:32.360 --> 06:37.860
Notice that up here we have this white space above and below the slider.

06:38.240 --> 06:43.010
This is coming from the HCM mail section we created in the beginning of the course.

06:43.130 --> 06:50.900
So when you edit that in our services file Let's open up the file there and let's find out where the

06:50.900 --> 06:54.860
problem is.

06:54.870 --> 06:59.700
So it's here we have this bedding which we don't need.

06:59.970 --> 07:02.560
So I'll just comment on it and we're good to go.

07:11.070 --> 07:16.610
Another problem we have here is that the publication date is almost invisible.

07:16.630 --> 07:19.590
We'll have to fix this with CSSA as well.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.870
But let's do it through the plug in itself.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.550
Let's go back to WordPress added template

07:30.150 --> 07:33.480
the selected element.

07:33.530 --> 07:40.260
Now here in style I'm going to create a CSSA class style this element in the Pro version of this plugin.

07:40.370 --> 07:47.300
You can do this more easily but in the free version you are limited to use in C Ss.

07:47.570 --> 07:55.800
But with just a few customizations you ready reach a very nice effect I save the template and click

07:55.800 --> 07:59.250
on slider settings.

07:59.340 --> 08:06.630
Under appearance you remember that there was a text area in which you can write some success code.

08:07.200 --> 08:11.480
Let's state the class we just created and style it like this.

08:14.660 --> 08:18.630
Let's say and see how it's now

08:24.860 --> 08:26.660
well you got a lot better.

08:26.970 --> 08:33.710
It's more visible and it's much like our original of before finishing this lesson.

08:33.770 --> 08:34.970
Two tips.

08:34.970 --> 08:39.070
The first one in the same way that we can style the publication date.

08:39.190 --> 08:47.360
You can also style any other element of the slider just add a CSSA class and type the desired code and

08:47.570 --> 08:48.410
and.

08:48.520 --> 08:54.920
You can also play around with the animation controls for each element of the slider just use the element

08:55.010 --> 09:01.590
and click here in animation we can for example apply a delay to the element.

09:01.870 --> 09:09.300
Hide it and that that we can have an effect similar to a layer slider the same way we have in plugins

09:09.310 --> 09:11.240
like the revolution slider.

09:11.450 --> 09:18.030
But the difference is that this plugin is free well I hope you enjoy this lessons.

09:18.080 --> 09:25.940
I'm back in the next one and they continue to install a few more plugins in Arfin then by.
