00:01.280 --> 00:03.430
Hey guys everything OK.

00:03.650 --> 00:09.200
In today's lesson we began the first step towards internationalization of her theme.

00:09.200 --> 00:15.280
Let's learn a bit about the get tax functions and translate all the terms we find in our theme.

00:15.590 --> 00:22.940
Well first things first we have to start by adding a kind of translation support in our film to do this

00:23.210 --> 00:29.510
as a part of the functions file and within the function we created at the beginning of the course in

00:29.510 --> 00:34.640
which we are typing all of the functions and commands related to the film configuration.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.840
Let's add a few more lines.

00:37.250 --> 00:45.150
You want to create a variable and call it text domain and it will get as a value the name of her theme

00:45.210 --> 00:48.530
in lowercase.

00:48.540 --> 00:53.310
Now let's include a function called Load thing that's domain.

00:53.490 --> 01:00.810
This function is used to ensure that future translation files created by translators by our collaborators

01:01.120 --> 01:05.040
or by the site's owner are uploaded in the correct way.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.480
It requires two parameters.

01:07.500 --> 01:12.840
The first is text domain which in our case would be this variable we just created.

01:13.110 --> 01:18.870
And the second parameter is the directory path register installation files will stay.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.850
So let's call the function here.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.230
Best first parameter

01:28.860 --> 01:34.770
and for the second parameter we're going to use the guess template directory function concatenated with

01:34.770 --> 01:35.380
this train.

01:35.610 --> 01:44.140
For slash languages slash this get a pair for a folder called languages which of course we have not

01:44.140 --> 01:45.200
yet created.

01:45.550 --> 01:46.960
So let's create this folder now

01:50.420 --> 01:57.350
OK this ensures that whenever there's a translation file We're will try to look for it inside this directory

01:57.560 --> 01:59.220
that we just created.

01:59.750 --> 02:06.470
But we also have to worry about child themes child theme is a subject I didn't work on this course at

02:06.470 --> 02:11.550
least not here but it's highly important the idea of him can handle them too.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.490
To do this just duplicate this line here.

02:16.910 --> 02:20.260
And change this word same plate by style sheet.

02:23.590 --> 02:29.590
Except that this line regarding the child thing has to be placed before the line related to the burying

02:29.590 --> 02:29.890
theme.

02:29.890 --> 02:30.600
OK.

02:31.030 --> 02:33.760
So let's just change the order here.

02:33.790 --> 02:42.460
Pretty simple and I think we need to do is add a couple more items to our style that says file remember

02:42.760 --> 02:49.860
this is our main source of file and it's used oh so you didn't find the theme within the Wordpress dashboard.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.610
Let's add another line here called Text domain

02:56.360 --> 02:58.520
and tied to our text domain here.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.690
And as we were adding this file.

03:02.820 --> 03:06.240
Let's take this opportunity to add another important tags.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.760
License and license you high.

03:12.220 --> 03:15.170
You can be sure we have all the requires tags.

03:15.180 --> 03:20.130
If one day we decide to upload this thing to the Wordpress repository.

03:20.370 --> 03:20.720
OK.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.200
Excellent.

03:22.200 --> 03:27.930
Now what they have for now is an environment that is almost ready for future translations.

03:28.220 --> 03:35.430
We defined a text domain for our thing and also created the directories where in the future the translation

03:35.430 --> 03:38.430
files will be placed very well.

03:38.430 --> 03:44.950
So now we can finally talk about the translation functions that we mentioned already in the last lesson.

03:44.970 --> 03:48.080
These functions are all over the world press code.

03:48.150 --> 03:50.750
For example let's open the 2016 thing.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.190
Let's choose any file.

03:53.210 --> 04:02.060
For example this one before or for those BHB notice for example that we have here two areas with messages

04:02.120 --> 04:06.010
in English here and here too.

04:06.470 --> 04:12.020
But it's surrounded by a function that goes almost unnoticed code on the court.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.820
So people don't even realize it's a function.

04:15.980 --> 04:19.460
We have another example inside this fien function file.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.640
For example here in the function that register the menus.

04:25.010 --> 04:29.430
Notice that we have here two English texts all menu names.

04:29.990 --> 04:35.860
And these trains are X-band even more discrete function called Debu underscores.

04:35.900 --> 04:36.620
That's right.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.530
This is a function.

04:38.990 --> 04:46.310
And for now on we will be addressing this two functions the underscore and the double underscores.

04:46.430 --> 04:50.420
If you look carefully the two functions have a very similar syntax.

04:50.750 --> 04:57.790
They basically require one the string to be translated into the same text domain.

04:57.960 --> 05:04.630
The fundamental difference between the two is that the first one underscore is used to wrap some HDMI

05:04.700 --> 05:10.630
code as you see here in the form of all speech we file here for example.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.360
The string is inside an H1 heading tag.

05:13.750 --> 05:22.040
And here within a paragraph double underscores are used to wrap pure ph code in the example of the functions

05:22.040 --> 05:22.840
file.

05:22.880 --> 05:29.400
These strings are arguments to an array so plain PKP code no HVM else.

05:29.690 --> 05:32.380
There are several other functions like this too.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.970
And they are used by WordPress as well.

05:35.180 --> 05:40.590
But unfortunately it will not be possible to approach all of them here in the course.

05:40.590 --> 05:47.780
This to your right to be useful for most cases at least here in our theme Well you understand the long

05:47.780 --> 05:50.140
task that is ahead of us then too.

05:50.450 --> 05:56.730
Yes you have to look for strings that can be translated into another language all over him.

05:57.050 --> 05:59.370
That's right all over ofin.

05:59.670 --> 06:05.460
Fortunately despite the amount of files we already have in Arfin these files are not that big.

06:05.750 --> 06:12.410
So we can easily find the snippets of code that we should change I'm going to start just by these two

06:12.410 --> 06:20.270
files for all for the pitch B and functions that pitch be two files that we also have in our three hour

06:20.330 --> 06:26.040
show you in detail the first changes I made to this two files and the rest of the files.

06:26.090 --> 06:28.420
You'll see me changing but at faster speed.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.030
OK.

06:29.360 --> 06:35.220
The idea is to show you the process itself as it is a very repetitive process.

06:35.240 --> 06:39.280
It is not worth it to span the whole US and explain it the same thing.

06:39.710 --> 06:44.180
So lets start off with the fall for the pitch file.

06:44.250 --> 06:50.370
The first thing that we can wrap it into a translation function is this one that is inside the H-1 having

06:50.370 --> 06:52.350
tag to do this.

06:52.380 --> 06:54.570
I'm going to cut this text here.

06:57.770 --> 07:06.580
Open the PSP tag here and I'm going to use the underscore function the first parameter repasts is the

07:06.580 --> 07:08.110
translatable string.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.380
So let's put back the text that we just got.

07:12.530 --> 07:17.210
And the second parameter is are things Stex domain which should always be learned.

07:17.210 --> 07:23.680
WP So this string here is now ready to be translated into any language in the future.

07:23.710 --> 07:28.330
OK let's do the same thing now for the paragraph just below.

07:28.400 --> 07:33.950
But before a very important tip never include Jamail tags inside the string.

07:33.980 --> 07:34.730
OK.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.860
The translator doesn't always know what these tags mean.

07:38.960 --> 07:44.990
If you leave and are called Inside the string you run the risk of having these H.M.S. attacks are removed

07:45.050 --> 07:47.090
or ignored or even worse.

07:47.090 --> 07:50.450
They can be modified by the translator was just not good.

08:03.170 --> 08:04.140
Let's go on.

08:04.430 --> 08:17.500
And we have another text here.

08:17.750 --> 08:23.620
And this last text is no longer a shemale but something that is inside of the code.

08:23.900 --> 08:31.120
In this case do not use the underscore function but this time the double underscore function.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.620
So this way

08:39.280 --> 08:46.650
OK we don't have anything else here in this file save it and it's already translatable file.

08:47.100 --> 08:53.120
Let's do the same thing now for the functions file and for the other files to speed up the video OK.

08:53.320 --> 08:58.420
I believe that you will not have any problems to understand since you see the same thing being repeated

08:58.480 --> 08:59.640
many times.

08:59.920 --> 09:04.900
It's the very same process we've just seen on the or for that speech peafowl.

09:04.990 --> 09:08.290
So without further ado let's get started.

12:14.010 --> 12:16.930
And finally we get to the last file.

12:17.010 --> 12:22.110
It was a bit hard work but our whole thing is now fully translatable.

12:22.110 --> 12:24.930
One tip I can give you is the following.

12:24.930 --> 12:28.450
Try to make your thing translatable since the beginning OK.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.860
Try to translate all the shrinks.

12:30.860 --> 12:35.570
Little by little do it slowly as you create each file.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.860
I mean never leave translations to the end as I did here.

12:39.870 --> 12:45.630
I just left everything to the end for learning purposes but you don't have to do it like I did.

12:45.630 --> 12:46.270
OK.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.660
So what's the next step now.

12:48.870 --> 12:54.810
Well now that our theme is translatable let's create our translation template file that will serve as

12:54.810 --> 13:01.710
a basis for other people to translate your film but that will be for the next lesson and then piece.
