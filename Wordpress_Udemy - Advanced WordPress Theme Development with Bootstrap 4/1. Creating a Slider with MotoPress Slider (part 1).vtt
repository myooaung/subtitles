00:01.010 --> 00:07.820
Hello Guys welcome to a brand new section of our course this section will be slightly different from

00:07.820 --> 00:08.640
the rest.

00:08.720 --> 00:13.950
So far we have been able to create pretty much the whole structure of our theme.

00:13.970 --> 00:19.660
We have already created the template for the new pages we already know how to control the Wordpress

00:19.740 --> 00:20.280
loop.

00:20.480 --> 00:24.740
Hand of the imagination and theme support and many other things.

00:25.100 --> 00:31.190
But if you look at the home page of our theme you'll see that it still seems a bit far from the original

00:31.200 --> 00:32.310
layout.

00:32.450 --> 00:39.080
This is because some essential areas like the slide show the social media icons and the map are still

00:39.080 --> 00:40.060
missing.

00:40.220 --> 00:47.080
In addition to them we still need to take care of things like the responsive menu and the contact forms.

00:47.090 --> 00:51.470
My proposal was to use plugins to view these areas.

00:51.560 --> 00:56.270
A lot of people ask me why do you ask people to install so many plugins.

00:56.270 --> 01:01.730
There was a plug in to include a responsive menu and other plugins for social media icons.

01:01.730 --> 01:08.880
This one for the slider contact forms Well there's a couple of reasons why I do that.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.390
First developing all this from scratch would be hard work.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.850
If you have plugins that can do this hard work for us.

01:17.030 --> 01:18.350
Let's use them.

01:18.590 --> 01:25.880
If I decide to teach you how to view every single functionality from scratch this will be a never ending

01:25.880 --> 01:26.990
course.

01:26.990 --> 01:33.500
The second reason is because even professional developers include plugins when they are making their

01:33.500 --> 01:35.470
films available for download.

01:35.510 --> 01:42.590
For example if you take a look at film forest you'll find that most films or maybe all of the themes

01:42.710 --> 01:44.570
bandos some plugins.

01:44.690 --> 01:53.090
So i can we more over all the plugins I'll be using here are free OK which is good news and the good

01:53.090 --> 02:00.040
news is if your intention is to make your thing available for download I'll be teaching you how to bandeau

02:00.260 --> 02:02.710
all of the plugins with your thing.

02:02.900 --> 02:03.750
Yes really.

02:04.070 --> 02:08.940
Every single plugin but this will be later on this course.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.240
So hold on OK.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.200
It's worth it.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.710
So after this sort of mirror COOPER Let's get started.

02:17.120 --> 02:22.880
In this lesson you're going to start with this light show glugging Let's go over to the Wordpress dashboard

02:23.210 --> 02:26.930
and we're going install a plugin called Mauprat slider.

02:27.290 --> 02:29.960
Head over to the Blunkett's menu add new

02:33.140 --> 02:36.450
and Harrigan and look for a plugin called a press slider

02:40.910 --> 02:42.160
as go ahead install it

02:45.550 --> 02:51.640
and we can activate it among the phrase Leider plugins.

02:51.660 --> 02:53.850
This is one that I find more complete.

02:54.030 --> 03:01.800
Of course it's not as good as Brenan plugins such as slider revolution but it's free and it really does

03:01.920 --> 03:04.050
a great job for us.

03:04.050 --> 03:13.240
Once installed we have a new menu entry down here as click on moral press slider and we got to the screen

03:13.240 --> 03:13.810
here.

03:15.310 --> 03:21.530
Well before you start creating something let's go for a more theoretical explanation.

03:21.550 --> 03:28.690
I think it's necessary to make this explanation because some students are so confused with how these

03:28.690 --> 03:38.300
plugins work in this plugin and in almost all plugins of the like they have a structure like this that

03:38.300 --> 03:44.590
is we have a container with these letters and insight than we have.

03:44.630 --> 03:47.040
Each one of these lights.

03:47.210 --> 03:53.870
So this slider one has a first light a second one and so forth.

03:53.870 --> 03:57.020
So you can't have as many sliders as you want.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.820
And even then as many slides as you want to.

04:01.490 --> 04:08.000
So on this page that we are seeing now which is the plug in home page we have the list of all the sliders

04:08.300 --> 04:13.100
which are the containers you can't create as many sliders as you want.

04:13.100 --> 04:19.370
For example we can have a slider that will be displayed on the home page and another one that will only

04:19.370 --> 04:25.710
appear on the About Us page or you can create more than one slide your for the home page.

04:25.940 --> 04:31.080
But for now we have no sliders so let's go ahead and create our first one.

04:31.550 --> 04:38.490
Let's click here on create slider and here we can choose which type of lagger we want.

04:38.690 --> 04:44.010
We can have a custom slider which will be as Lider with any kind of elements we like.

04:44.010 --> 04:51.210
For example we could create a custom slider with three slides within it each one with a background image

04:51.300 --> 05:00.070
some text and a click to action button because also have both slider and I like the custom slider.

05:00.220 --> 05:06.800
This one is made up by posts or pages that the plugin would grab from the Wordpress installation.

05:07.240 --> 05:13.540
And of course if you don't want to have much work we can decide to import samples of both a custom slider

05:13.660 --> 05:18.810
and a post slider as we don't have much time for this.

05:18.850 --> 05:21.960
I'm going to go ahead and choose a beautiful template.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.950
Help me create a post slider.

05:24.980 --> 05:27.120
So what's the idea behind this.

05:27.500 --> 05:34.920
Well the idea is that you have a slider at the top of the home page showing the latest post in a slideshow.

05:35.210 --> 05:41.120
Each item on the slider will have a future image from the current post title.

05:41.300 --> 05:48.240
The excerpt and the publication date only the OK selected.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.020
I'm going to click here on chromate slider

05:53.940 --> 06:00.860
and the plugin shows that both sliders structure has been ported and now we can start setting up the

06:00.860 --> 06:01.990
slider.

06:02.410 --> 06:03.790
Click on this button.

06:07.180 --> 06:08.300
Notice though that.

06:08.320 --> 06:17.160
Alternatively I can also access this configuration page to the Blyton's home page look my slider is

06:17.160 --> 06:18.670
already here.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.860
Just go ahead and click here on sitings.

06:20.870 --> 06:22.590
OK.

06:22.730 --> 06:31.110
Notice also that this is still the slider settings page that is used to configuring this slides container.

06:31.130 --> 06:34.630
We're still not setting up each slider items.

06:34.650 --> 06:38.870
OK soon you do that here on the first step.

06:38.950 --> 06:44.590
You want to include some basic informations for example as type a name for the slider.

06:45.130 --> 06:48.850
Let's change the name here for home slider.

06:51.190 --> 06:54.210
And here we want to add in the lines for example.

06:54.220 --> 06:55.850
Home hyphen slider

06:58.870 --> 07:02.040
this alliance will be very important.

07:02.140 --> 07:09.170
It will be part of the short code that we need in order to include the slider on our template or on

07:09.170 --> 07:10.730
the Wordpress page or post.

07:10.750 --> 07:17.380
If you want to do that let's change the height and width information as well or the width.

07:17.380 --> 07:25.090
We're going to set that you 1000 170 which is the initial default with other side made with bootstrap

07:26.710 --> 07:34.400
and for the initial height I said that you six hundred and fifty pixels here on size.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.480
Let's check this first checkbox by doing this.

07:38.520 --> 07:44.030
I went to ensure that we're going to have a slider that can extend across the full width of the screen.

07:44.190 --> 07:48.970
You can later tweak these other settings to learn more about displaying if you want.

07:49.200 --> 07:54.820
I am only going to work with the basic settings right here on slide show.

07:54.850 --> 07:59.010
You can see the types of effects that the slide show will have.

07:59.190 --> 08:05.160
You are going to change only one of these values which is relative to the amount of time each slide

08:05.160 --> 08:06.280
is on the screen.

08:06.540 --> 08:13.830
Let's decrease this value to seven thousand milliseconds which is the same as seven seconds here on

08:13.830 --> 08:14.660
controls.

08:14.800 --> 08:21.540
We can choose the elements we want for the navigation we can for example show the bollix disabled navigation

08:21.570 --> 08:24.340
arrows it's at your discretion.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.310
I'm just going to leave this as it is.

08:26.320 --> 08:26.870
OK.

08:28.120 --> 08:33.150
Here on their appearance it can change the slide show more generally.

08:33.220 --> 08:39.580
For example you can hide a certain amount of lights at the top of the list are or certainly to the beginning

08:39.670 --> 08:41.350
of the slide show.

08:41.410 --> 08:45.880
What matters most to us here is this text area below.

08:46.030 --> 08:48.570
Here we can define success for and it's Leiderman.

08:48.730 --> 08:52.010
And later on the course we're going to return to this place here.

08:53.580 --> 09:01.530
And finally here on content it can set the slider's content as we define that is likely to be made up

09:01.530 --> 09:02.620
by posts.

09:02.640 --> 09:07.180
All options are relative to which post will be displayed in the slide.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.640
You can choose here the post-Arab that is going to be used.

09:11.730 --> 09:16.830
For example you may have Bouffes or pages.

09:17.020 --> 09:19.060
Let's leave it as it was before.

09:20.070 --> 09:24.300
We can also choose just a few categories or some specific tags.

09:24.610 --> 09:29.050
Post formats and a bunch of other information.

09:29.070 --> 09:37.640
Let's say we want only five posts in our slider and if I click here I can see below the post that will

09:37.640 --> 09:39.350
be displayed in the slide there.

09:39.370 --> 09:47.360
After everything is don't all based on the filter as I said above Well when you're happy with all the

09:47.360 --> 09:50.490
choices just click here on safe settings.

09:51.500 --> 09:58.640
Now you're ready to set up each individual slide as we're working with a previously imported both slider

09:59.010 --> 10:01.720
will have less work to set up the slides.

10:02.030 --> 10:08.390
But as this last one is already taken too long will continue on this process in the next lesson.

10:08.540 --> 10:12.150
So thanks for watching and see you in the next lesson.
