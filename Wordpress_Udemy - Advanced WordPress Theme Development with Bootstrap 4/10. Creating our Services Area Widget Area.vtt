00:00.890 --> 00:06.860
Fellow guys in today's lesson we're going to show you one more thing we can do with the world's best

00:06.860 --> 00:08.370
widget areas.

00:08.420 --> 00:16.670
In previous lessons we used this widget airiest tribute sidebars to sidebars one for the home page and

00:16.670 --> 00:18.560
another for the blog page.

00:18.770 --> 00:21.890
But you can have more than simple sidebars.

00:21.890 --> 00:24.310
Don't let the name fool you.

00:24.690 --> 00:30.450
Today you're going to be creating three widget areas to used the service section here.

00:30.740 --> 00:38.450
Notice here that in the service section we got three items each of them is made up by the same elements

00:38.960 --> 00:43.720
an image a header in a paragraph fortnightly.

00:43.760 --> 00:50.210
WordPress has all the features that allows us to create this area and we can do that just by clicking

00:50.210 --> 00:51.760
and dragging elements.

00:51.800 --> 00:57.920
There is a widget that allows us to insert an image and there there's also a widget that allows us to

00:57.920 --> 01:02.370
create an area with a header and a totally customized content.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.370
So why not use these widgets to create all this here.

01:07.400 --> 01:14.180
One feature I've always missed in wordpress is a native widget that future or what you see is what you

01:14.180 --> 01:16.260
get site editing area.

01:16.340 --> 01:22.040
There are several places on the dashboard where this type of editor is there by default.

01:22.040 --> 01:30.950
For example in The Post editor but into Version 4.7 there was no native way to do the same thing from

01:30.950 --> 01:40.060
this version 4.7 new widgets were added include formatted text images video and audio all of them are

01:40.070 --> 01:46.760
resources that the Wordpress community requested and that until then were only possible to implement

01:46.790 --> 01:48.850
using plugins.

01:48.860 --> 01:51.450
Great but enough is not all can.

01:51.450 --> 01:53.910
Let's get down to business.

01:53.960 --> 02:00.110
The first thing we're going to do is use the HCM mail markup of the service section.

02:00.110 --> 02:07.630
First of all let's open up the page home that page be file and we want to remove this word here.

02:09.170 --> 02:14.600
I'm going to use the Emmets extension to speed up my work as you all know.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.020
You can write everything faster with it.

02:17.030 --> 02:21.740
I just IPN the classes I need and then hit the tab key.

02:21.740 --> 02:29.690
Now before the start of the row I'm going to create a new header and then this row I'm going to create

02:29.690 --> 02:32.850
the markup for the three elements I need to place here.

02:33.660 --> 02:42.690
By doing this I create all three divs all of them with column sizes I want and now gigolos out within

02:42.810 --> 02:43.710
each div.

02:43.860 --> 02:48.510
I'm going to create a new div with the services I get in class.

02:48.510 --> 02:57.600
I can easily do this by holding the control key or a command on a Mac like in like this and typing the

02:57.600 --> 03:01.010
code for the three things at once.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.210
OK excellent.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.890
I already have the required markup.

03:07.940 --> 03:17.000
Now let's create the three areas in the functions file as open up that file and now to create the three

03:17.000 --> 03:18.460
new widget areas.

03:18.650 --> 03:19.850
Just copy and paste.

03:19.850 --> 03:23.240
This last portion here three times.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.820
Just be careful not to copy anything wrong.

03:25.820 --> 03:31.780
For example we have a copy from the word register a sidebar to the semicolon here

03:36.440 --> 03:36.740
OK.

03:36.750 --> 03:43.280
Now we just change the values for name ID and description arguments of each of these areas.

04:12.680 --> 04:17.980
Let's leave the HCM wrappers the way they are OK and save everything.

04:18.920 --> 04:27.230
Now go back to the Wordpress dashboard head over to the appearance menu widgets and now we have our

04:27.240 --> 04:29.820
three new widget areas.

04:29.910 --> 04:31.290
Now it's pretty easy.

04:31.290 --> 04:38.400
We just have to know what widgets we need to visually compose our service section for all that we just

04:38.400 --> 04:39.150
need to.

04:39.250 --> 04:42.240
Very simple native widgets.

04:42.480 --> 04:51.440
One of them is this one image and the other one the text widget Let's click and drag the first widget

04:51.500 --> 04:53.070
to the first widget area.

04:53.930 --> 04:58.140
See that it allows me to add a title and upload an image.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.510
In our case I don't need a title.

05:00.610 --> 05:09.290
I live it Auntie and disciplined in image to complete the design of this area.

05:09.310 --> 05:15.860
I already have three images ready each with the width and height of 200 pixels.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.900
So I'll go ahead and grab this first image.

05:22.710 --> 05:30.240
OK now let's drag the text widget this time I'm going to add a title which should work as a heading

05:30.240 --> 05:31.900
element for my design.

05:32.370 --> 05:36.350
And here the content I'm going to paste any text.

05:36.810 --> 05:38.610
Ok I'll save this here.

05:39.740 --> 05:44.980
Let's go back to the page home page be filed and we want to say the following.

05:45.140 --> 05:52.840
Open PH BE tax if it's active sidebar.

05:53.070 --> 05:56.400
And what is the name of the first widget area.

05:56.780 --> 05:58.590
It's services one

06:03.500 --> 06:07.990
dynamic sidebar and the we just Area name again

06:11.730 --> 06:15.190
let's copy this here and call the next widget areas.

06:23.570 --> 06:33.540
I save this here and refresh the theme home page look you already have all the elements of the first

06:33.540 --> 06:34.570
widget area here.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.790
Excellent isn't it.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.230
Well since it worked.

06:38.270 --> 06:42.880
Let's go back to the widgets manager and do the same for the next widget areas.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.410
Our speed up the video a bit.

06:44.420 --> 06:45.150
OK.

07:10.210 --> 07:11.470
Now back to the thing

07:16.620 --> 07:17.420
excellent.

07:17.630 --> 07:22.320
We now have all the elements of the services section here on the page.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.950
All the images all the headings and the content.

07:25.950 --> 07:32.610
Of course it's a bit ugly but that's something we can solve easily with a bit of success.

07:32.940 --> 07:39.930
As I've mentioned since the beginning of the course we will not focus here on CSX only on features that

07:39.930 --> 07:43.090
relate directly to WordPress.

07:43.140 --> 07:47.230
So in the next lesson you'll see this year changes I'll be a plane.

07:47.250 --> 07:54.860
But of course any changes I make here will be in the files I'll make available for download anyway.

07:54.930 --> 08:00.730
Don't miss the next lesson as we're going to learn how to create a custom loop within WordPress.

08:00.870 --> 08:06.460
Simply one of the most interesting subjects so far in this course.

08:06.480 --> 08:11.670
That being said I'll wait for you in the next lesson and then by.
