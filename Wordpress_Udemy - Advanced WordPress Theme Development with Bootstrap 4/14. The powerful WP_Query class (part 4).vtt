00:01.450 --> 00:04.650
Hey what's going on guys it's Marcello once again.

00:04.870 --> 00:12.880
Today's lesson is the last one about W.P. Querrey this powerful WordPress class that allows us to create

00:12.880 --> 00:14.330
custom queries.

00:14.650 --> 00:22.330
So far we've just created a custom loop is helping us bring the latest post on the home page and that

00:22.330 --> 00:26.230
will be our first news item in this lessoned.

00:26.290 --> 00:33.700
We're going to build our second new machine bring the next two news items into the list before we start.

00:33.850 --> 00:39.660
I must apologize because there is an error here in the bootstrap CSSA classes.

00:39.730 --> 00:41.870
The order is inverted.

00:42.100 --> 00:48.000
The correct order will be first the container class and then the role inside its container.

00:48.110 --> 00:49.690
So sorry for that.

00:49.870 --> 00:54.360
Let's just swap the classes.

00:54.420 --> 00:58.760
Now back to the explanation to speed up things a bit.

00:58.770 --> 01:11.420
I'm going to copy the entire custom we created in the last lesson.

01:11.470 --> 01:18.940
So next we go ahead and change the name of a class object let's call it secondary hoedown.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.240
Commands The nak control the on Windows or Linux to find and replace everything at once.

01:27.700 --> 01:33.210
OK in the first loop we use to string methods to retrieve the database information.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.340
Should the W.P. Carey class.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.520
Now we go to the second method using an array.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.690
What is the right thing to use in an array instead of a query string.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.770
Well the adventurous is quite clear.

01:46.990 --> 01:53.290
Let's say that we have to pass several arguments to declare a string as the number of arguments grows

01:53.410 --> 02:00.010
it becomes more difficult to read and understand the comments to a point where we can no longer make

02:00.010 --> 02:00.950
mistakes.

02:01.030 --> 02:06.260
If there's a single mistake here it would be like trying to find a needle in the haystack.

02:07.900 --> 02:19.760
Now when we use arrays that doesn't happen let's create an array up here let's call it args and let's

02:19.760 --> 02:22.260
start adding the arguments here.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.420
The first argument is going to be the kind of post we want to fetch.

02:26.780 --> 02:33.420
So posts underscore type post.

02:33.510 --> 02:36.240
In fact this argument can be ignored.

02:36.270 --> 02:39.010
It's optional if you choose not to pass it.

02:39.030 --> 02:45.900
WordPress will always consider that what we want are both Indeed it's most useful actually when we have

02:45.900 --> 02:50.910
to work with custom post types but it's not our case.

02:51.090 --> 02:52.340
That's also pass here.

02:52.350 --> 03:01.740
The number of balls we want to bring in this case there are two posts now to fetch the post categories.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.780
Let's do something different.

03:04.110 --> 03:08.480
Let's start by choosing which categories will be excluded from the list.

03:08.550 --> 03:11.270
For that let's pass the category.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.290
Not in agreement.

03:13.590 --> 03:19.130
Just pay attention because there are two underscores after the word category.

03:19.130 --> 03:27.210
Right so is Category 2 underscores not on the score in it's go hadn't create an array here and passed.

03:27.210 --> 03:31.390
Category 8 became later pass.

03:31.420 --> 03:39.330
Other categories separated by comer's will also choose which categories will be included in the list.

03:39.340 --> 03:43.510
The opposite of category not in its category.

03:43.510 --> 03:48.710
In once again with underscores as great a nearer way.

03:49.030 --> 03:53.780
And inside it we want to pass the values for an 11.

03:53.860 --> 04:01.940
Thus when new categories are created they will have to be added here smell.

04:01.990 --> 04:11.680
Now that we have all the arguments let's just pass disarray to the WP Querrey class as change a few

04:11.680 --> 04:13.050
more things here.

04:13.150 --> 04:18.020
First the elements of this loop will have six columns instead of twelve.

04:18.370 --> 04:22.390
So let's set the code as same six class here.

04:23.740 --> 04:25.320
It you'll make the death tax.

04:25.320 --> 04:32.770
However with a 50 percent from small devices upwards towards large screen sizes and the name of the

04:32.770 --> 04:43.500
file that will be required here will be content high and secondary that be OK the loop itself is ready.

04:43.600 --> 04:48.400
Now you need to create this file called content hyphen secondary ph P

04:52.980 --> 04:58.280
that charge in this process app a bit by copying the contents of the previous license file.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.690
And we're going to save a new file.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.220
OK here we only change a few things.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.920
The tag article class

05:14.110 --> 05:16.270
and we want to remove the publication date.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.320
And that's it.

05:24.300 --> 05:24.660
OK.

05:24.670 --> 05:29.550
We now have a second row with you news items all of that.

05:29.740 --> 05:32.130
Thanks to our second custom move.

05:32.340 --> 05:33.700
Notice one thing though.

05:33.730 --> 05:36.230
The first news has been repeated here.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.900
But what if you don't want it repeated.

05:39.910 --> 05:41.350
Is there a way to do that.

05:41.620 --> 05:42.840
Yes of course.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.360
First let's add another argument shuddery

05:48.220 --> 05:56.750
and that argument will be offset when the use of said Intel WordPress how many items we wanted to ignore

05:56.870 --> 05:58.500
at the beginning of the list.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.510
Let's start again.

05:59.510 --> 06:01.010
For example one

06:05.150 --> 06:10.240
reload as you can see non-dualist makes more sense.

06:10.260 --> 06:17.140
That's because WordPress ignored the first result of the list which was the same post we have up here.

06:17.140 --> 06:20.780
If we change it to two this both here is going to be ignored.

06:20.950 --> 06:31.740
And the first one on the list is going to be this one here.

06:31.810 --> 06:32.840
Very cool.

06:34.730 --> 06:35.030
OK.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.050
This is the last lesson on W.P. Querrey.

06:38.310 --> 06:44.010
I hope you feel like you learned something new from the lessons but don't stop here.

06:44.010 --> 06:51.300
K equerry and custom loops are the most interesting topics in the Wordpress development world.

06:51.510 --> 06:56.060
In addition to the arguments we work with there are many many others.

06:56.190 --> 06:56.760
Go ahead.

06:56.760 --> 07:03.150
Visit de-link that are left available in this lesson be curios and exploit the full potential of this

07:03.150 --> 07:05.080
WP class.

07:05.160 --> 07:11.790
You see that for every scenario for every need there is a way to use this class that you can benefit

07:11.790 --> 07:12.490
from.

07:12.630 --> 07:19.500
Another thing what I taught you is just one way to create a filtered news list in wordpress.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.590
There are several ways to do this.

07:21.630 --> 07:22.800
You'll find the internet.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.830
Many people teaching how to do this.

07:25.830 --> 07:27.160
Neither way is wrong.

07:27.540 --> 07:28.470
So that's it.

07:28.470 --> 07:32.570
Then I wait for you in the next section of this course.

07:32.580 --> 07:38.760
Let's start bringing life to the inner interface of her thing and then see you later.
