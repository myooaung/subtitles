Guys in today's lesson and when to bring up a very important issue our pages well with graded template

00:09.610 --> 00:16.870
files for just about every sort of inner pages in wordpress they also learn how to create specific templates

00:17.170 --> 00:18.600
and many other things.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.690
Everything looks like paradise.

00:20.710 --> 00:26.200
Everything's falling into place but there will always be a time when a visitor will come across a page

00:26.200 --> 00:28.410
that doesn't exist on your site.

00:28.660 --> 00:35.700
Let's say that the visitor sees a link pointing to your site while reading the posts on another site.

00:35.770 --> 00:38.280
Except that this link was spelled wrong.

00:38.440 --> 00:45.370
You can bet that the visitor will end up falling on an error page but at the moment we cannot handle

00:45.370 --> 00:47.830
this error requests in Arfin.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.810
So for example let's simulate on there we're here.

00:50.830 --> 00:51.760
In the thin

00:54.950 --> 01:02.180
now for example I'm visiting a non-existent page but even so I'm seeing some content.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.790
I bet you're ready no way.

01:05.120 --> 01:11.870
The answer is that every time WordPress doesn't know what content to load it loads a very special file

01:11.870 --> 01:20.180
called code exactly called index dot page B which is the default template for them.

01:20.210 --> 01:26.960
You can see that in our plugin app here you can also find other clues.

01:26.980 --> 01:29.030
If you inspect the page.

01:29.290 --> 01:36.290
Notice that in the body tag we have the addition of a class called error for all four and either way

01:36.290 --> 01:44.760
to see more information is by modifying our headers speech peafowl so open that file and here in the

01:44.760 --> 01:52.120
title tag you're going to include the Wordpress function called W.P. underscore in title.

01:52.340 --> 01:58.520
Now reload the page I haven't new clues since the browser tab shows in the title that the page was not

01:58.520 --> 01:59.260
found.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.840
But even so this whole situation can lead your visitor to make a mistake.

02:05.210 --> 02:12.530
They are seeing some content and may find that the link they are actually visiting does exist and that

02:12.530 --> 02:18.050
the content they are seen is really what they wanted to see but that's not true.

02:18.830 --> 02:24.410
To solve this problem is quite easy as create a new file called for all four dot.

02:24.500 --> 02:24.790
Be

02:30.200 --> 02:32.480
as over to speed up things a bit.

02:32.490 --> 02:38.550
I'm going to copy one of the files this time I'm going to copy the archive that page file but it can

02:38.550 --> 02:46.880
of course choose the index that page pre-chewed OK but I need to make some modifications around here.

02:46.920 --> 02:56.560
Our Arab page will have no luck so I'm going to remove all this code here related to the loop.

02:56.700 --> 03:06.330
When you exclude the sidebar and as there will be no sidebar this def tag here will be 100 percent wide

03:06.790 --> 03:07.360
for that.

03:07.390 --> 03:09.600
Just remove this little class here.

03:10.480 --> 03:16.350
That's changed the main class of the day thank you for hyphen for of.

03:17.770 --> 03:18.370
Here.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.000
You're going to create a header.

03:21.790 --> 03:30.670
And so infirmaries text elements that's a.

03:30.800 --> 03:37.010
And now you already have something that really indicates to the visitor that the content doesn't exist.

03:37.670 --> 03:44.300
At this point our visitor must already be very frustrated and offer them some solution.

03:44.330 --> 03:49.110
For example we can invite them to do a search to find what they want.

03:49.490 --> 03:53.960
Let's create a new tag here and include the search form here.

03:57.150 --> 03:59.370
We've already learned how to do that.

03:59.420 --> 04:07.310
Just call the function get search for another thing we can do is invite a visitor to check the latest

04:07.310 --> 04:09.840
blog posts to do this.

04:09.910 --> 04:15.530
Let's learn yet another very useful WordPress function called the widget.

04:15.530 --> 04:21.280
It does nothing more than call any WordPress widget in a specific point of the code.

04:21.560 --> 04:27.100
If we visit the Wordpress Codex you'll see that there is a list of widgets available.

04:27.110 --> 04:34.360
In fact this list is made up of those widgets that already comes in the default installation of wordpress.

04:34.410 --> 04:42.700
You can call this widget here W.P. widget recent posts so the visitor will see a list of recent posts

04:43.460 --> 04:45.480
and you know how to use it.

04:45.500 --> 04:52.730
Just click here in the sidebar menu and read it see all the parameters that they can use for each widget.

04:53.060 --> 04:58.160
We can use this function the way it is now with a very basic implementation.

04:58.330 --> 05:01.890
Or it can pass some more parameters in our example here.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.530
Let's play with these two parameters.

05:04.610 --> 05:07.250
Title and number.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.900
Let's copy this example here.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.940
And paste it into the file.

05:12.950 --> 05:14.820
Recreating.

05:14.870 --> 05:18.780
Now let's include an array and pass the title argument.

05:22.970 --> 05:28.910
And number let's limit the number of links to three

05:35.790 --> 05:38.300
OK X and its results.

05:38.300 --> 05:42.680
Now our error page has become much more meaningful for a visitor.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.140
Don't you think.

05:44.150 --> 05:47.550
OK let me finish this lesson with an observation.

05:48.050 --> 05:53.500
As a developer it is more than your obligation to create a narrower file.

05:53.510 --> 05:55.990
It greatly helps the visitor.

05:56.420 --> 06:02.720
It doesn't matter if you're creating the thing for yourself or for a single client or distribution of

06:02.720 --> 06:03.200
theme.

06:03.230 --> 06:06.390
More people never forget you create this file OK.

06:07.460 --> 06:13.250
Well as you can see we are making great strides in creating the thing and I hope you're enjoying the

06:13.250 --> 06:14.010
lessons.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.570
So see you next time.
