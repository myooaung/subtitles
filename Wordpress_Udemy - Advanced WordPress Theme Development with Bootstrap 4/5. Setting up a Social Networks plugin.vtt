Hey what's up guys.

00:02.370 --> 00:08.790
In today's lesson we're going to install another clone and this blogging will be responsible for showing

00:08.790 --> 00:15.460
us the social media icons here in this area which for now has only this text.

00:15.490 --> 00:19.600
There are a handful of INS in wordpress repository for this purpose.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.290
But I chose one that is easy to set up called social.

00:23.290 --> 00:26.290
I can switch it by Daniel Smith.

00:26.470 --> 00:32.650
So let's start by installing this plug in as go Virtu plugins add a new one

00:37.710 --> 00:47.910
and search for the displaying Let's scroll down a bit and here's the plugin that we want to install.

00:54.380 --> 00:57.780
Well with a plug installed Let's think for a moment.

00:58.070 --> 01:00.940
This plug in is a different kind of plug in.

01:00.950 --> 01:08.660
In fact it's so we did so to use it we first need a new widget every available Chuwit we can added at

01:08.660 --> 01:10.020
this moment in our theme.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.880
We have five widget areas by the way.

01:12.980 --> 01:16.430
Let's remember that going over to a perience widgets

01:20.050 --> 01:25.390
we then have these five widget areas and they need a new one here.

01:25.450 --> 01:32.260
Otherwise we will not have where to add this widget we just installed you already know how to create

01:32.260 --> 01:33.930
a widget area right.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.550
We need to register one more area in the functions that PSP file.

01:38.620 --> 01:42.030
So let's open this file up in our subline text

01:44.760 --> 01:52.020
and here we have this portion of the code where the five exist in widget areas are registered to create

01:52.140 --> 01:52.910
a new one.

01:52.920 --> 02:00.050
It's very easy to Scobie all of this code here corresponding to the register sidebar function and pasted

02:00.060 --> 02:01.320
just below.

02:01.470 --> 02:08.140
Just be very careful because the copied code has to be placed right after the semicolon here right.

02:10.720 --> 02:15.250
Now the work we will have will be to modify the name of the widget various

02:18.000 --> 02:24.400
your ID lets call it social media and the description

02:31.040 --> 02:35.590
and the rest of the code will be left the way it is okay.

02:35.590 --> 02:43.010
Let's go back to the Wordpress admin now in this page we can see that there is a new widget area.

02:44.380 --> 02:48.120
Now we can track as many pages as we want into it.

02:48.850 --> 02:52.950
But of course we were interested in just one of these widgets.

02:53.050 --> 03:00.460
Lets look for the plugin widget we just installed social icons lets drag and drop the widgets to the

03:00.460 --> 03:01.500
new area.

03:01.970 --> 03:08.120
And now we can go ahead and configure all the options and do this first.

03:08.290 --> 03:14.890
We don't want any title because according to our layout the only one the icons with respective links

03:14.950 --> 03:16.270
nothing more.

03:16.270 --> 03:24.080
Lets use an icon of 32 pixels medium size and we're going to click here to hide the title.

03:24.370 --> 03:32.290
If we leave this option unchecked a text will appear say in followers and we don't want this text messing

03:32.290 --> 03:33.580
around in layout.

03:33.590 --> 03:40.840
OK now you finish out just specify the addresses for all the social media that we want.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.870
I'm going a few only with Facebook and LinkedIn

03:49.630 --> 03:50.460
now I can say

03:58.420 --> 04:03.550
OK but of course it's not just that it's never that simple.

04:03.600 --> 04:09.240
You still need to make some changes to the head of that piece file which is vertical that generates

04:09.240 --> 04:12.680
the threat bar comes from and called the new widget area.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.440
There are two

04:16.180 --> 04:21.080
as I open up this file and we're going to remove this text here.

04:21.350 --> 04:27.980
And instead let's call the new widget area here to do this is pretty simple.

04:27.990 --> 04:31.820
I up on the beach stack here and write the following.

04:32.150 --> 04:42.330
If is active side bar and what side we're doing that we just created called social media

04:47.360 --> 04:58.580
dynamic sidebar and we passed the name of the sidebar or widget area again to the function OK.

04:58.610 --> 05:00.790
Now we can see the result on the screen.

05:01.160 --> 05:10.060
Let's refresh the page and there we have the social media icons the ones that we fill in there in our

05:10.060 --> 05:12.350
widget but it's still strange.

05:12.370 --> 05:14.100
Look I don't like it.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.380
I think we need a bit of success to make it look better.

05:19.160 --> 05:25.150
Let's open up our CSSA file them.

05:25.190 --> 05:25.640
That's great.

05:25.640 --> 05:35.290
A new area here social widgets and here is say the following for the order list.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.560
Let's say there will be no padding and no margin

05:44.650 --> 05:47.840
for each element of the list as to the following.

05:55.920 --> 06:03.000
This will cause those bullets to disappear and each item to be displayed side by side not one on top

06:03.000 --> 06:05.300
of the other as it is at the moment.

06:06.510 --> 06:15.070
Let's say now let's refresh the page.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.270
Voila here it is.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.370
We now have our social icons.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.400
Are you ready.

06:21.410 --> 06:28.610
We have a good space for each icon and if you want to add more icons just go back to the widget and

06:28.610 --> 06:32.550
filling with addresses for another social media OK.

06:32.990 --> 06:35.750
So that's what I had to show in this lesson.

06:35.870 --> 06:38.750
I hope you enjoy it and see you next time.

06:39.050 --> 06:39.540
Bye.
