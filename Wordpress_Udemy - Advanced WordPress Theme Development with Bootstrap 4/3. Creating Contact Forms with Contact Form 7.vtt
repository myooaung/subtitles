Hi everyone in today's lesson.

00:03.760 --> 00:09.870
Continuing our blog installations we're going to be adding to contact forms to our theme.

00:09.940 --> 00:15.480
The first one will be added in the home page sidebar and the second one will be added to the themes

00:15.490 --> 00:17.110
contact page.

00:17.140 --> 00:20.250
So without further ado let's get started.

00:21.040 --> 00:27.490
There are several plugins that can be used to have forms in wordpress we can use this blog and create

00:27.730 --> 00:32.750
from simple contact forms to more specific and more complex forms.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.390
In our case we want to use a plug in called Contact form 7.

00:37.440 --> 00:42.900
One of the most used in wordpress and also one of which I love to work with.

00:43.210 --> 00:49.100
Well before you ask me why am I using a plugin to create a simple contact form.

00:49.120 --> 00:53.010
Isn't it easier to create that using only plain page code.

00:53.320 --> 00:58.840
Well of course it could be easier depending on your BHP skills in wordpress.

00:58.960 --> 01:05.500
You can create just about everything but I always use a plugin in this case in the first place because

01:05.590 --> 01:12.490
it's faster and secondly because a good plugin is going to take care of various security aspects such

01:12.490 --> 01:16.240
as escapin strengths security tokens etc..

01:16.360 --> 01:22.330
Since I don't want to worry about these things in all my projects I always prefer to use some kind of

01:22.330 --> 01:23.290
plugin.

01:23.650 --> 01:29.890
That said At school I had installed this plugin we had over two plugins add new

01:34.950 --> 01:37.740
and they're going to search for contact form 7

01:41.660 --> 01:42.840
lasting stole it

01:45.860 --> 01:46.560
activated

01:50.180 --> 01:57.140
and now we have one more thing in the dashboard menu called compact and we click here.

01:57.150 --> 02:00.200
Your Radagast abusing exemple form.

02:00.320 --> 02:06.980
Notice here that it has a link that allows us to edit the form and the short code that you'll be using

02:06.980 --> 02:11.180
to insert the form into a page or into a template file.

02:11.240 --> 02:15.050
If you click on the link you get to this page.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.870
Here we get these four tabs.

02:17.990 --> 02:24.110
I'll be showing you the first three of them and the first one can create the form itself adding the

02:24.110 --> 02:31.700
fields we want and the coolest thing is that we can create fields using CML or clicking on this buttons

02:32.000 --> 02:36.300
which makes things easier and speed up the form creation.

02:36.310 --> 02:42.970
I'm not going to explain every single element even because everything here is quite intuitive and easy

02:42.970 --> 02:44.520
to handle.

02:44.560 --> 02:50.550
I suppose I want to add another text field in which the user will have to type the name of their CD.

02:50.890 --> 02:53.590
So just make room for the text box.

02:53.890 --> 03:00.590
For example here click here in text and enter the necessary data.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.270
For example going to make this fuel required.

03:04.500 --> 03:09.260
Call it city if I want a placeholder.

03:09.310 --> 03:15.920
I enter some value here on the default value field and click here on this option.

03:16.840 --> 03:22.880
And if later on I wish to style the field I can type in ID or a class.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.080
OK ready.

03:24.310 --> 03:30.330
Now just click on inserts that and make it look the same as the other fields.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.570
I'm going to place it inside a label tag

03:38.290 --> 03:39.850
here under mail.

03:39.940 --> 03:44.820
We have the form submission settings as I am on a local server.

03:44.860 --> 03:50.440
I'm going to leave everything as it is since I would need to be on a remote server if I want to make

03:50.440 --> 03:54.720
a fool and more accurate test messages.

03:54.790 --> 04:02.520
We can modify the error messages warnings success messages and so on before saving.

04:02.530 --> 04:06.730
I'm going to change the name of my form to sidebar form.

04:06.790 --> 04:13.020
This will be the form that will be displayed in the home page sidebar and I'm going to add in nature

04:13.120 --> 04:23.590
heading tag in a paragraph explaining what is this form.

04:23.820 --> 04:29.430
So let's save the form and we're ready to take it to the home page.

04:29.460 --> 04:30.930
This is very easy.

04:30.930 --> 04:35.290
Just got the discharge code and inserted in the place that we want.

04:35.460 --> 04:40.130
In our case this form will be inserted in the home base sidebar.

04:40.180 --> 04:45.790
Remember that in the previous sections we created two sidebars in the functions that page befoul.

04:45.930 --> 04:52.760
Until then we have used only the second Ciber the first one was used for testing purposes only.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.340
But enough of that.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.440
Now let's include some meaningful content here.

04:57.750 --> 05:05.250
Let's go ahead head over to appearance widgets and we're going to add the text we did in the first Ciber

05:05.820 --> 05:06.610
in our case.

05:06.690 --> 05:08.340
Let's just added the text we did.

05:08.370 --> 05:12.060
We already had less space to form short code.

05:12.060 --> 05:17.390
We just copy it we want to remove this title here.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.310
Save.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.160
And now let's see how Rufin looks like

05:26.110 --> 05:29.580
as you can see it's working but it's a little weird.

05:29.780 --> 05:36.800
This is happening because there is no CSSA rules in the plugin that control the width of the text fields

05:37.400 --> 05:40.910
so it's up to us creating Surtsey says rules.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.750
But don't worry because it's quite easy actually.

05:44.830 --> 05:48.990
I'll be using a code snippet I found in the plugins documentation itself.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.060
Just go ahead and open Armentieres file.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.270
And I'll paste in that code snippet right here I'm going to change this for you here.

05:58.280 --> 06:04.920
You 100 percent and remove these other values here because we don't need them.

06:05.230 --> 06:12.550
By doing this my text fields text areas and other fields of view the content area.

06:12.790 --> 06:13.570
So let's say

06:21.760 --> 06:23.470
also is very cool.

06:23.950 --> 06:26.880
With little we forward it have a working contact form.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.170
That's amazing.

06:28.980 --> 06:29.510
OK.

06:29.700 --> 06:35.370
What they can do to make it a little better is to add placeholders to the other form fields because

06:35.370 --> 06:38.380
we want the other views to look the same.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.330
So let's go back and edit the form once again.

06:44.530 --> 07:00.740
And just follow the same logic that we used for the city field.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.930
I think I forgot the name if you.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.540
Let's get back there.

07:13.330 --> 07:16.700
And here we get all the fields with the same format.

07:17.080 --> 07:17.360
OK.

07:17.380 --> 07:20.810
Now we also need a form for the contact page.

07:21.070 --> 07:28.270
If we open this page we see that we have only a bunch of dummy text to solve this in the fastest way

07:28.590 --> 07:29.940
we're going to duplicate the form.

07:29.950 --> 07:34.740
We've already created for the home page.

07:34.940 --> 07:44.130
If it just mouseover the forms link and click HERE where Id say and duplicate Let's rename the form

07:47.480 --> 07:58.730
and tweak the content a bit now and just say and copy the new charge called Let's go to pages and open

07:58.730 --> 08:03.670
the contact page for editing.

08:03.750 --> 08:09.680
Now to space the short code wherever you want in the page.

08:09.780 --> 08:13.890
And now let's take a look at the page to see if the form is showing up.

08:15.090 --> 08:18.320
And look the form is here the way we want it.

08:18.530 --> 08:19.240
Excellent.

08:20.030 --> 08:22.820
Just one more thing before we finish this lesson.

08:23.060 --> 08:28.400
This plugin as I told you at the beginning of today's lesson is quite versatile.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.210
You can do a lot with it.

08:30.440 --> 08:37.460
However since one lesson is not enough for us to explain all of its features I invite you to visit the

08:37.460 --> 08:39.050
plugins documentation.

08:39.200 --> 08:46.470
So whenever we edit a form we have this link here on the right side that leads to the plugins documentation.

08:46.730 --> 08:48.740
I think it's worth taking a look.

08:48.740 --> 08:50.830
You never know when you need some support.

08:52.040 --> 08:59.300
Well with that said we finished this lesson here and our theme is getting even more beautiful and complete.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.980
So I hope you enjoyed it too.

09:01.310 --> 09:04.250
And I see you in the next lesson by.
