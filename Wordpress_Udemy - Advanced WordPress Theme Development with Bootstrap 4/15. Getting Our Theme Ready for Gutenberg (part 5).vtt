00:01.200 --> 00:02.510
Hey what's up.

00:02.510 --> 00:04.300
Welcome to my lesson.

00:04.580 --> 00:08.510
As you know we are learning to make our theme ready for good Amberly.

00:08.780 --> 00:11.410
We already know what good Amber is.

00:11.420 --> 00:16.720
You've been introduced to this new amazing tool we enable some cool features.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.750
We fixed some bugs etc. In today's lesson.

00:20.810 --> 00:25.060
They continue to add support to some other advanced features.

00:25.430 --> 00:31.710
This time you'll learn how to add our own custom colors to the good unbury color palette.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.390
And what's this for.

00:33.740 --> 00:41.870
Well by now you've seen that your users can do almost everything they want when they are editing posts

00:41.930 --> 00:42.970
and pages.

00:43.010 --> 00:50.390
But let's suppose you want the end users to be able to create an element that use only the callers who

00:50.390 --> 00:53.570
have already defined in your film color palette.

00:53.870 --> 00:57.750
Well it had the biggest job of all choosing the callers.

00:57.760 --> 01:05.350
Testing them combining them and you don't want the user to turn his or her website into a rainbow.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.920
Oh my goodness.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.170
Surely you don't want that.

01:09.350 --> 01:14.960
So with Gutenburg you can determine that the user will only be able to choose the colors that you want

01:14.960 --> 01:16.460
through the site.

01:16.760 --> 01:22.070
This will be true for every element that can let you choose different background and text colors for

01:22.070 --> 01:27.740
example blocks such as the paragraph or the button block by default.

01:27.740 --> 01:31.290
Good Amberg already comes with a default color palette set.

01:31.550 --> 01:39.050
So if you create a paragraph block here on the block specter under color settings you already have these

01:39.050 --> 01:40.910
colors defined.

01:40.910 --> 01:49.720
Also the user can choose other colors here but lets put an end to this mass and define her own colors.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.030
First let's add some more support in functions that BHP

01:56.120 --> 02:06.070
the name of this new feature is editor hyphen color hyphen palette for it to work.

02:06.090 --> 02:12.640
We first open an array here and inside to have another array.

02:13.350 --> 02:22.090
And now we're going to pass some arguments the first one is name let's call the gettext translation

02:22.090 --> 02:22.830
function

02:27.020 --> 02:32.210
our name this color blude rad is just a name.

02:32.220 --> 02:39.200
OK the next color won't be exactly blue red but it'll do for the moment.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.440
The next argument is the color slug.

02:42.980 --> 02:47.580
This is very important because it will help us define the color.

02:47.930 --> 02:52.840
As I said its value as blude hyphen.

02:53.080 --> 03:00.990
Read and the last one is color pass the hex color code.

03:01.240 --> 03:08.290
In our case it is still the red color we use snarfing not exactly the blue and red color has said that

03:08.320 --> 03:11.360
it doesn't matter to set a second color.

03:11.380 --> 03:13.120
Just copy this array here.

03:14.020 --> 03:16.560
And change the values.

03:16.580 --> 03:27.400
Let's create an option for the white color for example.

03:27.420 --> 03:33.130
This will only help us show a little color circles in the block inspector.

03:33.150 --> 03:34.890
If the saving reload Gutenburg

03:44.430 --> 03:46.590
now would click to select the paragraph again.

03:48.260 --> 03:54.030
Color settings and look here our colors.

03:54.270 --> 04:01.860
I can use this white color to sad the font color and the red color will be the background of our paragraphs.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.690
I can do the same thing for a button.

04:05.690 --> 04:08.510
For example I add a block with a button

04:23.270 --> 04:29.850
but the problem is that if you look at the front end nothing will appear with the color that we choose.

04:32.050 --> 04:38.430
As I told you earlier we need some customisation before use and most of the features we enable the ADD

04:38.430 --> 04:39.720
themes support.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.800
The reason is quite simple.

04:42.040 --> 04:49.660
If you look at the HMO code for the block here in good Amberg you'll see that WordPress creates a special

04:49.660 --> 04:53.850
class that starts with has hyphen.

04:54.030 --> 04:59.690
Then you have the strength for this like argument and a context of use.

04:59.840 --> 05:06.830
In this case that red color that was used for the background color and that what color said for the

05:06.830 --> 05:11.680
font color in order for them to be available in the front end.

05:11.910 --> 05:18.740
We have to add the corresponding CSSA to the theme CSSA file but it would be like a piece of cake.

05:18.810 --> 05:20.770
Lots of police says file again.

05:24.960 --> 05:30.350
First let's set the red color to the background and the font.

05:30.510 --> 05:36.750
The name of the selector will always start with a has hyphen after words.

05:36.770 --> 05:48.810
We need the colors like blude hyphen red and then the context or the background we use background hyphen

05:49.320 --> 05:50.470
color.

05:50.670 --> 06:03.880
Now just past the color hex code to the background color property.

06:03.970 --> 06:15.880
Now for the font color that space has hyphen blude hyphen right and color as the context of use and

06:15.880 --> 06:19.270
pass the hex code here to the color property.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.100
And that's it.

06:25.100 --> 06:39.310
Now I'll just do the same thing for the white color.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.030
All right.

06:40.070 --> 06:42.790
Just Saveur changes.

06:42.900 --> 06:50.040
And now let's go back to the front and let's reload the page using comb through shift are to clear the

06:50.040 --> 06:51.600
browser cache.

06:51.660 --> 06:57.780
We don't want to load Arshiya says file from the cache.

06:57.970 --> 07:04.260
And there you have it the button and the paragraph everything with the color of it defined.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.850
And one last tip.

07:05.920 --> 07:11.520
Let's assume you don't want the user to choose different colors at all on the site.

07:11.530 --> 07:17.010
You can even disable the color picker for this you need to add some more support.

07:17.050 --> 07:24.020
This one is called disable custom colors so and theme supports

07:28.440 --> 07:34.030
disable hyphen custom hyphen colors

07:44.920 --> 07:51.220
and from now on the user only be able to choose the colors that you define earlier.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.810
That's great.

07:52.810 --> 07:59.580
One cool thing is that could America gives you some tips when the color combination is inconsistent.

07:59.830 --> 08:05.030
This can prevent the user from choosing color combinations with very low contrast for example.

08:05.230 --> 08:09.350
But the final word is yours as the developer.

08:09.460 --> 08:16.840
You're going to define the extent to which your theme will restrict or extend Gutenberg's functionalities.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.750
It's in your hands.

08:19.210 --> 08:27.970
And the same concept also applies for font sizes here in the paragraph block under text settings.

08:27.970 --> 08:31.570
You can set different values for these buttons for example.

08:31.570 --> 08:41.360
Change the S M L and Excel labels and also the font sizes associated with each of them.

08:41.380 --> 08:45.750
The process is very similar to the one I explained in this lesson.

08:45.880 --> 08:50.830
I'll give you a link to the Word Press that communication explaining which codes you have to use to

08:50.830 --> 08:55.730
customize text as the process is very similar to the one that's just seen.

08:55.750 --> 08:56.800
I won't go over it.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.710
OK.

08:58.210 --> 09:01.800
You can take that as an exercise if you want to be implemented.

09:01.930 --> 09:04.520
But I'm going to stick with what they got.

09:04.780 --> 09:09.210
I hope you like it and I'll wait for you then in the next lesson.

09:09.220 --> 09:09.690
Recording.
