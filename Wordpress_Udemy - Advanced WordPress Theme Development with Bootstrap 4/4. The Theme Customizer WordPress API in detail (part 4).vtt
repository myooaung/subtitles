00:01.390 --> 00:02.780
Hey what's up guys.

00:02.950 --> 00:08.620
Welcome to this lesson which is going to be the last one about the thing because the miser in this lesson

00:08.830 --> 00:13.140
as promised we're going to make our math more dynamic.

00:13.150 --> 00:17.220
You remember that lesson in which we created our map.

00:17.290 --> 00:19.890
It has included two values manually.

00:20.200 --> 00:28.200
For those who don't remember how I started my open ended page home that BGB file again here at the end

00:28.200 --> 00:31.690
of the file we have the Google Maps I-frame.

00:31.710 --> 00:40.470
But notice here that these two values the API key and the address were hard coded into the file.

00:40.830 --> 00:47.520
And here comes the question how the owner of the site home most of the time doesn't understand anything

00:47.520 --> 00:50.610
about programming and it's not for us to understand.

00:50.610 --> 00:53.970
Of course we all manage to edit those values.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.460
This is very unlikely to happen.

00:56.460 --> 01:02.760
So today we're going to learn how to create a friendly or directive to the site owner or to a thin user.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.390
OK.

01:03.660 --> 01:09.270
At the end of this lesson you're going to have to do new fields in customizing and you'll be able to

01:09.270 --> 01:14.420
set both the API key and the address in a very friendly way.

01:15.180 --> 01:20.080
Let's start with the customer that ph file as add a new comment here

01:22.880 --> 01:27.580
and I'm here you're going to be creating a new section to speed up a bit.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.590
I'm going to copy this portion here.

01:32.270 --> 01:35.280
And I'm going to change only the necessary venues.

01:36.190 --> 01:39.610
The section name is should be SAQ underscore.

01:39.650 --> 01:40.130
Matt

01:44.080 --> 01:45.030
and description

01:47.870 --> 01:48.260
OK.

01:48.270 --> 01:51.240
Now we can create the settings and the controls.

01:51.540 --> 01:52.140
Let's do this.

01:52.140 --> 01:56.800
First of all for the API key let's copy the setting here.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.120
And let's change the name of the setting.

02:02.300 --> 02:08.660
In our case it will be set and the score map underscore API key.

02:08.780 --> 02:14.480
The setting will be responsible for saving and retrieve the API key value in the Word Press.

02:14.480 --> 02:20.020
WP options table the default value will be empty.

02:20.300 --> 02:25.640
And as this to also be a common text field that's keep the same callback.

02:25.640 --> 02:31.320
Now let's include the control copy again.

02:31.370 --> 02:43.300
Let's call this control the R L and the score Meck underscore API key we set a label and here in description

02:43.450 --> 02:47.510
as do different Let's give an instruction to the user.

02:48.160 --> 02:54.060
If they don't have a key yes let's include the link so that they can generate the key themselves.

02:54.520 --> 02:59.140
And now we only need to specify which section and setting this control belongs to

03:06.570 --> 03:06.920
OK.

03:06.940 --> 03:11.210
Now let's do the same thing for the address viewed as Scobie.

03:11.260 --> 03:15.900
All of this here and we only need to replace the values

03:18.830 --> 03:24.570
as condescending set underscore MacT underscore address.

03:24.590 --> 03:30.740
Now as this view will be a text area with multiple lines the callback needs to be different.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.350
Naspers here ask underscore textarea.

03:35.470 --> 03:43.080
This one is another WordPress function capable of sanitising the data passed in the textarea fude and

03:43.080 --> 03:54.200
the corresponding control will be called CTE r l underscore map and the score address.

03:54.250 --> 03:57.460
Let's ask the user not to type special characters in here.

03:57.470 --> 04:04.000
OK in my experience this feud will work even if the user types are special characters in.

04:04.210 --> 04:08.100
But let's ask them not to do this finally.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.510
That said the section

04:13.960 --> 04:14.530
setting

04:18.190 --> 04:20.690
and the field stype will be textarea

04:23.180 --> 04:34.760
OK let's say and let's check out our customized.

04:34.910 --> 04:37.030
Now we have a new section here.

04:37.460 --> 04:42.850
Let's click here and we finally have urge you new foods.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.730
Let's see if you can set any value here.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.390
Copy the API key.

04:47.390 --> 04:48.200
We're testing

04:59.830 --> 05:03.110
unless we specify a different address for Emap

05:13.480 --> 05:14.000
let's say

05:18.150 --> 05:26.080
nice we have no errors and the fields are still here which means they have been saved onto the database.

05:26.080 --> 05:26.500
Good.

05:26.590 --> 05:29.980
Now how are supposed to use these fields.

05:30.370 --> 05:31.780
Well very easy.

05:31.780 --> 05:38.230
First let's go back to the page home that page profile the way to do this that I consider to be the

05:38.290 --> 05:42.870
easiest way is first create two variables above the I-frame.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.760
Let's open the tags up here.

05:46.870 --> 05:52.120
That's great the first variable call key and this variable.

05:52.130 --> 05:58.970
You get the value of a get thing mod with a setting that holds the value of the API key which is called

05:59.090 --> 06:02.430
set and the score map and the score API key.

06:03.580 --> 06:09.690
Now the other variable will be called the tress and it will do the same thing but for the other setting

06:13.720 --> 06:16.220
but a very important detail.

06:16.480 --> 06:22.120
When we retrieve the value of the address it may not be passed with the correct formatting to the map

06:22.810 --> 06:25.670
depending on how the user enters the address.

06:25.780 --> 06:33.130
It will be included in the link with special characters spaces comer's line breaks and this can cause

06:33.130 --> 06:36.460
some problems to prevent this from happening.

06:36.610 --> 06:43.480
We're going to wrap the value returned from the database with a native function called your L in code.

06:48.300 --> 06:55.350
According to the HP manual This function is convenient when encoding the string to be used in a query.

06:55.350 --> 07:00.630
Part of the Eurail as a convenient way to pass variables to the next page.

07:00.750 --> 07:08.580
So as you use it here now comes these sparrers as replace the fixed values with the variables we just

07:08.580 --> 07:09.790
created.

07:09.840 --> 07:16.450
Since these values come directly from the database we ensure that they are always dynamic.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.690
First let's delete the key value

07:24.490 --> 07:25.300
and the echo.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.740
The variable key out

07:31.830 --> 07:34.920
and we're going to do the same thing with the address variable

07:43.590 --> 07:45.300
saith.

07:45.530 --> 07:48.880
And this time let's make the text directly in the customize or

07:53.380 --> 07:54.910
let's change the address

08:05.570 --> 08:06.990
and automatically.

08:06.980 --> 08:11.350
You'll notice that the map with the new address is rendered in the thing.

08:11.660 --> 08:15.260
Wow that's simply fantastic.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.020
It's brilliant.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.910
Let's change the address again.

08:27.190 --> 08:29.520
And there this.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.010
Very good that safe

08:43.960 --> 08:45.880
and everything's ready.

08:45.890 --> 08:46.500
That's it.

08:47.660 --> 08:54.230
Folks I really hope you enjoy this lesson and I also hope that you have the chance to use these ideas

08:54.260 --> 09:00.140
in real projects for me that would be really really rewarding.

09:00.650 --> 09:04.310
OK but the cost doesn't end here in the following sections.

09:04.350 --> 09:10.040
Are you going to learn the basics about fien internationalization and we also learned a way to package

09:10.040 --> 09:12.680
Arfin for distribution.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.650
So until then see your.
