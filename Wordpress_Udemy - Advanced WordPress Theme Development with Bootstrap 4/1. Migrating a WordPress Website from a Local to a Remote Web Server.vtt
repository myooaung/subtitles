00:01.250 --> 00:05.360
Everyone this is a very short lesson quite simple.

00:05.360 --> 00:11.180
And the goal here is to teach for those who still don't know how to stand the sight read it on the local

00:11.180 --> 00:12.010
server.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.540
Your remote server of your choice.

00:14.920 --> 00:21.890
I when to leave aside the issue of which is the best hosting company for Wordpress even because currently

00:21.890 --> 00:27.950
I am not affiliated with any of these companies by the way if you want to know my own opinion.

00:28.130 --> 00:34.840
The best type of hosting currently are the so-called virtual private servers or the.

00:34.970 --> 00:39.720
However I'm not going to give you many details of how this type of server works.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.760
Even though this is something I'm still learning.

00:43.070 --> 00:49.220
Currently there are a lot of people running away from shared servers and migrating their Web sites to

00:49.220 --> 00:50.630
some sort of peace.

00:51.050 --> 00:57.110
But for this lesson I'm going to use a shared hosting service that I have purchased in any hosting company

00:57.610 --> 01:02.370
here I have access to a subpanel which greatly helps the installation of wordpress.

01:02.810 --> 01:09.760
One important detail I'm going to teach you how to migrate Web sites using a plugin called W.P. clone.

01:10.100 --> 01:16.370
There is a way to migrate the whole site manually as well but lately I've been preferring to use plugins

01:16.370 --> 01:17.550
to do this.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.750
It is much faster and so I always spare a few minutes more of my day.

01:22.840 --> 01:29.000
Every time I need to perform this type of task this plugin works great if your website is not ubique

01:29.390 --> 01:35.230
it will be perfect for Migration this website we created you in discourse on top of that.

01:35.270 --> 01:40.170
Lately I've been using this plugin as a backup solution for my sites as well.

01:40.490 --> 01:42.660
So let's get started.

01:42.770 --> 01:49.040
To start off we need to access the hosting company control panel and we're going to create a database

01:49.040 --> 01:53.260
to install WordPress set over two databases.

01:54.340 --> 02:02.220
We click on My sequel databases what we all need in order to install WordPress we need a user with the

02:02.220 --> 02:05.510
respective passwords and a database.

02:05.670 --> 02:12.310
First of all let's create an empty database by clicking here where it says create new database

02:15.680 --> 02:23.660
click here in create database write down the name of your database or copy its name to any notepad application.

02:23.660 --> 02:29.660
The fact is that we need to know the name of this database during the Wordpress installation so keep

02:29.660 --> 02:31.030
it saved somehow.

02:32.250 --> 02:35.990
Now you create the database user and scroll down a little.

02:36.000 --> 02:45.620
It says My sequel users add new user I'm going to type a name to this user and I want to generate a

02:45.620 --> 02:46.610
password here.

02:49.980 --> 02:55.520
Click on create user and I'm going to also save this username and password somewhere

03:00.240 --> 03:02.730
right now with this true information.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.600
I have to add the created user to the database.

03:05.690 --> 03:11.960
A lot of people forget to do this and in the end they don't understand why the Wordpress installation

03:11.960 --> 03:13.430
doesn't work.

03:13.430 --> 03:20.780
The fact is that the created user needs to have all the privileges of creating change in tables and

03:20.780 --> 03:23.290
other privileges within the database.

03:23.300 --> 03:30.350
Otherwise this user will not be able to do anything inside the database which include installing WordPress.

03:30.560 --> 03:41.370
Let's go to where it says add user to database choose our user and our database and click on Add in

03:41.390 --> 03:42.600
the next screen.

03:42.790 --> 03:49.080
We check all privileges make changes and that's it.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.140
The whole process is finished.

03:51.140 --> 03:54.820
You already have a user database configured.

03:54.920 --> 04:01.160
Now we can go ahead and send the Wordpress installation file to the server if you know how to use in

04:01.160 --> 04:02.510
FTB client.

04:02.510 --> 04:06.370
Go ahead and submit the Wordpress installation file via aftah be.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.590
But for this tutorial and going to use the C panel's file manager.

04:10.970 --> 04:14.020
Let's go back to the C Bangladesh word.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.900
Head over to your file manager.

04:18.940 --> 04:25.520
I'm going to choose to open the public mail directory and here is the folder where you'll be saving

04:25.550 --> 04:28.490
all of the files from the Wordpress installation.

04:28.580 --> 04:35.210
If this is the first time you access this folder you'll probably see some files like this one here and

04:35.210 --> 04:37.770
you can safely remove these files.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.320
So I'm going to select these files and click this button here.

04:44.050 --> 04:49.910
OK now I'm going to send the word installation file to the server.

04:50.250 --> 04:54.120
You can download this file directly from the Wordpress dot org page.

04:54.140 --> 05:02.280
OK I have already downloaded so I just click here to upload it and in this new screen I'm going to click

05:02.280 --> 05:10.050
on select file I'm going to choose my compressed file and wait for the upload to finish.

05:16.230 --> 05:21.690
OK I can go back here to my father.

05:21.790 --> 05:25.530
I'm going to select this file and click on extract.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.000
OK ready.

05:34.180 --> 05:36.200
Now I can delete this installer

05:40.220 --> 05:44.990
and wordpress installation files are inside his folder called WordPress.

05:44.990 --> 05:49.730
But I don't recommend you to start off the installation through this foliar.

05:49.770 --> 05:59.110
So what I'm going to do when I enter this folder choose all the files click and drag to the public HVM

05:59.160 --> 06:02.670
mail directory.

06:02.860 --> 06:09.990
So the installation of Wordpress will have at its starting point the root directory of the server not

06:10.030 --> 06:11.840
this WordPress folder here.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.100
It is much better this way.

06:14.110 --> 06:15.200
Trust me.

06:15.370 --> 06:19.080
And also I can remove this folder which at the moment is empty

06:23.890 --> 06:29.830
now we have everything ready to make a brand new installation of Wordpress on remote server.

06:30.100 --> 06:34.970
Later on this lesson you'll understand why you're installing WordPress from scratch OK.

06:35.810 --> 06:42.770
Now we can access the Web site address and if everything is ok you'll see the Wordpress installation

06:42.770 --> 06:45.810
page you already know.

06:45.810 --> 06:51.570
This whole process here from the first lesson of the course so I'm going to speed up the recovery a

06:51.570 --> 07:27.950
bit.

07:28.050 --> 07:32.100
We have a new installation of Wordpress and what we're going to do with it.

07:32.670 --> 07:36.030
Let's install a new plug in here called W.P. clone.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.170
So the whole thing will work as follows.

07:39.210 --> 07:45.540
We are going to install this plugin in both WordPress instance we just created and the one we have on

07:45.540 --> 07:52.190
the local server in the local installation will be creating a file and that file will be used to restore

07:52.190 --> 07:56.340
the full size back up on the remote server well.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.740
Let's show you how this will happen in practice.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.550
Let's install the plugin here on the remote server

08:07.540 --> 08:09.140
and this is all for now.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.140
We don't need to do any configuration right away in this plugin.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.960
Let's leave this window for a moment and let's open our local installation of Wordpress

08:35.160 --> 08:41.160
nounless did the same thing they did on the remote server that's installed the WP klong plugging here

08:41.200 --> 08:41.480
to

08:53.450 --> 08:59.880
well now we have the plug installed in both locations on the local installation.

08:59.930 --> 09:07.890
Then you had over to the main page of the plugin clicking here on the BPP clomb.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.460
This is the plug in configuration screen.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.920
But as I told you it works great even without that in any specific settings.

09:16.260 --> 09:22.270
But if you want to know what settings are available you can go ahead and click here in advanced settings.

09:23.150 --> 09:29.550
For now what we're going to do here is to click on this large blue button and create a backup of the

09:29.550 --> 09:31.670
local installation of wordpress.

09:31.920 --> 09:39.390
When we do this the plug in will create a backup file which you can restore later on the remote server.

09:39.450 --> 09:44.060
Let's click here them and wait a while until the process finishes.

09:47.200 --> 09:47.690
OK.

09:47.830 --> 09:50.380
Once the backup is complete you have the screen.

09:50.380 --> 09:55.580
Here we have this link which we could use to restore the backup.

09:55.720 --> 10:02.170
But this link works best when the need to transfer a site that is already online to a local server or

10:02.170 --> 10:03.790
to a new remote server.

10:04.030 --> 10:07.630
But in our case this link will be useless.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.770
However there is a shortcut.

10:10.150 --> 10:17.680
We're going to send this file which is inside the W.P. content folder uploads W.P. clone directly to

10:17.680 --> 10:22.080
the same folder on our remote server to do this.

10:22.090 --> 10:29.720
Let's go back to the see panel file manager and what you see here at the moment is my remote server.

10:29.780 --> 10:40.910
Ok let's head over to W.P. content uploads be a clone let's upload the file that is on the local server

10:41.210 --> 10:44.080
in the same folder on our computer.

10:44.150 --> 10:49.730
I mean all the hard drives

11:06.160 --> 11:08.210
and now we have the same file.

11:08.220 --> 11:11.570
Also on my remote server.

11:11.710 --> 11:15.180
Now let's head over to the mainstream of the clone

11:18.090 --> 11:20.400
Remember I'm still on my remote server.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.190
OK.

11:21.840 --> 11:26.610
And here as you can see we got the file we've just uploaded to the remote server.

11:26.970 --> 11:34.110
If you can see this file here in the list you see this button here that says scan and repopulate the

11:34.110 --> 11:35.520
backup list.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.860
Just click on it and you have this list updated.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.590
You're going to do next.

11:41.630 --> 11:48.800
Let's play this button here and down here another button we appear saying restore backup.

11:49.020 --> 11:52.980
But before clicking this button we have to read this one carefully.

11:53.010 --> 11:58.980
It asks you if you're really sure what's you want to do because the database would be totally overwritten

11:59.070 --> 12:02.760
with the backup information coming from your local server.

12:02.780 --> 12:06.410
Since what we have here is just a name the installation of wordpress.

12:06.410 --> 12:07.590
There is no problem.

12:07.830 --> 12:14.830
Let's then proceed without worrying too much Jack here and click the orange button.

12:15.530 --> 12:16.950
Now we wait for a while

12:21.690 --> 12:24.970
and it's ready on some occasions.

12:24.980 --> 12:28.160
You're likely to see some errors popping up here.

12:28.210 --> 12:35.620
Generally these servers are generated as a result of some limitations of your server or some misconfiguration

12:35.620 --> 12:37.190
on your server itself.

12:37.450 --> 12:44.110
If this is your case you can try contacting your hosting company or try to perform the manual migration

12:44.110 --> 12:45.250
of wordpress.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.770
You can check the extra materials of this lecture.

12:47.920 --> 12:53.560
You see a link with a very good article about how to manually migrate a WordPress website.

12:53.670 --> 12:56.440
But I hope you don't need to read it right.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.000
The link is here on the left side.

12:59.050 --> 13:02.560
Click the blue button and you can have access to it right.

13:03.820 --> 13:09.120
Now just to finish the process the plugin asks you to save the Wordpress permanence again.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.150
Go ahead and click on this link

13:16.970 --> 13:18.880
and here there is no secret.

13:19.070 --> 13:21.610
Just click here and resave this data.

13:24.020 --> 13:30.650
Now we can browse our site and it should be exactly the same as installation they have on the local

13:30.650 --> 13:31.510
server.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.070
Ok nice.

13:37.310 --> 13:42.170
I hope you also managed to migrate your website without any major problems.

13:42.500 --> 13:50.430
That's excellent and I also want to congratulate you for coming so far and I really hope I have contributed

13:50.430 --> 13:53.640
to your knowledge of this interesting too.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.160
So versatile that is WordPress.

13:56.540 --> 14:02.630
Throughout this more than 50 lessons I have been with you teaching a little bit of what I have learned

14:02.660 --> 14:04.290
in recent years.

14:04.310 --> 14:09.920
I tried to make it easier for you to learn something that was very difficult for me to learn at the

14:09.920 --> 14:13.100
beginning and I hope I have achieved that goal.

14:13.130 --> 14:19.400
As you think I've been unable to contribute anything to your career or simply that of course was worth

14:19.400 --> 14:20.090
it.

14:20.090 --> 14:27.080
Please don't forget to leave your review here at Eudemus this you have other students who are interested

14:27.080 --> 14:30.360
in this course to know that is really worth it.

14:30.770 --> 14:38.390
So I remain at your disposal here at either me answering your questions or doubts and I'm also available

14:38.390 --> 14:39.920
on social media.

14:39.950 --> 14:44.320
A big hug to everyone and I'll see you in another opportunity.

14:44.660 --> 14:45.220
Bye.

14:45.290 --> 14:47.320
Take care and peace.
