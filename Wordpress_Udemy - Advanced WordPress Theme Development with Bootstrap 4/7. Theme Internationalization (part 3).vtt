Hello guys you're reaching the end of the internationalization process.

00:06.580 --> 00:09.810
You already have a fully translatable thing at hand.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.940
And in today's lesson we're going to create a file whose purpose is to save as a template for anyone

00:15.940 --> 00:19.410
who wants to translate our theme in any language.

00:19.420 --> 00:24.690
The first thing we need for this lesson is to download an application called Paul added.

00:24.700 --> 00:31.310
Paul added is one of the most used software for internationalization of the most diverse applications.

00:31.330 --> 00:38.560
It's free and it's cross-platform which means you'll be able to use it regardless of the operating system

00:38.560 --> 00:39.820
you have.

00:39.820 --> 00:47.050
So what a show here on my computer which uses the Makower system you also be able to do it in Windows

00:47.200 --> 00:48.500
or Linux.

00:48.520 --> 00:55.540
So as each operating system has its own way of installing applications I'm not show here how to install

00:55.540 --> 00:55.710
it.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.010
OK but if you still don't have the software installed.

00:59.020 --> 01:05.950
Just visit the project page which is on both added dot net and go ahead and download and install the

01:05.950 --> 01:07.130
application.

01:07.660 --> 01:16.510
So let's fire up pu'er did and when he opened it we have this option below translate WordPress theme

01:16.560 --> 01:17.960
or plug in.

01:18.010 --> 01:21.040
But unfortunately this is a premium future.

01:21.280 --> 01:28.580
If you click here you end up realizing that it's a future available only in the Pro version of the application.

01:28.660 --> 01:36.330
Even so you can still go ahead and create our translation files but they need to take some shortcuts.

01:36.340 --> 01:43.690
So follow me from the top menu of I did head over to file new.

01:44.140 --> 01:46.910
Let's choose the language of the translation.

01:47.130 --> 01:48.670
Let's start with English OK.

01:49.780 --> 01:50.560
OK.

01:51.500 --> 01:59.900
Now we need to navigate through file saith And we can save the translation file inside our things.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.180
Language folder.

02:03.440 --> 02:10.850
The software will save your file as an underscore us that file and also generate another file called

02:11.140 --> 02:15.060
an underscore you start M-O.

02:15.120 --> 02:20.990
Let's go to our language folder because we need to remove one of these files and rename the other one.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.090
Well here are the files.

02:26.160 --> 02:30.930
So the file with the Emel extension is not useful for us at the moment.

02:30.930 --> 02:32.800
So I'm going to delete this file.

02:33.870 --> 02:44.400
But the leftover file I'm going to rename it to learn WPA and its extension to that O.T. you can go

02:44.400 --> 02:46.450
ahead and do this without any worries.

02:46.530 --> 02:51.630
Even if you see some warning popping up on the screen since it's just a plain text file.

02:51.810 --> 02:55.230
So don't worry.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.830
Now back to the main software page we see this message here.

02:58.850 --> 03:02.240
It says that there are no translations yet.

03:02.600 --> 03:10.070
Click here in extracts from sources and Paul and it will take you to the catalogue properties window.

03:10.070 --> 03:14.800
Now click on the source path tab and here again the path to our file.

03:14.990 --> 03:19.460
And these two areas can include and exclude more paths.

03:19.470 --> 03:24.900
We click on this first plus sign and now we need to select or things fall.

03:29.660 --> 03:34.660
Pay attention because it's the thing for the UK not the translations folder

03:37.460 --> 03:38.170
OK.

03:39.220 --> 03:46.730
And note here that this little thought is just not finish out we're going to click the next tab.

03:47.430 --> 03:54.630
And the purpose here is just to do according to what we're saying up here use these key words function

03:54.630 --> 04:01.800
names to recognize translatable strings insert files let's include here the two functions we used in

04:01.800 --> 04:03.030
Arfin files.

04:03.420 --> 04:08.400
And we're going to also include three other functions we came across in other template files as we are

04:08.400 --> 04:10.640
including the translation functions.

04:10.710 --> 04:12.380
That was the last lesson.

04:12.510 --> 04:22.830
For example here in search form that BHB we these two other functions ask to X an underscore X those

04:22.830 --> 04:29.370
functions are already in this file because remember this file here have been copied from the 2016 themes

04:29.430 --> 04:30.240
folder.

04:30.420 --> 04:36.900
And what it did was only replace the text domain here from 2016 to learn W.P..

04:37.350 --> 04:41.030
So we need to add them in our list to click the plus sign.

04:42.050 --> 04:48.660
The first function used was the underscore function as added to the list and we did the same thing.

04:48.710 --> 05:00.690
And the other translation function we used.

05:00.850 --> 05:01.980
Now as soon as actually.

05:02.040 --> 05:09.040
OK our beauty file we populate it automatically with all the translation strings that bowhead it can

05:09.040 --> 05:11.220
find inside files.

05:12.110 --> 05:14.040
And look how cool it is.

05:17.220 --> 05:23.850
All the strings that have been wrapped by those translation functions underscore the double underscores

05:24.120 --> 05:30.870
underscore X on the square and the hags and as attribute backs were built here automatically.

05:31.350 --> 05:36.230
We can now have a translation template file ready to be delivered to anyone.

05:36.600 --> 05:42.560
So for example if we have a list of collaborators you a thing you can send them a copy of this file

05:42.780 --> 05:46.470
and they can translate your film into any language.

05:46.470 --> 05:49.780
Finally let's go to the File menu and save our work.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.240
You can go back to the language folder.

05:54.240 --> 05:59.760
And as you can see our files here let's do with the extension.

05:59.750 --> 06:10.300
Let's just rename the file to P.O.D..

06:10.480 --> 06:12.610
And if you open this file in sublime

06:15.840 --> 06:22.770
we see that it's only a translation file but without the translations pull added automatically as the

06:22.770 --> 06:29.880
name of the file or the string was found along with this line number does make translation quite easy

06:29.880 --> 06:35.190
especially when the translator doesn't understand the context of each individual sentence.

06:35.430 --> 06:42.460
Based on this file here anyone can generate the pill and M-O files using poetic itself.

06:42.870 --> 06:49.290
Your task as the developer whenever you come across a theme project that needs to be internationalized

06:49.530 --> 06:52.500
localized for one reason or another.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.370
These are the steps that you need to follow right.

06:55.800 --> 07:01.830
Well I hope you have enjoyed it that you have understood that at least you have acquired a totally new

07:01.860 --> 07:08.520
knowledge with these lessons await you then in the next section which finally will be the last one in

07:08.520 --> 07:11.520
the scores and Jovem by.
