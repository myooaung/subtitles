00:00.690 --> 00:02.920
Hey guys how's it going.

00:02.920 --> 00:05.720
Are you ready to start creating your first years in the world.

00:05.720 --> 00:07.210
Breasting costume either.

00:07.500 --> 00:13.900
I hope so because today you're going to learn a lot of new and cool things great in this lesson.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.190
You'll see that the customized tool is very powerful and versatile.

00:18.290 --> 00:24.660
Use of the my students say that these are the most interesting lessons of the whole course.

00:24.660 --> 00:27.790
So without much delay let's get started.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.320
The first few are going to be building.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.910
Is this copyright area here.

00:33.420 --> 00:38.230
Well you can see that it is a simple text field to tell the truth.

00:38.250 --> 00:41.700
There is no great need to make it a customizable field.

00:41.730 --> 00:48.390
We could simply create it directly in the code or create a very simple text widget so that a user could

00:48.480 --> 00:49.620
edit it.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.490
However I'm going to teach you how to include it.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.660
The thing customized for learning purposes as it is just a text field.

00:57.720 --> 01:03.480
It serves perfectly for you guys to understand how to customize your words in the least traumatic way

01:03.510 --> 01:15.430
possible to begin with as far up our Sublime Text as create a folder called ink and then that's let's

01:15.440 --> 01:22.940
create a new file called customized or that page be you'll be creating all the necessary fields in this

01:22.950 --> 01:24.920
firefight.

01:24.940 --> 01:32.350
However since this file is not automatically loaded along with wordpress when it's required inside the

01:32.350 --> 01:36.970
functions that BGP file that intern is automatically loaded.

01:37.830 --> 01:38.730
To do this.

01:38.870 --> 01:45.410
Open up the functions file and use in a native function called required.

01:45.600 --> 01:55.700
Let's include our newly created file so we acquire now to get the path to the same directory we use

01:55.820 --> 02:07.810
get template directory and concatenated with the file path.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.590
Remember you add this forward slash in OK.

02:10.800 --> 02:16.920
Otherwise the file will not be found OK ready to save.

02:17.130 --> 02:22.260
Now in customized BHB Let's start creating something first.

02:22.420 --> 02:24.950
Open the tag.

02:25.430 --> 02:29.900
We don't need to decode tag that's create a function.

02:30.770 --> 02:34.200
The name of this function may be wherever name you want.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.760
In my case I'll call this function.

02:36.770 --> 02:45.910
Learn w the underscore customize for the name is not so important but it's very important that you pass

02:45.910 --> 02:54.600
a parameter to it and this parameter is a variable called the Customize that simple well.

02:54.620 --> 02:58.630
Let's recall some basic details that are mentioned in the last list.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.620
The customize it is made up of sections and inside each section.

03:03.770 --> 03:06.550
We have one or more controls right.

03:06.590 --> 03:12.660
There are also something called Pennino and inside each panel we can have several sections.

03:12.980 --> 03:19.010
But are we not to use any example that uses panels because they made the code very complex.

03:19.010 --> 03:23.910
Let's just stick with sections which can have different controls.

03:24.140 --> 03:27.950
So let's create in this order a first section.

03:27.980 --> 03:34.820
Let's make a comment here indicating that this section will be for corporate information.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.250
Pay close attention to the structure that I'm going to explain to you now.

03:39.310 --> 03:46.090
At first glance it looks very complicated and it can confuse you a lot with when you create it once

03:46.360 --> 03:52.510
it can be copied and pasted so you can create the other sections and then your other controls etc..

03:53.400 --> 03:58.920
The first thing you're going to do is call a variable name the way you the customer is.

03:58.920 --> 04:05.460
In fact technically speaking this variable is an object of the W.P. customize manager class that is

04:05.460 --> 04:10.160
responsible for handling the execution and control of the customized itself.

04:10.500 --> 04:17.650
Let's add a small aero D-minus and the greater than sign and we're going to pass here a function called

04:17.980 --> 04:19.980
add underscore section.

04:20.320 --> 04:27.250
Again technically speaking to be more precise this class object here is calling the class method name

04:27.410 --> 04:29.770
and section you'll see.

04:29.770 --> 04:36.180
Still in this lesson and each time you'll be calling a different method when you are building sections.

04:36.200 --> 04:43.280
Use add underscore section but for controls you're going to use add up the score control and so on.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.570
Okay now inside that section you're going to pass information.

04:48.830 --> 04:57.410
First a name or an ID for that section and then an array argument first section Id always use a name

04:57.410 --> 05:03.780
that starts with SAQ underscore something you see in this lesson that this will help a lot.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.900
Not to get lost within the code.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.310
So I recommend that you do the same.

05:08.690 --> 05:16.040
Now you finish out the create an array with a few arguments as best you argument.

05:16.330 --> 05:21.690
The first one is going to be tied to let's dive here.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.370
Copyright

05:25.240 --> 05:27.760
and the second argument is going to be description

05:33.480 --> 05:39.180
the value of the title argument will be inside the clickable object of the section when you click on

05:39.180 --> 05:40.060
this object.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.940
You see the controls that it has inside.

05:44.030 --> 05:49.460
Now comes a detail that I didn't explain in the last lesson because it wouldn't make much sense then

05:49.790 --> 05:51.700
but now it makes more sense.

05:52.620 --> 05:58.830
Between the suction and the controls we have the so-called settings that are responsible for storing

05:58.830 --> 06:04.890
the data entered by the user in each control sending that data directly to the database.

06:05.010 --> 06:10.400
Without these settings is not possible to persist any data into the database.

06:10.580 --> 06:15.950
A curiosity where press saves all the data inside W.P. options table.

06:16.140 --> 06:21.480
So if you need to check out how this customized data is stored into the database just take a look at

06:21.480 --> 06:22.560
this table.

06:22.650 --> 06:26.420
Basically the setting structure is very similar to a section.

06:26.540 --> 06:30.940
We start with the object.

06:31.180 --> 06:39.030
Now instead of calling add section we call another Mathilde's name and setting.

06:39.170 --> 06:41.210
Here we also pass two parameters.

06:41.400 --> 06:48.180
The first one is the name of the Saddy and the second is an array of arguments for the name of the setting.

06:48.180 --> 06:55.320
I generally use something like set underscore something.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.910
Now Isadore passed the following arguments.

07:00.540 --> 07:02.020
First is type.

07:02.210 --> 07:06.350
This argument applies to the type of field that will be stored in the database.

07:06.360 --> 07:14.940
You can have two types of foods option and theme modifications are simply theme underscore mode to better

07:14.940 --> 07:17.630
understand the difference between one and the other.

07:17.850 --> 07:20.630
Let's see what the word preselect limitation tells us.

07:21.950 --> 07:29.480
So here the documentation states that there are two primary types of sand's options and theme modifications

07:29.990 --> 07:36.440
options are stored directly into the options table of the Wordpress database and apply it to the site

07:36.650 --> 07:45.050
regardless of the active theme themes should rarely if ever add settings of the option type themed mods.

07:45.140 --> 07:48.920
On the other hand are specific to a particular film.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.790
So for the first argument let's set the value as the model.

07:52.790 --> 07:53.520
OK.

07:57.510 --> 08:03.150
The second argument is the default value of the theme we we're saving.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.370
For example let's step in here.

08:05.610 --> 08:11.990
Copyright x All rights reserved.

08:13.640 --> 08:18.090
And the last one is sanitize Colback.

08:18.240 --> 08:24.590
Unfortunately I look a lot but I haven't found good documentation explaining all the values that can

08:24.590 --> 08:27.060
be used in this field at this point.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.760
WordPress documentation is too poor at least until the recording of this lesson.

08:31.760 --> 08:37.520
It is because it doesn't say nothing about this argument sanitized Colbeck.

08:37.580 --> 08:44.300
What I found out is that in this field we can specify the name of some field sanitization function used

08:44.300 --> 08:49.550
by Wordpress or some that are sanitized and function that you can create yourself.

08:49.580 --> 08:55.630
This is important because everything the user types for any control will be sent to the database.

08:55.760 --> 09:03.380
And before that happens the data should be sanitized or in other words they must be cleaned out the

09:03.380 --> 09:07.040
name of the function will depend on the type of field we intend to create.

09:07.040 --> 09:14.420
For example for text fields it may be sufficient to pass a function called ESC attribute or only ask

09:14.690 --> 09:17.150
underscore a TTR.

09:17.430 --> 09:23.360
This function filters and cleans the data passed through a text textfield removing special or invalid

09:23.360 --> 09:26.250
characters for numeric fields.

09:26.390 --> 09:34.640
I generally use the Absynth function but as I said there is little documentation on this so I'm not

09:34.640 --> 09:38.100
sure if these are the correct functions she use.

09:38.480 --> 09:43.290
As soon as I have more information on this I will certainly keep you updated.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.030
But let's continue.

09:45.470 --> 09:52.100
You already have a section created and also our setting but the control itself is missing.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.740
Just pick things up.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.130
Copy the structure here.

09:58.130 --> 10:06.390
I'm going to rename the methods to add control and the name of the control is going to the city R L

10:06.750 --> 10:13.230
and the score coprolite I want to remove this arguments because they will be different.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.430
Let's get straight to the arguments then.

10:15.760 --> 10:20.350
The first one is label and applies to the name that appears before the field

10:23.640 --> 10:25.560
then description.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.740
Now let's treat deserve a little more attention.

10:34.710 --> 10:41.370
Section here we have to specify the name of the section to which this control is connected to and the

10:41.370 --> 10:44.430
name is SEC on the score copyright

10:47.000 --> 10:53.780
settings here inform the name of the setting that would save the value back to this control.

10:53.780 --> 10:56.860
In our case it is set on the score.

10:56.910 --> 11:05.110
Copyright notice why I identified the name of the section and citing the specifics as it helps me very

11:05.110 --> 11:07.440
much not to get lost in the code.

11:08.970 --> 11:15.750
And now the last argument type this is the kind of control or feuds you're building.

11:16.020 --> 11:19.680
In our case it's going to be a text type field.

11:19.690 --> 11:27.990
It could also be textarea checkbox select radio etc.

11:30.730 --> 11:32.950
and now to finish all this file for today.

11:33.130 --> 11:36.640
We're going to add an action to this function we just created.

11:37.030 --> 11:46.950
So an action and this function needs to be triggered on a hook called customize the score register.

11:47.140 --> 11:51.250
And here in the second parameter indicate the name of our function.

11:51.370 --> 11:54.090
Learn the WP customize for

11:58.830 --> 11:59.740
OK let's safe

12:02.990 --> 12:05.810
and we can already see if everything's working.

12:06.410 --> 12:07.990
Let's go to the customize for

12:11.790 --> 12:12.080
you.

12:12.100 --> 12:19.420
We have the section that we just created and then that the field be created with its default value.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.310
Well I set another value to this field.

12:29.060 --> 12:36.510
And safe at this point that every entered has been already stored in the W.P. options table.

12:36.510 --> 12:41.750
So with every change you made in the field the data will be updated in the database.

12:41.790 --> 12:47.670
There is only one way to fast this value from the database and show it on the screen as open up.

12:47.670 --> 12:53.630
Or for that page file then let's delete this text here.

12:54.150 --> 12:56.710
And to call it The field is very easy.

12:56.740 --> 13:04.500
That's used to get theme maade function and pass inside it the name of the setting that stores the value

13:04.590 --> 13:05.740
of the field.

13:06.240 --> 13:13.950
In our case the setting is called Set underscore cooperated in order for the saved value to be displayed

13:13.950 --> 13:14.870
on the screen.

13:14.940 --> 13:23.030
The awning that you actually read out I saved this and see if it's working.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.620
First let's check the thing

13:33.350 --> 13:34.210
Excellent.

13:35.930 --> 13:41.280
Now let's reopen the thing because the miser and let's make some changes.

13:48.060 --> 13:56.300
Look how interesting the viewing area is refreshing and the field value changes according to what A-type.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.640
Very cool.

13:57.640 --> 14:02.710
We have our first few working in customizing What a breakthrough.

14:03.270 --> 14:05.390
But I still have a good way to go.

14:05.650 --> 14:08.360
We still have our logo for example and the map.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.360
Yes the map.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.770
You see what we still got for the map.

14:12.940 --> 14:16.790
So that's all for now and see you then in the next license.
