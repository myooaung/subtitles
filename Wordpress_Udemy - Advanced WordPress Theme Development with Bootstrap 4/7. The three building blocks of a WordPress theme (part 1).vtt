00:00.720 --> 00:07.380
Hello Guys welcome to one more lesson in this lesson we are going to talk about the three basic building

00:07.380 --> 00:09.660
blocks of a WordPress scene.

00:09.900 --> 00:18.560
You'll see that we need only three blocks to beautifying a header or dynamic content area and a future.

00:19.020 --> 00:24.540
This dynamic area at first to be represented by adding the X Dadds page file.

00:24.750 --> 00:30.330
But as you remember this fire is used as a default theme template.

00:30.330 --> 00:35.990
We also have different template files used for static pages for the human etc..

00:36.330 --> 00:39.620
But let's focus first on the next large beach file.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.650
First let's open up our layout.

00:47.400 --> 00:54.690
You may notice that it contains this region here region that is going to be the same for all pages which

00:54.690 --> 00:59.710
goes from this red bar to the end of the menu.

01:00.060 --> 01:06.010
It also has a dynamic content region that goes from the slide to that map.

01:06.780 --> 01:13.780
And then there was a footer that is going to be displayed on every page of the theme as well is that

01:14.160 --> 01:19.170
region at the beginning will be entirely created on the index that should file.

01:19.350 --> 01:25.020
But when we open a post we'll make arrangements for words press you use a different thing play file.

01:25.020 --> 01:29.930
But first things first and the last lesson we created the that file.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.810
But it was created in a rather elementary way.

01:32.820 --> 01:36.480
It has only one paragraph and a title tag on it.

01:36.960 --> 01:42.930
But if you can remember from another lesson I told you that a home page is very different from a contact

01:42.930 --> 01:47.190
page in about a space services page and so on.

01:47.520 --> 01:51.920
That's why we're going to make this layout more dynamic in order for this to work.

01:51.930 --> 01:56.040
Let's split this layout into three parts to begin with.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.810
Let's create our basic HMO structure.

01:58.920 --> 02:03.220
It should be all based on the layout we are seeing here.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.430
So let's head over to Sublime Text

02:09.230 --> 02:11.310
open up index that Peachtree.

02:11.780 --> 02:15.500
And I'm going to leave this paragraph here just as a reference for us.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.130
OK.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.320
Well let's start off with a board tag.

02:19.760 --> 02:25.850
Fortunately WordPress gives us a very useful function that can be used inside the body tag.

02:25.850 --> 02:30.380
It helps us identify which base we are working on within the theme.

02:30.540 --> 02:39.760
We can use this artifice to better style our theme this function is called Body underscore class and

02:39.760 --> 02:43.770
it basically returns to classes related to the page we are vene.

02:43.780 --> 02:50.090
For example when you visit the home page it brings the home class inside the body tag.

02:50.110 --> 02:54.660
Hence we can style a page that has the home class in a different way.

02:54.850 --> 02:58.540
But of course you understand is better as we move along the course.

02:58.540 --> 02:59.070
OK.

02:59.310 --> 03:02.440
You see this in detail for now.

03:02.470 --> 03:09.250
Let's start by creating the HMO structure of the site's header and inside the header according to our

03:09.250 --> 03:09.890
layout.

03:10.030 --> 03:12.600
We have a red bar at the top.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.230
First we create a header tag

03:17.150 --> 03:26.260
and inside a tag we want to create a section that you have the top hyphen Bar class inside the stop

03:26.260 --> 03:26.960
bar.

03:26.990 --> 03:28.790
We have two other areas.

03:28.790 --> 03:33.230
The first one on the left side reserved for these social media icons

03:38.250 --> 03:40.730
and another one on the right side.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.050
It should be named search.

03:44.070 --> 03:45.640
Do see what I'm doing here.

03:45.930 --> 03:51.720
So explain to translate that red bar on the layout into HVM mail.

03:51.750 --> 03:59.190
I just call that top bar on the HMO structure and inside it I created this structure for these two other

03:59.190 --> 04:07.710
areas on the left side and therefore those social media icons and on the right side a search area as

04:07.710 --> 04:12.640
you can see you're creating for now only the basic markup of the theme.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.680
Will be only this to start with.

04:15.810 --> 04:17.460
Now to continue on.

04:17.460 --> 04:23.000
Let's go ahead and create the menu area still within the header area.

04:23.310 --> 04:34.780
Let's call it Menu hyphen area and within this menu we have another section that's called Logo Because

04:35.020 --> 04:37.210
we be placing our logo there.

04:38.860 --> 04:47.290
Now we want a knapsack and it's classful will be called Main hyphen menu and you're being served in

04:47.320 --> 04:56.440
our first menu there and that's all for this whole area you're creating you repeat on every single page.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.570
OK.

04:58.570 --> 05:04.090
So let's go ahead and create our dynamic area now let's call it content hyphen area

05:08.060 --> 05:11.610
inside this area you have many other areas.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.720
According to the lay out we all have here.

05:14.780 --> 05:20.800
Our main area which will stay inside our main seg inside is Mentec.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.580
You have a section for the slide

05:27.680 --> 05:31.220
and below the slide you have a red bar for these services

05:34.540 --> 05:36.570
and after services.

05:36.740 --> 05:40.890
We have a central area let's call it middle Haven area.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.400
Inside is Nido area.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.200
We have a sidebar and a News area.

05:47.550 --> 05:57.360
Then in the mail the side by side in a side stack and you have the class of sidebar.

05:57.560 --> 06:06.480
And after that you have a new day tag called news and you have one less section for a map a stipend

06:06.560 --> 06:11.840
here section class.

06:12.470 --> 06:16.500
Now both the main area and a dynamic area are complete.

06:16.540 --> 06:20.660
Now we can create a footer which finally closes the website.

06:21.020 --> 06:24.100
So let's use the foot or tag to mark this region.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.060
OK.

06:26.070 --> 06:29.620
We have now indexed that page file finally ready.

06:30.060 --> 06:37.050
But again I must tell you that if we only have indexed that page file created that way our theme will

06:37.050 --> 06:38.910
be pretty simple.

06:38.910 --> 06:40.880
So that's the difference.

06:41.130 --> 06:46.340
Ok my idea is to break this index that piece B file into three blocks.

06:46.410 --> 06:50.320
The first one will contain an area that will be always dynamic.

06:50.520 --> 06:56.940
That is its content will change depending on the page visited for example on a home page.

06:56.940 --> 07:00.890
This area will look identical to the image you're seeing now.

07:01.080 --> 07:11.360
However on a news page it on display this slide is service area the map and other areas too.

07:11.520 --> 07:19.890
On the other hand the other two areas from here up and from the footer down always repeat for every

07:19.890 --> 07:24.860
single page and this will be our three Duling blocks.

07:25.140 --> 07:31.760
But we're going to stop here for now because in the next lesson we're going to continue with the explanation

07:31.770 --> 07:39.810
showing you how we can split this blocks into three different files one for a header one for the dynamic

07:39.810 --> 07:42.640
part and a third for the full hour.

07:42.800 --> 07:49.710
Also in the next lesson you'll be downloading a pure H.M.S. theme and will try to turn it into a WordPress

07:49.720 --> 07:53.370
film using the knowledge we are getting from these lessons.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.680
And it's going to be very cool.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.730
So until then NSU in the next lesson by.
