00:00.640 --> 00:07.690
Hello guys in this lesson you're going to talk about a very powerful future of Wordpress called themes

00:07.690 --> 00:09.520
support.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.470
So what a theme support as well.

00:12.490 --> 00:17.530
Let's first take a look at the film we all see that visually.

00:17.530 --> 00:19.750
It's still quite simple.

00:19.750 --> 00:28.420
We have no logo no header etc. film support is a WordPress function that allows us to customize many

00:28.420 --> 00:30.340
aspects of our scene.

00:30.340 --> 00:37.090
In fact it comes in handy for those who want to allow the client or the user of the scene to make specific

00:37.090 --> 00:38.500
changes to the theme.

00:38.560 --> 00:45.370
Even though your client or yours user don't have any programming knowledge I start by going over to

00:45.370 --> 00:47.260
the dashboard.

00:47.440 --> 00:53.640
If we head over to the appearance menu we can see only a few basic options here.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.800
Ever since install WordPress you can see the same options.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.220
So we have nothing new here.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.390
At the end of today's lesson we all have a couple of new options here.

01:04.420 --> 01:07.640
They will allow us to make some customizations.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.020
The theme to the dashboard to begin with.

01:11.020 --> 01:13.610
Let's open up our functions file.

01:14.020 --> 01:20.110
The first thing you're going to do is create a new function that function has nothing to do with thema

01:20.150 --> 01:25.780
support necessarily but it will help us organize the code a bit more.

01:25.810 --> 01:27.350
Let's call this function.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.910
Learn W. B underscore config.

01:32.410 --> 01:40.060
And here we will be concentrating all the code that has any relation with the theme configuration itself.

01:40.060 --> 01:47.190
So for example I'm going to move all the code related to the menus and pasted within this new function.

01:56.860 --> 02:04.330
Let's call it new add action and say that this new function which triggers on a hook code after set

02:04.330 --> 02:05.170
up seen

02:09.870 --> 02:13.480
this time you going to pass the last parameter to this function.

02:13.510 --> 02:20.400
This parameter handles the priority of execution for this function which will be zero.

02:20.530 --> 02:27.620
In this way everything you create here in this function will be executed whenever the after set up thing.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.060
Who is a variable.

02:29.290 --> 02:35.290
I have already explained to you the dynamics of this mechanism in previous lessons so I'm not going

02:35.290 --> 02:36.280
to explain that again.

02:36.280 --> 02:45.730
Right OK now that we have everything place we can start talking about the thing support Well the ADD

02:45.960 --> 02:48.480
support function is quite versatile.

02:48.690 --> 02:55.700
If we visit the Wordpress codecs you'll see that it allows you to add things support various features.

02:56.580 --> 03:09.560
We can't enable post formats post thumbnails custom background custom header and many other features.

03:09.620 --> 03:15.930
All of these features are not enabled by default in wordpress but can greatly enrich our theme.

03:16.070 --> 03:21.380
When you add them are going to start by adding theme support your custom headers.

03:21.590 --> 03:27.440
They will be very useful to us as they will help us make this thing in their pages a little bit more

03:27.440 --> 03:30.520
different and with a more attractive look.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.400
So let's get started.

03:32.660 --> 03:36.220
Let's just add a new line inside the function we just created.

03:37.050 --> 03:45.800
So and seeing support and inside princes we want to pass that type of thing support.

03:45.830 --> 03:55.360
You want to add in this case to be custom hyphen Hetter Most futures can also contain additional arguments

03:55.840 --> 03:57.450
in the case of custom headers.

03:57.520 --> 04:02.460
We can pass arguments such as a height and width for the hair image.

04:02.470 --> 04:10.570
We can do this by creating an array of arguments miscalled args and past the following arguments.

04:11.560 --> 04:24.130
Height 225 and with 19:20 with the array created we can pass it as a second parameter to this ad theme's

04:24.130 --> 04:26.380
support function.

04:26.430 --> 04:31.960
Notice that height and width are just two of the many arguments we can pass to this function.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.200
You can see all of them in the codex.

04:34.200 --> 04:34.740
OK.

04:34.910 --> 04:38.710
And the link is available as an additional resource for this lecture.

04:38.750 --> 04:48.990
Go ahead and say that and now head over to the admin area refresh the page and we now see that under

04:49.030 --> 04:54.530
appearance it's got a new option which is this one here header.

04:54.900 --> 04:55.910
Let's click here.

04:58.590 --> 05:05.150
And the screen that you open is a very interesting feature of Wordpress called the theme customize or

05:05.550 --> 05:12.000
if you have already customize the theme in wordpress possibly you are aware that this tool exists.

05:12.140 --> 05:16.230
We all learn how to create more advanced controls that this chore.

05:16.470 --> 05:23.460
At the end of our course for now you'll notice that this option here allows us to customize the theme

05:23.480 --> 05:24.400
header.

05:24.480 --> 05:32.360
This option is also available because we have just enabled support for header images in our theme.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.530
So here we have some instructions.

05:35.730 --> 05:45.240
We say that our theme recommends a header size of 1920 by 225 pixels precisely the values that we passed

05:45.240 --> 05:46.780
to our function remember.

05:47.160 --> 05:56.880
Let's go ahead and click here to add a new image upload any large image in this case.

05:56.920 --> 06:08.340
Our image is at least 1920 pixels wide as we want the uploaded image with a high of at most 225 because

06:08.700 --> 06:12.810
we see the screen here that asks us to crop the image first.

06:12.810 --> 06:16.640
So let's do that and click on this blue button.

06:17.070 --> 06:20.980
Let's repeat process and choose three more images.

06:33.830 --> 06:35.850
A quick tip for you guys.

06:35.900 --> 06:42.360
One thing we can do to make our head or image more dynamic is to randomized them.

06:42.360 --> 06:49.630
For this we just click on this button here and now we can save and publish our changes.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.810
Good but it's not over yet.

06:52.920 --> 07:01.290
If we visit the home page and refresh the page we want to see our head image anywhere and why that because

07:01.320 --> 07:06.070
we still need to tell WordPress where we want to have an image to appear.

07:06.270 --> 07:13.830
Well the first question we have to answer is to which pages in our theme or which page types we want

07:13.830 --> 07:15.550
to add an image header.

07:15.810 --> 07:22.770
Ok let's assume we want a header in all pages that use the general template which for now the About

07:22.770 --> 07:30.150
Us page and the contact page and on all pages that use the default template as well.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.180
So the home page will not have a header.

07:33.210 --> 07:36.420
There are two files that we need to change.

07:36.420 --> 07:46.860
General template that HP and index dot HP that is the only template file that will be left out is page

07:46.860 --> 07:49.030
home dot ph p.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.000
So let's start with index that page be filed.

07:52.380 --> 08:00.900
Let's open it and the header will be placed right here between the cathead a function call and our first

08:00.900 --> 08:02.280
div deck.

08:02.340 --> 08:13.200
Visually it will be positioned here where you see this red line go back to subline text once you get

08:13.200 --> 08:17.140
ahead I'm going to paste here a code snippet for the header image.

08:17.130 --> 08:24.180
Call this code can be found on the Codex page whose link is also available as an additional resource

08:24.240 --> 08:27.230
for this lecture space here.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.640
So the explanation can get a little faster.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.930
So what does this code mean.

08:32.940 --> 08:40.800
First we have an HMO image tag the image source is returned by a function called hetter image.

08:40.830 --> 08:48.520
It will bring to us the full path for our image since our image is random with each page load.

08:48.570 --> 08:55.800
That source will be changed dynamically to add a height and width for the header image.

08:55.800 --> 09:03.450
We use the echo command to print out the hive and with properties of the image in the stack the function

09:03.480 --> 09:05.730
that returns these values to us.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.780
Is this one here called get custom header.

09:09.780 --> 09:15.930
Now when you save this file you can check if the block page is can unload the header image.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.950
So let's go over to our browser refresh the page

09:23.240 --> 09:24.350
and look at this.

09:24.350 --> 09:31.520
Now we have a header image as this image is random possibly when you refresh the page again we will

09:31.520 --> 09:33.960
have a new image.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.940
And here it is another Hetter image.

09:37.430 --> 09:42.450
But notice however that image is too large for the page.

09:42.620 --> 09:46.010
It is generating a horizontal scrollbar.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.030
That's pretty bad.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.440
So let's fix that.

09:50.250 --> 09:56.390
Let's add another bootstrap class called I m g hyphen fluid.

09:56.570 --> 10:02.040
It will make the image in question become responsive which I've been here.

10:02.090 --> 10:06.610
Class ECOs.

10:06.710 --> 10:12.180
And she has been through it save and refresh the page

10:16.400 --> 10:17.500
OK ready.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.900
Now we don't have that horrible scroll bar down here.

10:21.930 --> 10:23.390
Cool isn't it.

10:23.590 --> 10:31.210
Now that we know what to do let's repeat the process for the pages that use the general template and

10:31.230 --> 10:33.020
sculpt this image tag here.

10:34.030 --> 10:41.820
Open up the general templates but PSP file and paste the code there are you in the same location below

10:41.820 --> 10:43.820
the square header.

10:44.130 --> 10:47.900
File.

10:47.950 --> 10:49.290
Now click on this link.

10:51.430 --> 10:53.250
And here we are.

10:53.380 --> 10:56.290
They also have a responsive header here.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.550
Same thing for the contact page.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.590
Very good.

11:00.610 --> 11:08.320
Finally Arfin is getting more professional and attractive don't you think so in the next lesson we will

11:08.320 --> 11:12.490
continue to support and work with thumbnails.

11:12.490 --> 11:13.480
See you then.
