00:00.860 --> 00:02.170
Hey what's up.

00:02.180 --> 00:07.580
Today we're gonna start learning how to create our first menu in WordPress.

00:07.580 --> 00:14.430
At the end of the next two lessons you have a horizontal menu similar to this one in the layout.

00:14.460 --> 00:15.170
Ready.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.430
So let's get started.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.270
Well so far we have no menu created.

00:20.580 --> 00:28.080
So if we head over to the dashboard appearance menu you'll notice that we don't have any way to create

00:28.080 --> 00:35.430
a menu yet in order to manage our own menus you'll have to do something in the functions that PDB file.

00:35.580 --> 00:42.360
This file will help us register our menus so that we can use them in our theme before creating a menu.

00:42.360 --> 00:48.570
Let's create some static pages within WordPress as this is the first time we will be curating a page

00:48.600 --> 00:50.130
or a post in the course.

00:50.130 --> 00:52.920
Let me just clarify one thing.

00:52.980 --> 01:00.160
This course has been created with Wordpress Version 4 currently WordPress is already in Version 5 between

01:00.160 --> 01:03.300
the last updates of Version 4 and Version 5.

01:03.300 --> 01:07.410
A new editor emerged in WordPress called Gutenberg.

01:07.410 --> 01:09.550
It's a new content creation experience.

01:09.580 --> 01:12.300
Little like that of a page builder.

01:12.300 --> 01:16.120
However the existence of a new editor changes very little.

01:16.120 --> 01:22.650
The way you create themes in WordPress that is everything I teach you here in this course remains 100

01:22.650 --> 01:23.470
percent valid.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.390
Okay.

01:24.630 --> 01:30.030
The only thing you notice is that my page and post editing screens are a little different.

01:30.150 --> 01:37.150
If you've never worked with Wordpress prior to version 5 you'll notice that my editor is a little different.

01:37.210 --> 01:40.100
It is called the classic editor.

01:40.110 --> 01:45.970
All the tools I use inside the old editor the classic editor also exist in the new editor.

01:45.990 --> 01:46.690
Okay.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.920
Might just have a little more work to find them.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.970
If you have any difficulties.

01:50.970 --> 01:54.380
You can contact me and I will be glad to help you out.

01:54.510 --> 02:00.710
But from what I've noticed so far very few students are having trouble finding the tools.

02:00.750 --> 02:06.400
Just a warning for those who didn't like the new editor at the moment I am recording this video.

02:06.410 --> 02:14.590
Wordpress is announcing that it will support the classic editor on June 20 22 or as long as it's necessary.

02:14.670 --> 02:18.510
So you'd better get used to using the new editor.

02:18.510 --> 02:24.390
The Gutenberg editor at the end of this course you see that I have prepared seven lessons about a new

02:24.390 --> 02:25.220
editor.

02:25.290 --> 02:28.890
There are also explain how to get your feet ready to work with it.

02:29.490 --> 02:31.650
So I think you'll love it.

02:31.650 --> 02:34.640
But for now let's get on with the lesson.

02:34.710 --> 02:44.070
Let's head over two pages at new let's create some pages then the first one is gonna be the home page

02:44.490 --> 02:45.370
for all the pages.

02:45.390 --> 02:49.180
I'm gonna just write a minimal description.

02:49.330 --> 02:54.680
So this is the home page.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.050
Now the blog page

02:59.270 --> 03:00.080
about is

03:02.760 --> 03:07.930
contact.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.400
Now we can start registering our menu.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.160
But what do I mean by registering a menu.

03:14.160 --> 03:20.300
Well it means nothing more than logically creating it within wordpress so we can use it later.

03:20.340 --> 03:28.350
The first thing we're going to do is use a wordpress function called register nav menus like every function

03:28.350 --> 03:34.800
call it has dispenses that opens and closes and the same call at the end.

03:34.820 --> 03:42.480
This function allows us to define an array which in a simpler definition is only a list of elements.

03:42.860 --> 03:49.100
Library going to use an array because we can register more than one menu at a time.

03:49.110 --> 03:52.260
This is even an exercise you can do yourself.

03:52.290 --> 03:55.730
Do you remember that we have two menus in our layout.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.450
One at the top of the page and another one at the bottom.

03:59.520 --> 04:05.820
So I'm going to register one of these menus in this lesson and your exercise will be registered as second

04:05.820 --> 04:06.150
menu.

04:06.150 --> 04:06.670
Okay.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.100
Why do you think about this exercise.

04:09.240 --> 04:15.780
The first element inside this array is gonna be the menu slug that is to say a short name for it.

04:15.840 --> 04:23.850
I'm gonna create this log called my other score main on the score menu.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.680
Don't forget you write this value with lowercase letters and no spaces.

04:28.680 --> 04:35.790
You can use dashes and underscores as I did myself the value of this element of the array will be the

04:35.790 --> 04:41.290
name that will show within the admin area that is a more friendly name.

04:41.610 --> 04:44.890
In our case it will be main menu.

04:45.090 --> 04:49.050
Don't worry because soon you will understand where this value was shown.

04:49.050 --> 04:49.340
Okay.

04:50.220 --> 04:50.490
Okay.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.290
Now an important information.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.850
If I add a comma here I can register a second menu.

04:56.850 --> 05:02.460
In fact I can register multiple menus within the single function.

05:02.460 --> 05:09.930
I can add a new slug and a new value each menu corresponds to what WordPress calls a position.

05:10.050 --> 05:16.050
So I would have a second registered menu position here but I will not do that now.

05:16.110 --> 05:19.430
This will be a little exercise for you guys.

05:19.530 --> 05:22.780
So I'll go ahead and delete this for now.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.440
And now when I save this file and get back to the dashboard reload and page if I hover over to the appearance

05:31.440 --> 05:39.920
menu you see that I mean use option is now available when I click on menus we get to the menu admin

05:39.950 --> 05:45.980
area of WordPress WordPress creates automatically a menu called menu one.

05:46.010 --> 05:52.270
I can stay with this menu or I can create a new one by clicking on this link above.

05:52.520 --> 05:57.740
Let's go ahead and click on this link I want you give a name for this menu.

05:57.850 --> 06:02.220
And um the name of it is gonna be top menu.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.510
It could also be main menu.

06:04.510 --> 06:14.700
Anyway I'm going to click on Create menu by the time the menus graded two options which show below automatically

06:14.790 --> 06:18.430
add new top level pages to this menu.

06:18.510 --> 06:26.250
I'm gonna leave this option checked and this means that the moment I create a new static page it will

06:26.430 --> 06:29.400
automatically be added to my menu.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.890
I'll show this in practice in the next lesson right.

06:32.490 --> 06:39.370
And the checkbox below display location is to indicate a menu position in the menu.

06:39.390 --> 06:46.470
Remember that we added two text strings to the menu menu registered in our functions file the first

06:46.470 --> 06:54.180
one was this large menu a key and the second string was a description for the menu its corresponding

06:54.180 --> 06:55.060
value.

06:55.200 --> 07:01.710
The text that we have here corresponds to that second string that is to say the menu description.

07:01.800 --> 07:02.730
In our case.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.590
Main menu.

07:04.590 --> 07:10.590
If I chose this option I'll be telling WordPress that the menu I'm creating right now will be relative

07:10.650 --> 07:14.280
to the main menu that I've registered in the function's file.

07:15.340 --> 07:19.640
So I'll go ahead and click on Save menu.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.880
So is it over.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.570
No.

07:23.080 --> 07:30.430
Is not ready yet because we don't have the menu items that you see on the left side that I can choose

07:30.430 --> 07:34.150
to add some items to my recently created menu.

07:34.150 --> 07:42.460
I have a list of pages post custom links categories etc. here on pages I have those pages I created

07:42.490 --> 07:49.240
earlier in the lesson to remember them so I am going to add all these pages to my menu to do this.

07:49.240 --> 07:53.380
I just select one by one and click on this add to menu button

07:59.450 --> 08:02.210
I can also reorder the items if I want.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.910
Now I need to save the menu.

08:05.910 --> 08:09.910
Once again and now the menu is ready.

08:10.080 --> 08:17.100
Well it's ready at least in the admin area because this is not enough to have our menu displayed on

08:17.100 --> 08:17.670
the front end.

08:17.670 --> 08:20.590
Yeah let's visit the home page.

08:21.670 --> 08:28.090
Refresh the page and you can see that we don't have any menu here yet.

08:28.180 --> 08:30.720
Only this word menu and nothing else.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.520
So what more do we need.

08:33.520 --> 08:40.780
Well we need to indicate in the header that PDB file that the menu created in the admin and registered

08:40.780 --> 08:47.650
in functions file will be position it in this specific place here but that will be a subject for the

08:47.650 --> 08:48.590
next lesson.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.050
So see you later.
