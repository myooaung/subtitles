Hey what's up guys.

00:03.520 --> 00:04.980
Welcome to this lesson.

00:05.350 --> 00:08.820
Well I'll start by saying this is an optional lecture.

00:08.820 --> 00:13.990
It's purpose is to teach you how to install a local server on your computer.

00:13.990 --> 00:18.420
So if you already know what a local server is you're ready work with that.

00:18.490 --> 00:23.240
If you already know how to install one you can skip this lesson with no problems.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.860
Firstly why do you need a local server.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.170
A lot of people ask me this question.

00:29.590 --> 00:35.500
Well the common practice in the web development world is that you have separate environments for production

00:35.590 --> 00:41.980
and development the production environment will be where the work will be public which in the case of

00:41.980 --> 00:48.850
web development would be a hosting service for example whatever the scenario is I think it's always

00:48.850 --> 00:53.320
better to develop our solutions locally and only after it's ready.

00:53.380 --> 00:59.880
Send everything out to a production server where your application will be available to everyone.

00:59.890 --> 01:06.730
There are some reasons for this such as saving hosting bandwidth avoiding unnecessary use of server

01:06.730 --> 01:09.430
memory resources etc..

01:09.460 --> 01:12.430
If you don't have to worry about it it's OK.

01:12.430 --> 01:19.330
Another reason is that it's better to fail in a development environment than in a production environment.

01:19.330 --> 01:24.030
Imagine if you install a plug in or make an application that breaks your Web site.

01:24.220 --> 01:30.460
If you do this on the production server it's done you'll have to make up lost ground and as soon as

01:30.460 --> 01:31.290
possible.

01:31.540 --> 01:38.570
But if this happens on a local server you have time to analyze any kind of error that may have occurred.

01:38.620 --> 01:41.780
So that's what we're going to do in this course.

01:41.830 --> 01:48.940
Initially install our local server than WordPress on top of it and at the end of the course of teach

01:48.940 --> 01:53.890
you how to send the whole project to a remote web server of your choice.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.600
So let's get started.

01:56.510 --> 01:59.530
There are several choices for installing a local server.

01:59.720 --> 02:06.350
Basically you need not only the server which in our case would be Apache but you also need some applications

02:06.350 --> 02:10.970
to manage your database and the language library itself.

02:11.090 --> 02:17.280
So more advanced users install all of these features separately but there's no need for that.

02:17.570 --> 02:25.370
As we can install a package that can manage the Apache server in my secret database and HP in this lesson

02:25.610 --> 02:28.860
you'll be using one of these packages called ZAHM.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.580
Some people also pronounce it exempt.

02:32.000 --> 02:39.650
So let's head over to the Zahm Web site which is at the w w w dot Apache friends got all R.G.

02:44.450 --> 02:50.990
and here on the home page we see this information saying that Zahm is the most popular HP development

02:50.990 --> 02:53.930
environment that we can easily install.

02:53.930 --> 03:00.780
The Apache server with Mario D-B which is equivalent to my sequel and HP itself.

03:01.070 --> 03:03.470
This is exactly what we need.

03:03.470 --> 03:07.710
One of the advantages of Zap is that it is multi-platform.

03:07.730 --> 03:11.560
I mean you can stall it on any operating system.

03:11.900 --> 03:18.920
As I am using a Mac I am going to download the Mac version but if you use Windows for example you see

03:18.920 --> 03:21.950
that the steps for installing are not that different.

03:22.120 --> 03:28.270
The way in my opinion the configuration of the Zahm environment in Windows is even easier.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.560
Let's go ahead.

03:30.020 --> 03:34.340
For this lesson I'm not going to download the default VM installer.

03:34.440 --> 03:41.030
I don't know why but the VM virtual machine version is not working on my computer so I just download

03:41.120 --> 03:42.880
the regular installer.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.640
I'm going to click here and choose another version.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.770
Now scroll down to see all options from Mac.

03:50.020 --> 03:55.970
If you use another class you could also choose another version here on this page.

03:55.970 --> 04:03.190
I can choose between the PSP versions when you use Beach B-7 I can use one of these options here.

04:03.280 --> 04:08.270
In my case I'm not going to download the file again as I have done this previously.

04:08.310 --> 04:14.790
Am going to access my downloads folder Doubleclick the installation file

04:19.990 --> 04:21.890
Doubleclick the application I can

04:25.140 --> 04:28.780
and click on open enter my password

04:31.790 --> 04:34.410
and I'll just Brissy the installation process.

04:38.500 --> 04:49.440
Next next next I can uncheck this checkbox here next next.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.400
And now the installation begins.

04:58.190 --> 05:05.150
Now from here I can already launch their application or open it later if I want you going uncheck this

05:05.150 --> 05:11.000
option here and click on finish now I can go ahead and fire symp

05:16.940 --> 05:18.620
enter my password again.

05:22.760 --> 05:29.130
And here I have the application main screen here I can choose to start and stop all the servers.

05:29.340 --> 05:37.800
For example the Apache web server or the Mystikal database server I can even start all at once by clicking

05:37.800 --> 05:38.730
on this button.

05:40.060 --> 05:46.780
And here it can also configure the Apache server or my sequel but this will be useful if you have a

05:46.780 --> 05:53.690
problem or if you want to do some more advanced configuration by the way in the next lesson which is

05:53.760 --> 05:58.090
not to go lecture you'll learn how to make one of these settings.

05:58.090 --> 06:04.690
For now we have a fully functional development environment to check if everything is really working.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.100
I start all of the servers here at once.

06:08.110 --> 06:10.010
Go ahead and click this button.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.140
Start all

06:14.130 --> 06:15.990
and let's go back to your browser.

06:17.180 --> 06:21.900
And type in here localhost is Lesch dashboards.

06:24.750 --> 06:28.990
If you can't see the screen it means that installation is working.

06:29.100 --> 06:35.170
If you're not seeing that first Jack if the Apache server has started it has to be green.

06:35.370 --> 06:42.590
And with the running status you can also check if there is an error message under the application log.

06:42.930 --> 06:48.660
If there are any errors you'll see them here and you can have an idea of what is happening.

06:50.130 --> 06:52.180
OK you access the database manager.

06:52.260 --> 06:58.270
Just go to look at host forward slash BHB my admin

07:01.770 --> 07:03.510
and you see the screen here.

07:03.750 --> 07:09.090
This is VERY be creating your database to install WordPress For example OK.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.910
One more information before we leave for the next lesson.

07:12.100 --> 07:18.810
All the projects we create on our local server by default will have to be created inside the Zahm 80

07:18.820 --> 07:21.110
Docs folder to find it.

07:21.160 --> 07:29.960
You can open your file manager applications Zahm 80 docs in Windows.

07:29.960 --> 07:35.740
This directory is in C Zahm 80 dogs for a project.

07:35.740 --> 07:43.100
For example we be creating a folder called W.P. later on all your other projects can also be created

07:43.100 --> 07:45.580
here with different names of course.

07:46.700 --> 07:53.450
In other words you access your project you just type in the browser the word localhost followed by the

07:53.450 --> 07:55.050
name of the created directory.

07:55.070 --> 07:57.850
For example localhost forward slash.

07:57.860 --> 07:59.990
That would be great.

07:59.990 --> 08:06.950
But you understand that better in practice in the next lessons I hope you find this lesson useful and

08:06.950 --> 08:08.900
see you in the next lesson.

08:08.940 --> 08:09.520
Until then.
