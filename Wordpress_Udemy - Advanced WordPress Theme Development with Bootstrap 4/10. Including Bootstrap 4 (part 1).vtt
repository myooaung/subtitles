00:00.480 --> 00:06.420
Hello guys and they'll come to one more lesson in the last lesson we started hearing our stuff shit

00:06.510 --> 00:11.760
using the WB and Khusrau function inside the functions that BHB file.

00:11.910 --> 00:14.170
In this lesson you're going to learn how to read.

00:14.180 --> 00:18.430
Q Are scripts as I want this lesson to be very effective.

00:18.510 --> 00:23.750
Let's learn how to think you both the style sheet and the bootstrap javascript file.

00:24.860 --> 00:28.880
I think most of you already know what bootstrap is don't you.

00:29.180 --> 00:35.840
But for those who have never heard of it bootstrapped as its name suggests is a kind of library that

00:35.840 --> 00:42.870
makes the creation of responsive sites very easy as this course is not specific about bootstrap.

00:42.950 --> 00:44.920
I will not teach details about it.

00:45.050 --> 00:51.490
Despite this fact you end up knowing a lot about how this works as you move along to lessons.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.890
You see that it's nothing out of this world.

00:54.710 --> 00:55.160
OK.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.960
In other Jeanne-Claude bootstrap we can use that same function we created in the previous lesson that

01:00.960 --> 01:04.090
the code load underscores quips.

01:04.140 --> 01:11.550
You need to include a CSSA file which is required and at least one javascript file that it's optional

01:11.850 --> 01:19.290
and is used to include some bootstrap plugins like model boxes dropdown menus carousels two types and

01:19.290 --> 01:20.560
many other things.

01:20.910 --> 01:26.970
Although it's optional for learning purposes we're going to teach how to include the javascript file

01:27.060 --> 01:28.540
in this lesson too.

01:28.940 --> 01:30.510
Well you are half way there.

01:30.510 --> 01:37.380
Since we already know how to include stylesheet now which include the javascript file within WordPress

01:37.590 --> 01:38.900
that is the question.

01:39.030 --> 01:40.070
But that's easy.

01:40.080 --> 01:44.350
We are going to use a function much like the one we used in the last lesson.

01:44.430 --> 01:45.950
WP style.

01:45.990 --> 01:51.940
This time it will be called WP and the score in enqueue and the score script.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.640
Now this function has its own set of arguments.

01:54.660 --> 01:56.350
Let's go ahead and meet them.

01:56.430 --> 01:58.530
The first parameter is the handle.

01:58.530 --> 02:02.370
Let's call this Hindu bootstrap hyphen J.

02:02.370 --> 02:08.790
S. And the second parameter is also the path on which the file can be found.

02:08.850 --> 02:15.150
But unlike the example we used in the last lessoned related to a file that was inside a folder of our

02:15.210 --> 02:22.830
own thing this time we can just IPN a link for the bootstrap javascript file to get this link Reagen

02:22.880 --> 02:29.940
a visit the official bootstrap page and W W W does get bootstrap that come

02:35.790 --> 02:44.400
let's click on getting started and here under QuickStart we have all the links we need for including

02:44.480 --> 02:45.400
bootstrap.

02:45.510 --> 02:51.510
The first one we are going to copy is the link for the javascript file as copy this link here.

02:51.510 --> 02:57.660
Third one and paste inside single quotation marks into our code

03:01.310 --> 03:01.650
again.

03:01.670 --> 03:08.930
The third parameter is called dependency and pay close attention to this bit of code because here we

03:08.930 --> 03:10.530
must type something out.

03:10.580 --> 03:12.510
It cannot be empty.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.430
And here's a quick explanation.

03:14.450 --> 03:17.430
Bootstrap depends on J-curve to work.

03:17.450 --> 03:19.410
That is it doesn't work.

03:19.580 --> 03:23.240
If Joe equerry hasn't been loaded before it this way.

03:23.270 --> 03:27.200
It depends on J query to indicate this.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.410
Let's just IPN J.A.G. inside an array.

03:31.210 --> 03:36.380
This instance of J Querrey that we are indicating comes from the Wordpress library itself.

03:36.610 --> 03:40.160
Thus there is no need to write another line in queue.

03:40.210 --> 03:44.320
And Jake varify WordPress has already done that for us.

03:44.410 --> 03:46.660
You just need to call it here.

03:46.720 --> 03:52.320
The first parameter is for the version that can type in the version of bootstrap here.

03:52.330 --> 03:59.930
In our case as you are seen here the version will be 4 point 0 point or the first version in Bootstrap

03:59.970 --> 04:04.020
for now the last parameter is very important.

04:04.020 --> 04:10.080
It points out if you want to answered our javascript file within the foot tag before the closing of

04:10.080 --> 04:13.770
the body tag or inside the Elkhead head tag.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.300
What does it for.

04:15.540 --> 04:18.440
Let's take another very practical example.

04:18.540 --> 04:25.100
Everyone once in a lifetime needed to include the Google Analytics script on the site right.

04:25.140 --> 04:31.550
Google always recommends that you include that script before the mail closing had tag.

04:31.860 --> 04:37.350
But if you want we can use this less parameter and easily include scripts like Google Analytics.

04:37.350 --> 04:39.430
Not before the close and hash tag.

04:39.540 --> 04:46.700
But at the bottom of the page to do that the value of this parameter will be set to true.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.510
Notice that by default its value is false.

04:51.630 --> 04:54.290
WhatsApp will also be included on the footer.

04:54.390 --> 04:57.410
So let's type in true here.

04:57.990 --> 05:02.990
You can also include the bootstrap style sheet to make this process easier.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.520
I'm going to copy the example we created in the last lesson and replaced the values were needed.

05:08.690 --> 05:13.000
I am going to change the handle calling it bootstrap hyphens.

05:13.020 --> 05:16.220
SS.

05:16.320 --> 05:21.710
I'm going to copy this SS file link from the bootstrap site which is this one here.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.680
There is no dependency this time.

05:28.680 --> 05:36.310
The version is also for point 0.00 and this file also refers to all media types.

05:36.810 --> 05:37.670
OK ready.

05:37.860 --> 05:44.700
Now these new files will being cute together with our last license file.

05:44.700 --> 05:48.150
We cannot check if our files are actually incudes.

05:48.560 --> 05:55.460
I check the source code of our site and search for bootstrap and look.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.600
We found this SS file.

05:58.180 --> 06:01.020
Let's do a search now for the javascript file.

06:03.230 --> 06:08.380
But how strange how come the javascript file is missing.

06:08.480 --> 06:13.520
Well do you remember the WP had function we used in the last lesson.

06:13.520 --> 06:20.690
There is a counterpart of it that we can include in the footer that speech be file and its name is W.P.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.150
underscore footer.

06:23.330 --> 06:33.840
It's open up the footer that should be file and add this function before the body and in tag.

06:33.840 --> 06:39.780
Now look for the javascript file once again you see that it's being loaded at the end of the file as

06:39.780 --> 06:46.810
we want it to be well that's all for this lesson and I hope you like it and the next lesson will be

06:46.810 --> 06:51.600
testing out our first bootstrap classes so don't miss it.

06:51.730 --> 06:53.410
And then by.
