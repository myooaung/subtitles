Hello students.

00:02.650 --> 00:08.930
I'm back and in today's lesson we're going to move to a little more advanced approach to integrate her

00:08.930 --> 00:10.470
theme and Gutenberg.

00:10.490 --> 00:12.570
So stay tuned.

00:12.590 --> 00:16.130
So far we already know how to basically use the tool.

00:16.280 --> 00:22.190
We know how to add support to some advanced futures but there is still something missing.

00:22.190 --> 00:29.360
Well don't you agree with me that it would be perfect if everything was seen Gutenberg is exactly the

00:29.360 --> 00:31.360
same God in the front.

00:31.580 --> 00:34.830
Or at least it's both Gutenberg and the front end.

00:34.910 --> 00:41.300
Had a look which would be as close as possible for example I see that the fonts used here in Gutenberg

00:41.660 --> 00:42.760
are not the same phones.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.050
My theme is using.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.680
Is that possible.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.060
Yes it is.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.960
In fact that's one of the goals of Gutenberg.

00:49.970 --> 00:55.880
The idea is that theme developers can also if they wish of course style each block.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.430
And also Gutenberg's all an addict in the area.

00:58.430 --> 01:04.970
So that's what we see here can be as close as possible to the themes thrown in but that's optional according

01:04.970 --> 01:06.990
to the world press documentation.

01:07.070 --> 01:09.760
Film creators can if they wish.

01:09.920 --> 01:16.790
Use blogs as they are without any additional style overriding the default styles could bring a really

01:16.790 --> 01:19.250
cool experience to the end user.

01:19.250 --> 01:26.360
But of course this can also mean more things to be done and considered by the developer taken as an

01:26.360 --> 01:31.270
example the atomic blocks thing that I mentioned earlier in one of our lessons.

01:31.460 --> 01:37.220
They only needed to use your sex files with a few lines each to modify Gutenberg.

01:37.220 --> 01:41.980
In a way that it would look like the expected result in front end.

01:41.990 --> 01:46.630
The purpose of this lesson is not to do the same thing here in our thing.

01:46.730 --> 01:48.950
I'll just show you the best way.

01:48.950 --> 01:55.790
And from then on if you think you want that in our project you already know where to go.

01:55.790 --> 01:56.790
Okay.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.090
So let's get started.

01:59.120 --> 02:06.780
The first thing we need to do is to create a separate style sheet that you says file will be used only

02:06.930 --> 02:09.040
in the WordPress admin area.

02:09.090 --> 02:15.420
So here inside this CSX folder we're going to create a file called style hyphen editor.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.560
That's USS

02:21.360 --> 02:22.010
now logical.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.250
This file is really really very simple.

02:25.290 --> 02:29.220
First we add one more support called Ed styles

02:35.620 --> 02:39.970
this theme support is required for most actions you need to perform in the backend.

02:39.970 --> 02:43.420
Now we just need to call a function named add editor style

02:47.940 --> 02:51.990
and we're going to pass the name of this success file we've just created.

02:51.990 --> 02:58.460
Don't forget to add the name of the folder USS.

02:58.690 --> 03:03.330
Now we can write all this assets that we control the appearance of the editor.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.140
Let's try to make it similar to the front end and we start by defining three things First the size of

03:11.140 --> 03:19.200
the container where the text part of our post is which is this area here then the size for the blocks

03:19.230 --> 03:21.210
that have wide alignment.

03:21.240 --> 03:27.180
And finally the size for the blocks that have full alignment to define this strip thinks we don't need

03:27.180 --> 03:34.970
much work Gutenberg documentation has all the code we need we just go there and copy what we want write

03:36.150 --> 03:38.640
and of course I'll make this link available to you.

03:38.770 --> 03:39.090
Okay

03:45.860 --> 03:52.130
the first section with the selector WP block is used to define the total size for each of the Gutenberg

03:52.130 --> 03:52.970
blocks.

03:53.030 --> 03:59.570
You can set the values you want here in pixels I think is this valuable lead of for example 800 pixels

04:01.250 --> 04:07.640
the next line so for you to define the size of the blocks or the wide and full with right here for the

04:07.640 --> 04:13.940
white blocks you can set the value you want to test that out and see what value can give you the best

04:13.940 --> 04:15.680
results in my thing.

04:15.680 --> 04:21.200
Ten eighty was a great pixel value and we may already see some minor changes

04:29.930 --> 04:36.350
here for example you see them that the size of the container is eight hundred pixels and it's very come

04:36.350 --> 04:45.920
in from the file that we created and let's change this category to wide and if you expect it you can

04:45.920 --> 04:49.730
also see that the size is 10 80 pixels.

04:49.730 --> 04:52.820
You can do your test type in the values directory here

04:58.780 --> 05:04.070
and look at the results in front end and to get what we want.

05:04.090 --> 05:11.920
Another thing we can do is make the phones look also closer to what we got in front end at this moment

05:12.310 --> 05:18.160
the fonts used here in the ed. screen is totally different from what they get in front end.

05:18.220 --> 05:25.150
To change that um you have to know what funds are used in the front end and apply the same phones to

05:25.150 --> 05:27.560
the right elements in Gutenberg.

05:27.610 --> 05:30.480
That of course would depend on your theme.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.550
I'm going to give an example how I did on my theme.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.000
So you understand what to do.

05:35.040 --> 05:43.350
OK first these are the two phones I used in my theme lotto four paragraphs and also for the heading

05:43.350 --> 05:49.100
tax first let's see what classes will have to change in Gutenberg.

05:49.170 --> 05:50.700
Just speed things up.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.950
I'm gonna paste here some success again.

05:54.890 --> 06:03.260
These are the classes and rules that we need up here I'm targeting the whole Ed area with special attention

06:03.260 --> 06:08.890
for the paragraphs as I've already added support for the editor of styles in the theme.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.100
I can only read this piece here if I want.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.000
Okay.

06:12.020 --> 06:18.260
In fact I'm gonna get rid of it because WordPress append the selector automatically in the backend for

06:18.350 --> 06:22.210
all of the elements classes and ideas that I want to add to the file.

06:22.900 --> 06:30.440
And I'm saying that the font is going to be lateral with these margin values is the same role I have

06:30.440 --> 06:31.990
in the front end style sheet.

06:32.060 --> 06:36.560
The template that she has file with the addition of these margins.

06:36.890 --> 06:42.110
And this one down here is the SAS has that controls the post title.

06:42.110 --> 06:46.860
Look how interesting even the post title can be modified within the editor.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.950
And this one uses a different font type.

06:49.430 --> 06:49.730
Great.

06:49.730 --> 06:51.560
Now if we reload Gutenberg

06:56.420 --> 07:04.750
wonderful our text is already very similar to the one in the front in it brings back the two elements

07:05.020 --> 07:10.620
you see that they already styled according to the admin assess file using the two phones and margins.

07:10.630 --> 07:18.970
We defined and here you can see the class Ed styles wrapper which has been automatically appended very

07:18.970 --> 07:20.070
correct.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.400
So that's the idea.

07:21.400 --> 07:29.140
Folks basically will inspect Gutenberg you find the element or block you want your style and other rule

07:29.140 --> 07:36.220
here that target that element in the backend to assess your aim is to tweak the backend and to get as

07:36.220 --> 07:38.620
close to the front end as possible.

07:38.860 --> 07:42.010
You just need to remember that it's optional right.

07:42.010 --> 07:46.750
If you don't want to implement this for example for your client site you don't really need.

07:47.290 --> 07:53.620
However if you want to make your film available for download I recommend it to do at least the Baz exchanges

07:53.620 --> 07:54.770
start here.

07:54.940 --> 08:01.490
Some market places such as seeing enviros theme forest require you to ensure that all WordPress core

08:01.500 --> 08:06.050
blocks are styled to match the design of the theme or demos.

08:06.070 --> 08:12.300
Another requirement is that Web phones are also in cute while in my tests I didn't need to include my

08:12.300 --> 08:15.360
two Google phones Latino and O's vote.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.920
In order for them to display in Gutenberg.

08:17.920 --> 08:25.090
Maybe that was due to the browser cache to really ensure that they will indeed display go back to functions

08:25.090 --> 08:40.380
that BJP let's create a new function.

08:40.380 --> 08:46.890
The point here is that this function needs to be fired on a special hook called NQ block editor assets

08:56.600 --> 09:00.680
and here we are going to interview the two fonts in a very simplified way.

09:01.790 --> 09:14.070
Call WP NQ style we best font handle for example Lando font and then the path to the Starship file which

09:14.070 --> 09:16.930
we already have here in the successful.

09:17.060 --> 09:18.820
Let me just copy these here

09:23.390 --> 09:25.620
and now we did the same thing for the Oswald font

09:34.760 --> 09:40.000
a hand you can add Google fonts using functions as well.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.210
Most premium things do that.

09:42.590 --> 09:46.540
I'll leave you of course the link with a great tutorial in this lesson too.

09:46.550 --> 09:53.830
If you want to delve into it one more interesting thing you can do is to add a support called WP block

09:53.880 --> 09:54.840
styles.

09:55.060 --> 10:00.990
What it does is it can makes the appearance of the block of the native blocks you have here in Gutenberg.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.710
Looks the same and when you see them in the front end it's only valid for the WordPress native blocks

10:07.720 --> 10:08.820
okay.

10:08.890 --> 10:10.840
For example let's add a quote here

10:19.210 --> 10:21.830
so as you can see you have these formatting here.

10:22.390 --> 10:23.960
But if you take a look at the front end

10:29.630 --> 10:32.000
you'll see that it's quite different.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.640
But now if you add that support let's do it.

10:46.580 --> 10:47.840
Now reloading the page

10:52.810 --> 10:59.170
now you see that the block here looks quite the same as the one we haven't Gutenberg once more.

10:59.170 --> 11:02.970
This is only valid for the WordPress native blocks okay.

11:03.010 --> 11:08.620
Another hint I can give you is that to take a look carefully here at this official documentation because

11:08.620 --> 11:16.660
they are always adding new things new features new resources and you as a developer will learn a lot

11:16.660 --> 11:20.290
from that well in the next lesson.

11:20.290 --> 11:23.650
You close the series with some final considerations.

11:23.650 --> 11:27.490
I'll show you some interesting features that I have not talked about yet.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.320
So until next time.
