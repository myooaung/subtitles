00:00.830 --> 00:07.480
Hello Guys this is a very special lesson in which you're going to talk about a very important issue.

00:07.520 --> 00:11.950
Search Engine Optimization also known by the acronym S.E.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.730
OK first of all this course is not about you.

00:16.940 --> 00:23.000
So the idea behind this lesson is not to bring you tips about how to rank your site on Google but the

00:23.000 --> 00:27.920
way this course doesn't teach you only to create a simple website.

00:28.040 --> 00:34.300
The main goal is to teach you how to create WordPress themes that is more than a website.

00:34.430 --> 00:40.670
Over time you understand that although it seems the same thing creating WordPress seems it's a much

00:40.670 --> 00:43.520
more comprehensive subject.

00:43.610 --> 00:50.330
I am saying all this simply because I believe that the real response of Jamaican decides rank in search

00:50.330 --> 00:53.870
engines like Google is the site owner.

00:53.870 --> 01:00.630
It is the content that he or she generates to the site that you make it more visible to search engines.

01:00.770 --> 01:05.490
However that doesn't change the fact that your theme has to lend a helping hand.

01:05.720 --> 01:12.260
So you as a WordPress developer must be aware of the fact that your thing at least can offer a couple

01:12.260 --> 01:18.950
of good practices which in the end will help anyone who uses your theme or if you don't help at least

01:18.950 --> 01:21.060
do nothing to get in the way.

01:21.110 --> 01:28.720
That said let's see what our theme can do to help anyone who uses rank better on search engines.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.640
I start off with a header that page befoul.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.790
In fact most of our test will focus on this file.

01:35.810 --> 01:41.170
We also need to inspect the source code to check if our changes are working.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.090
Let's get started.

01:43.460 --> 01:51.210
So go ahead and open the header that page beefalo as you can see you're still including some fixed values

01:51.270 --> 01:53.240
in the HMO code.

01:53.310 --> 02:00.450
For example the character encoding as well as the language attribute of fixed values but these values

02:00.480 --> 02:02.880
cannot be fixed in line.

02:03.120 --> 02:08.250
Let's imagine your theme will be downloaded by someone in China for sure.

02:08.340 --> 02:12.060
This person's WordPress installation will not be in English.

02:12.060 --> 02:18.340
Therefore these two values have to be added according to the data provided by WordPress itself.

02:18.570 --> 02:24.670
Fortunately we can solve this easily using two functions for the language attribute.

02:24.710 --> 02:26.340
Let's remove this here.

02:28.560 --> 02:35.900
And call that language attributes function so whenever the installation language changes your theme

02:35.900 --> 02:38.250
will change the value dynamically.

02:39.070 --> 02:40.360
Let's see if it works.

02:40.640 --> 02:47.460
As open our theme and check the source code.

02:47.540 --> 02:57.140
Notice here that the current language is you as English as go to the dashboard go to settings general

02:58.200 --> 03:08.010
and they're going to change here to sign language to Brazilian Portuguese.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.170
Now looking at the source code again

03:13.280 --> 03:16.440
see here that the language has now changed.

03:16.460 --> 03:26.280
Now it's Brisley in Portuguese as go back to English.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.670
Now for the character encoding Let's use a fairly versatile function called plug ins.

03:33.170 --> 03:41.180
Previously when people butes WordPress themes they used this function like info so many things but nowadays

03:41.330 --> 03:43.520
its usage is quite limited.

03:44.450 --> 03:52.160
Let's exclude disvalue here and cold blogging so and passed with a parameter called char set.

03:53.280 --> 03:53.830
And that it

03:56.540 --> 04:02.360
basically things won't change in the source code but at least we are assured that everything's more

04:02.360 --> 04:03.400
dynamic now.

04:05.250 --> 04:12.090
Now one very important point since we're press version for point one several more attacks are no longer

04:12.090 --> 04:17.400
used directly in the head portion of the text that is no longer used.

04:17.400 --> 04:21.750
Here is title really title.

04:22.110 --> 04:26.200
So here in our AGM I'll have to just remove that.

04:28.110 --> 04:32.550
But then you must be thinking this guy's totally crazy.

04:32.550 --> 04:39.080
The title tag is one of the most important if not the most important of all for the correcting of a

04:39.110 --> 04:41.130
site by search engines.

04:41.430 --> 04:49.110
Well let me explain then or else you think I'm kind of crazy since version 4.1 WordPress recommends

04:49.110 --> 04:56.060
that this tag is included not in the head portion but through the functions that page file using themes

04:56.070 --> 04:56.820
support.

04:56.940 --> 04:57.330
Yes.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.040
Think support.

04:59.040 --> 05:04.800
So let's open up the functions file and include one more thing support the whole thing is very simple

05:05.250 --> 05:09.530
let's just pass this type of task parameter and we're good to go.

05:09.570 --> 05:18.030
So as theme support I don't take that when we look at the updated source code of the thing.

05:19.890 --> 05:21.980
Magically have the title tag.

05:22.410 --> 05:26.850
And of course the value override according to the page you visited.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.110
OK.

05:28.200 --> 05:33.220
And as for the automated tags like description auser keywords.

05:33.600 --> 05:39.450
Well we're not going to include this other meditation or think you understand why we have to visit the

05:39.480 --> 05:42.650
Wordpress Codex.

05:42.890 --> 05:49.330
So we are here in the codex here on this page whose link I will make available to you of course the

05:49.340 --> 05:55.700
Wordpress team explains that over the years many of this metal tags no longer makes sense.

05:55.700 --> 06:02.400
Like for example the keywords matter tag which Google no longer uses because many people abused it.

06:03.230 --> 06:08.280
Down here they have a phrase that I think is great you explain this.

06:08.420 --> 06:14.340
They say without a doubt content is the biggest contributor to search engine page ranking.

06:14.630 --> 06:22.380
So if you want to raise your rankings make sure you have quality content OK but if you still want to

06:22.380 --> 06:28.650
use some of the smartest acts like description for example well on the same page the Wordpress guys

06:28.710 --> 06:30.610
explain how to do it.

06:30.900 --> 06:34.280
So just go ahead and follow their instructions.

06:34.320 --> 06:40.110
I'm not going to include any other matter attack here because even the native WordPress themes no longer

06:40.110 --> 06:41.930
use this method tags.

06:42.150 --> 06:45.180
If you think I'm crazy again you can see by yourself

06:48.610 --> 06:50.750
see no more mass attacks here.

06:50.830 --> 07:00.970
Strangely as it may seem ok as I said earlier discourse is not about SEO so I just went over here to

07:00.970 --> 07:05.990
talk about some good practice for you play when viewed in your themes.

07:06.070 --> 07:11.490
By doing this you already have a good way to help those who will certainly use or see.

07:11.920 --> 07:18.280
So I hope you like the tips and I hope also that if you'd like to learn something new and I would catch

07:18.280 --> 07:22.720
you guys on my next video actually on their new section.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.240
So until then.
