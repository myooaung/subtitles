00:01.840 --> 00:04.150
Hi there how's it going.

00:04.150 --> 00:08.830
Continuing our lesson on the TGM plugging activation in this lesson.

00:08.920 --> 00:14.230
You're going to finish out the library configuration and learn how to request the installation of plugins

00:14.500 --> 00:16.490
that we are using in our theme.

00:16.710 --> 00:24.070
So continuing where we left off let's go back to the required plugins that PSP file and clean up the

00:24.070 --> 00:25.720
File a bit.

00:25.720 --> 00:31.720
Let's get rid of this bunch of comments and other snippets of code that don't interest.

00:31.780 --> 00:34.600
At the moment but if you take a close look.

00:34.630 --> 00:37.790
In fact this whole code is very interesting.

00:38.020 --> 00:46.120
The amount of code here also shows that there are several usage scenarios for the TGM that if you focus

00:46.660 --> 00:53.500
on explaining everything here we will never reach our goal so let's just stick with the essential if

00:53.500 --> 00:53.970
you wish.

00:54.010 --> 00:57.700
You can go ahead and download the file and study it more carefully.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.650
OK.

00:58.810 --> 01:05.590
What interests us here is inside this function that ends with Register required plugins.

01:05.870 --> 01:14.510
Given this variable called plugins we have this main array and other arrays inside this main one.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.420
This version of the library brings five arrays.

01:17.630 --> 01:20.180
Each one of them is for a given user age.

01:20.360 --> 01:25.000
They have a usage example for when you have plugins bundled with a theme.

01:25.040 --> 01:32.390
I mean when we want to include the plug in files Viniar thing and many other examples we're going to

01:32.390 --> 01:38.760
use this for example here because we want to include a plug in from the Wordpress plugin repository.

01:38.870 --> 01:44.870
So here we're going to point out which plugins will be marked as required after the user downloads and

01:44.870 --> 01:47.110
activates Arfin.

01:47.160 --> 01:54.490
So here it includes a use A-check example we have here an example in your film uses the pre-press plugin

01:55.020 --> 02:00.240
and having this an example you can go ahead and create our own examples for us.

02:00.390 --> 02:02.790
Let's remove all the usage examples.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.300
We don't need too much code here.

02:05.370 --> 02:06.940
We don't need all of this here.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.290
Why do we need to specify just three things.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.560
The first one is the name of the plugin then it's luck.

02:16.600 --> 02:22.320
And finally if the installation of the plug in we will be required are not after our theme is activated

02:22.890 --> 02:29.320
if this last value is set to false the plug in will appear only as recommended not required.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.870
So let's start off with our social media plugin.

02:33.340 --> 02:40.020
Well the first complicated question to answer is how do I find out this lack of planning.

02:40.120 --> 02:47.050
In fact that's very easy to set this field head over to the dashboard.

02:47.170 --> 02:55.630
Click on plugins install plugins as find or social media playing.

02:55.720 --> 03:02.510
Click on details and here in this window have the link to the plugin page in wordpress.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.170
Or she

03:06.100 --> 03:06.630
OK.

03:06.830 --> 03:13.560
Now all you have to do is copy the last section of the Eurail which corresponds to dislike of the plugin.

03:13.580 --> 03:28.790
So with that done I start setting up our fields name so show icons widget Slyke and as they seem that

03:28.850 --> 03:30.170
we are viewed in here.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.900
Can't work without this plugin.

03:32.060 --> 03:40.050
I'm going to make it requires now to include the next plugin and I copy this entire array and we're

03:40.050 --> 03:49.410
going to repeat the process the next one will be this slider plugging Let's go to the plugins page close

03:49.410 --> 03:52.770
this I'm going to click on View details

03:56.770 --> 03:57.940
copy the page link

04:02.810 --> 04:09.260
and name Moto press slider Slagg

04:13.100 --> 04:15.270
and this one will also be required.

04:16.680 --> 04:23.500
The next one will be a contact form seven plug in I'm going to leave the plug in.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.960
Already sat here.

04:25.740 --> 04:27.780
And I'll go ahead and get this plug.

04:38.560 --> 04:38.890
OK.

04:38.890 --> 04:39.640
Ready.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.440
And now let's plug in the responsive menu.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.310
I'm going to just repeat the same process OK.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.310
And there it is.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.050
Let's save this file.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.830
And very good you go.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.170
We just have to test it now.

05:05.350 --> 05:09.560
But we're going to do that only in the next lesson so.

05:09.730 --> 05:10.310
See that.
