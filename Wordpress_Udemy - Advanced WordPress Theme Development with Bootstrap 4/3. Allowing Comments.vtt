Hello everyone.

00:02.290 --> 00:03.600
Welcome back.

00:03.690 --> 00:09.760
In the last lesson we learn how to create a different view for each unique post of our field.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.990
In today's lesson we go a little further by enabling a comment form for these pages.

00:16.120 --> 00:22.630
First let's open up one of her posts for editing.

00:22.700 --> 00:28.580
I'm going to show you something that goes unnoticed for most WordPress users here at the top.

00:28.600 --> 00:36.350
I have this little drop down menu screen options which most people don't even know about in this menu.

00:36.350 --> 00:40.110
You'll notice that there is a series of checkboxes.

00:40.130 --> 00:45.880
Each one of them allows us to enable or disable some editing area here of the page.

00:45.890 --> 00:48.610
In fact we call these areas metal boxes.

00:48.890 --> 00:53.250
So every check box here lets you hide our show and letterbox.

00:53.390 --> 00:57.400
One of these metal boxes is called discussion.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.720
I'll show you here on the page.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.730
It's this one here.

01:03.730 --> 01:08.470
It allows us to define where the comments will be open or not for a specific post.

01:08.470 --> 01:13.290
If you click here we end up disabling comments for this particular post.

01:13.290 --> 01:21.780
Let's check this and say we don't want comments for this post so no visitor can comment on this post.

01:21.790 --> 01:25.420
Ok same thing works for pages.

01:25.480 --> 01:30.800
They may or may not allow comments for any pages within WordPress.

01:30.820 --> 01:35.960
Well this explanation is important in order to understand the code that you'll be using should call

01:36.070 --> 01:42.560
the comments form within the post and thus allow our visitors to interact with our content.

01:42.610 --> 01:45.210
So let's open up our Singo that page befoul

01:48.330 --> 01:52.570
and here before the loop is finished let's perform a check.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.190
Let's create a nice block.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.610
Let's close it out here.

01:56.820 --> 02:01.230
With an end if so we will not have any problems in the future.

02:01.680 --> 02:07.320
And here inside the parenthesis we want to check if comments are open for the post which is the one

02:07.320 --> 02:10.470
that is being displayed at the moment by the Word Press loop.

02:14.030 --> 02:19.900
Let's also call another function that lets us know how many comments we have for this post.

02:23.720 --> 02:29.000
Ok if comments open we're going to call the comments form.

02:29.040 --> 02:36.500
At this point we do this by calling the comments template function well.

02:36.580 --> 02:37.500
What this function.

02:37.510 --> 02:42.220
Basically this is Rander a standard comment form on the screen.

02:42.400 --> 02:48.310
In order for this to work you need to have a file called comments that should be at the root of our

02:48.310 --> 02:49.900
theme's folder.

02:49.900 --> 02:54.880
If you don't have that file it pressed for use a fallback file it has the same name.

02:54.910 --> 02:59.240
Comments not DHP taken from its default theme.

02:59.410 --> 03:05.230
That's one of the reasons why removing this default WordPress themes is not recommended.

03:05.230 --> 03:06.970
You never know when you need them.

03:07.450 --> 03:13.660
So what you're going to do now is to get a copy of that file taken from the 2016 theme and create a

03:13.660 --> 03:17.210
new one at the root of all themes folder.

03:17.430 --> 03:22.430
For this lesson I'm not going to create a new market for this file but it can do that later.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.460
As an exercise.

03:23.480 --> 03:23.940
OK.

03:24.090 --> 03:25.790
Of course if you want it right.

03:26.010 --> 03:29.230
The fact is that many things developers do the same.

03:29.490 --> 03:36.100
They just make a copy of the default comments template file and add it to their own themes and there's

03:36.120 --> 03:37.440
nothing wrong with that.

03:37.530 --> 03:44.450
Actually many things that can be downloaded from the Wordpress repository itself are made this way so

03:44.560 --> 03:47.850
I'll go ahead and create a file called comments that BHB

03:50.550 --> 03:57.870
and paste everything you just copied in there let's save this file and let's open a post

04:01.830 --> 04:05.750
we start by opening a post where comments are allowed.

04:05.790 --> 04:14.790
For example this one here look at it we have in our comments form as I am logged into the site you see

04:14.790 --> 04:17.580
that the form is displayed like this.

04:17.580 --> 04:23.030
Now if I log off they have a slightly different form.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.060
And now you see a form with different fields.

04:26.070 --> 04:31.980
Now if I want to comment I have to give more details like my name my e-mail etc..

04:33.000 --> 04:34.720
Now let's use that post.

04:34.740 --> 04:37.620
We decided it wouldn't be open for comments.

04:41.030 --> 04:48.230
And as comments are not open for this post we simply don't have the post form displaying on it but it

04:48.250 --> 04:49.510
won't change that.

04:49.790 --> 05:00.050
Let's open this post for comments then.

05:00.160 --> 05:09.540
Now reloading the page we have the form to make comments but the first thing is not display in any form.

05:09.540 --> 05:15.170
It may be that your installation is completely closed for comments.

05:15.180 --> 05:20.820
You can check many other rules related to the discussion within your site by going over to settings

05:21.360 --> 05:24.140
discussion.

05:24.390 --> 05:32.370
For example here you can find that my site will not accept comments so regardless of the individual

05:32.370 --> 05:39.230
settings of each post or page your site will never accept comments from visitors causing it.

05:39.390 --> 05:46.080
So I have an exercise to propose you copy everything you have in your comments that page file and make

05:46.080 --> 05:51.000
a new file out of it and then make any changes in your new file.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.240
For example you can move tags from one place to another.

05:55.260 --> 06:03.150
It can remove some feuds you name it then call this modified file inside the common template function

06:03.750 --> 06:04.620
to do that.

06:04.620 --> 06:11.820
You can simply pass the file name inside single quotation marks starting with a slash and see what happens.

06:13.380 --> 06:14.170
That's it.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.690
We'll be back in the next lesson then.

06:17.970 --> 06:19.030
Peace out.
