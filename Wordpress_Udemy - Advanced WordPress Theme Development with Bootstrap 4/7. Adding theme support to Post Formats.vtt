00:01.040 --> 00:04.050
Hello Guys welcome to a new lesson.

00:04.050 --> 00:10.250
Today it's time to talk about another valuable feature that we can add to our theme.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.370
Let's talk about post formats.

00:13.640 --> 00:20.900
Post formats are one of the futures that you can option only the at your film making it even more attractive

00:21.140 --> 00:22.280
to the end user.

00:22.370 --> 00:28.740
But in case you never heard about them I really like to explain everything in detail and visually.

00:28.820 --> 00:34.750
So let's go over to our browser here in the blog de-listing page.

00:34.750 --> 00:39.580
You can see that all the post entries appear in much the same way.

00:39.910 --> 00:44.720
Actually we always have the same structure repeated several times.

00:44.740 --> 00:51.900
Here we have a future e-mail for the post the title and the other elements that we defined in the loop.

00:52.120 --> 00:59.230
By the way you certainly remember that this loop is coming from the file called index dot PH BE ALL

00:59.230 --> 01:01.190
of the post entries look the same.

01:01.300 --> 01:08.630
Precisely because we have only one loop structure which is repeated as many times as necessary.

01:08.680 --> 01:16.060
But what if I want this listing to be different depending on the post content or on posts category.

01:16.120 --> 01:22.780
For example let's suppose that for all posts in the web design category we wanted to show only a single

01:22.780 --> 01:23.680
image.

01:23.710 --> 01:28.590
I mean no text only one image as the post content.

01:28.900 --> 01:33.020
And for the social media category we could have something different.

01:33.040 --> 01:40.290
For example we could only show a video with some tutorial for example and we could go further.

01:40.480 --> 01:46.390
Let's say that all having some of the Web Design category posts would have different color and style

01:46.930 --> 01:51.190
and the same for items in the social media category.

01:51.310 --> 01:57.640
The post formats are available from word breast's three point one and help us make the differentiation

01:57.640 --> 01:58.870
that we want.

01:58.990 --> 02:04.900
WordPress currently works with 9 post formats according to the Codex.

02:04.910 --> 02:12.240
We can have the following post firmus can have a site which is similar to a Facebook note app.

02:12.670 --> 02:19.970
They also have Gallerie post firmus link M.H. quote.

02:20.960 --> 02:28.270
Status video audio and chat transcripts.

02:28.350 --> 02:33.330
We also have the standard WordPress post formats that you understand better.

02:33.330 --> 02:41.370
Later on this lesson for this lesson we're going to use three of this post formats the default one video

02:41.690 --> 02:43.010
and image.

02:43.170 --> 02:47.190
Knowing how to use these formats the others will come naturally to you.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.280
OK so let's get started.

02:51.400 --> 02:57.210
Let's open up our functions files again and let's add another support to the theme.

02:58.500 --> 03:05.920
This time we are going to pass the string post hyphen formats to the function of k.

03:05.990 --> 03:13.570
If you only do that and open any post for editing we'll see something that was not there before.

03:13.740 --> 03:23.510
As open one of the posts here notice here on the right side we have a new metal box and it's quite strange

03:23.510 --> 03:25.660
because it's too empty.

03:25.700 --> 03:31.970
Surely you should have seen this on some other theme but not empty of course.

03:32.030 --> 03:36.710
This metal box should be displaying in a couple of new options but it's not.

03:36.770 --> 03:41.900
Those options are for you to define what kind of content you are currently creating.

03:41.900 --> 03:48.720
For example if it's a video post or an image post or not your post etc..

03:48.890 --> 03:54.520
If you want to display those options you have to pass some more arguments to the function we just created.

03:54.810 --> 03:58.020
So let's go back to a file and pass arguments.

03:58.370 --> 04:02.540
Fortunately this is very but very easy.

04:02.660 --> 04:08.930
We just create an array within the function and type in which post formats we want to enable.

04:08.960 --> 04:14.120
Notice that we are talking about the thing as a whole not just a specific post.

04:14.120 --> 04:19.820
Let's say then that throughout the thing the following post formats will be allowed.

04:20.230 --> 04:25.680
VDU M.H..

04:25.810 --> 04:33.830
Let's say that let's go back to our editing area and reload the page.

04:33.860 --> 04:37.160
Now we have three new options inside the master box.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.340
Standard video and image.

04:40.430 --> 04:47.780
This post FIRMAT called the Standard has a special meaning is the default option and means that no specific

04:47.780 --> 04:50.480
post format is being indicated.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.090
Well now we can start playing around with our posts.

04:55.130 --> 05:01.130
I can go ahead and create a lot of new posts and for posts I'm going to choose a different post FIRMAT

05:01.820 --> 05:09.050
I'm going to create six new posts here to post for each category and for each post format I'm going

05:09.050 --> 05:14.350
to pause the video for a moment and when we come back I'm going to show you what I've done.

05:16.010 --> 05:19.430
So we have this two new posts at the top.

05:19.480 --> 05:25.930
Let's open the first one this post belongs to the social media category.

05:25.990 --> 05:29.200
I defined that for this category of posts.

05:29.230 --> 05:35.430
We'll have the video post format and only contain one video as a contact.

05:35.500 --> 05:42.340
I just grabbed the link from any YouTube video and paste it here in the Post editor and I did the same

05:42.340 --> 05:45.930
for the other post from the same category.

05:45.940 --> 05:51.600
Now back to the post table as open a post from the web design category.

05:52.570 --> 05:59.470
For the two posts in this category I did find that the post format will be MH and their content will

05:59.470 --> 06:02.790
be just a single image.

06:02.890 --> 06:10.360
The idea will be that post in the social media category would represent only a video tutorial and post

06:10.360 --> 06:17.590
from the web design category would only show an image it could be for example a portfolio image but

06:17.590 --> 06:20.390
that's just a hypothetical use case.

06:20.500 --> 06:26.920
Just to illustrate the possibility of using POST Furman's in real life the user of the theme or the

06:26.920 --> 06:34.000
site owner is the one who will define if he or she wants to use this feature and for what reason.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.940
OK the other two remaining posts in the web development category.

06:39.160 --> 06:44.530
You have a standard post FIRMAT they will not present anything different.

06:44.530 --> 06:51.130
Notice that you can easily identify the post FIRMAT in the table that this little icons here next to

06:51.130 --> 06:53.170
the title of each post.

06:53.560 --> 06:58.460
OK but when we go back to her thing we see that nothing has changed yet.

06:58.780 --> 07:01.200
The structure remains the same.

07:01.270 --> 07:08.030
The only difference is that we have new posts with new content.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.890
What we want to do is for posts in the social media category.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.470
We want to remove this also link here.

07:14.470 --> 07:17.870
We could also present the title in a different color not this color.

07:17.870 --> 07:24.230
We have at the moment for the posts from the web design category we want to remove the publication date

07:24.320 --> 07:28.280
and we could also present the title with a different style.

07:28.480 --> 07:33.780
On the other hand both defined with a standard post format won't change at all.

07:34.560 --> 07:41.060
To use the full potential of forced formats you gotta make some changes to our Leupp first the first

07:41.060 --> 07:48.240
thing we're going to do is added that file we created in the previous lesson called Content got BHB.

07:48.410 --> 07:55.460
It contains only inmates shemale article tag as you can see inside the article have a content that is

07:55.460 --> 08:02.750
repeated every time you loop runs and the loop as you know is the one at the next page be filed.

08:03.050 --> 08:13.100
So the school function here inside this article tag get post Furman's and we're going to call this function

08:13.100 --> 08:19.940
out to see what is returning it will do nothing more than showing on screen the name of the post FIRMAT

08:19.950 --> 08:22.830
related to the current post loop.

08:22.860 --> 08:25.210
Let's say that and you see what I mean.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.080
Notice that for the first two loops we have video

08:37.620 --> 08:39.450
for the next two posts.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.080
MH

08:44.490 --> 08:47.920
and for standard post nothing is bring it out.

08:47.940 --> 08:50.680
Good but what is this for.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.250
Well for this to be useful.

08:53.250 --> 08:58.560
We need to use the second parameter of the function we learned in the last lesson to get Steyne played

08:58.560 --> 08:59.250
a part.

09:00.890 --> 09:08.340
So let's just recap the first parameter of this function is the file path without the extension.

09:08.540 --> 09:12.510
So here we have template parts for these flash content.

09:12.830 --> 09:18.200
The second parameter can be used whenever we want to call a specialized part of the same plate.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.960
Kind of confusing isn't it.

09:20.240 --> 09:28.150
Yes and this is a rather complicated concept to explain but in practice it is very easy to understand.

09:28.160 --> 09:35.360
Suppose we have in addition to the content that page file another file called content hif an image that

09:35.570 --> 09:38.360
be with a different content.

09:38.360 --> 09:44.120
How can we do to include that file using the second parameter of the getting paid part function.

09:45.010 --> 09:50.470
Very easy with just typing the word image in the second parameter.

09:50.900 --> 09:57.480
So pressed we will understand that we want to include a file called content hyphen image dot page.

09:57.700 --> 10:01.020
For this to work the full file name must have a hyphen.

10:01.020 --> 10:04.360
OK that's very important.

10:04.360 --> 10:10.930
In a more detailed explanation what happens here is that WordPress will always include a file that has

10:11.230 --> 10:14.250
and they Danti code name to the second parameter.

10:14.470 --> 10:21.600
If it can't find this file it will fall back to the file that has the same name as the first parameter.

10:22.030 --> 10:29.950
So in this example if a file called content hif an image that exists inside of its folder it will be

10:29.950 --> 10:30.820
included.

10:31.090 --> 10:36.330
If it doesn't work press will link to the file called content dot page.

10:36.690 --> 10:37.070
OK.

10:37.090 --> 10:40.200
But what does this have to do with post firmus.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.750
And with that get forced from a function I explained earlier.

10:44.020 --> 10:52.550
Well you see that in a moment let's first create two new files here in the template parts folder one

10:52.550 --> 11:01.130
called content and image that BHP and another file called content.

11:01.190 --> 11:10.340
I think video that HP inside the contd image that BHP file let's copy and paste everything they have

11:10.340 --> 11:12.890
inside the content that BGP file

11:18.710 --> 11:27.280
here we want to remove the publication they don't want to hear and for the content video that's fine.

11:27.430 --> 11:31.560
Let's do the same and just remove the author's link.

11:32.690 --> 11:33.120
OK.

11:33.160 --> 11:40.850
Now going back to the index that BHP last passed the second parameter of the Get template part function

11:40.850 --> 11:48.650
to include this new files in the loop to do this last pass to get those FIRMAT function as the second

11:48.650 --> 11:49.130
parameter

11:52.660 --> 11:59.020
as we already know get post FIRMAT returns a string with the name of the post Furman's.

11:59.020 --> 12:06.280
So whenever there is a post that has the video pulse FIRMAT WordPress will try to include the file called

12:06.280 --> 12:12.750
content hyphen video dot BHB whenever in the loop.

12:12.760 --> 12:20.480
There is a post that has the image Bohr's FIRMAT the file to be included to be content hyphen image.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.130
BHP.

12:22.480 --> 12:28.690
And then whenever the function returns nothing that will be the case when we have a post that has the

12:28.690 --> 12:35.560
standard Poor's FIRMAT the file to be included should be content that THP the second parameter will

12:35.560 --> 12:37.910
be completely ignored.

12:37.930 --> 12:41.470
So that's the magic ladies and gentlemen and I say that

12:45.910 --> 12:53.110
and look at us for posts from the social media category which have the video post FIRMAT the content

12:53.110 --> 12:56.060
video that page peafowl was included.

12:56.140 --> 13:04.440
We can say that because these items don't display the author's link and this below posts from the web

13:04.440 --> 13:05.760
design category.

13:05.790 --> 13:11.360
They don't have the publication date which means the file I've included here is the content image that

13:11.380 --> 13:14.620
BHB file.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.770
Your other post didn't change at all because they were beautiful.

13:18.790 --> 13:23.810
They called it APCP file which has the most complete loop of all.

13:23.860 --> 13:27.960
Now that you know all of this you can start playing a little more.

13:27.970 --> 13:34.400
You can for example modify the tags of which count and file by adding certain CSSA classes within those

13:34.400 --> 13:37.610
tags and then styling them differently.

13:37.780 --> 13:44.710
For example for all polls that have a video post FIRMAT we can say that all having elements will show

13:44.800 --> 13:52.100
in red color and that's just the tip of the iceberg or we can do something even more advanced.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.130
Look at these examples.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.140
That's it for you guys.

14:48.170 --> 14:55.400
We can't call the post class function inside the HTL mail article tag of all the content files we created

14:55.400 --> 14:56.700
in this lesson.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.980
Inspect these elements and see which classes will be included.

15:00.980 --> 15:05.500
Think about what you can achieve with those classes using CSSA.

15:05.660 --> 15:09.650
I am sure that many ideas will pop up from your mind.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.700
Well that's all for this lesson.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.990
I hope you have understood and also liked it.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.660
If you have any question go ahead and use our questions and answers page.

15:19.730 --> 15:21.630
So see your next lesson.
