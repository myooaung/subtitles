00:01.280 --> 00:02.290
Hi thanks.

00:02.380 --> 00:08.100
Marcel here for another lesson and they're almost coming to the end of this long work.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.550
And today you're going to be great an area to include the logo.

00:12.550 --> 00:19.850
First of all as head over to the Wordpress dashboard appearance menu customize

00:24.180 --> 00:30.930
and undersize identity you realize that we don't have a control upload the logo to the thing yet.

00:31.230 --> 00:33.710
So we have to figure out how to do this.

00:33.990 --> 00:39.750
Fortunately there was a fairly easy way to do this in wordpress to do so.

00:39.910 --> 00:41.450
Let's go back to our code.

00:41.970 --> 00:48.540
Today we can forget the customize or that page be filed because we need only the functions file it changes

00:48.540 --> 00:50.890
will be as you'll see many more.

00:51.390 --> 00:53.870
As Go ahead and add another thing support

00:56.940 --> 00:57.610
this time.

00:57.710 --> 00:58.680
The support we want.

00:58.680 --> 01:02.060
It's called Custom hyphen logo.

01:02.070 --> 01:07.590
This film supports accepts an array of arguments in which we can set both the width and the height of

01:07.590 --> 01:09.030
the image.

01:09.060 --> 01:11.270
So let's begin the array here.

01:14.470 --> 01:20.220
Height is going to be 110 and with it's going to be 200.

01:20.240 --> 01:26.470
This is going to be enough for a logo image as you setting an exact size for this image.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.710
You'll notice that WordPress will allow us to crop the image used for the logo.

01:32.270 --> 01:33.760
Let's save this here.

01:35.310 --> 01:41.910
And reload the customized dashboard.

01:41.920 --> 01:49.710
Now if the access side identity again you have here an exclusive area and our logo is in it.

01:50.170 --> 01:53.740
Let's upload an image.

01:53.850 --> 01:59.730
Look here as I said before the Customize customized suggests that the uploaded image has a dimension

01:59.730 --> 02:03.260
of 200 by 120 pixels.

02:04.320 --> 02:12.160
And when you choose an image that I have already set aside for the logo though this that this image

02:12.190 --> 02:14.900
is larger than the suggested size.

02:14.950 --> 02:22.390
So when I click select WordPress S-meter crop the image before that I'm going to type here in alternative

02:22.390 --> 02:26.450
text for the image and also a description.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.920
I'm going to just type the theme name

02:31.320 --> 02:32.020
ok.

02:32.370 --> 02:36.750
I'm going to click on this button here and proceed to crop the image.

02:42.960 --> 02:43.660
OK great.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.780
The image is here in our view.

02:46.260 --> 02:49.620
But of course it's not explained on the theme yet.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.930
Let's save this here for now.

02:52.470 --> 02:55.520
And we go ahead and include the logo in our theme.

02:55.710 --> 02:58.760
To do this let's open up the head of that page file.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.550
Let's remove it all here.

03:03.980 --> 03:05.400
The last color logo.

03:06.260 --> 03:12.530
To do that it's really very simple let's just call the custom logo function

03:16.590 --> 03:18.280
that's it nothing more.

03:18.630 --> 03:23.890
But now you understand the reasons why we created some things at the beginning of the course.

03:23.970 --> 03:32.460
For example we have this Sandra class here and we also have this defect just below the bootstrap container

03:32.610 --> 03:40.950
called a line the text in class ensures that the logo will be censored even when we are at a very small

03:40.950 --> 03:47.970
screen resolution such as the smartphone and the align class that we use to align both the logo and

03:47.970 --> 03:54.360
the menu vertically well before showing you how are going to align these items.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.860
Let's see if our logo is already showing up on the screen.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.960
Let's open our theme here.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.310
Excellent.

04:05.310 --> 04:08.000
Our logo is already showing on the screen.

04:08.130 --> 04:08.880
Look here.

04:09.640 --> 04:13.650
However you can see that it's not aligned with the menu.

04:13.870 --> 04:17.410
In fact we have this space all on the menu.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.120
It really seems very very ugly.

04:21.520 --> 04:25.600
So this let's use only three CSSA comments.

04:26.050 --> 04:30.150
Let's go ahead and create a very simple rule for that aligned class.

04:30.430 --> 04:32.680
Let's open up our services file.

04:38.650 --> 04:42.760
So a line and let's say the following.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.400
Display flex

04:49.050 --> 05:02.490
line items sender with 100 percent isn't only this you can ensure that all items are aligned vertically.

05:02.740 --> 05:03.360
So let's see

05:11.250 --> 05:13.660
well something went wrong here.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.010
We have to figure out what happened.

05:16.540 --> 05:21.480
Let's go back to our code because I believe the problem is that aligned with

05:25.310 --> 05:26.680
yes it's here.

05:26.750 --> 05:34.910
In fact this div must be inside the room not outside or otherwise the display flags won't work for the

05:34.910 --> 05:37.210
Jew innards of Dag's.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.860
Let's we want to decode

05:44.620 --> 05:46.810
and let's refresh the page again.

05:49.250 --> 05:57.890
An Grainne his work in IT can get more perfect than this.

05:57.910 --> 05:59.740
So now let's resize the screen

06:04.280 --> 06:14.900
and then when they get below 767 pixels are Esparza's menu will display and the logo image is center.

06:15.040 --> 06:19.010
Thanks to the A-line glass Well folks.

06:19.090 --> 06:20.570
That was it for this lesson.

06:20.860 --> 06:26.500
I hope you enjoyed it and I invite you then to be here with me in the next lesson which will be our

06:26.500 --> 06:30.090
last on the Wordpress theme customized for jovem.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.460
Happy coding.
