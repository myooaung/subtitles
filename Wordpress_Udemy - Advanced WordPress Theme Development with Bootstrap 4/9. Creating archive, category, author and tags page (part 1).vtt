00:00.900 --> 00:06.840
Heather we're almost coming to the end of the section in which you're learning how to create the inner

00:06.840 --> 00:13.380
pages of our thing in previous lessons you have already learned how to create a single page and a search

00:13.380 --> 00:14.170
page.

00:14.220 --> 00:20.320
So every time I click on a post link or that we do a search you have a different view.

00:20.610 --> 00:26.960
If you haven't graded those pages the whole view will be based on one file which is the index dot page

00:26.960 --> 00:27.440
B.

00:27.690 --> 00:28.420
I think you're ready.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.540
Tired of knowing that isn't it.

00:31.050 --> 00:34.360
But at least you'll have some other template files to handle.

00:34.380 --> 00:41.520
For example when you click on the category tag the author's name or as you see a publication date link

00:41.850 --> 00:45.740
what's low that US is still the index that file.

00:45.860 --> 00:51.370
We can easily check this if you install a plugin called show current template.

00:51.780 --> 00:57.780
This plugin is a great help for anyone who is a film developer or in situations where we need to modify

00:57.780 --> 01:00.640
a thing that was not viewed by herself.

01:01.090 --> 01:12.360
Let's then go ahead and install this plugin.

01:12.600 --> 01:17.100
And we don't have to set anything up because it's now ready to use.

01:17.350 --> 01:25.720
I go to the front end and now in the admin bar you can see that there is this new option.

01:26.030 --> 01:31.290
It shows us the name of the main template file that is generating the current view.

01:31.640 --> 01:37.680
If you just mouse over it we can still see other things like parts that are loaded along with the main

01:37.680 --> 01:38.920
theme plate.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.780
Let's go to the blog page

01:44.890 --> 01:51.670
and look as I've been explaining to you for a while the blog page just uses the deforesting plate which

01:51.670 --> 01:57.030
is indexed dot BHP as I said at the beginning of this lesson.

01:57.040 --> 02:03.040
This also happens when you click on a category link and tag the author's name or a publication date

02:03.040 --> 02:06.390
link Well let's see if it's true.

02:07.370 --> 02:09.100
Click on the author's name.

02:09.960 --> 02:13.710
And the template is index dot page B.

02:13.830 --> 02:18.900
Click on a category again index dot page B.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.120
Click on a publication date.

02:21.940 --> 02:27.280
And see again that template file is the start page be well.

02:27.330 --> 02:29.120
There is nothing wrong with it.

02:29.310 --> 02:35.840
If you really want to see the same plate when you click on any of those links if your intention is to

02:35.840 --> 02:42.320
submit your thing to market places such as the think forest you'll see that they have this very special

02:42.320 --> 02:43.260
requirement.

02:44.290 --> 02:52.800
So here they are saying index that page B should be reserved for Standard blog latest post view so you

02:52.810 --> 03:00.040
can use index that page for every scenario just for the blog latest post for you as we're doing here

03:00.280 --> 03:06.170
in our theme say that are not using text or PSP as a template for this plane.

03:06.240 --> 03:06.840
Tags.

03:06.880 --> 03:13.050
They are Alpher pages to solve all of these display problems at once.

03:13.050 --> 03:16.120
You'll be creating a new template file called archive.

03:16.140 --> 03:25.390
Dot BHB typically This file will be used if you need to create a page Well a page with your sites archive.

03:25.400 --> 03:31.920
There is a page showing the content organized by date by month my ears etc..

03:32.170 --> 03:38.100
Whether we can use this file in a slightly more general way it's very versatile.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.490
You understand this better.

03:39.620 --> 03:46.350
Let's go over to the Wordpress thing Handbook which is a page with valuable documentation for developers.

03:47.750 --> 03:52.400
This page here talks about all the template files needed to create a theme.

03:52.640 --> 03:59.610
Let's go ahead and click here in common WordPress template files here we got a list of all template

03:59.610 --> 04:02.420
files with the description below.

04:02.520 --> 04:08.530
We can find something about the archive that page peafowl look what they say about this file.

04:08.580 --> 04:15.480
The archive template is used when visitors request post by category our for our date.

04:15.480 --> 04:20.850
Note this template will be overbreeding if more specific thing plates are present like category that

04:20.850 --> 04:25.080
page be authored that page be and they thought page.

04:25.260 --> 04:30.210
That is it can create specific template files for categories authors and date.

04:30.360 --> 04:36.380
But it can also choose to create a single file called archive that BHB which can handle these three

04:36.510 --> 04:39.600
situations at the same time for us.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.710
In fact we can also create the text in that page through this file.

04:43.860 --> 04:49.830
Although the documentation don't mention this fact that's what we're going to be creating in the next

04:49.830 --> 04:50.250
lesson.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.560
OK I'll wait for you then in the next lesson.

04:53.700 --> 04:54.180
By.
