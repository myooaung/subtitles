00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.570
Kinesis Data Analytics can have several different sources for incoming

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.830
data, It can use Kinesis Data Streams to get near realâ€‘time data to

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.940
analyze directly from one of those streams.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.100
It can also use Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams,

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.900
which will still provide batches of data,

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.140
but not quite as quickly as Kinesis Data Streams.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.900
Finally,

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.680
you can also use reference data in a source like S3

9
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.980
to enrich your data. For example,

10
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.500
you can use S3 data as something like a reference

11
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.370
table in a traditional database,

12
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:38.000
and then bring that data in as you're processing the data coming in from Kinesis Data Analytics and your sources.
