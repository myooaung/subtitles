1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,260
Let's look at all the different services that fall

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,780
inside the Amazon Kinesis family.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,600
Now, this is going to really help us answer the question, what is Amazon Kinesis?

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,920
You might've heard someone say the word Kinesis or read it in a

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,740
blog post somewhere, but what is Amazon Kinesis?

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,330
Well, Amazon Kinesis actually comprises several distinct AWS services,

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,950
each with their own purposes and capabilities.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,410
Most commonly, when people talk about Kinesis,

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,490
they mean Kinesis Data Streams,

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,740
which are used to process large amounts of streaming data in near real time.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,620
But there's also the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose,

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,020
which is also used to process data in a more

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,280
handsâ€‘off and managed by AWS kind of way.

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,680
You can also use Kinesis Data Analytics to analyze,

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,590
transform, and manipulate streaming data or leverage Kinesis Video Streams to

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,470
stream video data into AWS and make it viewable on websites,

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,570
leverage machine learning capabilities with it,

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,540
or simply store it and services like Amazon S3. With

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,760
these four different distinct services,

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,540
things can get pretty confusing pretty quickly, so let's

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,820
clarify some jargon around the word Kinesis.

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,000
When somebody says Kinesis all by itself or Kinesis Streams, they're

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,830
probably referring to Kinesis Data Streams, but technically, there

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,640
are Kinesis Firehose delivery streams, too.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,770
If someone says Firehose or delivery streams,

26
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,190
they're talking about Kinesis Data Firehose and

27
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,040
Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,000
And in later modules, we'll look at both of these services in more detail just to clarify things better and show you how each of them work.
