00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.600
Now let's learn more about the Snow Family.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.500
Now this has nothing to do with Game of Thrones.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.970
In fact,

4
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.960
we'll be looking at Snowball devices that lie within the AWS Snow Family.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.720
There's a variety of different devices inside of the Snow

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.070
Family and includes devices that are currently operational and

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.040
ones that are retiring presently.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.520
But just in case you hear their names come up on AWS

9
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.540
exams or when people bring them up, it might be useful to know about them.

10
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.300
First, there's the Snowball device.

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.640
Now this device is currently retiring,

12
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.330
but it was used to allow people to get a physical hardware appliance to get

13
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.200
sent to their own data centers and put a bunch of information onto the

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.100
physical appliance like a massive SD card or hard drive,

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.370
and then send that back to AWS in order to unload

16
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.480
it into AWS's storage solutions.

17
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.740
AWS has moved a little bit away from just using this Snowball device,

18
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.390
and they have a few other products that are a little more relevant now.

19
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.870
If you need to move a lot, a lot of data,

20
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.950
one of those products is called Snowmobile.

21
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.480
Now this is for when you need to move up to a 100 PB of storage.

22
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.850
That's a lot of storage.

23
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.600
And if you need to move that much or more,

24
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.230
you'd want to use this,

25
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.340
which essentially is a massive truck that you'll be

26
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.590
sending to your own data center, putting a bunch of data on it,

27
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.210
and sending it back to AWS.

28
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.910
It functions pretty similarly to a massive hard drive on wheels that

29
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.650
you ship back and forth between those two locations.

30
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.330
Now while they started phasing out Snowball devices,

31
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.360
they've recently included something called Snowball Edge,

32
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.550
which is kind of the next version of that.

33
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.050
With Snowball Edge,

34
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.910
they'll allow you to both send information on this physical

35
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.720
appliance using 50 to 80 TB of storage,

36
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.920
but they'll also give you the option to have this device

37
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.000
process things with the power of the AWS cloud.

38
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.710
So there's some ability to use the Snowball Edge device to actually

39
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.030
run jobs locally before it gets sent back to AWS.

40
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.590
Now let's take a look at all of these in a little bit more detail.

41
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.940
First,

42
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.560
let's look at Snowball Edge devices and get a little bit of

43
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.690
a better understanding of what they do.

44
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.490
They have both onboard compute capacity,

45
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.450
and they have the ability to mimic the EC2 and S3 endpoints that you

46
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.280
might use when you're working with the AWS cloud.

47
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.180
This allows you to set up virtual machines on these separate hardware

48
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.710
appliances without connecting directly to the AWS cloud.

49
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.260
And it also lets you send in objects like files,

50
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.810
images, and other objects like that to these physical appliances in

51
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.690
the same way you would to AWS. Now if you wanted to process some

52
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.860
data without these sorts of endpoints,

53
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.120
you could also use Lambda functions in a similar way to what

54
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.660
you might do in the cloud, except they're running inside of the

55
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.540
device that AWS is shipping you.

56
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.560
So let's look at a few examples of when we might use Snowball Edge. First,

57
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.320
we might decide to use Snowball Edge when we're

58
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.570
working with a lot of IoT sensors.

59
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.580
We might want to capture some streaming data from those sensors

60
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.500
on our local environment that might have a little bit more

61
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.330
difficulty connecting to the internet,

62
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.890
and we could process that local data using a Snowball Edge

63
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.540
device before we sent anything over to the cloud.

64
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.420
We might also want to set up Snowball Edge devices when we have

65
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.720
some sort of long distance travel that we're doing while we still

66
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.040
need to collect information from different types of devices in

67
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.830
whatever environment we're using.

68
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.320
This is a good example when we're doing things like shipping where we

69
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.120
might have a bunch of different information that needs to get collected

70
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.630
from devices, but we're on a boat in the middle of the ocean where there's

71
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.740
just not very good Wi‑Fi connectivity.

72
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.650
So in those cases,

73
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.970
we could connect local devices to a local network and set

74
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.100
them up to interact with Snowball Edge,

75
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.250
where we both collect the data and potentially process it

76
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.290
before it gets reconnected to the internet.

77
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.380
Now other cases that frequently involve these sorts of devices

78
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.080
are manufacturing when we might have a bunch of different

79
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.680
machines all doing things at the same time,

80
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.770
and we want them all interacting locally to make sure we can get the

81
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.110
most up‑to‑date information and have them interacting with the device

82
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.740
that's local inside of that manufacturing site,

83
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.160
both for speed and to make sure we don't have to send as much data

84
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.340
back and forth between our local site and the cloud.

85
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.330
Now there are plenty of other examples,

86
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.170
but a lot of them revolve around when there's poor connectivity. So

87
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.120
that long distance nautical travel with a ship in the middle of the

88
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.540
ocean is a pretty good example of this.

89
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.640
But there are plenty of other situations where this

90
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.420
might come up and be the case too.

91
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:32.000
So if you think about any of those situations, also keep in mind that Snowball Edge might be a good fit for them.
