00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.900
When you have a really large source database with massive amounts

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.370
of information in it or you don't have a very reliable internet

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.860
connection to get data over to AWS,

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.750
one option that you might decide to pursue is using DMS in

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.570
combination with the Snowball Edge device.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.310
The way this will work is you'll start with your source and then

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.240
you'll have your DMS local replication instance.

8
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.540
You might install this locally on your own machines or

9
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.140
potentially get it working with Snowball Edge.

10
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.950
This would allow you to run the same tasks that you'd run through the

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.420
DMS Cloud Service and take the data inside of your source tables and

12
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.040
move them onto a Snowball Edge device.

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.390
Now,

14
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.760
this is a hardware appliance that's actually going to be sent to your

15
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.540
data center so you don't have to do this whole process over the open

16
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.200
internet and wait for the back and forth of this entire task because

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.450
when you have a lot of data, but it doesn't become convenient to do

18
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.980
that with the internet.

19
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.670
So you take the Snowball Edge device at this point and you get a

20
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.100
truck or AWS's way of shipping back the Snowball Edge device, and

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.540
then you'd send it back to AWS's data center.

22
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.090
You'd ship it over there and it would arrive at the AWS Cloud.

23
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.930
Now at this point,

24
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.140
you bring it into the AWS Cloud and the tables that you put on the Snowball

25
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.700
Edge device would then be loaded into your target database through the DMS

26
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.740
local replication instance inside of the cloud.

27
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.720
So this becomes a two‑part transfer from your data, first, from

28
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.120
your local source in an on‑premises environment,

29
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.070
for example,

30
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.340
to the Snowball Edge device using a DMS client locally in your

31
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.600
environment, and then sending the Snowball Edge device to the AWS Cloud

32
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.030
to then run the same DMS replication tasks to get the data from the

33
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.740
Snowball Edge device into the cloud database.

34
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.540
So what would some of the reasons be to use a solution like this?

35
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.070
Well, when your source database is massive,

36
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.920
this will become useful either to avoid the costs of sending

37
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.420
data over the internet and your ISP charging you by the size and

38
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.580
the amount of data that you're using or potentially just to

39
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.700
speed that entire process up.

40
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.530
Additionally, when network connectivity is an issue,

41
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.140
it's not just going to slow things down, but it might

42
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.640
cause problems in your database migration.

43
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.070
So if you can do it through Snowball Edge,

44
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.840
it might be both more efficient and more reliable to do so.

45
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.300
This is also a great option when you want some of the same

46
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.310
benefits of using DMS and allow you to have its software handle

47
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.560
the transfer of data from your source to your target for you. You

48
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.990
still get the same benefits.

49
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.560
Essentially,

50
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.240
this job just runs twice, once locally in your on‑premises

51
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.400
environment and once in the cloud when you're moving it from the

52
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.000
Snowball Edge to the cloud database. So in the next video, let's review what we've learned about DMS.
