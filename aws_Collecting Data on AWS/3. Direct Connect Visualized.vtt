00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.180
Now let's visualize Direct Connect and how it works.

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.200
It starts with a customer network.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.900
Now this means it's the AWS customer.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.440
In this case,

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.140
it could be your onâ€‘premises environment or maybe a colocation

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.340
provider that you currently rent hardware from.

7
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.310
Within this customer network, you might have your own virtual

8
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.770
machines or your actual hardware that you're running databases

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.660
and other applications on top of.

10
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.920
And you'll also have a router that you send traffic out to the internet,

11
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.000
or in this case, to a Direct Connect location.

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.090
The first thing that'll happen is you'll use that router in

13
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.240
order to connect to the Direct Connect location,

14
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
and you'll tie it to a customer partner or router.

15
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.800
Now that will then lead to a Direct Connect endpoint

16
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.140
inside of the Direct Connect location.

17
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.200
All of this is going to be handled by a Direct Connect partner,

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.540
like the ones that I mentioned in earlier videos.

19
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.790
Now,

20
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.880
once you've connected through your network to the Direct Connect

21
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.640
location over to the Direct Connect endpoint,

22
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.110
you'll then be able to make requests into the AWS cloud inside of a VPC.

23
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.980
Now, this would be using what's called a private virtual interface.

24
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.670
But, if you have resources that are outside of a VPC,

25
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.330
for example, AWS cloud resources like DynamoDB or S3,

26
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.550
you could access those through something called a public virtual interface,

27
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.730
which would still go through the first set of steps,

28
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.980
through the router, the customer partner router,

29
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.640
and the Direct Connect endpoint, and then be sent over to DynamoDB,

30
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.140
S3, or the other public API endpoints for AWS cloud.

31
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800
This would be called a public virtual interface.

32
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.520
So this is how you might use Direct Connect at a high

33
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.930
level to interact with AWS cloud services.

34
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.590
Just remember that when interacting with resources in VPC that

35
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.610
are protected by the VPC's configuration,

36
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.650
you'll use a private virtual interface,

37
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.000
whereas with the public services like DynamoDB and S3, you'll stick to that public virtual interface.
