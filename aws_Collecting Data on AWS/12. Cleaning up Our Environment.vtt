00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.990
Let's start cleaning up the resources we just created.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.390
Go ahead and go over to the Kinesis Data Analytics

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.260
application section, click the application we just had, and

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.890
then go to Actions and Delete application,

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.030
and then you have to click Delete application again. After you click

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.700
Delete application, just wait for the application to finish

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.850
deleting. Now, it should look something like this after that's done,

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.490
but regardless of what happens,

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.230
you'll need to go back over to the left side of the screen and go

10
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.170
to the Data Streams section too, because you also need to delete

11
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.040
the data stream that you created.

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.640
That's really a lot of what you'll be getting charged for.

13
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.140
So click on that check box, and click Delete,

14
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.290
and you might also have to type in delete to confirm you want to remove

15
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.880
this stream. Now, one other thing you might want to do is go back to your

16
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.850
Python interpreter and press Ctrl+C or Command+D to interrupt the script

17
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.070
that's running and make sure that it's not sending data anymore into the

18
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.820
AWS Kinesis Data Stream.

19
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.990
You might get an error like this if you delete the stream

20
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.100
before you stop the script from running.

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.930
Don't worry if you get that error. Just make sure that

22
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.570
you're going back into AWS and making sure that those

23
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.140
resources you created are now deleted.

24
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
And lastly, if you had decided to deliver data anywhere inside of AWS,

25
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.660
make sure that you realize that if it's in somewhere

26
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.210
like S3 or another AWS service,

27
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.000
you might be paying for storage inside of that service, so you might end up needing to clean up resources on that end too.
