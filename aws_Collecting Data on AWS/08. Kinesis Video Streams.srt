1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,350
Now let's take a closer look at another member of the Amazon Kinesis family,

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,900
Amazon Kinesis Video Streams.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,540
So what's the purpose of Kinesis Video Streams?

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,590
Well, it's a tool designed to help simplify the process of streaming video data.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,310
It can start by helping you stream video from a variety of sources and devices.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,980
Then,

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,380
it can help you process the data with a variety of tools to make it

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,440
easier to analyze and interact with video data using things like machine

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,940
learning or other tools to do object detection.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,170
Finally, it can help you store data from your video streams.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,220
This has a wide range of applications,

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,440
but maybe especially relevant for IoT devices with video capabilities.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,990
When it comes to using Amazon Kinesis Video Streams,

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,980
there's really two key toolsets to be aware of.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,970
The Producer libraries for Video Streams allow you to easily

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,240
set up devices to send video data to AWS.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,060
They help provide a set of libraries to configure with your video software,

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,930
and you can do this when working with Java,

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,540
Android, or C++.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,640
Now, the Consumer libraries are their counterpart,

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,290
where you can use them to parse information coming in from the video streams.

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,580
They can help send video data into machine learning

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,000
algorithms for image detection or help you parse video data for storage and something like Amazon S3.
