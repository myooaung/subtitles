1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,060
So before we learn more about collecting data on AWS,

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,370
let's see why we'd want to learn about AWS data services.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,320
Let's look both for the benefits for ourselves and our careers and the

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,540
benefits that they might have for our organizations. To get started for

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,520
us, we might be interested to know that AWS data services are among the

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,880
top highest paid skills included in a Dice 2020 salary survey that they

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,430
were sending out to see what the top technology skills were and how they

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,640
were compensated.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,810
Among the top 20, five of the 20 skills were

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,240
related to AWS and AWS data services.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,030
In addition,

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,280
one of the top compensated roles of data engineer saw a

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,980
9.3% salary growth from 2019 to 2020.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,600
So it looks like this trend of high pay for these skills isn't going

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,660
anywhere. Now you also might want to learn more about AWS data services

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,210
if you're preparing for AWS certificates, like the Data Analytics

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,370
certification or the Databases certification.

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,730
Knowing about AWS data collection technologies is pretty useful

19
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,170
when you're preparing for many of the different AWS

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,450
certifications. Now, for your organization's,

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,810
why would we think about using AWS data services? Well,

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,730
one of the first key reasons is that AWS is still the public cloud

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,670
leader and has many services and capabilities that are still far beyond

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,040
what the other cloud providers currently offer.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,760
Now, of course,

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,530
there's specifications depending on which cloud provider has a particular

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,600
service that you might really benefit from, but overall,

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
AWS still leads that area.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,750
In addition, when you're using AWS data services,

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,820
you'll be able to integrate those with a full platform of other

31
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,320
integrations and services inside of AWS while still taking advantage

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,240
of many open source tools and technologies.

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,220
You wouldn't necessarily get this from single tools or

34
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,640
other providers with smaller footprints.

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,700
So now that you have a better personal understanding and organizational

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,000
understanding of why we might want to learn about AWS data services, let's dive into looking more about the Amazon Kinesis family.
