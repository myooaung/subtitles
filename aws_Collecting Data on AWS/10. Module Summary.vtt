00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.870
In this module,

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.430
we took a look at how to differentiate between the different

3
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.770
services that fall under the Amazon Kinesis family.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.760
We took a quick look at Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Data Firehose,

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.040
which we'll be getting back too soon.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.980
And we looked at Kinesis Data Analytics and how it's used to integrate with

7
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.060
Kinesis Data Streams as part of the collection process,

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.780
as well as how it works with many other AWS services.

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.550
Additionally,

10
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.720
we looked at a few examples of how we could use

11
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.880
Kinesis Video Streams to collect,

12
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.520
process, and act on streaming video data. In the next module, we'll take

13
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.000
a more inâ€‘depth look at Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, so I'll see you there.
