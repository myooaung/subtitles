00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
So this is our product, three columns block.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.065
As you can see I can hardly read this caption,

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:09.465
so I'm going to change that.

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:12.600
I'm going here to edit page,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.160
and selecting this image like so,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.290
and adding an advanced CSS class here,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.125
we going to say product image, update.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:31.100
Just to check here,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.645
this element should be yes,

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:38.130
fig caption as usual.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:48.250
I'm heading to my CSS file and then adding this class product image,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.210
and then fig caption,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.520
of course, and say color white,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:08.640
save, update on the server and,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.930
check in the browser.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.000
You see, I have changed only this particular image.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.640
So I have to go one level up,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.575
and this is the whole block.

00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:29.970
Going here and assigning this block an extra CSS class,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.715
I'm going to call it product block, update.

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:38.205
Go to my CSS style,

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:42.910
and then say product block.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.915
Save, update and check in the browser.

00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:57.955
Yes, now all three captions are visible in color white.

00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:00.340
This title I don't like it.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.620
It's a bit too on the left,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:11.680
so I have to check in this block if I can put an extra margin on the left.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.070
So we are selecting this one.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.935
I'm adding here a class of product, block, title.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:28.030
One has to be pretty specific about this update.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.260
Go to my style sheets and then right, product-block-title.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.950
Let's say margin-left, it's going to be five rem,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.490
save and update, and check in the browser.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:03.080
Nothing happened because I probably forgot to put here the important rule.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.330
There must be some other ruling that is overruling

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:16.230
this editor CSS style, so update.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.810
Here we go. It's in the middle.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.625
I could do also the CSS style of removing this line here.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:30.465
It's probably before element.

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:34.365
It's this one.

00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:44.920
I'm just going to copy the style and say copy.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:56.830
Say here, display none.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.870
Maybe better put.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.240
No, I don't want these lines anywhere in my site.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.200
So yes and update, is gone.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.490
You see it's pretty great how you can just add

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.940
an extra class into an element of a block or the block itself.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.510
Then just go to style sheet and style this class. That's it.
