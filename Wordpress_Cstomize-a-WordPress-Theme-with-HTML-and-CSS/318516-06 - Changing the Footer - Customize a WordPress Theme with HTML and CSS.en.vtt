00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.415
To change the appearance of our footer,

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:05.025
first, I want to change the background color.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:06.600
I'm going to here,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.119
check in the web tools,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.355
what is happening with the footer.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.240
There it is, there is no declaration of background color,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
and of course it's taking over the body background color declaration.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.205
I'm going to make one here,

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:29.190
background color and check with

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.760
my Color Slope App because I was playing with

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.370
the colors and I wanted to have a less contrast in the footer,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.815
so the content area is a bit more visible,

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:46.825
just subtly but with a little difference.

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:52.045
Yes, I'm going back to the inspector,

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:54.635
putting the color here.

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:57.725
Yes, this is how it's supposed to look like.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:07.985
Then I have to remember that a footer ID is colophon and the class is site-footer, copy.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.345
Going to the style sheet,

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:12.810
and somewhere up here,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.985
we have colors override.

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:16.950
I see I have made a mistake,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.625
I'm going to delete that and paste the background color here.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:30.595
Make the brackets like so and

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:36.400
footer-id of colophon and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.400
the class of site-footer.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.075
Now let me check if this is going to work,

00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:51.420
without declaring the important attribute.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.935
Refresh, yes, it's working.

00:01:55.935 --> 00:02:01.500
This is great and now we can work on the widgets.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.285
Every time you see Meta in WordPress,

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:08.015
you can take a bet that this is a widget

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:12.870
and I am going to check here with the Web Inspector.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.250
Yes, here is the aside element which is declared as a widget-area.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130
In some WordPress themes,

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.785
there was a sidebar on the left or on the right,

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:27.260
which is also widgetized,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.885
where you can put these chunks of code,

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:36.460
a very practical functional elements that are going to enhance your theme.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.560
I'm going to head to the dashboard because I don't need all of these widgets.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.100
Here in the appearance go to Widgets,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:54.520
and I'm going to remove all of these like so.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.650
Take a look at my sketch,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.060
now here I have four lists,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.635
lists of text, and some of them have links.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:07.835
What I need basically,

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:10.685
I cannot find among these widgets here,

00:03:10.685 --> 00:03:13.850
I'm going to use the custom HTML,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.650
which is a very practical widget where you can create

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.845
whatever content in HTML directly for your footer or the sidebars,

00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:28.240
depending where your Aside element is.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.815
For my footer with widget,

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:35.700
I'm going to put in the custom HTML and widget,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.455
I don't need a title for it.

00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:43.039
Just going to declare a parent flex element,

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:50.760
It's going to be very original, footer-flex.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.250
Then inside are going to have four div elements.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.435
The first is going to be Copyright,

00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:14.770
the second, Class, that's going to be the address.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:24.215
The third, just going to copy these to put them inside and then change

00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:29.690
this contact and languages

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.010
because one day this page is going to be in German and English,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.800
going to save this in between and then declare the lists.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.160
This is not really what I wanted it to look like,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.915
so after much tweaking,

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:49.145
I have played with this code and with the widgets around.

00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:55.340
I found a solution to have the footer look like a 1 and a 2,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.535
and that is here in the CSS code,

00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:01.220
I have to change several things.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.725
For example, here for the flex I have to create space

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:12.835
between and I also have to decrease the font size.

00:05:12.835 --> 00:05:16.790
I'm going to put it a 0.7 EM.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:27.525
Also, the footer-flex div has a padding of 12 percent and it has a width.

00:05:27.525 --> 00:05:31.410
I'm going to put here 300 pixels,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:40.630
and also very important align-self to self-start.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:48.320
This is going to push the text in the div itself to be aligned with

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.100
the top line and the footer-flex is going to have a line items in the center,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.920
the vertical center of the footer.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.860
Also here in the UL,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.240
I have to declare the width of the 200 pixels.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.605
I think have declared everything that I've forgotten.

00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:18.510
I'm going to save this,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.120
push it on the Server 2 and then refresh.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.330
It still needs a bit of tweaking, for example,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.360
it's not aligned with the start of the content here on the left.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.270
This is because this element, as well,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.230
I'm just going to inspect the element here.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.720
The copyright also has a padding on both sides,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:56.700
so I am going to remove that by going to CSS and declaring the footer-flex div,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.785
first-child is not allowed to have padding.

00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:11.910
First-child padding 00,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.990
let's refresh.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.715
Now this looks better,

00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:22.610
there is one problem though,

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.080
which I was thinking about later on,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.750
and that is the responsiveness.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.510
If I watch this on the iPhone, on the smartphone,

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.385
I'm going to see only two of the lists,

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:45.650
so I'm forced to create two widgets with custom HTML.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.690
This is going to change here,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.110
so I'm just going to create another widget,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:08:01.755
custom HTML and copy these last two lists,

00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:08.520
which is, I believe contact and languages, yes.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.750
I have to close

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:23.980
the div and then paste this here,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.965
but I'm missing this starting div,

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:32.030
which is the footer-flex.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.905
The editor likes that,

00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:50.950
no errors, save and this is done so I'm going to refresh here.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:59.665
When I push this to the smartphone dimensions,

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:09.410
you can see I have all four of the lists here stacked above each other.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:17.850
I just have to declare may be another class to this footer,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.380
and to do this, I'm heading to CSS again.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.865
Declaring another class footer-flex-1 which

00:09:26.865 --> 00:09:33.290
I'm going to apply to the first of the custom widgets.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:39.270
I have to prepare this here and copy

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.430
footer-flex-1 into all declarations except this one.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:53.300
This is the first one which is not going to have the padding and footer-flex-1 UL.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.730
I believe I have covered everything now at the footer-flex-1,

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:05.920
so I'm going to update this on the server and check what I've done here.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.545
Yes, I forgot to change the class in the widget,

00:10:09.545 --> 00:10:13.790
let's go in there and declare this here,

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:22.435
footer-flex-1, save, done and voila.

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:25.345
Now this is the footer the way I wanted It to look like.

00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:30.325
I'm going to add icons for the languages at some point, but for now,

00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:34.600
I want to get rid of this disclaimer here at the bottom,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.570
and I can only do that in the template.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.550
This is where we're going to see this purpose of the child theme.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:48.700
And what I've told you that you can change the structure of the theme by copying

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:55.465
files from the parent theme into the child theme and changing the files there.

00:10:55.465 --> 00:11:00.280
I'm heading to FileZilla and opening the 2019 theme,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.050
which I have on my computer, otherwise,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.375
I would have to go up to my parent theme

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:09.410
on the server while I like to have it here on my computer,

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:15.110
so I can just easily copy my footer file up to the child theme.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.695
I'm going to edit that.

00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:24.115
Here it is, this is the footer Id, Colophon class site-footer.

00:11:24.115 --> 00:11:30.860
If I take a look, this disclaimer here,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.930
going to check in web tools,

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:41.730
I'm going to put this back on the right side so I can have a better view.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:51.730
This element here is the aside we've just customized,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.005
but this is the site-info and within the site-info

00:11:56.005 --> 00:12:01.875
this the class site-name and then the class imprint.

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:06.960
I think, this is what I have to remove,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.990
so div class site-info

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:19.410
and the link-imprint, class-imprint.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.320
This is where the next function starts,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.180
I'm not going to touch that one.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.560
I'm just going to delete here,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:44.530
save it on the server and take a look here in the browser, perfect.
