00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.675
In order to further customize our front page,

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:08.280
let's take a look at the sketch. Here it is.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.945
Here is the header,

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:14.880
then the content, and the footer we've just finished customizing.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.090
Remember, we've talked about the template files,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.415
the header php, and then all these templates for the content.

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:26.190
Our post was shown on the index php.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.600
Now we're using the page php because we put the reading setting as a static page for

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.630
our front page and the site element with

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.180
the widgets in this theme is integrated into the footer php.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.190
Now, how do we know that we are using the page php template for our front page?

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.715
Let's take a look in the browser.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.000
This is our WordPress installation,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.225
our dashboard, and the page that we've created.

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:59.255
We are looking at the preview and up here on the dashboard there's the edit page button.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:02.430
It doesn't say edit post, just page.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.955
Also we can check here in the source.

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:09.330
If we take a look at the body clause,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.635
it says home, page template default,

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:15.455
page, and page ID.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:20.675
Now I can be sure that I'm using one of the page php templates.

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:21.920
Usually there are several,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.635
but now we have only one.

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:26.270
It's a page php, I'm sure.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.715
When you look at our sketch,

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:32.150
you can identify that we don't have a title here.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.465
It doesn't look at all like our sketch.

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:39.095
Let's edit this in the Gutenberg editor.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:44.150
Here is the title and I can remove it like this,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.785
update, and take a look. It's gone.

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:54.820
Great. What I can do now is just continue editing this page without the title.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.030
For that, I need some images.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.040
The first block was an image with some text.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.910
I'm going to the dashboard and I'm going to upload the images I've prepared for

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.330
this website and that's here in the media button.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.695
I'm just going to say add new images, select the files.

00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:20.280
It's going to be this one,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:30.445
all these and another side open.

00:02:30.445 --> 00:02:33.510
Wonderful. Now you can wait here,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.135
I'll be back when these are uploaded.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:37.590
It's going to take awhile.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.435
Great. Our images are uploaded now we can find them here in the library.

00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:47.200
This is where your media files are all going to be organized.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.190
Month after month, you can see them in a list or in grid.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.504
Well, I'm going back to the page.

00:02:57.504 --> 00:03:03.420
Let me check here. Edit page and I'm building the first block.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.890
It's going to be combination of media and text.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:14.715
I'm going to remove this one and this one. All of them.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:19.690
Just click here on the little points, remove block.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.659
I'm creating a new one and I need media and text.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.175
I want it to be full width on the page.

00:03:32.175 --> 00:03:33.930
Here in the library,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.660
I need this photo.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.905
Select. Then I want to change

00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:48.510
the background color and here is going to be my paragraph.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.275
First is going to be a heading and it's going to be like this.

00:03:55.275 --> 00:04:01.005
I'm going to say biocomputing, something like this.

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:10.870
Then I need another buck going to be a paragraph and I just need some dummy text.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.439
Here in text generator,

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:24.915
copy, paste, and update.

00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:28.000
Let's take a look.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.440
This is our first block,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.605
an image with a paragraph and a title,

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:36.020
maybe put the title being bigger.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:44.400
But now I don't know how much is the distance between this and the header.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.540
If you remember in the sketch they're right after each other.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.370
Let me try and test it with the web inspector.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.160
I'm going to check this.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.270
It's going to be a header and I'm going to give it a background color.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:19.595
You see here there's always this gap that is supposed to be a place for the title.

00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:24.995
Now I can go and do height of the header,

00:05:24.995 --> 00:05:28.470
put it eight rem.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.315
But there's still this gap.

00:05:30.315 --> 00:05:38.170
Of course I can do some hacking and go back here in the edit page mottos and say,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:47.280
"I want this block to have a CSS class," no title like so.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.925
Then call a CSS class in the style sheet and say,

00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:58.060
put the top margin of minus five rem or something like that."

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.750
But I don't want to change this every time that

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.610
there was a responsive page or that there was a different header.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.120
I want to have a complete new template for

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.650
the front page where I don't have to worry if there is a title,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.030
if have deleted it,

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:24.670
and if I have put enough minus units on the top margin of this first paragraph.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.090
I'm not going to do that.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.650
I'm going to create a completely new template.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.705
This is how we're going to do that.

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:37.400
For demo purposes, I'm putting back in a title biocomputing,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.120
this is what this website is going to be about.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.085
Update, view page. Here it is.

00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:46.500
The title that we don't need.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.115
I'm checking in the web tools.

00:06:50.115 --> 00:06:53.150
It's not the H1, it's the header,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.265
the whole element that we don't need.

00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:57.530
It has a class entry header.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.354
I'm supposing since we are using the page php template,

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.050
let's take a look.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.470
In our FTP Client,

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.840
it's not here in our child theme.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.720
We have to go up to the 2019 parent theme.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.660
Here are all our templates.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.805
Here's the page php,

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:23.145
view in our editor and here it is.

00:07:23.145 --> 00:07:27.355
It says, "The template for displaying all single posts."

00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:33.260
Well, a page content is treated as one single post because it's not going to change,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.890
it 's not going to be a list of chronological posts,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.685
it's just this one post that is supposed to be a static site,

00:07:40.685 --> 00:07:42.655
which is not going to change.

00:07:42.655 --> 00:07:44.835
Then it's simple, get header,

00:07:44.835 --> 00:07:46.365
show me the header.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.760
Then here is the section content area,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.940
our main site content.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.375
Then the famous WordPress loop,

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:59.220
it says, While have post, the post.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.690
It means, if you have any posts or while you have any post to show,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.355
any content, then show me.

00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:08.955
Here we don't find our title,

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:11.435
we find this get template part.

00:08:11.435 --> 00:08:15.950
It means get me this part that is in the folder, template parts,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.690
sub-folder content, in the file contents slug page,

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.570
and then show the comments.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.385
But we're not going to use it on our website and

00:08:25.385 --> 00:08:28.745
this showing of the content and get the footer.

00:08:28.745 --> 00:08:33.390
That's it. This is a simple page template.
