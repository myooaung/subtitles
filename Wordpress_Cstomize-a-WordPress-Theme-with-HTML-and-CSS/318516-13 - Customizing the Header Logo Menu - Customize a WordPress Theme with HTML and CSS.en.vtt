00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.485
To customize our header,

00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:03.040
we of course need a logo here.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.940
I have prepared a little demo here of the default logo for this theme.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.120
I'm going to customize a site identity and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.720
here I'm going to select a logo from the media library.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.664
I've uploaded an image where they're found as a template on the Internet,

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:21.420
and I'm going to select it.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.080
It says here, "Crop image, " publish,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.245
close the customizer, and this is the entire logo for the 2019 theme.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:35.070
As I understood, the theme has an emphasis on text and writing,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.020
so, it's great for journalists, bloggers,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.865
and authors, but for my website and the branding purposes,

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:43.210
I really need a bigger logo.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.950
I'm going back to the customizer to remove this one,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
remove logo, publish again,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:59.365
and then I'm heading to the media library to add new file, my SVG logo.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:06.830
I like SVG, it's vectorized file and it doesn't lose quality while scaling,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.050
but WordPress doesn't like it here.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.535
It says, it's not permitted for security reasons,

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:18.109
which is great because someone is taking care of file security in WordPress,

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.930
but then it means that I am going to have to use in a plugin,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.700
and I found one which is called SVG support.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.430
Here it is. Going to install it and activate.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.410
Going to the settings,

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.035
if I take a look,

00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:40.715
I'm not going to change anything.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:43.430
It says, "Restrict to administrators," which is good,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.390
only I am allowed to deal with SVGs and upload them, so, that's it.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.360
I'm going back to the media library,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.995
and adding again my SVG logo,

00:01:55.995 --> 00:02:00.465
open, and here it is, it worked.

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:08.430
This is good. Going back to the customizer, site identity,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.155
select "Logo", here it is, select,

00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:14.880
and it says, "Crop image,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.760
" but it says,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.410
"There has been an error.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.465
We don't like it still."

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:29.090
Well, I have looked for the reason for this and have found that in the 2019 parent theme,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.475
in the functions PHP file,

00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:38.245
there is a function considering this custom logo,

00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:41.510
I'm going to find it here, custom logo.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.750
It says, "The height is 190 pixels,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.259
the width is 190 pixels," so, it's a square,

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.995
and then there is Flex width set to false,

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:54.780
there is no flexible width,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.760
and there is no flexible height,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.950
so, I have to change this.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.550
I have looked through the WordPress org forums and found in the codecs,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.635
there is this code here which I'm going to copy,

00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:16.895
and I have put it as an answer to many questions of customizing the 2019 logo, so,

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:23.115
I'm heading to my functions PHP file in the child theme here,

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:28.875
and I'm going to add this code and adapt it to my theme.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:34.580
So here under this enqueue WP child theme function,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.010
which ends here with these brackets,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.420
I'm going to paste this function and then change the name,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.555
I'm going to call it L-yaks custom logo,

00:03:46.555 --> 00:03:54.900
and it's going to be 100 pixels high and 400 pixels wide.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:03.780
The flexible width is set to true and I want also the flexible height to be set to true.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.650
Like so, and that's it.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.405
I believe I'm going to delete this.

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:17.815
Oh, I have to change this here, of course.

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:25.030
It's my L-yaks custom logo function.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.040
Prefix, yes, I think that's it.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.070
I'm going to save this and upload it to the server,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.170
and take a look here.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.070
Again, customize, site identities, select "Logo",

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.115
"SVG file", and I'm just going to skip cropping.

00:04:50.115 --> 00:04:55.380
That's it, publish, close, and here we are.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.830
We have this tiny little logo here that is not at all what we need.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.350
We also have the site title that I don't want to appear here.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.180
But now you know how we are going to change this.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.565
We're going to head to the style CSS file and adapt the header to our needs.

00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:18.020
We just needed to create the possibility of

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.880
a flexible size of the logo in our functions PHP.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.420
So see you in a bit in our style CSS.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.405
Just quick before we dive into our style sheet,

00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:32.360
there's one essential structural element that is missing.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.100
Its our menu here.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:41.700
I'm going here to menus and giving my menu a name.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.130
I'm going to call it top menu.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.805
It's going to be on top of a page, create menu.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.375
It's going to be a primary menu.

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:51.270
Save it.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.130
Then I'm going to add all of these pages that I have created as

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.250
place holders to the menu here,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.935
and then just drag and drop them in the order that I want them to be in the menus.

00:06:06.935 --> 00:06:09.110
This is coming here,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.650
like so, and save menu,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.310
take a look, it's here.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.449
It's taking over the styling of the links,

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.605
but we want it to be here on the right side and to have smaller typography.

00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:30.745
So I'm going to open my web tools and take a look.

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:34.495
This is the nav ID site navigation.

00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:39.425
I'm going to edit as HTML copy this,

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:41.320
put it in my style sheet.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:50.835
I have to create a new chapter here called headers styling and paste this ID,

00:06:50.835 --> 00:06:59.030
and say, I want you to float right and I also want you

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.135
to have a font size

00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:11.195
of 0.7 RM, save.

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:16.210
Of course, on the server too return back to the browser.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.860
Checking this and something happened here.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.630
We have the right typography,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.290
but we don't want this minimized menu here.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.755
This is for the mobile site and just in a minute,

00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:32.020
I'm going to explain you what happened.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:42.085
So next, I want to remove the site title here and copying this class site title,

00:07:42.085 --> 00:07:44.110
going to my style sheet,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.145
adding it here and saying class site typo.

00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:52.390
Please display none.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:08:00.955
Save and check.

00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:03.265
It's gone and now we have

00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:09.920
our tinny tiny round logo that is absolutely not doing its job for our website.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.840
Let me check it's the site logo here.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.420
Yes, this is the positioning of the div.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:27.700
Inside the div is the link which has border radius transition box shadow all of this,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.455
I'm just going to copy it,

00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:31.810
put it in my style sheet,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:37.480
and say, I want the border radius to be zero.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.225
Okay, this is fine.

00:08:40.225 --> 00:08:50.650
I don't want any box shadows and so displays block and width and height.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.760
I don't think there's 50 pixel is going to be fine.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.580
Transition, please none.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.755
Save and check what we've done.

00:09:05.755 --> 00:09:09.685
Here. It is teeny-tiny and of course the hover state,

00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:11.785
I have to change that one as well.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.630
Here in the inspector,

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:18.010
I'm going to take a look at the hover state

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:25.330
here and it says site logo has a box shadow black.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.055
It also has a border,

00:09:27.055 --> 00:09:30.040
the yellow border that we have on all the links on our page.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.040
So I have to change it in my style sheet here.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:40.579
I'm going to say to paste this here and say box shadow none,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:52.280
transition none and border color has to be transparent.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:59.515
But this is an important rule because it's a general rule for all the links.

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.675
This has to be more specific.

00:10:01.675 --> 00:10:06.595
Save on the server and

00:10:06.595 --> 00:10:12.250
checking the browser and the hover state, is now gone.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:17.635
This is good. We just now have to deal with the size of this logos.

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:21.080
If I put here,

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.330
just check this is 50 pixels.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.840
If I put 400.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.000
Then the logo is gone and this is because the position

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.595
of this site logo div is way back to the right.

00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:44.905
So I have to say auto and yes,

00:10:44.905 --> 00:10:49.030
the height also has to be changed.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.645
It's going to be 100 pixels.

00:10:52.645 --> 00:10:58.510
Yes, and the position has to change of course too. I'm not going to do that.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.295
This is way too big.

00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:04.915
So I'm going to the style sheets and saying the style sheet,

00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:13.370
I need maybe 80 percent of this width, height.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:23.590
So and if I take a look,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.240
the logo is gone,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.975
so I have to change this site logo position,

00:11:31.975 --> 00:11:37.300
and then also what's important here is that the business is a media query for

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:43.105
big screens that are everything that is above 768 pixels.

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:48.130
I have to take care of that too and here,

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.230
I'm going to copy this.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:12:00.500
I'm going to say right auto and important,

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:09.950
but also I have to add the media query

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:28.475
and min-width is 768 pixels.

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:33.960
Yes then, and I need some brackets here and here

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:40.255
save and check and here's is our logo.

00:12:40.255 --> 00:12:46.060
Now, we only need to position this in the right position with padding and

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:52.930
margin and I also have to change the color of this header,

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.170
that this is the header, ID masthead.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.900
I'm just going to copy this.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.550
Put it in the style sheet.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:16.465
It's an ID and I think the background color,

00:13:16.465 --> 00:13:19.780
I have written it down here on note.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:29.110
Background color is 353942.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.730
I have styled this a little bit further.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.850
So for the header, I have increased the height here,

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.690
not only changed the color and for the navigation, which is only a button.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.600
Now, I have also changed the margin top,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.645
so it's more enlightened with the logo.

00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:48.895
And there are no limits for the CSS styling in your style sheet.

00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:52.390
I just wanted to show you which function in the functions file

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.995
is responsible for displaying the size of this logo,

00:13:56.995 --> 00:14:01.629
and then we've changed a bit the CSS to remove the radius,

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:07.270
removed the borders, and the position so that we can show that entire logo.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.100
Here now we're heading to see what happened with the navigation.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.040
I've started also a little bit for the mobile version.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.670
But what I wanted to show you is actually a little trick.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:24.830
I was going crazy over this display of the button on

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:31.190
the desktop version on big screens and I went through entire word pristine files.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:37.310
What I've found is actually the here in 2019 itself in JavaScript files,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.235
there is a file called priority menu JS.

00:14:41.235 --> 00:14:43.790
When I took a look inside to see

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.630
which function is actually playing with this navigation menu,

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:53.875
found out that there is a typo and it says navivation instead of navigation.

00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:57.160
Now, I don't know if this was purposeful name.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.435
I just checked it out,

00:14:59.435 --> 00:15:04.700
applauded the corrected version and now you

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:10.940
see if I refresh our main navigation menu is here.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.109
So that was basically it we have finished the rod,

00:15:15.109 --> 00:15:19.550
the first creation or customization of the 2019

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.290
to make it look like the theme we're supposed to work on and now of course,

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:29.915
the little details are going to happen making the topography images nice, etcetera.

00:15:29.915 --> 00:15:31.260
There are no limits to that.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:36.635
I just wanted to show you how to work with the functions files,

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.570
with the template files,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:46.229
with the CSS to create the theme that you would want to have for your website.
