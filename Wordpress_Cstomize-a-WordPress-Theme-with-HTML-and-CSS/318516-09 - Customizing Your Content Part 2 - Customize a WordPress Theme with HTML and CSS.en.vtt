00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.815
What are we going to do now?

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:07.485
We are getting this template part back in our FTP Client.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:13.395
Here is the folder template parts and here is the content.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:15.645
In this content it says,

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.215
this is for showing the excerpt.

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:22.055
This is for the case we don't have any content on this page.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:27.960
This is the content page that is interesting to us for our page php.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.975
This is the content of a single post,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.775
one single article that we've written,

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:35.880
and this is the general content.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.050
This is, for example,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.910
if we have 20 posts,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.370
it's going to show 20 posts.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.495
Let's take a look at this content page that's so interesting to us.

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:51.475
We are hunting the header and here it is.

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:57.015
It says here template part for displaying page content in page php.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:04.215
This means content page php is a small module of the page php.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:10.425
It's like a small lego part of this whole page house that we are building with legos.

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:13.500
Here is the header that we don't need.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.220
I'm not going to delete it here because I'm then going to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
ruin it for the other pages that want to have a header.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.555
I'm going to just copy this.

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:30.930
For that I'm creating here a new file and calling it one.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.270
I'm not very imaginative with this.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.420
I'm just copying and expanding.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.870
Then I'm going to open it and here it is, empty.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.965
Now, I can just calmly select all of this,

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.870
copy, and put it in here.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.760
It's basically the same content page,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.785
just content page 1.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.365
I don't need this header here.

00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:06.865
That's why I'm going to remove it.

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:12.264
Save. We have changed this little tiny module,

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:15.575
close it and go back here,

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:18.030
confirm that we've created it.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.400
Now we have this little tiny module that we've created for

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.790
the pages that don't have this title,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.010
this header with the title in it.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:35.055
Now we have to go back to this page php and create a copy of it.

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:41.935
I'm dragging this page down onto my computer to save it and to have it to work with.

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:49.420
I'm opening it in my editor and creating a completely new file,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.455
which is going to be our new custom page template for the pages without a title.

00:02:56.455 --> 00:03:01.615
The only thing I need for that is a comment

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:08.250
which says template name.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.400
I'm going to call this page, no title page.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.790
Sorry, typo as usual.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.570
Close the comment and close the brackets.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.585
Now, I'm going to save this here and call it no title page,

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:35.230
for now, we might change that afterwards.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.520
I'm also saving it here and the only thing I have to do

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.280
now is copy all of this from the page,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.420
copy, and put it in here like so.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.070
Now because here is the closing brackets,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.480
I have to delete it here and now I have this template.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:13.370
But it's going to the content page and I just need the content page 1, like so.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.715
I'm going to close all of this and just upload the,

00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:22.815
sorry, I have to refresh here.

00:04:22.815 --> 00:04:25.155
The no title page,

00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:30.250
just have to upload it here into my chart theme.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:39.640
I just want to check one more thing here with the template,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.935
page 1 that is has a content.

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:51.265
Yes, it does. Now let's see what happened in the browser.

00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:55.760
Whoops. This is our page. Let's refresh.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.445
Now you can see here in the page attributes we have a template to choose from.

00:05:02.445 --> 00:05:04.750
The second one is the one we created.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.400
It's called No Title Page.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.845
If I update here and view the page,

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:14.860
wow, I have it now without the title.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.100
That's wonderful. This is how you create

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.960
a custom page template and upload it to your chart theme.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.240
You just have to take care of the template parts that you need to

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.855
change if they're in your code of the default page php file.

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:36.710
Now let's build some blocks.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.745
I'll click here on edit page and don't mind this ad title.

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:43.735
It's just there. I can't remove it for now.

00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:46.240
I suppose that the dashboard and the editor have

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.520
their separate CSS style sheets and I'm not going to be bothered by that now.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.665
I just need a new block which is going to be heading,

00:05:54.665 --> 00:06:03.550
products, and then it's going to be centered and updates.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.010
Then I need a new block with three columns.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.890
I have created the columns block and I'll have to

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.850
select it here and increase the number of columns to three.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.115
I also want it to be the full width over the page.

00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:23.590
I've prepared some text here,

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.420
just going to copy it.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:36.450
Copy and paste and then I need an image.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.035
Here, no, here.

00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:44.645
It's a bit difficult to select blocks in this Gutenberg editor.

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:47.650
I hope they're going to come up with some optimization.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.470
But for now, I just put an image here and you see it

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.180
inserted the image above the paragraph and I need it below.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.700
I click on this arrow.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.330
I'm going to choose one from the media library.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.725
They're not pretty, but they're just doing fine for the demo purposes,

00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:15.690
add the caption, copy and paste.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:22.690
You can see here that I can link an image to a media file,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.755
another media file and an attachment page and a custom URL.

00:07:27.755 --> 00:07:32.110
Of course, I can always add an extra CSS class,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.110
but I'm just going to leave this like so and

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:41.560
then continue to do for the next block as well.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.470
I'll see you when we're finished with this block.
