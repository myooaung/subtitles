00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
First of all, I want to change the typography.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.630
I have already looked for the font before.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.395
It's called Source Sans Pro.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.555
I liked it for this project.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:19.470
I'm going to select it here and choose the styles that I need;

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.630
the regular, the Italic, and the bold.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.215
When I look here,

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:32.430
I'm going to need this link in my function's PHP files

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.440
because we're going to change the fonts via functions PHP as style link.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.305
After copying this link to the fonts that we've chosen,

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:54.235
I'm heading to file dealer to open the 2019 child folder and edit the functions PHP file,

00:00:54.235 --> 00:00:57.560
because in the newer version of WordPress,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.190
the styles are on queued into the theme.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.275
They are not put in as a link,

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:06.990
but on queued into the function file.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.800
Here, you see that the parent-css file is built into the theme,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.620
and here's the child-css file.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.250
If we write anything here in the child-css,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.475
it's going to overwrite the parent-css.

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:26.300
The same goes for the child JavaScript file.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.990
If we have custom JavaScript in our child theme,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.605
it's going to overwrite the one of the parent theme.

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:38.525
So here I'm just going to paste the link from Google fonts and then

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:44.405
copy this WP on key style function here,

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:54.240
and name my function child-googlefonts,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.020
make a comma and then paste this reference to

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:09.185
the CSS of this font here inside and put a semicolon here,

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:13.225
and of course delete this link.

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:17.105
I'm just going to put a little comment here.

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:20.105
Add Googlefonts.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:25.250
So that I know what I have changed in case something doesn't work.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.110
I'm going to save this, and yes, confirm.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.530
Now, let's see if anything has changed on our site.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.735
No, it hasn't.

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:46.445
The reason is because if we use the Web Inspector from Firefox,

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:56.660
we're going to see that this h1 still has the font family does is in the parent theme.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.910
So we have to overwrite this in our child-css file.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.860
So let's do that now.
