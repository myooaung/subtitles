00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.490
Hey there.

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.140
Thanks for choosing my pores on CTK.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.770
I have to send the course in a completely interactive manner with all the necessary court

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.850
for you to follow.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.700
Be along in those chapters on the cold is all committed in get up so you can go ahead and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.370
flown them.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.350
Have access to the court anytime.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.220
On if any of you is comfortable with good on,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.750
you can make a pull request so that if there's a typo our there's a mistake.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.140
Then you can send me that really pulled request.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.390
I much them on.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.740
Everybody can learn from it.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.820
So now and let me quickly go ahead and show you how you can get the call for a particular

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.190
chapter that you are going to do.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.020
A temple on the court that we're talking about is in this report country.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.600
If that is going to be another importantly,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.680
then I'll add them in their resources section off their cell course so you can go ahead and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.560
get that you are.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.880
And if you're not familiar with the get you have something called us,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.950
it releases on their races,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.680
you will have all the decks that are we're talking about difficult here and take on the tax

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.750
section on all the comments out there.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.210
If you're not familiar with to get,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.780
you could go ahead and don't know the terrifying.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.150
Also that false are possible.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.720
I'm going to show you a simple mechanism by which you can clone the comet for a particular

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.650
chapter on follow the demo.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.570
So the simple way to come flown a particular branch or attack name is this is the command

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.050
you can use.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.230
Git,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.600
clone,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.670
heifer knife and branch.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.690
And then the tag name followed by the airport.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.230
You are.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.960
So if we go back to our repositories here on the throne or don't know you're you have both

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.000
the SS that your asshole s the city s your let us say we want toe check out the court,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.340
which is talking about the tagging,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.250
all their sources.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.000
So this is attack we're talking about.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.190
We need toe check out this particular chord for this chapter.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.490
So we have to do is let us go to our terminal.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.030
So I'm just going to say,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.760
get clone hyphen hyphen branch followed by the branch name brand name.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.450
Followed by that you are So I say informed earlier,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.650
you can find you are here.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.090
I'm taking the SS that your if you want,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.950
you can go ahead and choose the Hester TVs.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.960
You are also so this support it is going to be locally cloned.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.830
So let me switch to that directory on.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.080
If you are using which usually go like me when all your just type court dark,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.660
they will automatically open me the directly in visual studio code on here.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.070
I will have the necessary cold for trying out this table in this particular chapter.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.120
We're talking about attacking the resources in.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.540
Usually you can see here there's a corridor tag or add on and there's a golden time,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.770
but you can go ahead and check on any off these tags on broil doors.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.240
Appropriate the chapters when you're practicing death,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.800
I won't name them all in and Judy Way.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.720

I will go ahead and fix them for you.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.810
