00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.280
Hello,

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.890
folks,

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.130
Welcome back to another lecture on City game.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.860
So far,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.860
we have been seeing have to launch an 82 instance on.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.830
We went ahead and added some permissions to the seat of instance so it can pick up some

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.460
plants from history or bootstrapping it with some Web confrontations,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.060
like installing,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.480
infested,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.140
piece of.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.240
But in order,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.340
this configurations.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.750
One thing that was constant was the air my i d.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.690
We had the air,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.850
my i d hard coded in glower stack,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700
in my opinion,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.040
Asian a white hart cutting values whenever it is possible.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.690
But even putting in the context while has the disadvantage that we know that the new

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.970
packages are released,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.790
then you're my idea gets updated on.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.350
You need to go over that change your got X twice and really brought your staff.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.540
What if you can't animate you?

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.960
Pick the latest washing of your air.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.020
My Apply your patches in one time.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.890
That is what we're going to see on.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.430
Moreover,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.850
if you're a my ideas heart quarter it is.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.170
The stack is going to be born to a particular region because it,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.520
when ideas are tied into a region,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.010
are otherwise you need to write the stack,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.820
then find out what is the region that appropriately pick up the air.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.160
My ideas from your stack So don't want all this problems.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.930
I'm going to show you a simple mechanism off picking the latest every ID's on any region,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.110
the stackers running.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.050
Let this go ahead and do that now.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.460
So this is a stack that we have been playing around with.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.430
So we're going to make a couple of modifications.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.230
The first thing,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.610
sir,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.830
Picking up the latest air,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.850
My four line X.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.180
So Amazon has pre but in classes for that aspirin.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.900
So the first thing is here we have had heart quality and value.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.390
So what I'm going to do is just going to come in this so we can reuse the value.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.500
So in submission image with the value,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.740
what,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.270
and when it does,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.660
I'm just going to have a variable so that we can pass on the image and video here.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.710
So let us say I want to run on Amazon clinics and my i d here.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.740
So I'm just going to say Mannix,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.750
am I so that the same boost would come on here,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.780
So let us pick up the value of dynamic,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.250
you know.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.520
So here you have few options off accusing your air might.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.860
So all the options are under the issue.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.660
Two concepts over the school head and add that are easy to construct.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.260
You have machine image.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.490
So once they come here,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.040
you can see a hughesmen option off genetic line,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.590
a line explosion or a genetic toast Question.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.550
Or I can go with the latest Western off Amazon landings.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.160
Also,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.410
if you notice it that there is no latest for attacked or Centaurus because those concepts

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.430
are different for Windows,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.010
there is a rebuilding license.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.070
So Amazon has backed up a few years myself with the sq and all those six.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.380
So first thing is,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.960
I'm going to show you how you can do on Amazon Lennox.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.650
Then I'll show you how to do the big question also.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.890
So here we are going to say lettuce,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.900
Amazon Lennox.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.990
On Inside this,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.170
we have a few options of customizing or machine.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.730
For example,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.250
if you want a toe standard edition are there is a slim version of Amazon lending service

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.850
available,

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.410
or do you want to run and a better way to rise the machine off hardware which applies to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.820
machine.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.240
So the first thing is John vision that are too available versions right now for Amazon like

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.650
next.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.540
So wait,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.870
the truth.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.250
The latest one once again.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.030
So I'm going to say Amazon landings generation on Dhere.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.530
You see here that I do washing,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.140
so I'm just going to choose the latest one.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.670
So that is the generation that is the latest.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.820
Am I for question two of Amazon landings on edits And this is a slim version or the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.930
standard of volition.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.050
So I'm going to shoes here.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.290
An exhibition,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.890
as is you feel there's a minimal and standard soldiers go have juice,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.110
a standard on what they have started.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.060
We want whether we want to run it in a formal instance,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.560
or do you want to run it in a GPS falling?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.950
The devious volume is quite often director under function,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.990
so I'm going to choose that one now.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.510
So you have your storage on def juice here,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.840
that is Ngentle Progress and CBS.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.150
If you want to go ahead and do general purpose also,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.890
there is nothing wrong with doing that.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.390
So let us shoot BBS on which realization is what I was talking about.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.400
If you want to do a better,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.060
which delays for some reason,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.560
I will recommend it.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.900
But if you still wanted to let it,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.100
that is also possible.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.790
So under what do you have to even values when it's a hardware which lies in battle?

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.220
What your life?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.050
So just go for hard work place.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.880
So now we got on our parameters for our land ex machine.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.370
So,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.490
as I said earlier,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.150
just in case if we want a luncheon Windows machine,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.480
so let us start with easy to construct here on that easy to contact.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.270
I just get to mission image on the letters to latest Windows on the latest windows.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.140
We have something called us and question.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.340
We don't have the same options like it's enriched.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.790
In addition,

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.650
but we have something called a situation.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.030
You can go ahead on import our Windows question so you can see here there's a different

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.050
divisions are available.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.620
Windows question when I do it out here,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.390
it was going to list out all the different year my summer sun is provided along with the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.670
appropriate licenses so you can see here's all of them are language back,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.880
but also their Some of them are with service packs on some of them with the different

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.330
languages.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.580
Also,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.200
for example,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.530
this one if I'm not wrong,

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.050
is for Japanese.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.400
So likewise if I scrawled on on the way,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.360
that would be some.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.770
Ask yourself for someone so available and different.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.550
I am I said,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.770
also available So you are free to choose whichever original windows you want lunch on.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.150
All you need to do is go ahead and change is valued.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.740
Toe does,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.180
am I?

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.400
And you should be able to find that instance So everything is good means let us go ahead on

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.850
synthesizer stack.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.350
So it just do that on Let me start typing the deploy command as well.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.190
So what?

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.630
This is getting benefit is goto our,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.890
um aws console and see if everything is getting ready there.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.670
So have for now that no instances that does get to her confirmation on great for or stack

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:53.810
to get completed here.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.890
So it's already building the BBC.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.370
We should see on so over running with the latest air.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.820
My so right now I'm in Virginia region on what I will do is I'll go ahead and deployed in

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.300
Ohio.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.290
Reason as well,

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.000
but we need to do is if your own were.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.740
If I goto my Abdul to people,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.580
I find you haven't region valuable sqs east.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.760
So if you change your here to us West or I can do here,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.750
is Carla's environment broad use tough environment brought again boot camp or something

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.160
like online my Virginia?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.120
And then I could create another deployment for,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.860
in my mind,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.110
Ohio or so.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.590
So that way I can just go ahead and deploy the stack in another region on the stack was

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.920
going to pick up the latest Am I from Amazon's list,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.070
and then it is going to launch it without any,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.910
uh,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.150
hi putting of values from my side.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.350
So let us get back here on the weight.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.750
One of the seven gets booted,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.280
so we got our staff creation completely.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.650
Just code.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.230
Or is it'll?

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.050
Instance we should be able to see a new instance here.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.040
It should be running the latest version of the Air Minds for you.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.450
Remember we were watching and Web server.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.830
So if a copy news and then put it to my approach that I should be able to see the

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.060
whatsoever coming online.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.060
You can see here,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.990
let's go ahead and see if we can deploy the same stack in the Ohio region also without any

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.150
modifications other than changing the region.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.770
So here what I'm going to lose,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.510
I'm just going to say U s speech to and then I'm going to save it on.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.490
Then let us toe syndicate ls so now that nothing has been changed except for the region,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.050
and I'm going to deploy it.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.660
So it's asking me permissions because the entire stack is getting billed for the Ohio

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.140
region,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.180
so that has head toe horrible,

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.720
higher region.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.620
So here's the confirmation servers,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.950
so we just cool toe Ohio,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.250
so you should see a new stack here on.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.980
Likewise,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:53.390
if I go to my easy to instant service in Ohio and Nusa instance will get built,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.210
and then it will get deployed or the Medicare so you can see here report to sometime back

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.940
to test the stack.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.820
It's working or not.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.050
This was the previous one,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.510
so you can see here my Web servers complete,

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.610
so let's go ahead and see what the new servers running you can see here That's a new server

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.050
running.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.690
Likewise,

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.610
if I take this I purpose and put it in the brochure,

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:12.450
Richard Workers.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.070
So basically what we have done is we have shown how to pick up the latest air,

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:22.750
my deployed at observer in different regions with just the modification off the region.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.840
Go ahead and try it in your own accounts.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.970
If you have any problems,

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.370
put them in the comments or questions.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.750
I'm happy to help them to you.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.750
Thanks for watching Happy learning.
