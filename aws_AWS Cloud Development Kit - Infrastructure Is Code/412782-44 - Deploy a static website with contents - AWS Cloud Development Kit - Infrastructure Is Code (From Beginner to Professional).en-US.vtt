00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
Hello,

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.920
folks.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.760
Welcome to another lecture on City.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.270
So far we have seen a lot of resources being put with the city care.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.170
We're seeing how to create an s three bucket created the visit of instances.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.780
We have created load balancers.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.960
It is time to start building some applications using syndicate and see the real power off

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.450
Medicare.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.400
The first indication that we're going to try and bird is going to be in static website

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.540
which is going to be hosted on as three service and it will have some flights on assets

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.910
Enforce.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.130
It s three on.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.050
We will have some public privileges enabled so that anybody in the world got access our

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.000
static upside.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.750
We have chosen this example so that it is an easy ramp up for the examples that is going to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.190
come back at the later stages on,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.130
we will start increasing the complexity in each and every level.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.970
So they just go ahead and see how we can build our static website and see the day.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.150
This is the fact that we're going to use I have named My stack has deploys that excites

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.120
stack on African see year.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.480
There are no resources that have been built Just imported the extreme.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.080
Or you'll if you're not imported or install it in your project repository.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.190
Go ahead and do that and make sure it is added Any requirements?

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.300
So when you're deploying it,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.730
you know what mornings are required on when you're talking about static website,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.830
we need two things.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.880
One is An s three pocket which can hold our assets like his email files.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.010
And CS is on then the actual assets itself.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.470
So what?

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.400
I'm going to show you now a status.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.470
Go ahead and create a bucket with the necessary privileges on the configurations for

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.640
aesthetic sight on.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.880
Then we will also go ahead and deploy our content also which can be in a local repository

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.440
or it can be in a supply or it can be from another location also.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.350
So they just stack building our three bucket first.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.310
I'm going to lose.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.060
That s three more.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.710
You in hell.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.610
Let us a scope it on once your school pick.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.790
Well,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.490
it has provided the bucket I d on.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.740
Let us make sure or bucket discussions so that we can roll back.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.660
If there is something going wrong on we want this pocket to be accessible to the public.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.380
So I'm adding it as a public read.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.190
Access on what is going to be my foot level document whenever somebody hitting my domain

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.410
name off my static site.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.870
What find I shouldn't be serving them.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.720
So I'm going to call that file as index darkest email on what if that is,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.410
find that it's not available in my sight.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.270
Then I need to sell them an error page.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.460
So let us configure our error document as well on I'm going to call this as for run for

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.990
about Hasty in.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.750
But you can go ahead and change it toe every wrote his semen or something like a redirect.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.850
History will also on dream or policy quite off when I do a lot off them all.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.040
So I ensure that I removed.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.570
My friend asserts our assets that are not required about the vineyard late in production or

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.200
any other environment you will want to choose retain instead of destroying.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.600
So since this is a demo,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.930
I'm just going to use it as distraught here.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.350
So my bucket has been created Now,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.760
Now the next thing is for deploying static website I need some assets.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.930
Like,

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:56.430
for example,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.460
this index short history will at this for more for your testimony about is that coming from

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.400
so in the project Reportedly what have done is created on direct record static assets under

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.340
that created some sample testable files and sample for not for flights.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.100
You can go ahead and create your own files if you are comfortable and doing his team.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.580
If not,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.250
take the samples and use them.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.340
So how do I go ahead and carpenters,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.750
which is in my laptop and do my estate market?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.720
So for that,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.040
there is another model call S s three deployment on that We can go ahead and add it to our

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.070
project report city and use that.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.650
So let us start with that.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.250
It's called deployment to save it.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.150
I'm now going to install it.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:48.040
So I finished installation that has close this one that is imported here.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:58.290
So now we have imported it like this school where and assets.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.450
So let's go ahead and begin.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.060
I use that every deployment morning that we just know created on under this we have

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.850
something called as bucket deployment on.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.110
Did you notice that that that is an error here.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.350
I just mentioned it as s each of history so that it's right.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.290
It's not prompting,

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.750
so I'm just going to fix that.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:28.140
So now we should get a prompt for bucket deployment and let their school and score pick.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.090
First on,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.480
that is my content is going to come from That is what I'm going to show here on.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.080
As they said,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.200
that content can be coming from different places.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.350
That is why it is an r a Andi.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.170
Within this today,

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.270
we're going toe shoes.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.500
1st 1 is going to be s three deployment dot source.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.000
I said it is billed it,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.350
and my asset is going to from from the full.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.070
But on you can see here it is under a glance use cases and static assets.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.510
So that's what I'm going to add here.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.520
Just going toe act a fool.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.950
But here that is done on way.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.840
Want to copy this?

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.990
So I'm going to say which is my destination.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.980
You can see here there's a destination bucket.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.550
This is the bucket where I want to copy my assets school.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.930
So,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.090
like they say this and I'm going to synthesize my stag like me.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.870
Just keep it here.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.930
So this goal heard I'm deployed our static site So you can see here What this basically

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.790
does is it is going to zip up my static assets.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.980
Why?

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:34.960
It is going to create a perfect It is going toe uploaded it to my syndicate wounded bucket

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.860
on from that toolkit pocket it will deploy Tinto my target pocket as well.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.690
On when we goto.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.660
Before doing this,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.920
when we go and see our cloud formations,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.410
you'll see it.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.120
There is an lambda function which is a creator toe.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.240
Do this copying activity from one place to another place because you until the market is

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.060
created you cannot copy some flights only that buckets creation you need to copy and broke

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.680
formation itself needs a custom resource to do that.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.790
So all that activity of creating the customer first copying the files and deploying it to

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.910
stand for you by Siddiqui Automaticity.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.450
So let's go ahead and check out in our cloud formation console.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:19.130
You can see this create in progress on if I go to my resources section that is in a market

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.590
that has been already created.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.310
I opened the extra point.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:29.150
So letters on one more thing that I wanted to mention on the beginning off the demo is you

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.800
need to have this privilege is if you have,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.450
ah,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.210
block access completely on for all four off them.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.580
You will not be able to do this demo because we're going to provision some buckets with

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.880
public access on it will keep trailing if you don't have the necessary privileges.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.440
If you configure it in the way that I am shown here,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.030
for example,

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.060
on court of force to and off for the last two,

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.050
then you should be able to do this demo on your own account.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.980
Or you can go ahead and find unit as you needed for your environment if you're sure of what

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.740
you are doing it.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.910
So now that is,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.750
uh,

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.870
set aside so we know what privileges need to be given.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.500
So very have five buckets here on you can see it gives me a warning saying that there are

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.050
one bucket which is having public access.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.950
So just go inside this bucket on,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.050
you can see other assets copied on My permissions are also said.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.260
That means that my stack must have completed you can see the stackers completed.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.410
If I go to my resources,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.100
assumes the and Lambda Function here,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.810
let me just just drink it here.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.470
You can see this is the land a function that is doing the functionality of copying the

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:42.050
poured from your environment to your target bucket.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.610
I would highly recommend you to see how this lambda function is structured so you can learn

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.080
from this custom referred that has been built into your star formation.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.830
So anyway,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.180
coming back door static bucket If I goto my property section,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.140
you can see here static upset has been configured on my index showed a similar is

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.120
configured my other pages got one figure.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.060
So I'm just going to cooperate,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.780
Issuer and put it into my brother.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:10.240
So if everything is set correctly,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.020
I should be able to get this page.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.490
Andi,

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.150
I should be able to navigate this.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.270
So if I go ahead and try something like something dot html,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:23.150
I should be getting the other page like here because we have configured our error page on

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.300
Enterprise has been rendered.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:24.410
What?

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.900
Our something You smarter there.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:31.360
That is how simple it is to create and static website using Siddiqi on deployed also with

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.010
silicate,

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.490
Go ahead and try it out in your own account and show the world your latest,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.720
a new shiny website quoted from every thanks for watching Happy learning.
