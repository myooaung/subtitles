00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
Hello,

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.880
folks,

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.780
welcome back to another lecture on city game.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.600
This time we're going to talk about logs whenever you're running an application,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.560
whether it is an easy to or elastic beanstalk are in laptop functions or containers.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.410
Then you would collect some logs to understand how the application is performing,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.340
how your users are interacting with your application or when something goes wrong.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.650
You want to be but application to understand the root cause off it.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.860
So in those cases,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.500
you want to centralize the logs,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.480
manage those logs on do some housekeeping on,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.840
said some archival policies.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.670
Our house,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.780
um,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.080
an addiction top off them to understand what is happening in your environment.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.520
So that is word cloudwatch locker rooms off.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.970
First you natively on.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.050
Let us go over and see how we can build this girl was law groups in your stack so that the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.470
stack would manage the law group.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.100
Whenever the stock is getting deleted,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.140
your little should also get deleted.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.680
Basically,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.490
everything that is new environment should be driven by code or,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.170
in other words,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.420
acidic a stack or for formation stack.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.240
So I'm going to show you how you can create your own law groups and attach it to a Lambda.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.190
Functions are easy to instance.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.960
This is attack that we're going to use for creating or law groups,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.050
as you can see here right now,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.340
that is,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.560
and I'm the function on for this number function by default.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.190
City is going to create a law group on through all the information there.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.430
But when you delete the stack,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580
that law group will still be there in quantity,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.060
does not get cleaned up,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.630
or the retention is also said to toe default off unlimited time.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.710
The law group will be there,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.680
so it is going to incur some costs as well.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.310
So in those cases off,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.590
how do you manage them?

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.210
One recommendation is go ahead and create the law group in your stack itself on attracted

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.560
to allow the function so that whenever the stackers updated or deleted that outlook,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.850
the cultural gets directed.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.350
So the first step off creating a law group is going ahead,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.460
and installing those packages on Daz always gotta requirements and add it there so that you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.450
don't forget it.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.630
So now my law group is installed,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.700
I'm going to import it into my stack,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.590
got my love group imported that the school head,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.950
and but it usually glove lambda functions have on a format off slash aws slash lambda slash

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.750
function name.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.970
This is how Lamba Logs has stolen.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.340
So what we're gonna do is we're going to create a locker room which is going to have the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.550
same function so that they start building our law group name.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.210
I'm going to call.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.010
This is Constant.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.910
No group on.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.090
We're going to use the newly imported construct on under this.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.940
We have something called a small group on scope it yourself and said then I d So we have

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.560
set a 90.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.990
Then we're going to set the lock route.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.290
Name me,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.970
Mr come on.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.240
Here.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.360
So that is why it is not auto populating.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.620
So let us go hell itself.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.750
A group name on here is where we're going to construct a lot Brooke name,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.370
which is going to take this format.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.310
So aws underscore slash lambda slash on We want dysfunction name.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.920
So I'm just going to take this on board it here and you will have the access to the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.810
function name.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.370
So then let me closest braces.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.440
So we have slash aws slash time that brownstone.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.450
So now what happens to my law group and my stack?

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.030
It's related.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.100
We have a maternal for that.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.750
Just called us a removal policy so they just go ahead and at that.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.630
So in the core,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.960
we have something called us and removal here.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.170
So let me just pick up the removal one.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.610
Yeah,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.820
On under this,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.300
we have multiple mothers destroy every day or whatever you want to do.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.080
So this case,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.630
I'm going to say,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.190
That's right.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.750
So this is all we're going to do for creating a lot of group.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.180
You can create a similar law group on attached to your PC.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.870
Two instance or fire Get cluster.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.380
Are any other material value application is going to lower logs and you want to store the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.380
mental floor watch groups.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.650
So let me go ahead and synthesize my stack.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.390
So I think it's good that we deploy it.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.530
So when this is deploying,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.750
I want to show you another cool feature off.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.120
Using visual studio,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.830
you can see here there is an AWS icon.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.310
If I go ahead and click on that,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.110
as you can see,

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.320
that's ah pro formation.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.390
That's the default Toolkit and Lambda Functions.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.320
Also not there.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.350
So what is going to happen?

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.880
It's as on my stack gets deployed on when I refreshed my screen.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.530
The newly deployed a Lambda function will also show up here and also the cloud formation.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.080
Tim Protective yet deploy That is something going.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.040
That's a custom law group template Closer show here on doesn't do that.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.190
We can trigger our lambda function from this console itself.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.410
It's not going to AWS.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.840
We can experiment with the are Lambda Functions and see that it sells right here on the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.390
concert.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.230
So now the stack is deployed.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.050
Let me show you hope we can check it out.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.830
So I refreshed my screen on Do you have?

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.440
There are constant lambda function.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.850
Let me just by a click it on you have these two options stays in work on AWS.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.610
This is where you performed the test functions.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.160
If you have invested went off Jason that is stored in your local system.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.280
Then you can go ahead and click on this Tuesday or you can use any off those default humans

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.650
that is provided by us.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.240
Also,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.260
we can go ahead and choose a global which evens are close trade unions organise events or

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.270
anything that you want you can see,

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.170
hear or understand what I'm going to lose.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.540
I'm just going to create my own.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.040
Even here.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.870
I'm just going to say test function on this is going to be and a dictionary.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.780
So I'm just going to say hello would here,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.730
Andi,

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.900
just close the races and click on in.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.330
Walk on it it automatically going to give you the response.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.170
You can see here the responses immediately.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.890
Coming up here,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.180
let me show you in my concert also.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.140
So this is my console.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.780
As often I would say is empty.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.200
Just refresh my screen.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.030
The Lambda function is here on under that people have a lot group on the log that we just

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.350
know generated would say is best function Hello world.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.040
So you can see here have been tested from your visual studio and when much itself on to see

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.030
where their land lies working.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.940
So when you're doing some real life quoting this becomes really,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.640
really helpful.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.880
So the most important,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.350
but that I want Oh,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.170
the mantra is deleting the stack.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.590
If I go ahead and delete the stack,

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.000
my law group will also get deleted.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.950
So this full command hyphen,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.920
different forces not going to prompt me for what I wanted to reject or not is going to

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.730
forcefully did it.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.310
My stack and all the resources.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.030
So it started deleting everything.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.650
Andi,

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.850
once it is deleted,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.740
you will not be able to see the confirmation as well.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.970
Asylum the function because it's got deleted.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.750
It does goto our roadways.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.960
Law groups that go back here on the refresh my screen on you can see here the lot group is

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.170
deleted automatically.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.970
But if you go ahead and do the experiment again,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.760
we don't,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.810
uh this removal policy,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.990
you will find that the law group was still there in your account on it will not get deleted

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.480
automatically on go ahead and experiment them two times until you get it right to

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.980
understand.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.500
What is the importance off this concept on how you can change it depending upon the

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.870
environment?

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.330
For example,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.620
in production are some higher level environments.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.200
You don't want to destroy the locker,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.630
but lower level environments.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.110
We want to enforce the destroy angle for no groups.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.540
Astronauts,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.590
the stack estimated so crying.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.180
See which concept is useful for which environments,

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.430
or even have a gift case based on the environment you have this value are not Adam.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.440
So try it.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.540
If you have any problems,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.170
put them in the Q and A section we can learn from each other.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.950
Thanks for watching Happy Learning.
