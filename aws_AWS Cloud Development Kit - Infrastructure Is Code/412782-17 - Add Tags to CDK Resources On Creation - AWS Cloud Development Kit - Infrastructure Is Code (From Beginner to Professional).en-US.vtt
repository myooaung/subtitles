00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
and a full welcome back to another lecture on ce que We'll be looking at creating resources

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.530
that to see how we can add some bags to those resources The last demo we saw how to create

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.880
a PPC This is the BBC stack that be created on if you notice that the default attacks are

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.590
there for example,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.760
name off the vpc Onda Few mother information related to the formation It's of the logical

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.270
80 stack Etienne stack name I believe in you want to go at a that your BBC you need to do

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.130
that in all the forces as well.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.610
For example,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.040
I filled out here or for or vpc And if I go to my subjects on select any off the substance

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.330
here one of the default attacks are very for I wonder at some back saying What is

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.910
application?

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.460
This VPC is going to host on who is the networking team that I need to contact for any

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.430
truth of the BBC like changing and security rules or anything like that.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.150
So I need to add tax on all these resources on If you are using the conventional

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.020
confirmation,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.850
then you need to go ahead and add all those sources.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.970
But that is quite time consuming on the lot off erroneous workers in world.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.690
Let us use the power of CTK to go ahead on the bag our resource like BBC in one central

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.840
place so that all the resources under the BBC can get the bag.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.100
Rumor of yours really have the court important here so that it's ah matter under court

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.650
which is called us and tagging.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.190
So we are going to do is score dot pang dark and on then the simple day and the patterns

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.150
are here which conflict that we want to tag and the key and the value in this case I want

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.790
to attack my BP Seems so I'm just going to add custom bpc on Little say I'm going to add

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.020
attack as Warner for app on.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.780
Then I'm going to say that they say my owners mystique just going to save it.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.490
That thought we need to do let us go ahead and send to Cesar Stack can do isn't as well.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.850
That is absolutely fine.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.350
So let me just move this up.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.340
So if I do a CTK send that,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.450
then adore Dev.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.300
Yeah,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.050
so I mean,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.090
we see the tags being added toe overstaffing.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.270
But here all the green lines so wonderfully over the template was quite big.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.090
If I go ahead and use my custom bpc stand here,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.200
it was already about a 400 lines,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.750
including the tagging must have gone human bigger.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.460
So city get improves the opportunity for me because I don't have to find our bathrooms will

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.650
start at 92 ad attack If I call headed just us for honored back here and you can find the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.420
all the water tax,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.290
it'll be greeted all mostly 16 decks have incredibly just go ahead and deployed on see it

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.640
in our bones or less Well,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.790
so when it is getting built on,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.470
we could take us back to our concerts right now you can see here that are about 1 to 3 on

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.110
the six tax.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.950
At that you see won more tackles,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.050
getting either as on ourselves record for mission starts deploying two stages.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:06.710
So it's complete for our Aida muse over to start with our I c w and work our way with

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.430
subjects as well.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.150
Let us go toe and GW on Go to tags.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.890
We should have our own of tech.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.910
Likewise,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.550
if I go pick some subjects that I started one,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.400
you should have it.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.750
So this is the very simple way of adding a tag lettuce.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.650
Uh,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.540
you can go ahead and take note that the resources also they would most probably get

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.160
completed.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.650
But what I want to show here celibacy,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.960
I want to add and other source like an SD.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.580
Although named Lucas and custom bpc stack,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.250
let us say I want to add another results like and history.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:52.220
So I have important here.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.910
And remember,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.930
if you're not installed,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.300
Esther,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.810
you need to go ahead and import history and install it as well.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.660
So just going to add it so that you don't forget it when they're going to follow this

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.370
existence along with me so important history.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:17.340
Let us go ahead and create our street packets of just going to say my bucket followed by

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.850
custom bucket highly.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.650
So let us go ahead and add another bag as well here.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:32.630
So my bucket followed by owner so stuff what I need it can just reuse the same stricter

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.010
here.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.150
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to synthesize my stack.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.920
Everything is good.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.980
There is little difference.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.060
See if the new book it is getting created in the bag so it's going to be had.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.580
It's just going to see a CD.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.300
Get to fly.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.210
So,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.730
like this,

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.130
you should be able to act Acto any resources that you're building out in your city.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.750
Just stack.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.720
So when this is getting created,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.450
it must go back toe over stack.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.360
We should have custom bucket choose.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.450
There's three service.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:23.760
You should have a new bucket here just trying to find which one was the new one.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.390
Because country collect between it is.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.280
So that is,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.720
uh,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.750
wait for this one.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:37.110
Our s three bucket and the market is called.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.040
That's my custom BBC stacked buckets.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.530
So this is the one I was thinking.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.250
This is the one.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.800
So my custom bpc stock market on the other properties and attacks I should have a name off

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.320
the tag that we created just now we can see here.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.350
The one attack is also added apart from the front formation tax that was spare old,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.750
Really,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.380
we have seen how to create resources,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.730
and you're also seeing how toe add tax to those resources that were created in our CTK

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.550
application.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.030
But you noticed that every time we need to add on value to the enforcement are creating

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.980
what have all the resources that are forming a particular stack we can centrally do.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.780
It is propagating the lines the same lines again and again.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.670
If you remember,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.220
we were coming pressing the owner deck ondas with less the value more.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.660
So what if we can with this values to see regular Jason on,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.730
apply it at the polls Level X and bought a stack of itself?

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.120
That is what we're going to see the next video,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.670
how we can apply tags globally so that all the resources that are performing a part of your

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.650
application on this accent of the application can take your bags.
