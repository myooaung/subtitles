00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
folks,

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.750
welcome to another lecture on city.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.740
This time we're going to talk about Chlo.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.750
What alarms and mattresses were quite often create a lot of resources,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.020
like easy to instances.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.770
Lampa functions at databases,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.040
but we have never went ahead and see how to monitor toast sources.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.200
How do you come to know when something goes wrong in your environment?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.780
How do you come to know when your users are having for experience?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.440
Because the CPU is pretty high on your server or your Lambda function is having a lot of

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.950
others.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.850
That is what we're going to see today.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.680
How to create those mattresses on how to get an alarm triggered whenever those notices,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.540
supposed beyond a certain pressure on when those alarms are happening.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.560
How do you get notified to your ops team so that somebody goes ahead and looks into those

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.590
problems?

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.150
So that is what we're going to see.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.260
We're going to create and simple Web Server,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.540
which is running on easy to instance on.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.940
We're also going to simulate and micro service,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.740
which is going to be running on after functions on.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.830
We're going to create some mattresses and alarms,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.430
for example,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.070
in the sea.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.880
Easy to case.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.290
We're going to see what is going to be the average CPU on if it is going to be a below

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.180
certain special or on a boat sedentary short going to create a allow likewise for the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.150
Lambda function.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.800
If the lambda function is going to throw a lot of others within a short period of time,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.960
say,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.500
for example,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.980
within the last one minute there are 10 others.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.850
Then I wanted to get in Allah.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.630
And what happens when those alarms have happening?

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.120
I want to notify my ops team on for notification.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.020
I'm going to use an SNS topic on for that s in this topic.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.490
I'm going to subscribe my email address so that option comes and looks into the shoe on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.350
Tracy resulted from this possible.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.050
So let's go ahead and bring this into our city case back now.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.730
So this is a city distracted.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.760
I'm going to use them.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.340
Called it as a custom,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.140
easy to alum stack on.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.820
You can see here.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.010
There's already some resources,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.110
prefect in the reason for that,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.230
we don't want to spend time recreating the C two and sensors estimates topic and laughter

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.490
functions that we need for triggering the labs.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.450
We can start building on those resources which are boc any times we hope to create it.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.850
So let me just walk through all the resources that are going to be pre baked in on later

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.850
we'll go ahead and see how to add alarm.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.100
Stop for most topics.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.180
So the first resource that I'm building here is on SNS stopping.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.980
I'm calling a second stone up.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.320
Steam on for that obstinate topic.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.310
I creators after chin with the militants off this one on me.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.290
If you're going to follow this,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.680
Temuco had to change this evening to something that you want so that you can get

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.100
notification and alarm.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.190
It's configured on day one,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.600
where I told about creating an easy to sever for That needn't be PC so I'm creating and vpc

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.670
on I'm also adding and usually descript followed by my am I at everything that is required

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.430
for my Web server,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.760
including security books,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.480
and I am going to show that they go ahead and connect to the server if something goes wrong

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.480
.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.620
Likewise for my lambda function,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.520
I'm reading the Lambda Function Court here and I'm deploying my lamp function,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.290
and I have given some empty conflict of what we're going to to next.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.850
So as often none of these resources are deployed in my account.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.280
So if I take you to my confirmation,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.880
you can see here.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.960
That's no stack that has been deployed on.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.680
If we never get to go easy to instance,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.310
you can see here.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.150
That's no instances running right now.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.430
There are no Lambda functions like Why's there?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.470
No alarms are also in my account right now,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.550
so let's go ahead and deploy the basic resources.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.120
So why my diversity getting deployed?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.620
Let us go ahead and start building our float watch alarms.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.640
So the first step is always going ahead and adding the concepts into our requirements file

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.290
on.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.260
If you remember,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.540
I spoke about tidings of actions whenever alarmist regard.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.970
For that,

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.070
we have another concept which is called us AWS under school cold water in the school

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.640
actions.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.780
So let's go ahead and import that as well.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.760
So I'm just going to remove this Newlink characters or done.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.100
I want to install them Now the borough for visual studio is I can just go ahead and open

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.840
another terminal.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.320
Why my deployment is happening.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.200
Another terminal.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.100
So I'm just going to install it here.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.160
My installations done here so that we just close this out on go ahead and import over court

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.750
here so that you start putting over a lapse.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.330
Important concepts.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.730
The next step is going head and creating the alarms.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.160
So I'm going to start by creating and metric.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.720
In this case,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.510
I'm going to take that album CPU for Casey took instance on here when you use the AWS

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.040
program that metric itself from the animal is born name space.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.490
If you go to your problem,

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.160
which console on the metric session,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.950
you should be able to figure it out.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.320
So if you just go ahead and I would get here Onda under easy to you should be able to find

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.790
the instance Rooted metrics,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.390
for example.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.740
We're going to talk about about instance metrics on.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.800
We're going to particularly pick up the easy toe CPU utilization based on my instance,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.060
I So that's what we're going to build here.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.560
So I'm going to call this as easy toe metric for those.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.720
If you are average CPU that I say we're going to use the club watch constant that the a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.770
greater just now Under this we have something called this metric followed by my name Space

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.770
.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.020
And I say said earlier,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.150
This is going to be my easy to name space on my metric name is going to be CPU relaxation

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.250
foreword by my dimension.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.840
As I said earlier,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.610
my dimension is going to be my instance I need Onda.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.750
We have our Web server somewhere here it has become observer on reference that several i d

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.050
So we got our dimension also done on for what we did.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.050
I want to measure this.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.260
I'm going to say for every five minutes give me my average CPU so that value be stored in

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.570
this variable.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.870
So we're way to create an alarm for the easy to server.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.290
When I were our every suffused below second intra short I'm going to call this asset Low

00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:02.100
CPU alone and we have love watch dot alarm on under this we have the scoping that we get to

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:10.230
this stack and call this s It is the alarm description which always gives us a clear idea

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:19.590
of why were created this alarm alert If CPU is less than 10% we are going to have an alarm

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.250
name on.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.820
We're going to call this as a low CPU alone.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:28.040
I would enable this alarm when you do this.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.140
What is the way it happened?

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.390
Whenever there's an alarm state,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.860
it is going to trigger the notification.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.400
Otherwise,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.890
it's not going to trigger any notifications or it is not going to measure anything.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.490
You can just haven't allowed just not doing anything.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.510
So I'm just going to make sure my alarm is enabled on patient what metric it is going to

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.040
allow.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.130
We just know created the easy to metric for basic human is going to use that on the

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.300
shoulder is going to be What is the CPI person that they want to measure against?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.750
I'm going to say if my CPU is less than 10% did you place for a period of five minutes?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.580
Throw in a loud so go ahead and increases if you want to know how production value.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.600
But it is going to be demo and I want to be triggered immediately.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.770
So city that's a very,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.270
very low.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:13.030
But if you're on 10% on what competitive operator we want to use on in this case,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:21.310
I'm going to use the the comparison operator on under this we haven't in venues is going to

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.800
be less dental records a threshold.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.390
But use that on television,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.050
period.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.940
So for harmony a whole long here that I want to make sure it so I'm just going to say for

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.580
one period,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.070
that is going to be five minutes.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.230
So see here Peter is chosen.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.440
Eso fine.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.190
So evolution Peter is going to be one.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.790
If you say to hear it is going to wait for 10 minutes and then see what is that alarmist?

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.790
Reaching or not?

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.800
On how many data points I want to mention?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.110
I'm going to say one so that it gets a notification immediately on.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.900
All these values are deformed.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.920
Cloudwatch alum matrices Go ahead and take on these parameters if you want to find to them

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:04.120
for your online division One second reinforcing your desk playing.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.050
But it's here.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.740
What happens when you were issued to somewhere is going to take more time to stabilize.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.950
So that is where we have a parameter called the street.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.380
Missing data on under that we have something called with towards daughter.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.170
Three missing data I'm going to say not reaching sometimes what happens is your self.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.880
It is really,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.470
really huge.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.630
That's a lot of dependency is not off batteries on before it starts serving data.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.970
It is going to wait some time building itself.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.780
So at that time,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.850
covered with my think that that's the other is underneath the lights or over utilize or not

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.240
responding on time,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.090
for example,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.090
agency might be very really high,

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.470
or the network throughput might be really,

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.650
really high because it is installing some packages.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.890
You don't want to get an alarm in those cases,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.450
so I'm going to say treated missing data as not reaching.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.550
So now our llamas said,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.090
What happens?

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.760
My alarm is triggered.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.230
We want to inform or essence topic for that.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:02.750
What we're going to use is it see to allow dot add alarm action.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.050
Under this,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:09.830
we have something called the storyboards actions on the total of actions.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.840
That is an action court as s in this action on,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.400
you want to use the Essendon stopping,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.390
we help page it earlier.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.290
If you see here,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.220
I have a constant off steam topic.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:26.210
So let me just go ahead on added here So let me send to save my stack.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.220
Meanwhile,

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.160
my insulation is completed.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.490
Let me go ahead and check whether my stack deployment for so completed so that it's done.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.030
So little school hadn't deployed this stack or so before that.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.250
I'm synthesizing it.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.250
So that seems to be good.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.860
Let's go ahead and deploy it.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:49.970
So my stack is here on.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.110
Let me refresh My speaking here should have issued to consents.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.600
And right now you can see here the alarm stated this none we should be seeing in Alan

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.130
Cumming appear likewise.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.430
I should have a lambda function here on Global Watch alarms.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.640
Let us go to our alarms here on.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.980
We can see a loss if you allow board ready on the remember.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.950
That is an essence topic that has been created for us.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.880
This isn't a meaty militaries.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.580
I will,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.100
sweetie,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.690
add another subscription so that I get an email whenever allow this trigger.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:29.180
So let me just go ahead and quit e ad and subscription so you can see here My alarmist

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.500
orderly triggered because I said it that are very,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.530
very low value on.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.490
I just let it saying,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.930
if my CPU is less than 10% age for the last five minutes,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.140
trigger and allow on.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.480
You can see here my city or something like a 0% age because this was not doing anything on

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.480
,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.050
uh,

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.390
when we set up this kilometers are insufficient state on.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.520
Then it is evaluated for the last five minutes,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.010
and it was triggered and allow.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.680
So let me just go toe my militaries here.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.770
I should be seeing the Atlanta you can see here.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.250
The most of your alarm has been triggered on.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.410
You can see here the value was Liston.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.210
The threshold of 10% age and this trigger allow.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:12.120
So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to set up my Lambda alum.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:12.540
Also,

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.420
you can see here this is going from insufficient to alarm.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.660
So let's go ahead and do the Lambda alarm as well.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.150
And see if my intelligence is getting a notification.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.740
So the lambda alarmist really be much more easier because you can have the access to the

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.500
mattresses much more easily.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:33.410
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to show you how to create it from Cloudwatch.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:38.360
But you can also do it from the I'm not function consequences.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.680
If you do dark metric,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.680
you will be able to access the metric values off the number function.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.430
Does he hope to do it using the club which morning itself?

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.540
So I'm going to call this as Const Own function alarm.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.630
After deploying this,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.000
let us introduce some others in the function court so that triggers of other issues.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.430
Let's go one step at a time.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.500
Where does create the alarm?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.050
First,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:04.650
it is a scope it after scoping and create an I D.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.340
I hear made for egg.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.610
This is whatever speaking about earlier we have something called this constant function

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:18.410
Dark metric on the school headers.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.400
So if you call this method automatically,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.460
the other metric is called on.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.350
The values are sent to my a lot here on.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.380
Likewise,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.070
I'm going to say three short and this time I'm going to say if there are more than two

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.230
errors in my lambda function in the last five minute period,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.030
then trigger and Allah so just going to sit to hear that this go ahead and add the

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.250
evaluation period.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.850
There was also one data point is good enough.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.810
I'm for period and wanted to choose a score.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.020
So likewise,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.330
we want to create an action that it's notifying my stopping.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:59.350
So I'm just going to construct function alarm that had a lot of action.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.290
Okay,

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.990
Not s illness.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.750
Action for our climate topic.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.110
That's it.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.140
Little school.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:10.390
Where?

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.170
On the center.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:11.540
Say so.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.250
Stack.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.460
So the status deployed.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.600
Let us go over and take over cloudwatch control first we wouldn't get an alarm notification

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.840
because my lambda function is not growing any others.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.940
But let us go where you can see it is as off now.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:30.360
Insufficient state because there is no information on,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.070
they will be treated at missing that I would be treated as not tweeting.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.130
It's not been set here,

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.880
So that is why you see it as insufficient data.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.840
But let us go where on trigger some others from Orlando function.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:49.420
So the first thing is sitting up our dummy desk.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.980
You went just to show you that this number function works perfectly fine.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.140
I'm just went click on test here.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.700
You can see here that says they're coming up the party messages coming.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.200
So just to break this land a function what I went through,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.900
which I'm just going toe create and other the best way.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.610
So I'm just going to change its very stuff global and just creating.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.920
And people say this the best.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.940
That should be better than one editor.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.740
You could see it clearly states this one.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.840
I'm going to test it again at a couple of more bank for good measure so that there is

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.260
enough number off.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.880
Others have logged into the system.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.240
I will get a notification,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:32.190
but it should I just go to our award section on it is forecasted.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.120
Since we have set their duration to five minutes,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.540
it is going to make for the next five minutes.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.550
On it is going toe trigger alarm.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:46.660
You can see here my a llamas moved from Okay,

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.290
Stato alarm state both my alarms and alarm state.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.970
If I go to my Villagers,

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.050
I should have got another image also.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:15:01.030
So let us go to my email on you can see here there's an alarm for custom issue toe allows

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.270
constant function alarm so that it's my stack name.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.470
That is way too starting with constant custom,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.240
easy to alarms.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.410
But this is the alarm that we created on.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.500
You can see here,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.650
The threshold worse.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.920
A preached me said that if there is a minimum off,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.460
two errors forehead and trigger an alarm.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.030
So that is what has happened.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.800
This is how we create alarms for different resources.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.960
Go ahead and try it for other sources that I have not shown here,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.570
for example,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.860
to an excuse topic or toe analogy.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:35.270
State a pasar animal dp when the latency is increasing or the fail organs in your ideas

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:35.820
databases,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.730
including over and trying different combinations on If you have any problems,

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.080
put them in the comments we all can learn from each other.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.990
Extra watching,

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.670
happy learning.
