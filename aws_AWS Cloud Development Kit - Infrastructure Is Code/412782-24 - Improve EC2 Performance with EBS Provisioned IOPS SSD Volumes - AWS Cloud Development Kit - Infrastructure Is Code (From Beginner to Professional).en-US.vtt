00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.230
Hello,

00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.770
folks,

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.550
welcome back to another every sort on city gate.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.190
This time we're going to see how the launching easy to instance,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.730
with some additional EBS volumes.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.350
So far,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.050
we have been launching easy to incenses with just a hoot volume with no Edison.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.350
Storage for state management are for access to Alicia that your applications might need.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.490
And when you're talking about EBS volumes,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.410
you get it to types of Williams when it's a standard one on,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.960
then with the provision shops,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.390
The provision Diop's a lotion obligation to have more spiky workloads for compute intensive

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.290
or read write intensive workloads.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.440
So in those cases you need and William,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.350
which can provide that kind of for performance in this demo,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.700
we're going to see how to launch an easy two instance with the required level of provision

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.910
psyops in a line.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.850
Next instance.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.530
So this is a stack we have been using for wanting or easy to instance,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.400
I'm not taking anything here just copied over to a new file on Called Us on Custom.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.310
Easy to pay up,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.610
stat on we have are easy to instance here you can see that it's on your route.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.910
William on no other women sometimes.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a comment here.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.980
So what we can do is we can use the same the Web server construct on the Web server we can

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.450
do Issa other instance on we can all right,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.080
the default property by using our property.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.750
All right,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.360
on the property over,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.850
Rider,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.370
we're going to define that this is going to be a block.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.230
The waste mapping.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.840
So this is a lower level construct that the city offers whenever you want to.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.410
All right,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.350
An internal property.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.270
You can do this so you can do device mapping on.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.430
There are many ways off.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.190
We're doing this.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.460
So this is one off the ways,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.510
as usual in Siddique is completely flexible on how you want to structure your cold.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.570
So I'm just showing you one way and then put the documentation so you can go ahead and see

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.750
the other ways also.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.690
So this is going to enlist because you can have multiple volumes on this sample.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.360
I'm going to show you 11 William.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.780
So under a list,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.600
we're going to create a Jason with the different type of values like puts the device name.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.720
What is the hopes?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.650
So the first thing is device name,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.290
so in line X,

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.150
usually you're going to mount it at a slash day.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.660
So I'm going to call this as slash del on the rule out there is little Route one and then

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.340
we'll call this.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.750
Ask STB.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.120
So after this,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.500
we're going to configure the previous specific parameters.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.600
On First is the Williams says what or how big the William has to be.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.200
So let us say I want something like eight gigabytes off storage on.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.190
Then I'm going to say what type I'm going to choose as I ops because we want provisioned

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.850
throughput.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.650
I want to know how much I hope so.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:00.250
I want so here I'm going to say a bow down 400 hopes and need on you can go ahead and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.290
configure it to any safe for you that you want that your instances supporting this time we

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.670
went to use the teeter Microsoft just a passing only a small amount of oil into.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.830
If you have a bigger instance,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.250
which can take advantage of much bigger jobs,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.690
then you can go ahead and use it.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.210
I'm just going toe until it domination.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.440
This is absolutely not necessary when you're doing it or pollution.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.330
Most probably would want to leave the disk on or are you were terminated there later.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.300
So in this case,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.570
I'm just going to show you that is an option off doing that when you're deploying the poor

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.960
formation.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.980
Except so if you say getting domination is true,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.150
then what happens is when you're stackers deleted,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.350
your also gets deleted at the end of it.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.880
So it looks like I made an error somewhere,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.650
so I'm just going to quickly check if I missed anything here.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.850
So this is the name of the property and my apology stairs.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.040
This is the name of the property.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.430
So then followed by a list here.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.530
So they're eagle.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.480
That was the other.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.850
Then,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.270
In case you want to add more than 112 you're easy to instance.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.690
So all you do is add one more item just to get the section on.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.710
Then you'll be able to add one more warning,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.850
but the size that you need.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:08.560
So in this case,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.250
I'm just going to add more anyone willing seller to school head and said to say so Stack

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.860
Everything is good that we should not take.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.050
See any errors here?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:24.210
So this school head on deploy the statcast would It does go to a rock formation service and

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.070
see what is happening there So we can see our payoff time being deployed here.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.550
So under here we have a server for that just code or a sequence Since we should have a new

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.280
server coming up here on defy scrawled on that must be to limbs.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.960
Here you can see others in a room device on then that is also an assistant.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.550
If I click on that,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.110
obviously this is a well in my knee.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.920
So again,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.490
I already open the dam was if we refresh my screen,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.350
I should be able to see two warnings here.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.490
So as you can see,

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.080
I have created on an 80 be provisioned.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.260
I also volume within Ayob Colour 400.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.300
So this is how you add an original William which is off provision stories to improve the

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.050
performance of your PC to win stairs.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.150
Go ahead and try it.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.270
If you have any problems for them in the comments,

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.760
I'll be happy to help them with you.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.740
Thanks for watching.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.490
Happy learning
