00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
and a phone Welcome to another.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.620
Every short on city gay.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.560
This time we're going to talk about importing resources that are already in your account.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.280
Are in your shell account into your city,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.050
Haystack.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.000
Why?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.970
This is useful.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.120
Let us sail.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.650
You want to launch a Luisito instance in an existing BPC?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.820
Are you haven't BBC already,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.760
but you want to ruin another BBC and peer those two BBC's than in those cases.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.710
You want to import those resources which you are created outside your stack on makesem

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.150
interactions with that stack.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.030
You know where you get up,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.360
modify the existing resources but you can use it for for example,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.030
launching and easy to are using that s three bucket as in storage mechanism are,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.640
for example,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.220
appearing the BBC also all those things that are possible But you cannot morning for the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.320
existing resources.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.840
So let's go ahead and see how we can do this in our stack.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.930
This is the product that we have been working on on you can see here there's a custom BBC

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.240
stack on be created and bpc already which is called this custom BBC on.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.750
There is also an estimate bucket if I call here,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.520
You can see the custom,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.090
BBC.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.860
What we will do is we will importers divorce with PC into our stack and try to create

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.170
appearing connection between these two BBC's that we see here.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.040
Likewise.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.750
I'll show you how to import and existing s three bucket like this one,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.590
so they just go back to our stack.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.420
So let us talk about importing the s three bucket.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.960
First,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.590
let us say you want toe add a bucket,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.210
which is already in your A counselor.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.150
I'm just going to add on comment here would say is resource and same account.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.010
So we're going to use the every construct here s three dot bucket on.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.480
We're going to say from bucket name in this case.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.020
So let us at a school which is itself on your also going to call this as my imported bucket

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.380
on,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.050
Just going to add the bucket name.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.450
So let's go ahead and pick the bucket name from here,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.000
so that's only this.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.570
So if we want to check it out,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.210
whether we have imported it successfully,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:18.180
what I'm going to do is have just going toe at the old good fiction cold or the cfn out my

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.650
important bucket.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.470
Uh,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.950
just have a name here.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.660
It just call.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.850
This is Bucket one.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.760
What I can say is against a bucket,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.460
One dark bucket mean Just go ahead and seem to say so.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.980
Stack if it if we have important it properly,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.300
we should be able to fit the faceoff stack on.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.140
Find the output section also.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.090
And if I go ahead and deployed so we can go ahead and take it out whether we have imported

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.650
this s trip again properly.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.130
So my stack has put deployed.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.100
You can see here already.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.840
My sample back.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.700
It has been exported automatically.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.430
So if I go ahead and refresh my screen,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.810
I should have one more output by important back it.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.690
So basically whatever then is I have imported an existing resource on I can use it into my

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.460
city historic.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.880
But this is not much fun.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.870
We're not done anything.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.360
Just used only one ourselves.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.910
But let me show you how you can import another bucket which is would be in another account

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.960
which is shared with you.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.560
So it is a pocket to Andi using the same construct this time.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.590
What we're going to do is what we are going to importers from bucket.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.030
Yeah.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.780
Then I'm inside this.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.870
We need to given proper here and let us at the scope first on.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.340
Then it is a Russ.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.360
I phoned Bucket.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.370
I don't have a cross.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.060
I want black it.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.370
Really?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.390
But what?

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.970
I'm going through it.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.950
I'm just going to show you how the air and should look like according aws school in history

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.040
on.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.850
Then your sample.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.710
Cross it going bucket,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.650
something like that.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.270
So if you do it this way,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.230
what happens is if you have a necessary permissions.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.870
The packet from that account is imported into your stack.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.190
I'm going to show you one more thing that you can do.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.340
We already have one BBC here custom BBC,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.370
which is if I go to my GP C section we have ABC,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.600
so I'm going to import this vpc into our staff.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.750
Let us copy this BBC I d andan important into our stack.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.760
So we're going to call this as a BBC two on.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.410
We're going to use that easy to construct on.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.710
There are two options for you.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.530
One is from look up on from the PC attributes from BBC attributes allows you a lot of

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.180
flexibility.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.010
Like for example,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.910
you can use the tags or you can use the V p c i.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.170
D.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.160
You need to be very,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.770
very specific when you're using that,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.000
so that the city can know that which BPC that you are talking of order,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.580
for example,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.850
in a re election annual.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.550
And that might have my people.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.320
BBC's So you should not have a confusion of which BBC two important.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.190
So you should have all the values,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.490
really.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.860
So that city can uniquely identify the PPC an important when we're using the look up there

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.670
talking French.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.290
One is the account number on the region from which the BBC isn't on.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.390
You need to provide it in your app.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.550
Daughter be way section is an environment variable.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.090
So I went to show you that option here.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.400
It's a self on.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.980
Then we'll call this as important BBC here there is a easier option.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.610
You can just say he's default equal to troop.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.480
It is going to import the T 40 PC because that can be always one lee one default in your

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.850
account.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.530
Whatever reason,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.220
it might even choose this option are I can show you another way where you can import it.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.820
You can say BBC I d on them will be copied the BBC I d So I'm just going to paste it here.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.960
Let us have another out border for our BBC Also to see whether we have ah imported it

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.550
correctly.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.250
I'm going to save me between two or three b c d and then have a brackets here.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.210
So let us into space or attack on,

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.500
See if everything is good you can see here it is requesting for the default region and also

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.600
the default account.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.020
So let me just go ahead and added in do my stack here.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.540
So if we remember,

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.320
we have done this in the earlier lecture.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.920
So under environment,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:29.750
all you have to do is accorded environment followed by the region.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.020
I have saved it.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.650
Let us do a syndicate Ellis again to see if our stack consent to sex properly.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.520
So what is going to do is basically is going toe maken a big old to my content,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.380
see whether the BBC ideas in my account and see whether it can import it.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.110
So they just go ahead and deploy.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.780
So it is not going to do much.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.280
It is just going to print out the value want to screen here.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.670
And also,

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.620
if I go to the Tora Formation service on the output,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.150
I will have the vpc idea also exported.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.520
So what?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.080
This is doing that I'm just going to show you how you can do it.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.980
BBC peering.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:10.800
But they said beer BBC So let's go ahead and build our hearing and we're going to use the

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.020
information class here,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:29.650
So bear BBC on We went to ST Pierre BBC I d.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.390
So in this case,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.210
my first BBC is going to be my custom BBC here,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:54.400
so I'm just going to use that value custom BBC dot BBC underscore Heidi Followed by my So

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.410
that's it all it requires to appear to be PC's in city.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.250
Get that a synthesizer stack.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.700
So basically what?

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.050
What we have done now.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:10.440
So I'm sure knew how to important s three bucket how to import an existing BBC on.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.070
There are two methods off important your existing BBC using the attributes and also the

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:20.920
look up on another step what you can do with an important source so like in this case,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:26.150
we're doing a building with being an existing BPC on the new BBC created by our stack.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.500
So the BBC building mixing is getting boot here.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.180
As you can see on remember,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.860
this is not going to build a vote.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.850
It is just going to create a period connection.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.860
If you want to take it to the next step that you need to act out ot tables for your BBC's

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.800
so that they can communicate between the two species S o.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.030
I believe it is an exercise.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.550
You can go ahead and try it out.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:52.250
So our billing connection is completely just goto Overcoat formation ticket out here.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:09:02.540
So this is my important BBC on my stock is also complete like Tesco under fresh our screen

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:11.900
to see our BBC Zoe Baird correctly So you can see here This is the accept or BBC because

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.600
the source waas our default to BPC.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.900
This is what 72 cities is by default on the other BBC instead about 83.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.580
If I go here,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.790
there's only two.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.850
So we don't have any confusions off different BBC's.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.090
Go ahead and try hotel important existing resources into your stack on day.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:30.830
Right toe.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.200
Make some resources on top off them.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.290
If you have any problems,

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.400
put them in the comments.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.060
I will have you with them.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.180
Thanks for watching.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:38.950
Happy learning.
