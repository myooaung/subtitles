00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.340
Hello,

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.840
folks.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome to another lecture on CTK.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.050
This time we're going to talk about scheduling a Lambda functions so that they run on a

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.200
preordained time.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.080
Quite often,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.340
it is a case that at the end of the month or a week,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.640
and you want to run some bad jobs to create some reports or other automation,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.500
and some people want to turn off the instances at the weekend,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.780
I turned them on our the party on any kind of job that you want to run on particular

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.340
schedule.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.450
Then you can combine Lambda Functions along with close givens to achieve the same reasons

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.550
in this demo and want to show you how you can do that in your own environment.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.270
So this is the fact that we are going to use for tradition.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.650
Demo on Guy named the Stack as a custom Lambda grown stack on day.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.770
This is just a default lambda function,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.750
which is going to just echo out even that it is receiving on waking Deploy this lambda on

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.110
corn figure and watch event,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.760
which would trigger this amber function at a free deter mined in time.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.930
Say,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.490
for example,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.850
every five minutes you want to run the sample function or every Monday every month.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.540
You want to understand the function so you can choose the project schedules.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.140
So if I take you to the documentation that Amazon offers that are two days old,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.980
ways you can schedule crunch of one is a great time.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.710
For example,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.670
every five minutes,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.150
everyone,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.500
not our every seven minutes.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.240
Seven days,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.210
as you can see here.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.030
Onder way 30 people annex type of job,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.470
Laddie,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.190
how fine grain control over all the metrics is like appendage.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.560
Our day off,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.670
the month and everything so seedy get also extends the functionality that code words humans

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.490
over on.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.050
You can configure it both ways,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.330
so I'm just going to show you how you can do that in your account,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.200
both the baseball.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.050
So let's go ahead and start depending our stack and,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.610
as always,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.710
is,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.780
since we're going to use the clothes Stevens,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.110
which is a new construct,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.320
we need to add tomato requirements while already to install those concepts into our our

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.790
project,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.710
that person tree.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.970
So let's go ahead and do that on,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.970
not just evens.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.540
We need that even target or so that is the Lambda continues to be triggered.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.220
So we need something called sq target.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.710
So we will let you see.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.850
We have this even targets of coming into picture.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.880
So for this moment,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.920
let's just go ahead and act him on going to install the mess.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.250
Well,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.000
so it finished installing.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.080
Let us go ahead.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.250
The closest flight then started being over stack So lettuce imported first.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.750
But the important if,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.250
as underscore given on this one has underscored targets.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.910
Okay,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.010
we have imported them.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.950
Just go where?

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.950
On the build.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.450
Our grown joke here.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.310
So the 1st 1 is I'm going to show you how you can run it at every day at six pm,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.630
for example UTC time.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.530
Remember,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.180
humans always take it up,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.220
but UTC time.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.750
So let us start building it.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.260
So I'm just going to call this as a six PM Koran.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.800
You can go ahead and name it.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.460
However you want to remember it So under even speak have a method called this room.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.150
So after always just go ahead on the scoreboard first.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.530
So inside this we have in parliament recorded skidoo on This is where we do our grown

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.310
parameters.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.120
So humans has something called a set schedule Dog gone on inside.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.590
This begins to go where and I had all the variables.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.250
For example,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:39.380
Minute is everyone minute or we just want to run it at six PM or 65 or 6 10 So let us say I

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.670
want to eat at 6 p.m. One.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:49.170
So it's just going to put it at zero at our sequel to going to be 80 on for month Military

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.330
say I want to run it every month that in that case I'm just going to put it as a star,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.250
followed by weekday or ah,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.150
we get So I'm just going to send this case one day toe Friday.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.960
So it is it.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.700
I finally do.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.280
We want to run it all year.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.690
I want to say yes or years so and that just savers.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.430
So we're good.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.760
That is one type of Iran.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.540
Another way is a great matter.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.530
So in this case,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.640
what I'm going to run it.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.600
I'm going to run this ground job every three minutes.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.260
So just go ahead and better this.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.000
And once again,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.390
we're going to use the rule on their They just go ahead and says he named it on here once

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.710
they instigate you under the dear friends we have scheduled.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.760
We saw that earlier.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.050
But this time we're going to choose a raid.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.050
I under rate.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.480
We can use the duration,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.140
which we are under seen before,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.780
so according to duration,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.860
dark minutes and I'm going to say three minutes here.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.990
So that is how simple it is to use this of eight matter.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.450
Now that we have set up our two rules,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.580
we need to attach our defense triggers.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.270
If you remember,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.950
laptop functions need a trigger so that they can run.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.350
So we need to attach a work of what Evans ruble to our Lambda functions.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.400
But this is where the targets are committed to picture,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.270
so they just go ahead and add for lambda functions here.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.780
So just as simple s so we have two routes,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.000
so I'm just going to take the flesh little here on.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.290
Then you're going to say,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.690
at target on inside this maternity,

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:49.920
just going to add a gamble from checker gets don't land a function so likewise he or so how

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.920
,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:06:00.320
when what even figure so that we just copy that on so the machine that on then if

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.040
everything is good,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.780
let this go ahead and synthesize and deploy of stack Now was Texas deploying?

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.760
Because goto our console and check it out.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.920
So we are confirmation care of you got out Stack deployed at this kowtow club Watch it just

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.840
goto rules here that made a fresh it must be tools here one for the six pm rule one Florida

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.720
three minute rule.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.950
So if I opened this it is going to give me when it's going to be my next execution.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:29.820
Likewise,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.680
If I go back and take over my three minute rule,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.870
you can see him.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.110
Both of them are pointing to the constant function and this is going together at foxl

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.240
duration off every three minutes.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.940
So let us go to our damned a function and see what has happened there.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.630
Let me refresh my screen here.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.710
So this is the function It should have to give its triggers So you can see you under club.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.060
Which events are even bridge.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.170
You can see here that are triggers that we just select different on.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.430
You can see both the human triggers have been added on automatically.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.520
This also be enabled the necessary permissions are also program That is the power of city

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.120
here for you,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.120
it very easily actually different triggers as the permissions that enables them so that you

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.830
don't have to do a lot of configuration people on the changing screens to make sure that

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.000
everything is working fine.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.160
So by now it doesn't.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.300
My stuff in three minutes for our first project would get trigger.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.050
So let me just go to monitoring and see if one execution has happened already.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.920
So you can see here There's already some executions that has happened.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.700
I decided a few times.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.450
So they just go to our law group and check it out now.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.970
So this Texas dedicated the Lobstein on you can see here.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.040
This Evan must also be enough a place to hear this must even my stopping from blowing which

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.850
humans you can see here that you went to type is aws Killen's.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.890
I assume it here.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.660
You can see your interviews givens on,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.510
but it is triggered by running every three minutes Job.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.520
That is how you set up your Cron jobs in the cloud and think I'm that function that watch

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.480
to intrudes.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.260
Go ahead and try it have some configurations,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.730
which will turn on instance at any time.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.720
The If you're choosing,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.330
turn them off when you don't want them or feathers and island time off them and it's going

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.330
.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.470
Thanks for watching Happy.
