00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.260
Hello,

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.850
folks.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.190
Welcome to another episode on City.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.040
In this lecture,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.210
we're going to see how to create custom.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.080
I am rules custom.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.030
I am policies adds a managed policies on grant resources permissions to access.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.160
Then if your own were earlier,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.770
we used them.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.390
I am users and groups.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.570
We will deliver it to the same constructs to see how we can add privileges.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.030
Toes users are those groups using manage policies are in line policies.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.950
So they just go to our stack and start building this environment.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.250
So this is a stack that we're going to use before Bellinger.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.130
I am rolls,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.180
but you can see here that is already fuel resources.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.870
I have written out up.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.460
That is,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.120
for example,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.390
I'm going to create and user on that I'm goingto have a group on.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.460
I'm adding that user one into this group that sold me going to help rebuild.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000
So I'm just going to quickly deploy this plane,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.170
be start writing our custom rules for rules and the permissions for manage policies and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.750
other things.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.530
The reason I want to start here is as off.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.650
No,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.780
you can see year.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.190
There are no permissions added to this group are.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.560
There are no permissions attitude.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.220
This user called us use that one.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.360
So when they are provisioned in my account,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.450
they will not have any privileges.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.410
We will go ahead and test that on.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.450
Once we confirm that there are no privileges,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.720
then we go ahead and add some privileges first by adding some manage policies on as always

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.720
,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.730
it is the best practice,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.540
not toe.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.210
Add any privileges to the use of itself.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.880
You either add privileges to the group that uses dismember off our to the role that you

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.280
should be assuming toe.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.950
So that's what we're going to do.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.050
We're going to add some manage policies to this group on.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.050
We'll take whether those manage policies taking into effect.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.930
So the user is getting probation now.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.850
So let me take you to my console here.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.390
So as off now,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.250
if I go to my user section,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.120
that must be one knew you said that must be getting created on.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.840
You can see the user is none.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.200
The group is none,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.630
but in a very short while,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.930
the user will get ah group added to him so likewise,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.590
Asaf know that are three buckets in my s three our service on.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.920
Then in a parameter story,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.840
we're going to see how to access parameters in our account.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.370
So as of now,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.960
there are no parameters also,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.080
So this is the baseline that we have.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.200
Onda,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.450
uh,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.150
you can see here the stack is created on an output section.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.290
I have and you are?

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.770
Let me just go ahead and put this into my private process so that we can go ahead and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.460
access it.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.190
So if your own word for user one what I did worse.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.550
The password iss stolen a secrets manager under the password string,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.070
as usual.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.850
One pass.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.380
So it is dynamically created.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.760
So I'm not embedding the password here,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.230
so just fleeced securely stored in my account itself.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.550
So if I go to my secrets manager here on user one vice is here,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.050
so just go ahead and pick up the value from here.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.740
Of course there.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.110
Since I'm exposing my passport here after the stackers completed or this lecture is

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.700
completed,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.280
I will be going head and destroying these two users.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.970
So as I said earlier,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.090
this user does not have any privileges.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.460
I mean,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.740
what any other resources I showed you earlier also in Virginia If I goto my easy to

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.890
instances are,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.480
for example,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.090
and just go to parameter store on also history I'm just opening Put the taps here So if I

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.460
goto my parameter store on goto this option I should be getting another likewise in s three

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.280
or so I should be getting no privileges So let us go ahead on and see how to add privileges

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.550
to our group now.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.140
So first what you are going to do is add managed policy on all of the policies and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.580
permissions are part off this I am group So it is already dead imported into my stack sort

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.580
.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.230
That is why I'm going to start using it.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.590
If you're going toe right it fresh make sure that you're importing that I have group on

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.660
since I will be later using a system I have important them be already started using secrets

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.410
Manager in the possible section So for doing the managed policy.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.380
So we're here to do this a const own group dot at managed policy on the construct the way

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:27.910
to Addis underscore I am dot managed policy from AWS manage policy name on this time I'm

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.350
going to use the Amazon trade only access for my s three bucket Amazon.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.640
Make sure that you're typing in the names correctly.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.990
Here.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.200
Amazon s three who need quantity access.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.780
So I'm just going to save this and then deploy it.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.280
Now we're giving additional privileges.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.880
So scenic is asking whether do you want to do this?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.740
So we're going to give on permission Toe syndicate to deploy the sedition permissions on

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.710
Once this is deployed,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.450
Let the school hadn't put your ticket out.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.970
The stock is deployed.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.190
Just go ahead and check it out in our private approach that you see here.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.160
This is a permission this denied.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.270
I'm just going to open it to do another tab on.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.730
Hopefully we should be able to see the three packets here.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.970
So that is how you have managed a permissions to your account.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.630
So even if I go here to my group section on,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.130
if I goto constant group on the permissions you can see here asked the daily access has

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.140
been added here later,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.460
we will see how to add in line policies also So just a demonstrator on inland policy.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.640
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create a couple of resources,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.790
especially there.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.620
But I am at the store.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.260
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create two parameters.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.310
I just taken the court from the previous stack that we earlier did with this system

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.890
parameter store here.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.810
The first parameter is going to be called a spam one on this is going to be called us Keys

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.540
to constant.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.880
That is good highlights.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.560
Gilkey Constance organization under that.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.630
My deputies on this kids called us fish on.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.050
There is a numerical value on Likewise,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.730
I'm going to create another parameter.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.470
Let me just changes to call this parameter to on named this parameter to.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.270
And this has under fish.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.150
We have different levels.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.050
So this is the goldfish and this is the value for that.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.120
So why I am creating new parameters is that is very easy way.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.800
For example,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.670
if I want to provide this user or this group permission for example,

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.430
Constant Group needs to permissions for this parameter all I have to do this.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:33.050
So all I'm going to do is bear one god Grant.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.560
Really?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.660
So here you can see here There's a read and write books who are religious?

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.850
Are there just this time going to give really here?

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:47.610
And I'm going to say Give the group name So that's all that's it I have to do if I don t

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.580
get ls it is going to give me that.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.050
That is a change in permissions.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.550
So if I do a diff,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.460
it will be able to clearly see that there is an additional for these describe parameters

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.000
and all those things What this group earlier we saw here,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.770
there's only really permissions now.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:13.070
It will also have some permissions to describe this particular parameter that is parameter

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.500
one,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.160
not all other parameter surges of fine grained permission so that the resources isolated

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.520
toe fortes parameter and the air it's listed there.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.900
So let's go ahead and deployed.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.450
That's the best way to take it out.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.900
So the stock is deployed.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.220
Let us go toe admin access.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.500
This is our admin access page.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.250
I'm going to go ahead and refresh this screen.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.880
You can see here.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.880
This isn't the doctor who would earliest and there is a new policy that has been a test and

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.160
in fact,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.350
we control policy.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.890
It will allow me to describe all these parameters for this particular source,

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.130
that is parameter one,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.050
if you remember parameter to has a fish slash gold so we don't have access to that.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:56.530
So this policy is actually not enough for going ahead and seeing it on the console later

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.160
School head and check it out.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.000
Here we have the parameter.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.050
Let me go ahead and describe it.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.450
The reason for that is when you're looking at in the console,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.850
you need describe parameters for describe parameter permissions.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.560
For all the parameters in your account,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.210
you can see here,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.980
it looks for the star privileges on.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.120
We don't have that.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.850
We give only privileges for particular resource here.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.780
So if you're going to do that in a C.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:21.900
L.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:21.970
A.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:22.440
For example,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.710
user one house and sdk or CLR access on.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.640
If the user is requesting the value for this particular parameter,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.110
then the user will be able to access the values.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.880
But in the console,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.710
when you're doing it,

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.000
you need privileges to list on the parameters.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.850
So that is what I'm going to show you next.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:45.250
How toe add a custom policy so that you can list all the parameters in your account.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.250
So let us go ahead and do that.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.080
That's what we're going to do.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.330
We're going to create.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.080
I am statement.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.260
So I'm going to call this group statement one because there can be many statements on the

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:00.630
other.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.050
I am.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.690
We have on a policy statement.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:10.260
So here you have that it is going to use the park mortal,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.950
which we are family with the principal actions Resource and FX.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:19.160
So the principle is going to be the group here on for effect what we're going to to assess

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.160
,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.450
we're going to say hello.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:30.230
I am on the affect dot alone you have that And then for resources were going to say all

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:40.520
resources because we're going to just describe them Onda for actions we're going to say a

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.940
system described the actions is also in a day.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.190
So we're going to put that in up records.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:51.190
So this is going to ss them cold and describe para meters.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:59.480
So this is good on guy usually personally recommend you to go ahead and add ons.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.840
Assaidi aside,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:07.000
is nothing but a small description off what this statement is allowing people to this case

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.000
.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.150
It is a describe on parameters in console.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:16.430
So when you go ahead and check it out and the statement in AWS console,

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.540
you'll find the bad.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.550
This is helpful.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.500
So that's all it is.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.120
So let us go ahead and synthesize.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.170
That's the type of there.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.640
Unless I take yourself.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.840
So just go ahead and deploy this.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.510
Remember,

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.760
I have not advice this ah statement of my group.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.000
So that is why it has not made any changes.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.550
So let me just add this privileges to my group.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.770
I forgot to that part Cornerstone group,

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.750
don't I?

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.930
We're not doing managed policy.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.340
We're going to just say at the policy on that,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:54.440
I'm going to say group statement one ls and get me to a CD in Different so that we know the

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.450
difference that the spirit is They're going to go out of the group.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:03.700
You can see here very clearly list that the sister describe parameters being added to the

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.950
principal construct group.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.250
So just go ahead and deployed.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.640
The stock is two point.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.960
That doesn't goto our private Brosa.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.320
You see?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.870
Hear them this user one.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.070
Let me refresh my screen.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.480
If the difference is not working,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.470
let me log out and log in on because sometimes cessation is not picking up the use a

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.130
variety,

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.750
a privilege that has been changed dynamically.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:32.250
So if I go to my parameter store now,

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.360
Andi,

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.020
I should be able to list on the parameters you can see here on.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.820
Remember this user that if usually one does not have privileges for the Swiss gold.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.530
We have just gave it a permissions poorly for this fish because go 11 omissions are not

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.610
that If I go ahead and click on that,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.550
it is going to give me an editor on the value.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.620
It's not civil.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.750
I will not be able to check any other attributes off this,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.530
but I'm a territory.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.850
But if I goto fish here,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.980
I have access toe.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.470
See that when you are,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.780
pick up this value and use it.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.320
So basically what we have done as we a graven,

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.630
fine grained access to a user using see decay to the point that you can restrict that you

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.110
said no particular resource on within that resource,

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.950
or so you can say one lead level permissions there.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.990
If I take you back to my admin console here under a group section we have this a policy

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.190
here.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.900
Let me just refresh the page here.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.020
Andi,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.780
if I go ahead and click on show policy particularly,

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.780
I wanted to show this essay the concept here.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.240
So you have a statement idea which describes why this particular statement has been added

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.900
into this.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.060
A policy here I would highly recommend you to go ahead and use this feature so that you

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.650
know why your particular policy has been added into this.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.600
So another thing is,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.000
this is an inland policy.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.250
Sometimes you want to create a customer managed to policy so that you can reuse that,

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.800
afford multiple services.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.750
So I'm sure you have to do that as well.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:06.040
So before we go ahead and see how to create a custom managed policies,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.150
let us go ahead and create a rule on for this.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:15.630
I'm going to call this role as a constant optional on we're going to give some issue to

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.830
privileges for,

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.490
to say,

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.330
rolled so that they can wanted to the easy to instances that have anything to second so

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.700
role under that,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:32.920
we're going to define the scope on we're going to say on stone ups Road on this is going to

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.390
be assumed to buy.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.370
I am going principle that is,

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:43.330
everybody in this account ho thesis probably can be assigning to are allocated to on We

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.140
have seen this earlier.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.800
How to pick up the account i d We have that won't and under cold or aws dot account i d.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.820
So we can pick up the value from there.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:58.240
So that is how the principal is created on for rolling.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.950
I'm going to use the same value has gone stone optional here.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:08.990
So we have created a road on Let us create and manage to policy so that we can add to this

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:14.900
manage for this little this little here and this managed to policy can be attached to any

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.310
user.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.750
Also,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.310
in this case,

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.380
I'm showing as an example of attaching it toe you wrote.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.110
So go ahead and attach it to a little groups or users.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.710
Whichever way you want to use them,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.250
list his it'll policy.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:33.750
So we have a contract.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.850
Something called us have managed to policy on.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.350
Once again,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.920
the scope is defined after the school where we're going to give the i d.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:50.810
So list easy toe instances and description is list is it?

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:57.320
Took instances in the region are this is going to be a policy show that is going to be

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:57.890
account.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.780
So that has changed That managed a policy name.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.060
I'm going to use this one,

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.240
Lee here on what is the permissions?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.020
So here,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.550
this is where the interesting part is that it's Ah,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.710
while you call the statements on you.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.990
As you notice earlier,

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.280
we can help multiple statements.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.780
So that is going to be a today.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.970
So let us open this on then.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.830
The first statement is going to be policy statement,

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.830
which you have seen earlier.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:24.350
Also,

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:32.940
I want to see statement on effort equals do and it's couple.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.470
And since we're following,

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.850
it is going to be a low on actions.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.620
So accents can also be in a hurry because they're gonna be multiple accents.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.420
In this case,

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:48.130
I'm going to just use a easy to gold and describe start.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.230
There can be multiple descriptions,

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.450
instances running the volumes and all those things.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.220
So and then,

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.920
if we want to check out approach alarms out there for that easy to insist that you need to

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.430
kill clothes,

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:06.010
which Coleridge is also something like cloudwatch describe star on If there are told what

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.360
metrics then you need to give them Also,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.190
cloudwatch get star.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:16.690
So these privileges would have noticed that my experience is barely enough toe get your

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.550
easy to dashboard concert working.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:23.010
So now we got our up in the park mortal.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:27.110
We got our effect off actions on resources So in this case,

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.010
the resources are going to be all off them.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.720
That is all the instances because this is an ops team on finally,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.310
we're goingto attach it to the are really that the operator?

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.090
So this is also going to be a list because there can be multiple roles that you want to

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:42.600
attach it.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.980
So in this case of just going to say,

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:54.200
const owner group on stone role obsolete So you if you have something like groups or users

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:54.200
,

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.180
you can attach that for the secret doors.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.960
I think you can see here for users also can attest this policy.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.020
So that's it.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.020
Let us go ahead and it's interstates.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.760
Our stack.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.850
If there are no others into school head and deploy,

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:08.550
that s well,

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.810
since the role is already completed.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:16.600
Lettuce goto our I am console.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.350
Here I am.

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.750
Remember,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.960
I'm on the main page here.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.060
I'm not on the user.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.070
One access because you said one does not have privileges.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:23.340
Toe.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.100
I am level.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:30.070
So let me just go toe rules on you can see here that is in a constant obstacle that has

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.740
been created.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.910
If I click on this that must be on at has managed policy,

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.610
you can see there's a manage policy.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:40.300
I can check the same thing by going to policies on under custom managed policy.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:46.540
I should be having that list easy to policy so you can see here the same permissions that

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:46.950
we get.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.450
So this is how you can create I am.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.200
Rules manage policies.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.650
Custom policies at actually them to different users are granted privileges to particular

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.590
resources using the grant option.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.540
What creating the stack it's for.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.910
Go ahead and try them.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:07.090
If you have any comments or questions or a better way of doing it to put them and Q and a

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.960
section we can learn from each other.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.530
Thanks for watching Happy learning
