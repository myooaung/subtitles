00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.300
hello,

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.870
folks.

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.360
But him to another episode on City que This time we're going to use indicate to create

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.360
users on add them to groups on,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.200
have a hierarchy in your head appears account.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.150
So this is a stack that we're going to use.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.280
So there are two important concepts that are required.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.360
One is the I am construct.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.100
Another one is a secrets manager.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.810
If you're wondering why we need a secrets manager,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.260
the basic concept off I am user requires and whose name on the passport.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.180
So in this case,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.500
for generating the password,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.560
we're going to use the secrets manager so that we can have and no complex password auto

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.530
generated for us.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.570
And then it will be stored in the sickest manager security for us.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.550
You can also use any test um,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.730
string our spring used to buy cold o r.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.080
It a Pacific itself.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.290
I'll show you put the matter so that you can use them to create I am users on.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.650
Remember,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.620
if I have already installed I am and Secrets Manager as the dependencies.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.870
So if you have not done that,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.120
go ahead and do that using the pip install hyphen,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.230
our requirements command.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.340
So let's go ahead and start building our first users.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.110
So I'm just going to call our flows to use a password because we need the password first.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.420
So let's just go ahead and generate them.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.130
Since we have seen how to create secrets earlier.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.750
Lettuce tool that faster.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.200
So here's a secret name.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.150
I'm just going to call it the secret vampires user One plus.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.640
So we have got our passport for our first fusion.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.350
So let's go ahead and build argues that itself.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.740
So we're going to use that I am concept for creating that usually this cold,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.130
as I thought user on then the school on bordered by the I.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.550
D.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.240
So,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.070
for bus word,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.680
we're going to use the other one dot secret value.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.830
It will automatically call on Pick it up So you can see here that the secret value dead on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.850
Then what is there going to be my user name?

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.850
I'm just for user name.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.650
I'm just going to say is that one here?

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.400
So we're all set for one user.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.030
Let me show you another mother.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.320
Also value can use custom generated password vary by that locally generated the password

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.070
and pass it on So I'm just going to say on user too,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.220
with literally passport on.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.950
Since we're goingto hard court the passport or show the password in the city can stack

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.280
itself.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.570
It is highly under recommended approach.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.470
But if you still want to use it for some reason you can use this just going to copy this

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.380
Construct here on day in store for this one.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.670
What we're going to say is cord our secret value Dark plain text on.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.260
In this case,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.960
I'm going to use a plane exports with this is the richness of course informing,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.520
you know,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.450
use this.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.140
So I'm going to say something like doing nos by I just,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:11.000
uh So finally,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.970
I just want contained this construct to user to one user tune.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.630
So we have got to users Onda,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.820
we should be better.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.160
Come on,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.730
the scene here,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:28.300
So just act this cover on business in the face of stack first if you are stuck in school,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.590
let go head on and deploy it.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:40.060
So when my stock is getting to pilot,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.870
does Goto Ah Consul in see what is happening there?

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.390
So this is my console right now and you can see here.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.740
That's when one user on that just refresh my screen.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.660
There's another stack that is getting built for now.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.340
Eso using a screen test,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.950
but they just go ahead and take it out here.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.650
You can see here people to users on both of them are not part of any groups.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.860
So if you want to give the user name as for the supplies but also to some use,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.370
and what we can do is we can use that.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.050
I'll put off for matter so that you can also generate the log and you had a or so.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.170
So I'm just going to quickly show you hope you can use that.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.620
So value is where the interesting part happens.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.530
What we're going to do is I'm going to construct the string from my account.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.900
ID's on my count that is available at court.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.520
What aws dot com i d.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.260
So once they get my contract it,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.420
then I can just like in my that you are signing dog aws.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.540
Start amazon dot com slash concert so that should be good.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.440
Just I'm going to deploy this again.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.680
So what this is going to do is if I go to my tour formation stack now under output section

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.290
as often,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.890
Innocenti.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.600
As soon as the stack gets completed,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.290
we will be having an awkward which will kill that you are in for you have to sort of the

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.430
usual toe can be center that the military's off the long and you are ask unless that

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.750
passport separated so that they would have the access chills to start being productive.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.950
So we have done here.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.790
So let me just see here.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.590
So we gotta put your just going to copy this on the letters,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.970
go ahead and put it into another project moment where I am in a different Roeser.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.950
Now I am the private browsing more so that we can go ahead and open that.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.230
So this is first users to on for password.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.940
If you remember,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.440
we used to hear password.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.630
I'm just going to copy this.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.450
And he was this?

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.850
Yeah,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.640
as off.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.830
No.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.020
You know where we have not given any promises for those users.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.780
But this user,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.650
if I just goto ecstasy or any service you can see here that is an error displaced because

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.090
we have not given any privileges at all for this king.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.130
So even if we go here,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.980
that user is not part of any group and there are no permissions.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.750
So let us go ahead and add a group and add one off these users into that group.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.630
So let's go ahead and add a group here.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:29.170
I went about this group as a constant group and here one second you're going to use that I

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.250
am constrict.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.550
That is the correct spelling.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:39.840
So again followed by my Heidi on my group name.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.350
That's as simple as that.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:48.290
Okay,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.060
now we have created a group on.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.360
Let us go ahead and add that you should also that's very simply done.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.630
Content group dot after school,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.910
usually what we're going to on,

00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:59.920
then they're going to act.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.150
Use that to here.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.830
So did we create a butt off them as user one itself,

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.150
which has changed it.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:17.080
So this is going to be used to now I'm just going to quest,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.650
uh,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:25.430
synthesised stacked made to make sure that they're not made any errors on discordant

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.400
deployed since we confirmed the staggers.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.970
But good,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.880
so know what is going to happen.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.860
It's a new group.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.430
I am group called this constant Group is going to get created on then that he was a user

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.950
that is used to will be adolescent member off this constant group.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:46.620
So let us go here on the groups you can see it is a group that is headed and assault.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:46.770
No,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.320
that's zero user stare as soon as my stack completes,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.810
which will be able to see the user toe that it's about being adults.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.020
Remember off the article,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.780
so the user to has been updated.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.920
That is not dead complete.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.050
That means that the membership has been updated there.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.250
So I just go to our group.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.650
No,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:10.790
we'll get out to the first page so you can see here.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.270
There's a usual to that has been added to this group,

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.870
So that is how simple it is to create users on I Am group.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.110
I would like you to explore how to set a password.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.730
Policies are how to set up,

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.050
but hierarchies are part boundary permissions.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.650
Also using the city concept.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.690
Go and explore them.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.690
If you have trouble,

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.190
put them in the question.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.170
Answer discussions.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.590
As a community,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.860
we can all learn from each other
