00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.380
Hello,

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.810
folks.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.880
Welcome back in continuing the CTK cities to religious.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.040
See how we can prepare for your deployments in your environment when you make some changes

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.300
to it.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.110
Infrastructure.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.920
It is always good to know what kind of changes that will be there on what is the impact off

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.960
those changes in your environment,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.800
whether the resources are going to be deleted or whether the losers are going to be created

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.510
or the existing resources are going to be modified.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.000
Now that all our infrastructure is cold,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.840
it should be possible for us to do it.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.470
If so,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.330
you can do that and find out what are the changes on how it is going to be impacted,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.580
which is very familiar toe anybody who is using kids or Washington your system.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.670
So when you do it,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.610
if you are going to have a deeper understanding off your core on,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.320
then for example,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.390
if that is an S three bucket that is going to be fortified with some public access are

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.250
going to remove some public access for public website,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.490
Then you can be more careful not to quit.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.060
Those changes are have some additional controls and approval mechanism for those kind off

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.250
impactful changes.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.090
So let us go toe over environment here.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.900
This is the stack that we have been using for deploying or estate bucket.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.580
You can see here that is questioning is enabled on encryption Also what set with K must

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.390
manage So let us go toe and when which itself to see them.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.470
So the system bucket.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.610
If I go to my properties,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.180
you see question is enable for some reason your department or your team things that you

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.350
don't ever need questioning for your bucket.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.140
Then we need to disable them.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.940
Unlike wise,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.650
If I goto my default encryption gutsier came is encryption without the campus air and it is

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.110
there.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.350
So let's go ahead and change it to an extreme manage encryption.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.370
Likewise,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.340
they just try to make one more change here.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.600
If I goto permissions,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.250
you can see here public access is off,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.170
so I want to block on public access to my bucket.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020
So that is what I'm going to try and do.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.400
Now I go back to my coat.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.770
It is as simple as changing my wishing to force here on then for extreme managed.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010
I'm just going to remove this Andi.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.490
If I throw a dart here,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
it gives me an option about all the different encryption mechanisms.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.900
I'm just going to choose history manage this time on the final game that we wanted to do

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.380
Waas blocking public access.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.100
So let's go ahead and trying to that block public access on in this case for rocking public

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.800
access.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.200
So we have on a redefined the meaning here on you can see there are different options.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.830
For example,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.650
you want to block only public issues or you want to block Electra public access or really,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.500
the new issues that are coming in it is Start with blocking all effects of public access

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.900
here.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.150
So little school head and save this fine on.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.450
I'm just going to activate my virtual environment.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.210
Remember,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.590
this is the most important thing when you want to work with the city K.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.700
So I'm activating my winter environment and do CTK Ellis to see whether my stack is having

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.360
any errors or not.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.690
So now that we are,

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.110
Stack is not having any errors,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.530
they just go ahead and do it if and see what differences that will be impacted in my and my

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.640
team,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.010
I know.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.930
So the command for that CD case spaced if on it is going to combat it with the existing

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.100
environment stack.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.280
With the new changes appear made on,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.080
it highlights it with different colors.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.950
You can see here we have changed the algorithm from AWS came us to and server side A to 56

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.950
.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.960
Likewise,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.210
the bubbly access have brought public access,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.940
has been unable.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.400
That's true on the listening is also being disabled.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.130
And that would be one more thing about it will say that whether your pocket is going to get

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.660
modified or updated,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.350
we can go ahead and see that in the stack Said s Well,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.590
so it is deployed.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.390
This change.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:47.230
So once the deployment triggers and let us go door confirmation and see whether we can find

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.350
the same changes that we have triggered here will be going there.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.870
Another recommendation,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.100
from my aside,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.940
is there is a ton off longer that indigent by CTK,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.010
so you can push all this logging information into your but management system or some kind

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.170
of a monitoring system to measure how many changes have been introduced into our production

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.690
environment.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.850
Harmony changes are damage of the when one meant harmony.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.120
Defects are the harmony.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.040
Break it and is that so you can have a dashboard on have rich experience off whole?

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.750
What is happening in your environment?

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.310
Unlike what you can have.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.720
Some approved mechanisms also possible so you can see the stackers deployed already.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.180
So before blowing and changing,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.460
I just want to go ahead and take you to the throat formation here on day in just a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.550
freshness screen here.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.510
So the status update Did that mean many Meister's and see here that has changed its on.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.830
The team says every time you together change from your CTK and new change said is created

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.590
with an unique I.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.950
D.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.110
So you can die this unique I d along with your long from your CTK on.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.060
Find out what changes was made on what changed it was created.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.220
And what is the identifier?

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.030
So here you can go ahead and take the Jason changes on it is going to list off the same

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.950
thing that we just know folk a boat,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.120
for example,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.740
here is the block public access configuration on like why,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.810
so we will be able to find the washing configuration as well it's the encryption

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.050
configuration or so so the bucket encryption.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.010
So there's one more thing here.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.860
The action keywords and you can see here are action is going to be modifying in case if you

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.190
are looking for changing the bucket name like we did in the previous the demonstration you

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.810
will be seeing and stuff are modifiable be saying that the new the successively created So

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.570
now that we understood that changes that has been triggered on the death element is also

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.910
updated and changed it.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.750
Let us see where the detainee is actually getting implemented.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.420
Let me leave the spirit.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.590
Asset is I'm just going to talk to get this page on.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.280
You can see it.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.990
That's a block.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.650
Public access.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.850
A swing set is no here on all the values are also know here.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.020
If I go back to my previous tab,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.440
you can see her on the values her off.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.050
Likewise,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.030
if I call here and then go to my properties,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.580
my questioning should be turned off.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.260
Unlike waste,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.710
my encryption is also said to a is 2 56 So that is how you use def command toe.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.240
Understand what changes are going to be made When you make a change,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.200
your confirmation.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.010
Andi,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.690
stop deploying it and finding out.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.060
But that was a making change before itself.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.210
You can take some corrective actions on deploy the successful changes wanted to your

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.150
production environment.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.350
Thanks for watching Happy lying.
