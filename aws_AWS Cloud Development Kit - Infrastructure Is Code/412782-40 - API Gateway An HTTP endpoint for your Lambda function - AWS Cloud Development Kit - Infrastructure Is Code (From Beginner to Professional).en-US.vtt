00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.190
Hello,

00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.040
everyone,

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.520
welcome back to another lecture on city game today.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.390
We're going to talk about a be a gateway when you're running a service in AWS.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.970
Whether the service or micro services an easy to Orlando function,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.550
it is ideal tohave.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.840
It front ended with an A p A.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.350
Get with so that you have controls and Mike Anderson's like Portion control or throttling.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.450
Or you can have a different stages for production on a test environment on the Dell as well

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.070
On You can also have deployed it edge optimized way so that the agency for your services is

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.450
.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.910
also reduced.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.170
So they get offers month and full integration for the back.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.360
And,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.840
for example,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.360
you can directly connect yourself extra service or animal DP service or different kind of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.530
functionalities available in this demo.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.010
What we're going to do is we're going to approach in an A P.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.600
A gateway on that you get with is going to point to a lambda function,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.760
so whenever you are in walking or accessing the A P,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.100
a gateway you are the Lambda function will be involved on.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.830
It will give us and rest forms,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.830
so we're going to use a very simple lumber function.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.650
You can go ahead and I had any Linda function off your choice.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.700
But in this demo,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.400
I just use a simple hello world that perfection.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.620
So let's go to our city,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.850
get back and see how we can build this.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.880
This is the city gets stack that we're going to use.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.360
Andi.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.640
I have named it as custom a p a gateway Stack on.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.230
You can see here there are some resources.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.630
But for example,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.800
I have already cornered the Lambda function.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.720
I'm reading the Lambda function called Hello World And then I'm creating a constant

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.260
function.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.210
That's all it is there,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.140
nothing else on off course that is in law group so that we can store the information from

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
the I Lambda function on Clean it up when the stack,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.700
it's dilated.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.010
So there is an entry for an 88 Wait.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.770
So we are going to build it there since we're going to use and new more deal from sitting a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.400
little school had an imported into our equipments pile.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.710
Now we have important it on also installed it.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.850
So it is close this and go back to locating our stack.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.350
I'm going toe imported here into my stack.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.190
So let's go ahead and start building in when you're talking about him being good with that

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.940
are my temple wears off integrating it that at best,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.900
a p a indication on the Lambda AP integration In this case,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.180
we're when we use a land of function as the backend.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.860
So I'm going to use a lambda S t a b a asked my integration point.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.980
We will see that in a short,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.670
quite late to start building our ap get May So under it vacated model.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.540
If I do a dart,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.390
you will see all the different type of integrations.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.920
For example,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.070
I spoke about eight of this integration for escalate service on.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.160
We also have a landline recently and the rest API integrations or different things.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.920
So we're going to use in this case Lambda rest FBI on that score.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.260
But to do this stack and name it as well And finally,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.280
what is going to make back?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.390
And so in this case,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.590
since I'm using a Lamba rest a pia,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.400
there is a parameter called as handler on.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.480
I just have to give my functions are simple as that You just go head on and give you a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.810
function name on.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.850
Then we're done.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.850
We don't have to do anything else.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.850
Silly games going to fill in on the other Default by news that are required for going toe

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.640
your AP,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.100
for example.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.740
This is going to build a proxy integration.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.040
That means that any matter whether you're doing a put metal or get matter or delete,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.710
everything is sent to the Lambda function.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.140
Lambda,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.150
we're goingto handle the different http matters So once we deployed really go ahead and see

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.270
Onda as usual,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.630
I'm going to add an output so that we know that you are off the a p a gateway that we need

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.050
to hit.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.070
So let us add the open function also.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:49.540
So we have a little over a p a.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.350
Get meant Let us go ahead and sensational stack.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.790
Everything looks good.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.350
Let's go ahead and deploy it.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.200
So what?

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.650
This is deploying Lexus school and check out in our consul.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.810
So I am in my lumber service right now.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.100
There are no functions in a short while,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.680
we should be able to see a function on.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.510
Likewise,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.160
we don't have any.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.770
AP is also So let this go on.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.680
Check it out here.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.850
So my stack is completed.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.430
Let herself go and check our lambda function first.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.400
We should have a simple lambda function.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400
Care on.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.010
Likewise,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.750
The most important thing is over a piece of lettuce.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.750
Go ahead and see what appears that there.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.960
So we have the Johnstone AP endpoint and automatic taters.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.510
Departures an edge optimize.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.610
You can see here the lot of values that you are providing is automatically same default as

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.620
they call it and civic A their configured for you on as I said,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.950
Listen,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.750
proxy integration for Go ahead on check on that.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.300
You see,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.760
here there is an integration request that goes to my London function.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.400
That is a constant function on then my sponsors or so sent back as it is so you can go

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.590
ahead and tested here also.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.480
But if I navigate through that you are that is shown here.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.810
You can see the your list available here,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.250
as well as if you go to your cloud formation or put section.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.530
You can go ahead happiness,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.020
Ural,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.550
and put it into your brother on.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.620
We will be able to see a response from the Lambda function.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.400
Except you can see here it's a It's a hello from this function I knew.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.670
I mean for data through an A p a gate with,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.670
so you can do the same thing terrace believe Since this method is not requesting any

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.730
parameters or anything,

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.500
we just go ahead and click on test.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.760
You should be getting a response just to be sure that the responses coming from our Lambda

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.490
function you can go ahead and check it until George Logs.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.750
You can see the two implications that we have been on that log stream should have that

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.920
information there so you can see here these other two invocations One was from a proxy

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.990
request Act directly from the Web site,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.880
or so we did it.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.980
So that is how you deploying a P A for your lambda functions or any other lips.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.820
Always that your money on it being it,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.240
whereas a lot of functionality,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.600
I implore you to call head and try older,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.120
different combinations off AP get recreating the status or changing the AP get with name

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.680
itself,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.830
are doing a different self integrations say they get support all off them.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.230
If you have any problems for them.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.450
In the comments be our can learn from each other s and community.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.250
I keep improving the equal system.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.010
Thanks for watching Happy learning.
