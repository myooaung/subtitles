00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
Hey there.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.990
Thank you very much for choosing the scores on taking the time to become an expert in seedy

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.680
que onda Ada viewers.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.040
Let me walk you through how this course has been structured so that you can get the maximum

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.150
value for your time and effort you are putting in.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.800
This course has been structured in four basic models on in These basic models will go ahead

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.320
and see how the concepts are.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.920
Therefore CTK on from their own words.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.640
You'll go ahead and start building higher level at once concept.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.190
So let's go ahead and see what are these four basic concepts that we have in Chapter one?

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.970
We're starting at the very beginning.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.700
We're introducing ourselves to see DK on.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.310
Then you're going ahead and finding what are the prerequisites?

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.200
What is the insulation requirements?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.090
Creating our first stack on deploying it,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.930
deleting it.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.140
I'm creating some best practices out offer,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.800
So that is what we're going to see on the first chapter on in the second chapter.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.550
What we're going to do is we're going to take it one step forward.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.330
I'm here.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.610
We're going to create some silicate resources.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.020
We tap it on top off the existing resources we are going toe,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.290
customize them by creating some bootstrap comments on.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.340
Then we're going to create a multi account,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.190
multi region deployments.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.030
So these are all the indications off all the different topics.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.670
It is not just these ones that will be other models also there.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.950
So on the chapter three,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.290
we're going to take it a little bit one step forward on we're going to create our data

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.790
basis.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.110
We're going to create essence topics and queues and user ladies and customize our policies

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.460
on See how we can do it with minimum quoting or minimum effort.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.250
So once we have this basics,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.210
we take it a little bit for higher level.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.920
Now on,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.230
we're talking about several s applications.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.890
Lambda functions AP a gateways on the custom dashboards,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.530
alarms,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.120
matrices,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.450
custom logs and all those sort of things.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.660
So once we have all these tools that in our hand,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.790
then we go ahead to Chapter five,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.550
which is going to combine all these concepts on start Really,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.250
at once use cases in these use cases,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.480
you will see how to create some must stream processes.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.530
You will create some even drew on architectures you will create some containerized

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.330
applications,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.380
so you will see all those use cases.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.650
And finally,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.260
when it comes to a chapter six,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.350
you put all your experience that you have learned so far in creating and chat blobby

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.060
application on all the court for that is also provided here.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.200
So you go ahead and created on Gasol,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.950
your friends with the stat application.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.050
So let us go and take it one step forward.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.600
Now you learn CTK.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.350
You're deploying applications.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.850
Rachael,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.900
you go next.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.020
What I've done is I've created a list off activity that you can take it on your own sweet

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.850
time on.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.680
Then go ahead and show it to the world.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.150
It is a kit of repository off a lot of challenges and you can go ahead and do it on your

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.240
own personal time or work with your friends and see what you can build with.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.400
Finally,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.850
to help you with all this activity,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.830
I put together a complete list off resources that will walk you through with all the demos

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.680
and everything on most of the code is available in gator on.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.080
You can go ahead and forget on Makesem pulled request.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.050
If there is an improvement that you need to make.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.400
Finally,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.540
if you have gone through all this way,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.490
I would like to see you on the other side.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.930
Then you are becoming acidic.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.690
Expert.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.600
Thanks for taking the time and see you in the first lecture.
