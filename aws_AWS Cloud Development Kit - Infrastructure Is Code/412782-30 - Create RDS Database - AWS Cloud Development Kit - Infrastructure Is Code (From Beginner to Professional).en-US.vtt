00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
Hello,

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.210
folks.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.350
Welcome back to another episode on Siri K.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.370
This time we're going to talk about creating ideas,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.040
instances for our database behind our applications.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.570
When you're talking about ideas,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.040
you can use them for Oracle databases or my sequel or post race or Maria TB,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.350
or any of the flavors that you like in the Microsoft stable on.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.090
In this case,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.890
in this demo,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.510
we're going to see how to create on my sequel database for our application.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.310
So the architects of that we're going to build is going to look something like this we're

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.490
going to have on back in as a my sequel database on the front and side.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.500
We will have you.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.450
Is he doing senses running inside an auto scaling group,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.230
which is front ended by an application with PAL itself.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.540
So we will long into one of those easy to instance,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.360
and try to see if we can connect to a database losing the delegates host name and the usual

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.450
alien password that has been generated on for the password.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.240
We're going to use the AWS secrets on that secret is going to be automatically generated

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.250
for us and put it to the secrets manager which can be used with other applications.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.850
Also.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.490
So this is architectural.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.650
Let us go ahead on to see how we can builders indoor CTK stack.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.250
Since we're going to build and treated architecture that is going to be a BBC toe host all

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.180
the infrastructure.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.290
So we're going to build on BBC Stack here on that,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.720
maybe see is going to provide on multi SCB P C with 67 It's that it's a public on the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.960
private and then isolated submits in the private ones were going toe brunch an obligation

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.780
stack which is going to provide us application load balancer,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.700
the auto Scaling group,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.160
the launch configurations and also there easy to instances that is going to run beside

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.190
inside them on If you see here we are importing the VPC that has been created here on

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.580
likewise,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.340
when you're talking about the database stack,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.790
we are importing the BBC on also the security groups from the application servers that are

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.470
going to talkto ahead at this instance.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.100
So this is the BBC sec.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.980
Nothing fancy here.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.590
We have seen it plenty of times,

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.300
So this is the entire court that we're going to use for launching the BBC.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.280
So I'm just asked me.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.120
I've seen it many times.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.290
I'm going to leave it as it is.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.650
There's no going to be any updates there on likewise in the application stack.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.050
Also,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.250
we're just going to use the Amazon line except for are easy to instances operating system

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.600
and then we're going to use.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.120
And,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.550
uh,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.050
it will be for obligation load balancer for our French ending application.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.100
Onda.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.880
We also are exposing our order scaling group so that we can pick up the security group

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.300
later for our database.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.390
So finally,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.920
since we're going toe build the RDS database,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.700
I have added the ideas package construct into a recover Mintz.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.120
Why?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.550
Let us go ahead and install the RDS package.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.640
Know that we have installed our ideas.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.960
Dependence packets it is.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.520
Go ahead and start building our earliest stack.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.940
We don't need these fines anymore because we have taken the inputs and have passed on to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.310
them.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.230
You can see here I have been about the basic concept of the class and I also imported the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.770
BBC and Auto Scaling Group.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.550
If you're wondering,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.950
just going to show it again under the app dot file.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.910
You can see here that is,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.070
that it ever stack on.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.320
I'm importing the VPC,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.670
which is coming from Michael et a repeat c Stackley PC on then from the application stack,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.220
I am importing the Application Security Group.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.870
Also,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.080
that is auto scaling group doctor Connection.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.890
Start security groups that were imported close to you.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.150
Let us see how to use them.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.270
So the first step is believed in my ideas.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.010
Instance on if you also notice that I have imported the ideas instance.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.580
Also the easy to the peasy tools for picking up the sub nets and a few other instance

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.550
classes also.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.040
So let us start by building or about database.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.940
So I'm going to call this asked constant db on the under this we will have a non artist

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.200
concept on.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.250
We have something called us and database instance.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.900
Let me just type it out So you get all the attributes so we're scope it once again to self

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.750
on then.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.360
But then self,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.750
we will create our ideas.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.680
Instance I d onda.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.880
We start building or master part user name.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.300
Now this is going to be the user name that is going to be used for my database.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.970
In this case,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.010
I'm just going to cause this as mystique.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.550
Mustard on.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.220
You can have whatever name you want,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.040
but make sure just a conforming to tow the database engine that you're using on.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.700
I'm not going to provide any password on when I don't provide anything.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.480
What is going to happen is City gets going to automatically create a secret on past that

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.470
secret for our database on.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.160
We can see the value in our secrets manager later.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.590
What's the status tip like before going and they're operating the devastation.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.390
Let us create a name for our database.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.580
And since this is a constant baby,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.870
I'm going to call this as a constant DP it's of on.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.110
Then let us talk about the engine on for engine.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.800
This is going to be ideas.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.250
Dart database.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.690
Instance.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.570
Engine on.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.380
This is an in home values of and I dough dot You get all the flavors off the depositions

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.500
that is supported on.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.550
We're going to use the mice equal one.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.700
Next is the VPC.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.080
So we have our important BBC just defined that there in port number on.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.560
I'm going to run it in the default port that is 3306 If you want to go ahead and trying it

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.340
in a different port,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.180
that is also flying on.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.310
But this is going to be demo.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.870
So I'm just going to use the t 4 30 kicks off.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.260
Remember,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.410
if our storage for my database on whether it is want to be muddy,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.580
easy or not on once again,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.880
as this is going to be demo,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.080
I'm going to say false.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.810
And if you just change the value true,

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.210
then you'll have to databases conflict for you on multiple over the British on

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.950
configuration.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.240
So whether you know what I want a cloudwatch long exports.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.530
What this going to do?

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.390
This it is going toe alot me toe Send some logging information whether it is audit long

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.940
enter longer general slow Katie,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.380
log on.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.670
All the information can be passed on to cloudwatch on.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.790
We can make some mattresses out off that.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.130
So I'm just going to say Heather also I like on that is something called us a general

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.820
logging whether it's who's lying and who's failing,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:16.240
belong and all this kind of information on then finalise local Very so now we're done with

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.660
the what kind of information you want.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.610
Toe monitor.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.960
Then what type of instance of a though it is going to Bt to Micro instance,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.200
or Devi Micro instance of what is the type of instance,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.580
so that separates class on here is whether easy to construct importers coming into picture

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.960
instance class or instance.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.330
Type.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.750
If I remember correctly.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.450
Andi off.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:47.510
And here we have to bring in the instance class you have eagle on.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.180
We want a Bastable one so that if that is an additional demand for databases,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.630
we can meet it on.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.550
The type is going to be.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:04.450
Our size is going to be my girl so you can go ahead and use any of the values that is

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.430
shooting to your requirements.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.040
On what,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.910
is it going to be removed?

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.030
Policy Again?

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.400
I'm going to remove Allah.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.330
I'm going to ask a syndicated Remove it whenever the stock it's deleted.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.570
But if you don't want your neighbors to be deleted,

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.800
just go ahead and make sure you tighten retain.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.820
And in this case,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.100
I'm going to just I destroyed because I don't want you said I was after This demo is

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.580
completed on delusion for It's another way of protecting your data bases dilation policy.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.850
This is a boolean value on I'm going to say Do not protect my database from the status,

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.610
are trying to delete the database itself or somebody's again deleted.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.120
Then they need to change this flag and then noted a developed village on what happens to

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.430
the automated backups.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.600
So I'm going to say daily to my automated backups.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.080
Also again,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.950
that is a bullion value on how long do you want to retain your backups on?

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.480
In this case,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.640
I'm just going to say,

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.090
I want to retain my backup.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.050
So for seven days,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.320
so that's it.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.090
We're done with the most off our database complications here.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.010
I'm just going to synthesize are stacked to see.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:13.510
Everything is good so far for everything isn't to say so so far.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.960
We should be able to get our database instance so before there is one more step,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.770
that is alarming our application servers to connect to our database instance at the thought

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.610
of scaling group.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.210
So if your room where we have imported our auto scaling group here,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.550
let me just for this one.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.170
So the auto scaling group so that might be more than one artist security groups in,

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:35.370
say,

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.390
the auto scaling security groups.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.000
So we're going to do afford up.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.340
This is a typical bite on foreign loop.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.510
So for security Group in Auto Scaling Group,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.470
what we're going to do is we're going to add them into the database security group database

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.470
.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.050
Your connections dot allow default.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:09.020
We have something called As a low default poured from SG on.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:16.970
We're going to add a description also to say that this is going toe hello easy to SG access

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.470
Door,

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.250
I guess.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.590
My sequel instance.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.580
So that's it.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.600
Once again,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.850
I'm going to synthesize Short Stack to make sure that we have type did everything correctly

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:27.850
.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.580
And if this is done,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.710
I'm going to go ahead and initiate that deploy.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:40.450
And since my database stack is dependent on my up stack and after a separate on my BBC

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.020
stack,

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.160
I'm just going toe,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.540
say,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:49.410
deploying my DB stack and it is going to automatically deploy my APP seller as well as the

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.380
BBC's tackle so you can see here automatically to speaking of the dependencies and listing

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.020
it and starts going to deploy when this is going to deploy this and because I just usually

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.650
takes about 5 to 10 minutes to get completely deployed.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.110
What I'm going to do is I'm just going toe all put the value off my database instance so

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.470
that we can go ahead and connect it.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.030
But one more thing that I want to go inform us some off.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.310
The concept that we're using can be experimental in nature.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.320
So what I mean by that is if I take you to the database,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.650
instance acidic a documentation page.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.830
This is the value that we're tryingto open in our court formation stack that this DB

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.100
instance in point at risk I even see here under the stability is experimental.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.540
That is today when I'm recording it on things that improving constantly.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.710
So by the time you see it are start practicing it by the experimental might be stable on

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.950
this value might change into something girls.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:45.910
But this is how you need to go hair adapt to the changes on see what improvisations you

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.220
need to make or what changes you need to make a record,

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.420
but constantly different to the documentation off.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.950
Something is breaking coming back.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.810
Checking the documentation itself.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.980
So this is what we're going to try and exports so that we can easily connect to our

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.750
database.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:06.220
Now we have wiped out the awkward command.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.110
So once this deployment is completed,

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.530
our district another deployment.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.470
What that will do is just add the cell could value into the cloud formations tackle puts.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.130
So once that is done,

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:22.720
we can just go ahead and check out the database itself on the Secrets Manager password,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.360
and then we'll pick it up on Goto are easy to instance,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.130
and try to log in to lazy to incense and connect or database.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.600
So let's wait for a stack to get deployed as off.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:31.750
No,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.200
you can see here when the absolutes getting to part,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.350
it is going to take a few minutes for our absolute and then they have is to come online.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.760
No,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.220
I was Tank has got deployed.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.280
I'm just going to go ahead and deployed against so that our good fortune it also beat.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.120
And so,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.690
meanwhile,

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.740
when this is getting to play,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.350
let us court over concern and check what has happened there.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.360
So this is our formation here.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.300
Let's go to our stack section on.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.960
We should be able to feed three stacks here.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.500
When is the BBC and abstract on the database stack?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.260
If I go to my databases on the resources,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.230
I should be finding the ideas instance.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:13.230
Let me just go ahead on and refresh my page here on the databases.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.150
I should be having one database there.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:20.810
Onda here is our artist instance and all the confirmations that were provided here should

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:21.580
be here.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:29.040
So that is a Tito db 32 micro instance and then the constant TV as a database name on for a

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.320
master user name we gave us Mystic Master on,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.800
but it's going to be the passport.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.350
So if I go to my secrets manager Andi Goto secrets,

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.200
that should be a new secret.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.360
Here you can see here that the constant secret generated by by Sirikit Stack for this

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.860
particular stack on defy Go on,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.430
scroll down.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.670
That's a ticket value and you will see the end adjacent feed that we're going to use the

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.950
horse named report the engine and the database name and everything.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.930
So we're going to use this information to connect to our database now.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:04.480
So for that we're going to goto our easy to incenses.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.550
These are our running inside and auto scaling group,

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.000
which is for Internet by an application.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.850
So if you just load any PHP application or any application,

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.550
then you should be able to connect with peppers.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.520
But since we're not having any application,

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.780
I'm just going to go and connect to the console on used a my SQL plant itself to connect to

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:21.490
the database.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:28.540
So I have already Bree installed in the user data script PHP in my school claimed.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.740
So if I just type in my school,

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.610
it is going to give me the my school prompter,

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.550
saying I'm not providing the user name and password on the date of his whole string.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.540
So you find go and check whether my stack is completed.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.230
You can see here the entire you are sprinted out here.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.800
Likewise.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.450
If I go to my cloud formation on output section,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.340
let me see that it is here.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.700
I'm just going to copy this.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.120
Andi goto our consular killing and placed it here on for bus work again.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.350
Pick it up from our secrets manager here.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.300
So this is the password on.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.450
Let us go ahead and placed it here.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.060
So we got connected food.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.330
We just to be sure.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.300
I'm just going to say that the show data basis on which have had a default list of

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.150
databases.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:16.600
So what we have done so far is we went ahead on defined our ideas.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:24.220
Instance Andi deploy the ideas instance behind an application stack and connected to our on

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.840
connected our application sellers to the databases and check the connected.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.590
Using the mice equal flagged.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.270
Go ahead and try it.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.320
If you have any problems,

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.690
put them in the Q and A section.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.220
I'll try and help them with you.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:35.970
Until then,

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.940
thanks for watching Happy Learning.
