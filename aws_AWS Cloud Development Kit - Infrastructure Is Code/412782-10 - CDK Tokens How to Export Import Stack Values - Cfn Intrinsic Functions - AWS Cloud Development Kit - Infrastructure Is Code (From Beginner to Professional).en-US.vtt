00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
enter falls.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.080
Welcome back,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.510
Inventing or CTK.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.170
Siri's Let us talk about city get tokens,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.690
which is very similar to the confirmation intrinsic functions that you might be using.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.460
Takeover scenario value or creating and publication.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.470
Whenever we're talking about a member application,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.300
that is always some more friend and stack that you will deploy,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.050
which will have s three bucket.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.200
But when you put in,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.980
the CS is on synthetic objects that are required for your website on.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.180
Then,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.910
when you're grading your Web servers,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.650
you need a pass on the information off Minister pocket which region it is located on.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.280
Other information about the bucket needs to go into your left ear stack,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.950
so you need that information from one stack to go to another stack.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.490
Typically,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.890
what happens is if your family with more information what you will do is you will write in

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.520
old Foot.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.820
As you can see here,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.220
you'll say,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.700
this is my pocket I d.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.960
On.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.040
This is the bucket name on you use the export functionality in one off the stacks on you.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.580
Will you go ahead on import that value into Europe tear stack so that the market can be

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.660
used when you're talking about the city,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.310
get you have a similar functionality here on that functionality is exposed by the cold off

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.670
city.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.650
Except so let us go and see the documentation for that.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.850
So under core,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.240
you will find something called a sissy Fono porch.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.940
Or if research for outputs,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.440
your begetting that on,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.160
then let us go toe foot section.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.000
You can see your volume dimension is a logical i d on what value it will be on if you want

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.850
to apply some conditions are descriptions on what should be the export name or so so that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.450
the other sex can big it up.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.060
So we're going to try this in our account now.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.780
So the other benefit off tokens are these offering values.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.460
The tokens can be a string value,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.130
or the tokens can be in list value or it can be a number.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.490
So since we're running it in a real gold,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.330
you will be able to print it out.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.910
What do you see?

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.310
All the guns.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.200
Only something like this.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.330
You see a token value like since some tokens are string values,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.940
you can do some links.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.040
Check for example,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.560
if you're getting it from another stack.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.250
You don't know what values are passed to you.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.520
You cannot trust the value mass it is.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.550
So you need to do some validation on since you're writing the entire stack and really cold

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.550
,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.340
even go ahead and manipulate them.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.110
Find out the link with their especially characters are there or in guesses,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.250
you're creating a bucket name.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.350
You cannot have income,

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.260
our dot or some special characters it so you can go ahead and manipulate that spring,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.680
will you?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.150
And then put it into your function so they just go to our stack.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.910
So here on the project director,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.380
let me activate My ritual in mind went first.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.380
So here is my stack here.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.130
So let us go ahead and try and create another bucket.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.730
So for opening a function,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.080
we need to told this value in tow.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.140
Object.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.500
So let us go ahead and create another Birgit.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.990
I'm going to call this as my pocket on.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.750
Then let us go ahead and quickly added another bucket.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.250
It's so this is going to be my bucket.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.650
My bucket,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.200
I d.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.680
So I'm not going to add any description or anything in any other values here.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.060
Just leave it as it is.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.900
So next is going to be are going to export this while you are used to see if an output.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.060
So I always prefer toe store the output are this told them in the object.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.120
So I'm just going to call this as open one or if you have one to have multiple annuals,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.950
that it's also possible so that you could keep on incriminating and find out which puts

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.650
have been banner,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.150
which reports that would not be bad.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.160
So we already important court.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.430
You can see here the beginning.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.980
You have a core here so you can go ahead and access the objections,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.570
said Core on.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.750
We're going to use the CF an output.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.360
So once again,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.350
the scope is defined on going to call this as my bucket of foot one on.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.020
Then I'm going toe actor by new again.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.360
We're talking about vital functions so we can use a very simple white on what was here.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:22.970
So here I am going to say are just not doing this way.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.960
That is just the first time that I do just like this.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.810
My bucket question.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.970
It is not just like this.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.450
My bucket docked,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.320
but get name you can see here.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.340
All the attributes off the market are listed here some just time.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.180
We're going to just use the market name.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.560
That's it on then,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.050
if you want to our description for this.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.090
So I'm just going to copters as this is.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.880
Remember,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.260
the description has to be string well,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.340
new my first to see the work id on.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.950
We also need an export.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.640
When your password you can see here.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.950
That is export name.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.970
I'm just going to use the same thing that it seems to be here spilling here.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.750
Let us go ahead and choose that.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.120
So let us see if everything is fine.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.650
Let's do one scenic Ellis.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.780
So you can see here.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.850
You cannot create it.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.440
Do get,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.350
uh,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.870
nautical ideas.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.320
So already we have in my pocket i d somewhere here.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.180
So I'm just going to call this as my bucket.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.050
I d one so that we could fix that other.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.650
Did we save the fine?

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.960
No,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.860
I didn't see it with the fire.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.010
You can see the doctor there.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.270
Okay,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.950
let me say we don't that run it again.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.220
My stack.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.230
It doesn't seem to have any better than this.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.650
Go ahead and doing def.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.830
I see.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.780
What are the changes you can see here?

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.340
That is an output that has been added.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.830
And then that's the new resource that is going to be created.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.020
So before we go ahead and deploy this,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.950
let us let me take you to my cloud formation.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.760
Temperatures is the stack that we have on right now in the oval section.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.950
We have nothing here,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.300
so let's cool head and deploy this on.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.950
Come back and see what happens.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.490
You remember the previous one we checked out.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.660
What is the change That?

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.720
So if you go ahead and look at the change that it will be saying action is going to create

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.490
little school and check their past well,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.980
so we should have a change said by now,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:36.980
Hopefully this is the new one they just called or Jason changes and you can see that

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.110
there's a tight resource and then it's,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.330
ah,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.630
completely numerous or that it's going to be created.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.760
So this is the value that I was talking about earlier.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.920
The action was modified because we were changing some attributes,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.350
often existing bucket.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.750
Now we're creating a new resource that so the action is add.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.970
So let's just go back here and see if the stack updates have been completed.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.450
You can see them Bridges company that is called the output.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.480
So here you can see here.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.960
This is my key value.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.230
I mean,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.080
this is Mickey,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.630
my bucket open one.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.730
And then this is a very This is the name off the bucket that has been created on this is

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.370
export value.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.740
So any stack that you're going to create no one words can import this value into that stack

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.350
on access the bucket name directly into that stack itself.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.890
So that is how you export value Self from one stacked,

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.850
another stack.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.880
So you remember earlier I spoke about doing someone numerical validations.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.720
So if you want to do some regulations,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.480
let us say your business don't,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.700
because our topic name is going to come from somebody else to say ABC x y Z that for a

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.090
moment assumed that this value is coming from another stack.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:49.150
So what you can do is city allows you to have some validations on top of the token,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.770
So I'm just going to say,

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.470
if not,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.770
I'm just going to take that This is a spring on.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.350
Whether it is the value is less than 10 or not.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:05.940
So I'm just going to say CTK core on then talking is unresolved on.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.170
Then I'm just going to say yes and that's stopping.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.290
Name Andi.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.210
Length off isn't stopping.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.550
Name is less than 10.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:25.250
Are you just greater than dentist legislation enter?

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.590
Okay,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.390
that's good.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.640
I'm just going toe addicts White C A b c 1234 cents.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.760
This is a string of I can just add numerous.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.770
Also just going to run the city get ls it should give us an error.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:42.090
Now,

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.760
with the value together,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.650
you can see here that is the value at a maximum value can be 10 characters.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.280
This case is was just a string.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.630
But if you're importing,

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.880
it'll become a Seeley Can't open that using that's token,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.000
you can validate them.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.870
Likewise,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.240
I can just show you one more thing Here you can I run time.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.460
You will not know the value off there's pocket name.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.800
So if you go ahead and do something like this,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.270
sprint my bucket to dart back a name,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:18.050
So I'm just going to remove this so that that of course away.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:25.820
So if I do in civic ls you can see here this is the when you love the bucket name I'd run

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.290
them because it's at the same time.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.140
We don't know the bucket.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.470
Never.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.670
When you deploy your stack,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.030
the bucket name will be there.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:36.210
So when the old what is called during the deployment time you can see the value but on your

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.020
compiling time or transporting time,

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.710
it is Ah numerical identified only there to go ahead and try down.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.450
Import them,

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.630
export some final use on dizzy.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.120
What manipulations you can add on what this case is.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.820
You can around up off this in the next sector letter See how you can go ahead and king of

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:58.150
your stack on day Start fresh for the next level of social that we're going to create.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.320
Until then,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.050
thanks for watching Happy learning
