00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
Hello,

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.890
folks.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome back to another episode on cloud Development,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.250
kid.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.450
Today we're going to see how to create custom SS and parameters on air abuse secrets.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.550
Earlier,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.910
we have used the services for creating orders retrieving in my I.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.120
D.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.360
S.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.420
It is quite useful when you want to start a lot off configuration that it's required by

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.060
your application or for connecting to a database you need over database password on

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.640
instruct Heart.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.200
According them.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.370
You can store them in secrets Manager and to treat them.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.630
So wait off when these services are being used for Lambda Functions and Micro Services for

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.550
passing parameters and configurations.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.370
So let's go ahead and see how we can build this in our environment.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.180
So this is the stack that we're going to use today,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
which is going to be called as the custom parameters secrets stack on day.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.420
I just created an empty filer.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.180
Know how resources are built on official incident,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.370
Kate,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.300
The first step is making sure that you have the requirements while updated with packages

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.780
that you're going to use in this case,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.050
we're going to use the sick racism,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.350
so I'm just going to add that on I'm also going to add the secrets manager also so we can

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.010
go here.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.650
Use that later.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.130
Okay?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.490
Just called secrets Manager.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.400
So on then.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.960
Remember,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.080
always you need to install them once as soon as you added.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.950
I always make it a point to install them as well.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.320
No,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.650
the installation is completed.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.850
Let us go hurt on the import them.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.960
Unlike wise,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350
I want to import the secrets manager also,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.350
let me just do it this way.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.380
So we have imported them there to start building our first parameter.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.880
So first time what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a simple parameter.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.100
Say,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.610
for example,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.810
I want O have on a low testing in my environment and I want to see how many users I want to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.550
configure there.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.700
So in that case,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.850
whatever do is I'm just going to call this as a parameter one.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.560
This is,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.950
um,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.380
dot string parameter.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.130
So you see her string parameter,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.780
And as usual,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.320
we're going to set the scope on.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.670
Then,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.760
after setting the scope,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.120
we're going to set the I D.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.660
In this case,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.850
I'm just going to call this s Bring me one on what is going to be this parameter.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.590
So I'm just going to add a simple description.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.900
I'm going to say this is low resting configuration on.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.890
Once we do that,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.130
we're going to set the parameters name it says so for the parameter name.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.250
I'm going to use something like a number off banker and users.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.450
So what is going to be the value of spring value?

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.270
So I'm going to say I want 100 uses.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.670
This can be any value one toes and hot bread or whatever you want on,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.180
then what year it is going to be standard deal because sometimes some parameters are going

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.630
to be access toe quite a lot of time more than dentals and transactions per second.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.420
Then you want to put it into a premium tier.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.550
But our bloated thing is not going to people requested that many times.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.130
So depending upon that,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.870
even want to choose your transaction deal in parameter store.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.290
So here we have something called us Barometer tier,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.750
Dark standard.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.340
You also have other in number news like Atwan steering,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.550
so choose depending upon what is your use case.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.830
So that is going to be our first parameter.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.370
So I'm just going to quickly output this value.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.820
So now we got no stack.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.540
Where we ever adding one simple parameter on all Soviet going toe to you?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.260
The value on putting it into the core formation open section so that the school had its

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.350
into Cesar stack.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.640
If everything is good,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.970
let me also deploy it.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.630
So while I was trying to deploy lettuce goto our this concert here we have the confirmation

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.710
Lecter's Coto,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:56.370
our custom parameters on that is all stacked that just getting bulldozer parameter fiction

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.370
.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.180
So this is our system console under here,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.570
you have the perimeter store on that.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.580
We should be seeing one parameter getting.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.380
But you see here the number of concurrent users on defy go inside.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.130
You have a value off 100 on Our good fiction also will be updated now,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.990
But sometimes what happens is that you need to stole more than one parameter,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.720
for example,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.530
for low testing.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.100
It's not just concurrent users.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.630
I will also need how many how long I want to run this tester that Eurasian off that on,

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.170
then is that an additional users coming in or repeated off them?

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.220
So I need to have multiple conversations.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.130
In those cases,

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.710
you won't have a hierarchy off configurations.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.320
So parameters allows you to have highlight kill configurations.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.080
So that's what I'm going to show you right now.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.530
Just going to duplicate this.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.530
I'm just going to call this aspirin,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.250
too.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.460
On that exchange is also to to Onda here in slow for having a simple value.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.420
I'm just going to perfect sit with forward slash and them let us.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.150
A locus is my low testing tool of choice.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.710
And then I'm going to stay low test conflicts on under that I would have ah number of

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.050
concurrent users on that is going to be 100 on.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.640
Let us it.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.450
I'm going to talk to get this again.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.440
Andi,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.940
I would have three here so that but I'm pretty sort of built on here.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.600
In this case,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.250
I'm just going to say duration.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.550
It is a tradition in seconds,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.900
so I'm just going to run this test for,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.390
say,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.410
about 300 seconds of yourself,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.250
like five minutes.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.390
I want to run this tester.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.320
So what happens is I will have a hierarchy conflagration now,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.150
so anybody wants to pick it up,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.860
can pick up the conflicts that apparently and that is the type of ever hear that is just

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.370
not the type of convicts.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.590
So once you pick up the confrontation locus and the conflicts,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.540
you will have access to all the values Number of concurrent users duration in seconds on

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.560
other parameter for free.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.100
Keep on adding likewise a Another contribution that I always comment to users is something

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.520
like a database on,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.050
then followed by the environment.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.050
Whether it is brought,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.150
there s on.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.860
Then you have my sequel or Laura are.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.970
But what about the date of his engine?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.310
I'm followed by the passport.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.670
So you know what parameters that they're without you and having to retrieve them?

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.530
Because their values you haven't highlight destructive for organization.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.290
And then you can keep on testing it so late to school.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.990
Head on.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.350
Deploy this one as well.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.280
Okay,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.610
I was tak it's got completed.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.650
Let's go ahead and refresh.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.010
Nothing is going to happen here,

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.570
But if you go here,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.400
we should treat to more parameters here.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.110
Under these conflicts,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.850
you see a Jewish in seconds and number of concurrent users.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:40.980
So now let's go ahead and see how we can use AWS secrets manager for storing some secrets

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.700
like passports for databases are some of the baby keys or anything that you want to store

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.860
encrypted on how some automatic rotational futures passwords.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.030
So let us go ahead and below secret.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.260
Now I'm going to call my secret as a secret one on.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.720
Then we're going to use the secrets manager construct on,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.840
then under that,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.140
we're going to call the secret my third,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.880
and then the matter scope is going to be self followed by my i d.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.290
We're just going to call this a sensitive one,

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.750
followed by my description on let us call this as my customer database bus work.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.870
And now we have that.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.980
And then let us go ahead and add our secret name itself.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.150
So this is going to be customer DP password.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.530
So let us cool head and synthesize the stack.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.410
If everything is good,

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.820
we should be able to deploy this.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.660
And remember,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.400
when you're using secrets Manager,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.350
you will not be able to retrieve the string value itself.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.110
You just retrieve the secret of token on that token,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.590
will passed on to any service that it wants to consume it just to show that I'm just going

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.240
toe.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.320
Add an output value for secret.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.750
Also,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.750
they're just going this as open to on,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.730
then just going to say secret.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.560
One thing this is little Say,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.010
this is the so the value is going to be secret value.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.140
This is how you're going to use the name off the you know,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.040
you're going to call the secret and then you're going toe pass it on to other services.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.700
Gift that census isis properly.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.400
Then we can go ahead and deployed.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.970
Okay,

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.790
Since we have a secret one and cannot just have this one is also secret one just say

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:33.200
lacking here ls it is called.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.220
I didn't deployed us,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.950
so we should have a new secret that is also configured for us.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:44.250
So when this is getting deployed of what I wondered was,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.130
I want to show you another way off,

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.600
creating secrets that just called us a temperature secret where you have on Jason feel like

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.820
Why have games the name,

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.540
password,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.180
and have a hierarchy off secrets.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.330
So let us see that one also.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.090
But this is getting deployed.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:04.610
Just go here quickly and then you can see here There's a secret one value.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.560
That is just a random string object.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.800
That is a reference to the secret itself.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.750
But if we go to the service called us the secrets manager,

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.950
we should have a custom Devi password on then on,

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.680
uh,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.350
secret value here in quite go ahead and click on this one.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.050
It's going to show me the plain text dwelling here,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.210
so that is the only way you can treat clean the plane takes.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.240
And if you are using it in the database spots work,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.330
this plain text token will be automatically passed on to the service.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.490
That consuming this.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.650
So here you can see here there is a secret key value.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.590
I don't know.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.060
We're just store and a simple string that started key value.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.600
So if you're dreaming it out,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.200
if you want to start multiple values,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.640
you cannot use this format.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.200
That is what I'm going to show you next,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.350
how you can store and hierarchical or Jason template that secret itself.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.670
So let us just,

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.450
uh,

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.820
write a new one That might be better,

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.590
that I'm just going to call this a set template ID Secret value went to you suggesting

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.930
template secrets.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.920
Manager Dark secret once again.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.840
And then the school is going to be self.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.720
The letters caused this secret as a secret,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.350
too.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:19.690
On here also were going toe act that descriptions show that we know what we're doing here.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.690
It template Good for you.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.880
Did,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.150
uh,

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.380
aan den uh,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.770
secret name,

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.480
Midst of later school head on our secret name on.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.110
I'm just going to call this ask you serve gone high pick buttes.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.750
So my user name is gone,

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.500
and then I'm just going toe had acted with for this users.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.360
So here we have a construct called us that generate a secret string on.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.090
We're going to call that on.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.540
There is a matter for this one.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:53.890
Also.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:59.420
Secrets manager dot Secret string generator.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:10:59.880
Okay,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.980
that is the one on here.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.550
We're going to say secret string template.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.110
The 2nd 1 on,

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.280
we're going to have a Jason for my third,

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.950
uh,

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.930
template because we're going to use the fight on our dignity.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:20.450
So remember that Jason is not imported into my court,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.510
So just going to import Jason also here so that it stops complaining about Jason.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.550
It's not unavailable,

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:31.820
so we want an ah dictionary.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.250
So I'm just going to call this adds user name on then for Lord,

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.310
apply my user,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.950
but using a value that is going to be calling here.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.350
So this is the bracket.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.950
Once that is done,

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.950
we have to say what is the possible is going to be stored?

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:55.020
So we're going to have the string key on here is my passport is going to be stored for

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:55.660
diffuser.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.520
So there will be a user name attribute whose value is going to be calm And there's going to

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.680
be one more attribute called this password on the whose value it began in Italy generated

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.470
by the secret that's told it and services.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.010
So let us cool head and synthesize it and deploy it.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:18.270
So whenever you're calling this secret in any other service you will have both attributes

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.030
so you can find out what is the use of name?

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.040
What is the password?

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.510
This might not be the ideal use case of student use.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.290
An impasse were part of for a P s.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.860
You can say for production.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.350
This is a pity for a test.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:35.450
You have this baby a key are for district party services of the So you can have some Iraqis

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.550
to find like that.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.860
It depends upon what is the Iraq.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.710
You want to define a quart of the keys.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.480
So this is just an example of using your sentiment password.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.640
So we got our secret uploaded.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.890
So to school back here and see that is the usual corn attributes.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:49.910
That is my user.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.250
So if I call inside here under secrets value,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.560
you can see here That is the user name whose values gone.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.720
And then there's a password with the values automatically generated presented here.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.620
So that is how you create a system parameters on the AWS secrets you've seen Citic it.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.890
Go ahead and try them.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.290
If you have any comments,

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.050
are problems facing get up issue.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.550
I will try and help with you.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.150
Thanks for watching Happy look.
