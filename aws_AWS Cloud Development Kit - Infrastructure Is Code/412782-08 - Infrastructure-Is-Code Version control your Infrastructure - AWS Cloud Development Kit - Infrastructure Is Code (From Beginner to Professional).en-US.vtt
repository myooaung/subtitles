00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
Hello Falls.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome back.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.850
We have been used in silly game to play around with our infrastructure.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.860
We saw how to create our stack.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.230
We went ahead and deployed our stack.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.630
We made some changes to your stack on day.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.850
We also saw how to push those changes to our account.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.070
So if you notice it,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.190
all the changes that we made to our infrastructure was at the core level on.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.780
We were able to take those stages,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.590
tow a car.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.460
So when you are treating infrastructure score,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.450
why not introduce was in control for your infrastructure so that you can know what has

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.010
happened when on who has made those changes on.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.010
In case those changes are not as desired,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.240
you can go back to the previous question off your infrastructure.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.010
So basically,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.830
you get an option off easily rolling back to a previously good state off your

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.710
infrastructure without worrying too much on how to roll back on how you can go ahead and

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.380
create a deployment strategy for your infrastructure.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.610
So that is what we're going to see.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.490
We're going to introduce wishing control for your infrastructure because it is written and

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.890
purely needed gored.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.530
So if we go back to our repository right now on the left hand side,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.270
you can see the entire trio for repository on.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.820
If you're using visual studio,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.680
you can see here that get already tracks all the change files in your report injury.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.620
But you notice that there is or more than one dozen files,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.060
but we don't need all those things.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.560
For example,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.550
you need the files under the intrude folder or under the in before you just need only the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.860
coal fires that you need.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.620
So you need to keep tracking only those files.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.630
So the best way to do it is through and get ignore.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.120
So let's and get ignored for our project.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.730
So when I looked around when I was doing some projects in CDG and fight and there was not

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.080
many get ignore really made Lee available.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.260
So I went ahead on created my own get or yeah,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.450
I'm going to put this link in the description so you can also go ahead and use it or modify

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.390
it or make some amendments and then send me modified just so they just go ahead and copy

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.840
This are easy and raise,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.060
too.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.600
Use that all wishing.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.050
So I'm going to create on get ignoring the root off my repository.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.470
So the moment I go ahead and paste this,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.200
you can see it.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.500
It's 1005 that are being tracked,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.020
but once we had a get dignified automatically,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.670
that gets changed so that the one with the necessary files are getting tracked.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.250
The most important thing is if we go ahead and see the get signal for the bottom section,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.060
it also ignores the vials and a CD.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.520
Get out.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.280
That also means that any template that is synthesized from your court is also left out off

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.430
your question control system because you're going to treat you infrastructure called That

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.290
is here.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.850
That's a real code,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.170
you know.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.240
Want to treat your synthesize to court?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.550
Asked the artifact that you want to keep it in your Western controlled a corsetry.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.400
You would probably want to store it as artifact in another losing control mechanism,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.720
so that is the reason it has been excluded them.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.440
If you want to go ahead and come in that you can manually add them by using the hyphen F

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.830
common,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.180
I can show you that as well.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.200
But just know that the city get out is by default.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.100
It is ignored.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.410
So let us put our repository into the Western control system,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.340
for in this case,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.540
I'm using Kate up.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.880
You can go ahead and do that in a big packet.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.040
Are good combat or any poison control system that you are familiar with.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.690
So we're just going to take this project name Ondo.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:40.070
Let me go to my get up on to create a new repository and you re a triple on it

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.950
automatically gives me the command so that I can set my repository toe remote origin here.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.560
So already we have a report here.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.160
So I'm just going to copy these commands.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.540
If you if we don't have it,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.140
then we need those commands so that the school head and set over remote this coming that

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.450
I'm going to execute now will push the goal into our you know.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.830
So the system villages go back here on the refresh our screen to see the court has been

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.230
pushed.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.440
So if I call here on my city project and go to my physical project,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.900
you'll find that the s three bucket court that we have it's not reflected The reason for

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.340
that is we have not committed those stages so you can see all those changes are not

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.980
reflecting here.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.550
So I'm just going to add the court on then the get ignore boys also require on city cages.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.580
And we will wait and see how to use the syndicate or Jason to customize your project so

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.990
that it's also another important why we need to keep track off on requirements is where we

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.720
have saying the dependencies.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.750
So I'm just going to ask that I'm saying this is going to be my initial commit and then I'm

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.500
just going to commit it on.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.150
I can push it from here as well.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.890
So once the pushes successful,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.460
let us go head on and make one more change here on the Read me for I'm just going to remove

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.790
the end.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.950
There's section here under in shame.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.450
Welcome to my first CD Gay project.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.150
Let's go ahead and come into this me find as well so we can go ahead and see the changes.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.030
Yeah,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:25.790
so changes have committed.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.400
So I'm just going to go back to my home folder here.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.590
So if I scroll down,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.890
you can see here will come to my foot CTK project and likewise,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.950
my court is also updated with my history information.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.820
So if you remember,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.510
I spoke about the city,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.030
Get out.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.740
Electricity is not being tracked.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.020
So in case if you want to add this while so you can go ahead and say,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.800
get on,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.150
get out slash my first.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.960
So if you just go ahead and press enter,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.240
it is going to give you an elder saying the falling parts that ignored by your get ignore

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.640
file.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.870
If you want to add them,

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.210
use the hyphen in flag.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.060
If you want added,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.520
just go ahead and and hyphen f on automatic.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.450
It gets tracked here so you can go ahead and add a coming message,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:19.850
adding my see offend synthesized template.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:29.320
So it gives you want to share your synthesized template with somebody are if you want toe,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.910
make it reproducible for some other people so that they can go and see how the template

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.550
looks like.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.930
Then you can use this modern on.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.250
If we go back here,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.500
we should be able to find City.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.190
Get on out folder also here.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.090
Get this,

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.100
Andi,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.770
Anybody can take this template and running their account.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.380
But John,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:55.120
where we have created a bucket with name so it might most probably not work because Asti

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.930
James advocate name.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.450
But that is not important point.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.350
Oh,

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.580
that was important.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.530
Thing is you consensus.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.370
I said template and chatted with your team are have other poor people who can do your cord

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.050
and make it reusable.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:13.930
So just how you wasn't control your infrastructure on then keep it into on Western control

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.740
deposits so you can roll back or look at the previous it is.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.240
And look at the comet history and see when the change was made.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.050
Who made it?

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.570
Go ahead and try it.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.470
If you have any problems,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.840
put them in the comments on the questions section.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.000
I will try and help them with you in the next section.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.780
You go ahead and see how we can customize our environment using the city cages and file on

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.550
add some matter groups there.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.240
Until then,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.950
thanks for watching Happy learning
