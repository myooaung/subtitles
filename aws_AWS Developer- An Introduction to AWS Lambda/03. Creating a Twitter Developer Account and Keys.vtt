1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.740
Let's get started creating our own Twitter bot.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.550
We'll need to do some preparation steps first that include

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.670
creating a Twitter account and making sure that we have API keys

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.700
that are associated with that account.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.540
We'll then put those API keys in the SSM Parameter Store for later.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.240
From there,

7
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.240
we'll make sure we have Twython and Sparrow and that they're all set up locally.

8
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.010
After that, we'll write our function,

9
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.220
which will involve modifying the Sparrow skeleton code and

10
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.080
then testing everything out locally.

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.790
After that,

12
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.800
we'll look at how we can deploy our bot by creating the function

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.930
package that we'll need to upload in the AWS console and then

14
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.920
setting the triggers and configuration on the function that we're

15
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.920
creating using that package.

16
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.860
So let's get to it. Over here in my web browser, I've navigated to

17
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.320
twitter.com, and I can sign up for a new account on this page.

18
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.750
Once I click the Sign up button,

19
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.110
I'll be directed to enter some information to create an account.

20
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.820
After I do this,

21
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.640
I can press the Next button and confirm that the account

22
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.190
information looks correct for the account I'm creating.

23
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.750
Then I'll click Sign up, and I'll be getting sent a verification code

24
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.780
to either the email or the phone number that I entered as part of this

25
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.240
process, so I'll need to enter that too.

26
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.020
I've gone ahead and opened up my email,

27
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.480
and I can open up this Twitter verification code, copy it,

28
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.200
and then go back to the original page,

29
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.250
put it in there, and click Next. After I've done this, I'll need to

30
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.800
set a password for my account, so I'll paste a password I'll be using

31
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.240
for right now here and then click Next.

32
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.230
When I'm done skipping through the rest of the steps,

33
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.360
I should be able to see my Twitter timeline here.

34
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.730
Now we're not going to do much from this Twitter view here.

35
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.170
Instead,

36
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.110
we're going to go to our URL bar and enter in developer.twitter.com, and I'm

37
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.400
going to get rid of the home here, and let's hit Enter. On this developer

38
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.590
page, we'll need to apply for a developer account.

39
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.130
We can click the Apply button and then click Apply for

40
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.150
a developer account. And from here,

41
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.210
we're going to need to say what we're doing. In this case,

42
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.770
we're making a bot, so I'm going to select that and click Next.

43
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.930
In order to create a bot with a developer account,

44
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.460
you may need to add a phone number, so if you haven't done that already,

45
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.590
you can do it here.

46
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.600
After entering the phone number's verification code, you can click Verify.

47
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.140
After your phone number is verified,

48
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.340
you're going to need to continue on the process of

49
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.190
getting your developer account set up.

50
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.990
So go ahead and scroll down, and fill out all the information

51
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.300
that's required by the application process.

52
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.670
When you're done filling out some basic information, you can press Next.

53
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.640
On the next page,

54
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.650
you're going to need to fill out information about how you intend to use the

55
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.820
Twitter API. Be sure to be honest about your use case,

56
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.710
but also be sure that you're following Twitter's automation rules and

57
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.340
terms of service for how you plan to use the Twitter APIs.

58
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.340
I've included an honest description of using it for this course,

59
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.840
and I'd suggest you include something similar to the application

60
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.480
you intend to develop using the Twitter APIs.

61
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.980
Once you're done,

62
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.280
you can click the Next button and verify the information

63
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.230
in your application looks correct.

64
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.300
Now, importantly,

65
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.630
you're going to need to make sure that you're saying yes to

66
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.310
whether or not your application will need to tweet, retweet, or

67
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.230
like anything because those are some of the things that we'll be

68
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.140
doing with our Twitter bot.

69
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.110
Once this looks good,

70
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.730
you can press the Looks good button and then review

71
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.610
and accept the developer agreement.

72
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.000
You're going to need to scroll all the way down to the

73
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.490
developer agreement before you accept the terms, and then

74
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.140
click this box to submit your application.

75
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.930
You'll also need to confirm your email with Twitter if you haven't already

76
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.710
confirmed it and answer any follow‑up questions from Twitter.

77
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.030
I've checked my email again,

78
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.730
and now I have a verification for my Twitter developer account.

79
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.010
Now that I've verified my account and signed back in,

80
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.480
I can start using some APIs. Back on the developer.twitter.com home

81
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.080
page, I can go to the drop‑down and then click on Apps. From here,

82
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.330
I'll create an app, give this app a name.

83
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.190
I'm going to call mine globopetcare for Globomantics Pet Care.

84
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.790
I'm also going to put that in the description. We're not going to

85
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.500
have this end up showing to end users for the time being, so we

86
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.220
don't need to change too much there.

87
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.870
And then in here,

88
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.560
I'm going to enter in my website name for right now, and

89
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.050
then if you had your own website name,

90
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.660
you could include that there. Towards the bottom, I'll also

91
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.370
need to provide a description of how we'll be using this app

92
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.340
so that we can get it approved.

93
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.170
After you enter in some more information here,

94
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.740
you can click Create to create your app.

95
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.720
I'd suggest that you make sure to take a look at all of these documents

96
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.390
so that your use case aligns with Twitter's rules.

97
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.410
If you want to look at what's actually allowed and get some good ideas,

98
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.650
you can go look at the Automation Rules here and scroll down to

99
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.460
where what you're supposed to do is listed here,

100
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.200
such as building solutions that automatically broadcast helpful

101
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.190
information or building solutions that automatically respond to

102
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.480
users and direct messages for your business.

103
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.420
Now there's some cool things that you can do,

104
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.850
but there's also some things that you shouldn't be doing,

105
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.550
so make sure you're aware of these when you fill your

106
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.960
application out so that you can get it approved.

107
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.140
Now, once you're done, you can click Create here,

108
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.530
and then you should be able to proceed with the next step,

109
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.850
which is getting some keys and tokens for your application.

110
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.600
So I'm going to go over here and click Keys and tokens, and

111
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.530
you'll see that we have two that are included here by

112
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.330
default, the consumer API keys, the API key and the API secret.

113
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.800
We're also going to need an access token and an access

114
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.580
token secret, so let's generate that here.

115
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.290
Now that we've generated these two values,

116
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.040
I can close this window out,

117
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.340
and they only show those values when you first generate them.

118
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.710
So, because I didn't copy those values from that very

119
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.640
initial generation, I can't use those anymore,

120
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.760
and I actually need to regenerate them in order to use them.

121
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.090
In fact, I'm going to revoke those ones so you can't use them anymore,

122
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.740
and then I'm going to generate my own,

123
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.080
copy them down, and store them somewhere safe.

124
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.590
So I'd suggest you do the exact same thing.

125
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.830
Make sure that you copy both of the values down and that you know which one is

126
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.290
your access token and which one is your access token secret.

127
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.950
Now that I'm done,

128
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.250
I'm going to close this out, and these are all the values that we need from

129
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.410
the Twitter API in the developer.twitter.com website. Because I'll be

130
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.270
deleting this account when I finish this course,

131
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.160
I'm not too worried that you'll see these values,

132
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.570
so that's why I'm not blurring them out.

133
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.940
But keep in mind they are sensitive and secret,

134
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.350
and you would be able to tweet things on my behalf if you had

135
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.020
somehow stolen these and I'd kept the account around.

136
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.470
So now that we're done creating our Twitter account and all of our API keys,

137
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:58.000
we can get these set up inside of the AWS console with the Systems Manager Parameter Store.
