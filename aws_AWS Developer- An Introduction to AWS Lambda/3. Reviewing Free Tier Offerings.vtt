00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.370
So let's make sure and go back to the AWS Free Tier page here,

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.900
scroll down, and take a look at a few of the services that

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.010
we'll be working with inside of AWS.

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.430
We can use this to get more detailed information about

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.960
what's included in the Free Tier, forever, and what's

6
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.650
included only for a set period of time.

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.660
If we select the 12 Months Free, we can scroll through some of the

8
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.950
services that are only included for 12 months.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, among these different services is Amazon S3,

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.740
which we'll be using somewhat in this course to store files and information.

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.550
So, after 12 months,

12
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.190
the files and information that we do store in S3 might start costing us

13
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.730
a little bit of money in order to keep them there.

14
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.960
So if you're not comfortable with that,

15
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.220
be sure to go back and delete the files after you've

16
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.740
finished the examples inside of AWS.

17
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.300
Now,

18
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.860
all the files that I'll be having you load into S3 probably won't

19
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.980
cost you more than a penny or two per month to actually store

20
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.100
there, so you don't have to worry too much.

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.440
But it is important to realize that this Free Tier does expire after 12 months.

22
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.520
Now, for other services that aren't S3, for example,

23
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.670
for DynamoDB and AWS Lambda, we'll be able to use those in

24
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.230
perpetuity up to certain thresholds.

25
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.520
For AWS Lambda, we'll have up to a million requests per month for free and

26
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140
up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.

27
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.220
What this ends up meaning is that we can use about a

28
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.050
million requests per month as long as they don't go over 3

29
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.970
seconds in the runtime length.

30
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.420
Or we could have some fluctuation in those requests,

31
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.820
as long as they're generally staying underneath an average

32
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.770
of 3.2 seconds. For Amazon DynamoDB,

33
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.340
which we'll be using later, we can have 25 GB of data stored in Amazon DynamoDB.

34
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.960
However,

35
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.580
we can only have 25 provisioned read and write

36
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.600
capacity units for DynamoDB tables.

37
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.780
This means that we'll be able to handle actually a pretty

38
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.040
significant amount of requests coming in and out, about 200

39
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.310
million per month. Now while most things I'll be doing inside of

40
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010
this course will be within the Free Tier,

41
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.410
especially the 12 Months Free Free Tier, you can learn more about

42
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.250
each service's pricing if you click through to that service's home

43
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.140
page and read up on the pricing section.

44
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.870
So now that we understand how all this works and how to double check

45
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.890
what we're doing before we create services inside of AWS, let's go

46
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.510
back to the AWS Management Console and set up our console here for a

47
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.530
little bit easier use later on.

48
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.060
The first thing we want to do is make sure that we're in

49
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.050
the correct region for this course.

50
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.910
Now, for all of my examples, I'll be doing things inside of us‑east‑1,

51
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.340
Northern Virginia.

52
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.720
This will be the default region that I've created

53
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.470
and been placed in, but for you, if you're in a different part of the world,

54
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.140
you might end up using different regions, or AWS might have

55
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.240
put you by default in another region.

56
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.290
The most important part about this is how you set up your AWS account

57
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.900
and your command line interface. Because I'm in the us‑east‑1 region

58
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.770
right now, if I create resources in this region in the AWS console, and

59
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.840
then I use something like the SDKs or the command line to then create

60
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.330
resources in a different region, they might not always interact the way

61
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.160
I expect, and they probably won't notice each other in those separate regions.

62
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.180
So be sure that you're picking a region and sticking

63
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.690
with it throughout this course.

64
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.410
If you want to just follow along with me,

65
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.330
I'd suggest you stick in US East in Northern Virginia.

66
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.810
There are implications though.

67
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.000
If you want to build real applications that serve real users,

68
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.820
you're probably going to want to put your applications

69
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.010
in a region closer to those users.

70
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.950
So if you have a bunch of people that you're working

71
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.140
with in Seattle on the west Coast,

72
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.190
you might end up wanting to use the US West Oregon region, or

73
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.620
maybe the US West Northern California region.

74
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.770
Either one of those would probably be closer to your users

75
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.430
than the Northern Virginia region, or another region in a

76
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.350
completely different part of the world.

77
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.810
So now that you know how to make sure you're in the right region and you

78
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.060
understand what those regions are for, let's go over to the Services

79
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.780
drop‑down here and take a look at some of the AWS services. Now, we'll be

80
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.780
working with a variety of services inside of AWS,

81
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.540
and there's a lot of different groups of these services,

82
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.190
ranging from Compute to Storage to Machine Learning, and everything in between.

83
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.210
If we wanted to find a particular service by name,

84
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.170
we could look at the A‑Z listing of all these services, or

85
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.490
we could click on this search bar here and search for a

86
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.840
particular service like Lambda.

87
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.650
But to make things easier for ourselves and to just get

88
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.550
started inside of the AWS console,

89
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.390
we can actually close out of this here and pin some of the

90
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.190
services we want to the top of the menu bar here.

91
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.500
This will also be a great opportunity just to get an idea for the level

92
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.210
of AWS services that are actually included in AWS.

93
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.530
Now,

94
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.630
of course we'll be using AWS Lambda, so let's grab that and

95
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.630
put that in the top, but we'll also be using services like

96
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.040
Identity and Access Management, or IAM, so let's grab that too.

97
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.470
We'll be using IAM in order to create roles and policies and attach

98
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.830
them to our Lambda functions so they can take actions on other

99
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.810
services. Some of those services will include things like the Amazon

100
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.100
Simple Email Service, or SES,

101
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.630
and we'll be using that to send email from our Lambda

102
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.530
functions, so let's put that up there too.

103
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.140
Now, we'll also be using the Systems Manager Service, so let me

104
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.620
scroll down here and bring that up to the top.

105
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.600
This will be used as part of the Systems Manager called the Parameter

106
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.100
Store to actually save some API keys from Twitter and use them in our

107
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.450
Lambda functions in a secure manner.

108
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.190
Now later in the course, we'll be creating a serverless framework

109
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.510
project that utilizes the API Gateway to create HTTP APIs. So let's

110
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.220
grab that service too and put it up in the top is well. Now that

111
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.830
same project will also use the DynamoDB service to store data inside

112
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.200
of a DynamoDB table.

113
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.190
So let's throw that up at the top too.

114
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.880
Now that we're done with this, we can click the pin icon again,

115
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.210
and we should have a few of these different icons up to the top.

116
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.660
Now if I scroll out a little further,

117
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.860
you'll see that I can actually see all of the different

118
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.330
icons and their text, but I'll show you how to reconfigure

119
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.990
some of this in another video.

120
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.300
So congratulations! You've already created an AWS account and learned how to

121
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.330
make sure that you're in the right region in your AWS account,

122
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.770
as well as reviewing some of the services we'll be using in this

123
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.760
course and pin them to the top of your menu bar in the AWS console.

124
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.000
In the next videos, we'll learn how to create Lambda functions and work with all these services, so I'll see you there.
