00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.300
In this video, we'll be going through the AWS Free Tier signup process.

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.180
We'll start with a walkthrough of the entire process of creating an

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.620
AWS account and making sure we're using the free tier, and then we'll

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.040
look at serviceâ€‘specific information about AWS services that are

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.070
included within that free tier.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.180
This will help us to avoid unwanted expenses inside of our

7
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.590
AWS accounts before we're ready for them.

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.970
After that, we'll take a look at the AWS console in more detail.

9
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.380
I'll show you some of the different service areas that

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.710
AWS categorizes its services under,

11
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.790
and we'll configure our workspace to use the particular

12
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.600
services that we'll need inside of this course.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.110
And once we've set up our workspace,

14
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.950
we should be ready to keep going. Over here in my web browser, I've

15
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.330
entered in aws.amazon.com/free in my URL bar,

16
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.810
and this takes me to the Amazon Web Services Free Tier page. Here, I can learn

17
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.330
a little bit more about what's included in the free tier,

18
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.140
including the different types of offers that are included, such

19
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.000
as services that are always free or free for 12 months only or

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.440
maybe are on some shorter trial basis.

21
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.640
And if I wanted the look of the specific offers,

22
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.850
we could look here under the Free Tier details for

23
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.210
particular types of services or underneath the Tiers that

24
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.730
are filtered out by 12 Months Free, Always Free, or Trials.

25
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.540
For right now, though, we won't look at this. We'll scroll back up,

26
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.150
and we'll either click Create an AWS Account in the top right, or click

27
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.870
Create a Free Account underneath the AWS Free Tier title here. This should

28
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.270
direct us to a page that looks a bit like this.

29
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.500
Well, we'll need to enter in our email address,

30
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.900
password, and a name for our account.

31
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.570
I'll use GPC, for right now, for Globomantics Pet Care.

32
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.380
Now I'm going to click Continue, and after I continue onto the next page,

33
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.020
I'll be prompted to enter in some basic information about

34
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.490
my account, including my company name,

35
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.720
the phone number, and everything else here, if I'm

36
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.920
creating a company account. For you, however,

37
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.610
you might want to go and click Personal and fill out the

38
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.220
information related to your personal account.

39
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.700
After you fill out this information,

40
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.140
you can click the checkbox down here at the bottom, and

41
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.140
then click Create Account and Continue.

42
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.370
On the next page, you'll be prompted to enter in some payment information.

43
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.890
Be sure to read through all the details to make sure it's something you're

44
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.740
comfortable with before you press the Verify and Add button.

45
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.540
From here, you'll be prompted to confirm your identity with a cell phone number.

46
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.910
Go ahead and enter your number, fill out the code that's

47
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.500
provided for you, and click Send SMS.

48
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.040
This will send a text message to your phone with a code that you'll then enter

49
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.260
into the browser here, and click the Verify Code button.

50
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.340
Once your identity has been verified, you can press Continue.

51
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.000
From there, you'll be prompted to select a support plan for your AWS account.

52
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.230
Now,

53
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.400
if you're sure you're going to be using AWS extensively and you want

54
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.110
to be able to ask lots of questions of AWS support,

55
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.780
you could consider a developer or a business plan here.

56
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.410
However, for right now, I'd suggest just getting started with the Basic Plan,

57
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.010
which is free, and you can always upgrade it later on.

58
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.100
So I'm going to click that Free button here.

59
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.010
Once we're on this page,

60
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.480
we could personalize our AWS experience and look at some of the

61
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.580
other documentation and resources that AWS offers.

62
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.260
But for right now,

63
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.840
I'm going to go ahead and sign into the AWS console by clicking that button.

64
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.750
And then I'm going to use the same username and password that I used

65
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.910
when I was creating the account to get started. After I've signed

66
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.800
into the AWS console, let's pause right here before we do anything

67
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.310
else. If you create any resources in AWS without actually knowing

68
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.280
what you're doing,

69
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.000
you might give yourself a bill that you'll later on have to pay. So let's look at how we can avoid that in the next video.
