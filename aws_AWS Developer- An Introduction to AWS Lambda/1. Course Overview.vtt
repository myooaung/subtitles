Hi everyone, my name is Fernando Medina Corey,

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.610
and welcome to my AWS Developer course, An Introduction to AWS Lambda.

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.035
I'm a data engineer at Curalate. At work, I frequently turn

4
00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:18.730
to Lambda to keep data pipelines flowing and providing

5
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.300
insights to company stakeholders.

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.310
AWS Lamba is the industry leader in the serverless function space.

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.380
This course is a quick introduction to AWS Lambda and

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.470
serverless functions more generally. No prior experience with

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.840
AWS or serverless functions is required.

10
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.450
Some of the major topics that we'll cover include integrating Lambda with

11
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.900
thirdâ€‘party APIs, leveraging other AWS services within Lambda, using the

12
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.880
AWS CLI to deploy our Lambda functions, and knowing when AWS Lambda is

13
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.110
suited to our development needs.

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.370
By the end of this course,

15
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.510
you'll know how to develop and deploy your own Lambda functions. Before

16
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.250
beginning the course, you should be familiar with basic programming concepts

17
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.740
and preferably have written some code in Python.

18
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.540
Being familiar with Bash or the command line will also be helpful.

19
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.300
From here,

20
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.900
you should feel comfortable diving into serverless application

21
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.640
development with courses on the AWS API Gateway, using Lambda to manage

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.710
ETL workloads, and other AWS introductory courses.

23
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn AWS Lambda with the AWS Developer: An Introduction to Lambda course, here at Pluralsight.
