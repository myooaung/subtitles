00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
One of the things we usually want to avoid when coding is repetition.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.160
If we reuse the same code more than once,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.265
it often makes sense to do things a little differently.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:16.470
Thankfully, Vue gives us the opportunity to use what is called mixins.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.080
If we look at the finished version here.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.290
Take our hotels here on the home page, for example.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.860
The same hotel structure which you see just here.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.460
Also the layout is used if we perform a search tool.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.365
Here we have our listed hotels which follow a same pattern.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:43.320
If you do a search and filling all the fields just on here, hit search.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.605
Where you see our search results follow

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:50.440
a similar layout and pattern as our hotels on the home page.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.150
This is a good use case for a mixins even though the hotel data is different,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.719
such as the description and also the title,

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.115
we can make parts of the mixins dynamic.

00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:05.580
It's really flexible to use.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.295
Over in the index dot pug file inside of Visual Studio Code,

00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:14.270
let's begin by adding the hotel info we need to begin.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.635
Starting with the wrappers and then link to all hotels.

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:20.475
Just have block content,

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:22.410
make sure you have this intended.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.860
Then we can add our outer div.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.925
Outer underscore wrapper.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:34.145
Inside here we also want to have a second wrapper for each individual hotel.

00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:38.000
Hotel underscore wrapper.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.515
Then the h2 of hotels.

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:44.840
This level two heading is also going to have a link.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.720
Just after this we are going to add our link,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.470
which is going to link to all hotels which are available.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.300
Add a href, which is going to link to forward slash all.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.380
Then in brackets a text of "see

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.285
all" you're going to save this and then go to

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:07.095
the browser in the home page and then refresh.

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:12.110
Down at the bottom we have our title of hotels and then we'll have a link which

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.775
we'll wire it up later to see all the available hotels in the database.

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:19.640
The reason we have this link to see all hotels,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.990
is because the hotels which will display on the home page are only going to be

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.715
restricted to nine random hotels pulled in from the database.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.880
This is so the home page doesn't get too crowded when we

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.470
have lots of hotels inside of our database.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.750
Now go ahead and add a dummy hotel.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.895
You can see how this is looking.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:45.245
After our links and at the same level as our h2,

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:47.405
we can add a hotel wrapper,

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:50.040
so dot hotel nest.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.630
Inside here we're going to have a couple of different sections.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.230
The first one is going to be for the hotel image. Hotel img.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.360
This is going to be the section which is going to appear

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.910
on the left hand side and it's going to have

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.565
a image of the hotel which we'll then link to the full hotel description.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:15.385
We need a link with the href.

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:19.280
We can leave this empty for now because this data is going to be

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.670
dynamic and it's going to link to the current hotel which we're viewing.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.190
After here we're going to add a image which is

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.005
the main hotel image and we could just add a dummy image now.

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:37.885
Forward slash images forward slash hotels.

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:42.250
Then we can select any hotel we want from our public folder.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.290
Let's drop hotels down and you can choose any one of these images from there.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.400
I'm just going to go for hotel one dot JPEG,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.255
and just like this link above,

00:03:56.255 --> 00:03:59.750
this will also be dynamic too and the information will be

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.260
pulled in from the database and then we can grab the correct image.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.795
After this hotel image section,

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:12.135
let's add a new section surrounded by a div called hotel underscore info.

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:15.650
This is going to contain information about the hotel,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.510
such as the hotel name,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.495
the star rating, the country,

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:23.590
and also the price per night.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.575
The hotel name is also going to be a link just like this image,

00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:31.100
which will also link to the full hotel view,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.135
which will show a extended description.

00:04:34.135 --> 00:04:39.900
Add our surrounding link with an empty href for now.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.065
Our title of the hotel is going to go in a h3 element.

00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:48.770
We can add some dummy text of hotel one.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.410
A horizontal rule then separates the title from the rest of the information.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.560
Now it's just a case of adding some p elements.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.655
The first one is for the star rating.

00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:03.590
We can set it to be anything we want for now.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.700
Let's go for four.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.575
The country: Jamaica.

00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:14.340
Then finally the cost per night.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.639
Remember this is just some dummy data so we can see the structure.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.130
Then let's see how this is looking.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.755
There's our image section above,

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:30.845
and then our hotel info with the name,

00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:32.945
star rating, the country,

00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:35.090
and also the price.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.705
Great. We now have a hotel on the Home page.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.300
We also need to create a view to link to you when

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.600
the user clicks on this all hotels link.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.434
Let's go over to Visual Studio,

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:49.675
open up the sidebar,

00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:53.895
and then inside the views we can create our new view called

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:59.110
all underscore hotels dot pug.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.270
Inside of this template we also need to extend layout.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.710
We also need to add block contents.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.610
Now as you going to share a similar view to the hotel from the Home page.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.065
If we go over to the index dot pug and it will copy

00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:26.100
all the way from the cost per night right up to the hotel.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.120
This is the individual hotel div.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.465
Go to all hotels and then we can add our wrapper.

00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:36.295
So dot hotel underscore wrapper,

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:41.945
indent it in one level and then we can paste in the code from the last video.

00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:44.150
Make sure this is just indented in

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:52.455
one level and make sure our all hotels dot pug file is saved.

00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.150
If we go over to our home page,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.615
we now won't be able to see the view down at the very bottom.

00:06:57.615 --> 00:07:02.615
It is because we have not yet set up the routing to handle this forward slash all.

00:07:02.615 --> 00:07:07.085
But you can already see that we've repeated the same hotel code,

00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:12.830
both inside the all hotels template and also inside of the index dot pug.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.155
Now's our opportunity to reduce our code by moving this hotel into

00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:23.225
a mixin inside of the views folder, inside the sidebar.

00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:27.180
Let's create a new folder called mixins.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.895
Inside our mixins folder,

00:07:29.895 --> 00:07:33.735
I'm going to create a new file which is called underscore

00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:40.370
hotel dot pug and this is going to be the file for our mixin.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:46.570
I know we'd like to start a mixin name with a underscore but this is totally up to you.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:52.610
We begin by using the mixin keyword followed by a name we want to give to this mixin.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:59.260
Mixin hotel then we can go and copy over the hotel code.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.215
We already have in our index dot pug.

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:09.730
We have this hotel all the way down to our star rating and cost per night. Copy this.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:14.090
Then if we go to our mixin which is underscore hotel.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:20.320
Paste this in and make sure this is indented correctly.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:28.420
One level layer, and then one further level for our image and info.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.425
Save this file and that's all we need to do to create our mixin.

00:08:32.425 --> 00:08:34.615
Now, index dot pug file,

00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:38.305
we then need to include this mixin file, which we just created.

00:08:38.305 --> 00:08:40.195
After extends layout.

00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:45.465
We can also include our mixin by adding the file path.

00:08:45.465 --> 00:08:48.490
Mixins, which is the folder name,

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.340
forward slash underscore hotel.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.770
We don't need to add the dot pug extension.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.730
Then we need to remove the hotel code and

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.865
then replace it with the name we gave the mixin.

00:09:00.865 --> 00:09:05.410
Cut or delete this hotel section from

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:11.455
the very bottom and then we add our mixin with plus hotel.

00:09:11.455 --> 00:09:16.060
This hotel name is the name we gave to the mixin inside the file.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.115
Underscore hotel dot pug.

00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:21.435
This is a name which you set right at the top.

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:25.890
If we now save this and then over to the index page

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.850
by clicking on the logo and I scroll down,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.330
you can see we have a problem with the indentations.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.285
Let's go and check this out and this is an index dot pug,

00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:40.515
over to our index dot pug,

00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:45.730
and it looks as though this is not quite lined up with this line.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.995
These little small errors are things we need to watch out for with the indentation.

00:09:49.995 --> 00:09:52.250
Make sure everything works correctly.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.510
Let's try reloading this.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.780
There's our hotel back in the home page.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.685
But this time pulled in from a mixin.

00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:07.400
Now we can do the same with the all hotels page inside the all hotels dot pug file.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.540
We can also include the mixin in the same way as the index.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.700
After our extends declaration,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.365
we can include our mixin,

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.970
which again is the file path of mixins,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.635
forward slash underscore hotel.

00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:29.495
Now we can replace this hotel code from dot hotel right down to the cost per night.

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:34.345
Then replace this with the mixin using plus hotel.

00:10:34.345 --> 00:10:40.855
Now we've replaced a section of code from two files and added it into one mixin.

00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:44.000
We will come back to mixin soon by also passing in

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.450
data to them about each hotel in the database.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.430
Along with also creating more mixins to you, as we go.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.710
Our code is now a little shorter now by including

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.600
this and it will be used a few more times in this project too.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.270
Next, we're going to move on to routing and how we

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.630
can use it to switch between pages in our application.
