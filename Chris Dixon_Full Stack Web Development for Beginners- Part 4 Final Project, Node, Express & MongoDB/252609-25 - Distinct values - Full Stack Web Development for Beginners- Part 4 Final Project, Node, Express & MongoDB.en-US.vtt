00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.350
If we head over to mongodb.com,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.960
which is a homepage for our database.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.920
Up at the top, we can see a link to the documentation.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.415
This documentation is going to give us all the information we need to query our database.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:21.375
On the left-hand side, if we click on getting started.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.710
Here, we can find a full reference to all the database commands,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.585
which we're use in this course,

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:29.490
along with many others.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.210
Down at the bottom we have a reference section.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.910
Click on this, and then go to database commands.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.210
This will give us a list of different methods which we have available.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.305
Let's scroll down to the use commands.

00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:50.370
Underneath here we have a find method.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.140
If we scroll down to the query and write operation commands,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.375
you have this fine method which we used in the last video to get all of our hotels.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:03.575
The next one which will be covering in this course is distinct

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:08.705
and this command is near the top. We have this just here.

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:11.315
For this project, we need to get a list of

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:15.245
available countries which have hotels located in.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:19.355
We may have multiple hotels with the same query law.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.090
For example, we could have six hotels located in

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.600
Mexico and we don't want the word Mexico to a appear six times in our country's list.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.480
Distinct will allow us to return an array of only the distinctive countries,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.480
meaning the only Mexico will appear once from our example.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.010
Let's begin by creating the all countries templates for this page.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.350
Open up the sidebar,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.180
let's close off some of these.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.400
I close this down.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.260
If we go to the views, we can create a new file inside of here called,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.260
all_countries with the.pug extension.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.255
We go ahead and add our basic code;

00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:17.080
extends layout, and then the block content,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.540
the h2 of title.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.780
Then next stop, we can add the route to the index of JS file.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.645
Go to our index inside the routes folder, open this up,

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:36.180
and then after the " /all route",

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.200
we're going to add router.get.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.130
This you got to handle the /countries routes,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.580
the hotelcontroller, and this time we're going to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.700
set up a function called listAllcountries,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.360
add the semicolon at the end.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.660
We have not yet created lists all countries.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.425
So, head over to the hotel controller file and then we can add it in. Let's open this up.

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:16.420
After a list all hotels let's add exports.listAllcountries.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.715
Setup our function.

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:24.020
I'm going to mark this as async,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.915
because we're going to need an await inside of here.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.254
We can pass in our request,

00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:33.180
our response, and also next.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.245
Then add our try block,

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:39.525
try and run the code,

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:41.745
followed by our catch,

00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:48.530
which is going to take in any errors and then pass them over to next.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.305
Make my error with no s. The code

00:03:55.305 --> 00:04:00.790
inside of the try block will be fairly similar to the all hotels above.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.005
We begin by creating a constant to store our data in.

00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:08.990
I'm going to call this constant allcountries.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.390
This time now we select our hotel model,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:24.940
so set this equal to Hotel capital H. Instead of the find method that we used before,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:33.430
this time we use.distinct then to return an array of distinct countries,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.590
we can pass in the country field as a string,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.150
and then under this we can render our templates with res.render.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.685
The template we want to add is the one that we just created of all underscore countries.

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:53.995
Separated by comma we can pass in our title.

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:56.135
Way to the text of,

00:04:56.135 --> 00:05:03.690
browse by country, I make this little bit smaller,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.900
then we can pass in our all countries data, which we set up here.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.010
Make sure that this is available to use inside of our template.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.200
Once this is done, hit save and then go to the browser,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.725
open up our projects,

00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:26.440
then we can go to /countries,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.360
and then scroll down, and we'll see the page title of browse by country.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.515
We only see this page title,

00:05:35.515 --> 00:05:39.400
because this is all we have currently setup in the template.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.540
Let's go to all countries.pug,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.365
and fix this by adding the all countries data.

00:05:46.365 --> 00:05:49.425
Which we now pass in to the template.

00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:52.335
I'm going to begin with a wrap if,

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:55.200
just like we did with the hotels.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.200
This is going to be called country wrapper,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.625
then create an unordered list to display the list of all countries.

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:06.220
To get all of these countries,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.410
we need to loop through this all countries data,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.770
which will pass to this template.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.950
We can do this with a loop,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.790
so each country in all countries,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.835
create a list item,

00:06:21.835 --> 00:06:24.635
which is also going to be a link.

00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:26.970
Pass in the href.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.475
This is going to be equal to our back takes,

00:06:30.475 --> 00:06:37.760
and then /countries/, then we can add our dynamic country name.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.825
So these are the country inside here,

00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:44.530
which is this individual variable that we loop through.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.605
We can then output our country name.

00:06:47.605 --> 00:06:52.085
And we can make this dynamic using the # and then the {},

00:06:52.085 --> 00:06:55.210
and then output the country.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.079
If no countries are available inside the database,

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:01.885
we can then follow up with an else block.

00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:04.580
Just on the same level as each,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.485
we can add else,

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:09.995
which I'll put a list item with the text of,

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:12.930
there are no countries.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.310
Now if we save this file and then over to our Projects and then

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.600
reload our forward/countries routes. Then scroll down.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.590
We don't quite see the information which we're expecting.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.695
We were expecting a list of countries.

00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:33.805
Again, a lot of strange looking code down below.

00:07:33.805 --> 00:07:37.975
The reason this is happening is because we are not awaiting

00:07:37.975 --> 00:07:42.640
our data to come back before we're trying to render this to the screen.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.505
This is one of the problems we mentioned before,

00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:47.440
because we're using a single weight,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.020
we need to await our data to come back from

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.100
the database before we try to use it in our application.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.695
If we go back over to the hotel controller and the list all countries,

00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:02.665
we have this function marked as a sink,

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:06.700
but we're not awaiting the hotel.distinct

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.610
value to be returned back from the database before we pass it to our templates.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.390
Hopefully now if we save this and then reload,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.690
we now get list of countries being displayed.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.310
If we click on one of these,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.594
we're then it taken to our route of countries,

00:08:24.594 --> 00:08:27.235
forward slash and then Jamaica.

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:31.825
We have an error down below because we're not handled this route just yet.

00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:35.330
Let's try another one for the Netherlands.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.905
These all appear to be working.

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:41.485
It would also look nice too,

00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:47.170
along with this country name if we can also put in a image related to this country.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.975
We already have the country images,

00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:52.615
which is stored inside of our Images folder.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.405
Public images.

00:08:55.405 --> 00:08:59.380
Then we have some countries with images down below.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.315
Let's go ahead and make use of these images in our templates.

00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:09.310
So just under our link, go on to the next line.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:13.420
Then we can set a image indentity in one level.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.120
This also links to the same route above.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.630
If the image needs a source,

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.450
is it going to be equal to o back ticks,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.645
the forward/images folder, the country's folder.

00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:30.615
Then we can add in the country name,

00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:33.494
which is simply country.

00:09:33.494 --> 00:09:38.270
Then we need to add the.jpg extension onto the end.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:45.260
If we now save this and then go over to our forward/countries routes, reload.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.880
It looks like we're typing errors.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.135
So let's take look at this.

00:09:50.135 --> 00:09:55.675
It's just because we've added a semicolon in our templates, which we don't use in pug.

00:09:55.675 --> 00:10:00.535
Refresh. There's our country images next to the name.

00:10:00.535 --> 00:10:03.370
At the moment, this looks like they are now all

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.270
working but at the moment though we can't be too sure.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:12.265
This is because we only have one hotel in each of these countries.

00:10:12.265 --> 00:10:16.315
So we don't know if it's showing a distinct value just yet.

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:20.740
We can test this by adding small hotels to our database.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.495
I know it's a bit repetitive,

00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:26.094
but let's now go ahead and add the remainder of our hotels.

00:10:26.094 --> 00:10:29.170
Then we can use this for the rest of the project.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:34.000
Let's go to forward/admin, forward/add,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.499
down to the bottom, I'm going to add hotel number 6 and then crop the Lorem Ipsum.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:51.350
Go to lipsum.com, I'm going to create two paragraphs and then hit "Generate".

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:59.770
Copy this and paste in our description.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.100
Hotel 6 has the image,

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.390
the star rates in this time of four, the country,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.890
Sri Lanka, the costs, 57.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.110
This cone can be available too.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.470
Admin/add, Hotel 7.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.940
Add the description and image.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.545
The star rating of five,

00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:34.165
the country of USA, 78.

00:11:34.165 --> 00:11:36.505
Keep this as available.

00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:39.280
Back to our admin routes.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.665
Create hotel 8.

00:11:41.665 --> 00:11:44.890
I'm going to go up to hotel 12 to much

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.190
all images which have been provided with the course.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.800
So add this in and hotel 8,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:00.295
the star rating, the country of Maldives and the availability as true.

00:12:00.295 --> 00:12:05.470
Now we can see we already have more than one hotel in the Maldives.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:10.405
Back to forward/admin, forward/add. Hotel 9.

00:12:10.405 --> 00:12:12.800
Based on a description.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.355
This one can be a star rating of four.

00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:21.200
The country of Mexico.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.994
Cost per night.

00:12:25.994 --> 00:12:29.590
Confirm. We need it now,

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:34.720
let's go on to the admin adds and creates number 10. [inaudible] four,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:41.035
hotel number 10, the description and also the image which is number 10 too.

00:12:41.035 --> 00:12:44.635
Open this up, the star rating of three.

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:47.930
Let's again go for Mexico.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.280
Have a price and then hit "Confirm".

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.010
Admin adds, hotel 11.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.505
The star rating, let's go for four,

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:09.039
the country of Thailand,

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:12.745
cost per night, 39.

00:13:12.745 --> 00:13:17.080
Confirm. Finally, we can add the hotel number 12,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.060
which is the last one.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.790
Sounds at the bottom.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.650
Hotel 12.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.500
The star rating of three,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:38.080
Dominican Republic, 56 and hit "Confirm".

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.535
Great. Now over two mLab we can now refresh.

00:13:42.535 --> 00:13:45.564
I know this is little bit boring and repetitive.

00:13:45.564 --> 00:13:50.170
But now we have all 12 hotels now in the database.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.580
So we have plenty of information to now work with in our projects.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.340
So I've provided 12 images.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.760
You can of course add more hotels, if you prefer.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.825
There is now more than one hotel located in the Maldives,

00:14:04.825 --> 00:14:08.320
Mexico, and also the Dominican Republic.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:16.045
Now if we go over to forward/countries and then hit "Enter", scroll down.

00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:19.855
We can now see all of the extra countries which we've added.

00:14:19.855 --> 00:14:22.525
There is only one of each volume.

00:14:22.525 --> 00:14:26.200
So there is only one Mexico, one Dominican Republic,

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.120
and also one Maldives,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.090
which means that with distinct values are now pulling in correctly.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:37.320
Now we're going to move on to looking at the aggregation pipelines.
