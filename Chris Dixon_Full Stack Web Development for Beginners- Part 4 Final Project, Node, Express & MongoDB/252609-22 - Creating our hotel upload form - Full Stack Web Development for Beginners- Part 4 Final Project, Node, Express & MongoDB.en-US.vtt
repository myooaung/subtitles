00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.169
Before we can push new hotels to the database,

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:06.330
we need to create a HTML form,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.285
so we can add the details we want to enter.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:12.480
This formal parts of our admin section.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.610
So let's add this admin route first over in the index.js.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.460
Open the sidebar, into the routes, and then index.js.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.730
I'm going to go down to the bottom of our router just for the export.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.545
Let's make a comment,

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:35.025
and I will say "ADMIN Routes".

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:38.850
The first one we're going to use is router.get,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.780
since this is a GET request.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.600
We want this to be for the forward slash admin routes.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.900
Then we want to run our hotelController,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.025
I'm going to call it call it the adminPage,

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:53.265
semicolon at the end.

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:55.870
As we can see with the red area down at the bottom,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.150
we don't yet have this adminPage in the control yet, so this should be next.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.015
Open the sidebar and go to our hotelController.js file,

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:08.730
and then we can add this right at the bottom.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.184
Exports towards adminPage, it's going to be equal to our function,

00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:20.415
which takes in the request and response objects.

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:23.265
Then inside the function body,

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:26.650
what we're going to do is a res.render,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.240
this is going to render an admin template,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.140
and then take in an options object where

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.275
we will pass in the title like we've done previously.

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:39.650
The title can simply be Admin,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.700
and then add a semicolon at the end.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.155
Now for the admin.book file to display this.

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:48.690
Let's go and create this admin template,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.424
open up the sidebar,

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:52.685
into our views folder,

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:57.930
create a new file called admin with the dot pug extension.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.680
This admin route is going to be fairly simple.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.680
At the moment all we're going to do is pass in

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.940
the title and then create a unordered list.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.040
This is going to have some links for the admin to use,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.304
such as the links to our new hotel,

00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:14.330
to edit or remove hotels,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.275
and to see any bookings which has been made.

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:20.505
Let's extend our layout.

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.625
Extends layout at the very top,

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.940
and then replace the content block.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.270
Indent it one level we can pass in our h2,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.380
which is the title.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.190
Then want to separate this title with the links with the horizontal line.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.535
These three links are going to be an unordered list.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.805
The first list item,

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:52.320
nested inside we can add a a for a link with the href equal to forward slash admin,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.630
and then forward slash add.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.440
This is going to be the route which is going to handle the add

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.305
in new hotels to the database.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:03.745
The texts of Add new hotel.

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.045
Then we'll do this two more times.

00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:09.720
Our second list item is also a link.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.580
This href is going to go to forward slash admin and then forward slash edit dash remove.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.025
The text of Edit forward slash Remove Hotel.

00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:28.685
We'll come back to this one later on when we look at editing and removing hotels.

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:33.870
The third one again is going to be for later too and this is going to be a link

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.560
which is going to link to a route which is forward slash admin forward slash orders.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.350
The text of View bookings and give that a save.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.045
You can test if it's working by going over to the browser

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:54.620
and then checking out the forward slash admin routes, and then hit and enter.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.770
If we scroll down, we have our title of Admin,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.245
which is passed to the templates and then our three links which we just created.

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:06.795
If we go ahead and click on "Add new hotel" at the top,

00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:10.965
we're taken to forward slash admin forward slash add,

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:13.530
which was set up just here.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.890
This results in an error down at

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.250
the bottom because we also need to set up this route too,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.950
along with a page template.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.850
Back over to our router file, which is index.js.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.200
Let's set this up with router.get.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.075
This router was forward slash admin,

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:39.570
forward slash add, to add a new hotel,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.955
and then setup our hotelController,

00:04:41.955 --> 00:04:50.110
and the function name of createHotelGet with a semicolon at the end.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.405
You may be wondering why we've called this createHotelGet,

00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:56.835
rather than simply create hotel.

00:04:56.835 --> 00:05:01.144
I've added Get onto the end because this is a GET request.

00:05:01.144 --> 00:05:06.070
Later will also be creating a POST request to this create hotel route.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.050
It makes it more clear when we get to that stage.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.985
This is now our route.

00:05:10.985 --> 00:05:15.070
We can now move on to the controller to render our view.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.920
Let's click on "hotelController.js" down at the bottom. Let's set this up.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:33.960
It was exports.createHotelGet sets up our function with the request and response objects.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.975
This is going to simply render a view.

00:05:38.975 --> 00:05:41.675
We do this with res.render,

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:44.135
just like we did with the adminPage.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:49.464
The template we're going to create is going to be add underscore hotel,

00:05:49.464 --> 00:05:52.455
and then pass in the objects,

00:05:52.455 --> 00:06:01.330
which sends the title of Add new hotel and a semicolon at the end.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.885
Just like we this admin two we've not yet created this add hotel page.

00:06:06.885 --> 00:06:08.550
Go to the sidebar,

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.445
go to the views, and create a new file,

00:06:11.445 --> 00:06:17.440
called add underscore hotel with the dot plug extension.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.410
Now it's a case of making this a form,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.670
which is going to be used to submit the hotel to our database.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.355
This needs to extend our layout,

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:30.724
select all of the files,

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.540
and then block content.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.145
Just before we get to adding our form,

00:06:38.145 --> 00:06:41.285
I'm going to add a link at the top of the page.

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:44.855
This link is going to link back to the admin section,

00:06:44.855 --> 00:06:46.970
so we can quickly switch between the add

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.680
new hotel and then go back to our three main links.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.285
The link with the href equals forward slash admin.

00:06:57.285 --> 00:07:00.060
This is going to be a button.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.895
We can add a button type.

00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:05.655
So type equals button.

00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:09.340
Then we'll also add a class which we are going to be using later when we

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.570
add some CSS or button underscore small.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.800
The text goes back to admin as this is where this is linking to.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.190
Then at the very bottom we pass in our page title.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.295
To keep this consistent we'll add this in a h2.

00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:28.935
So h2 equals title.

00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:32.140
Give this a save and check if it's working.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.395
Refresh forward slash admin, forward slash add.

00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:41.385
Underneath the layer so we can now see our button of back to admin,

00:07:41.385 --> 00:07:45.015
click on this and then we're taken back to our three links.

00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:48.225
We can now go back to add new hotel.

00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:53.510
We need create our form now which is going to have all the fields we need for our hotel.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.320
These fields need so much of the data inside our model.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.830
Let's go ahead and create our form underneath the h2.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:06.665
The form and then the attributes inside the brackets, the action.

00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:09.635
This is going to link to the same page,

00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:12.805
so we can keep the routes with an empty string.

00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:18.280
The method, this is going to be a post request.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.790
Then indent it in one level.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.400
I'm going to create a div which is going to have the class of form underscore input.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.180
Each one of these form groups is going to have the same class.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.770
We can keep the styling consistent when we get to the CSS later.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:40.385
The first one will be labeled and this is going to be for hotel name.

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:44.385
So hotel underscore name,

00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:47.770
and then the text of Hotel name.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.000
After the label will then add our input.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.720
This input is going to have the type of text,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.760
the name of hotel_name.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.960
Like I mentioned before, these fields need to match the data in our model.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:15.250
If we go over to our hotel.js and we'll begin right at the top with hotel name.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.510
This needs much name,

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.295
which we gave this in our schema.

00:09:18.295 --> 00:09:20.320
Hotel_name.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.830
Then we'll do the same for description and also for the rest of

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.720
the fields inside here. Back to our form.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.595
The name of hotel name and this field is also required.

00:09:33.595 --> 00:09:36.955
The next one is going to be for the description.

00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:42.790
The surrounding div of form input, the label.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.310
This one is going to be for hotel description.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.790
Then it's x-naught hotel description.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.300
This time rather than an input,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.580
this is going to be a text area.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.760
We do this input, just like the rest of the elements.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.800
We can add the name of texts area,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.205
and then we add the brackets or the attributes.

00:10:09.205 --> 00:10:13.010
The name of hotel_description.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.410
The ID, which is also

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:23.950
hotel_description and let's make

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.480
this smaller so it all fits on one line with the text area.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.265
You can also set the default number of columns and also rows.

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:39.025
So I'm going to set the columns to be 13 and also the rows to be ten.

00:10:39.025 --> 00:10:41.770
This is also required too,

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.410
like all the rest of the fields.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.865
Below this thing,next one is going to be for the hotel image.

00:10:48.865 --> 00:10:55.190
So I'm going to go ahead and add the wrapper which is form inputs,

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:01.130
the label for the image,

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.300
the textile photo image.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.570
This time it's going to be an input for the file.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.690
So the inputs with the type of file,

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.485
since we'll be using uploaded images from the user machine.

00:11:17.485 --> 00:11:19.915
So the type of file,

00:11:19.915 --> 00:11:25.520
the name is going to be image along with the ID.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.150
Let's go ahead and copy this hotel name.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.810
Then after the image paces in,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.300
this one is going to be for the star rating.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.065
So the label will have the name of

00:11:41.065 --> 00:11:47.200
star_rating and this will be a star rating of one to five.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.570
Star rating for the name is input type is going to be of number.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:58.855
To restrict this from one to five with the name of star_rating.

00:11:58.855 --> 00:12:01.510
This is also required to.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.580
Let's Keep this between one and five.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:12.070
We can also add the min attributes of one and also the maximum attributes of five.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.230
Go to under the star rating,

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.850
we can add this in again,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.775
make sure the indentation is correct.

00:12:18.775 --> 00:12:22.870
This one after the star rating is going to be for the country.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.704
So the name of country,

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:28.660
the same for the text.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.230
The input type is also going to be text too.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:41.330
So we can name this the name of country and also let's give this an ID of country too.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.610
This is also required too.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.100
The same again after the country.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.160
This one is going to be for the cost per night.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:58.670
So the label is going to be for cost_per_night.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.890
Text of cost per night to,

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.785
the inputs is going to be for price.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.560
So we can set this to be a number.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.020
The name can also match this,

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.520
so we can copy this and paste this in for the inputs.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.115
So we have the type, the name,

00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:23.695
and we also need the ID of cost per night too.

00:13:23.695 --> 00:13:29.935
So add this in and the next one after this,

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:32.005
if we go right down to the very bottom,

00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:34.660
is going to be for the availability.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.895
So we're going to add some radio buttons.

00:13:36.895 --> 00:13:41.320
Which we can select if the hotel is available or unavailable.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:47.035
So the wrapper of form inputs is going to have two radio buttons.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:53.600
The first one can have a label and this is for available,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.620
the text is available too.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:05.450
Then our input, which is the type of radio.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:13.585
After the type we can add the ID and this one is going to be the same.

00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:16.329
This also needs a name.

00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:19.090
This is the time of available.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.985
This is the data which we sent to the server.

00:14:21.985 --> 00:14:28.960
The value is going to be equal to true and we'll set the next one to be equal to false.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.730
So if this one is checked,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.370
we'll get the available equal to true,

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.520
and the next one will be available equal to false.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.430
By default, we want this true to be checked.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.480
So we can also add the checked attribute inside there.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.745
Then we just need to do the same for

00:14:45.745 --> 00:14:50.470
unavailable so we can copy these two lines and then add them below.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:57.145
This is unavailable as is the text and then the input.

00:14:57.145 --> 00:14:59.350
We can add on,

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.705
save the name, the value of false.

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:10.450
We can also remove this checked attribute because we only want one checked at once.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.895
So now the last thing we need to do is

00:15:12.895 --> 00:15:16.705
a button which is going to go ahead and submit this form.

00:15:16.705 --> 00:15:19.975
This can have the same form input wrapper.

00:15:19.975 --> 00:15:22.360
Skip the styling consistent.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.490
This time this is a button with the type of submit,

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:38.170
the class, the class we've already used before of button_small.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.200
This will keep the CSS more consistent and

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.055
then in capital we're also going to add the button text of Confirm.

00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:49.810
We can now save this and then go over to our admin.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.305
Make sure we're on forward/admin,forward /ads.

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:58.360
Now we should see the add new hotel form down at the bottom.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.230
If you've seen your form with no errors, congratulations.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.045
If you do see any errors,

00:16:04.045 --> 00:16:06.714
make sure you check over your code for any typos.

00:16:06.714 --> 00:16:09.025
Before moving on to the next video,

00:16:09.025 --> 00:16:13.460
we will finally get a hotel push to our database
