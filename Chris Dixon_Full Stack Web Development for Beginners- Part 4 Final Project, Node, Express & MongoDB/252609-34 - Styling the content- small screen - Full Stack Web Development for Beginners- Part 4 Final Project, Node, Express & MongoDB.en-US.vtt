00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.485
With the header styling now complete for our mobile view,

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.845
we can now move down to a style in the content area,

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:11.470
which has the hotels and also the countries.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.540
If we go over to our index dot pug.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.000
Open the sidebar into the views and then our index dot pug.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.860
Over on the side here we have a outer wrapper,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.245
which is this one just here.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:33.510
Then nested inside we have a hotel wrapper which goes down the hotel section,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.340
and then a country wrapper,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.625
or the country section down at the bottom of our index page.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:45.690
Let's go to our style dot css and begin working with the outer wrapper.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.345
Make a comment.

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.670
This is the content section.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.520
Hotels and countries, view.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.750
Okay, so let's start with the dot outer wrapper, with the under score.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.210
This is a wrapper for basically all hotels

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.540
and countries we see over on the homepage here.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.800
We're going to use it to align the text to the center and also set the font size.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.020
The text-align property, of center and a font size of one em.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.985
Set this, and then reload.

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:36.760
Now we can see our title and also all hotel information is now aligned to the center.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.960
Now on to the dot hotel div.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.425
This was the wrapper we used inside of each hotel.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:47.790
If we go to the mixins and then hotel dot pug,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.450
we gave each hotel a wrapper of dot hotel so let's use it now in the css.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.840
Below outer wrapper target the hotel.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.640
Okay, so we're going to give each individual hotel a background color of white,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.975
so it stands out against the Grey background.

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:14.550
Background of white and also some margin of zero on the top,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.290
zero on the right,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.690
one em on the bottom,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.890
and zero on the left.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.945
If we now save this and then refresh,

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:27.320
we now see the white background color and also

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.735
the margin on the bottom separates out each hotel.

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.830
Also inside of this mixin,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.010
we have the text fields inside of a div called hotel info.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.925
Back to our dot hotel dot pug,

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:46.610
we have this hotel info section which contains the hotel name,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.770
and also in the hotel detail,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.930
we have the description and also the star rating,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.225
the country and the price.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:58.235
It's basically all these texts we see in each hotel.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:03.395
At the moment, if you click on any individual hotel and then scroll down,

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:06.395
were then taken to the hotel detail view.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:09.860
All the text inside here is close to the edge.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.230
We can fix this with some padding.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.645
Style dot css, the hotel underscore info.

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:21.035
All we need to do here to fix this,

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:26.055
is to add some padding of one em and then reload.

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:29.180
Now have some spacing around the title,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.005
the description, and also the information down at the bottom.

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:36.350
Next, I'm going to move over to our forms.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.390
If we go over to our admin,

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.020
we should make this a little bit bigger so we can see the URL.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.585
Admin and then forward slash add.

00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:49.035
Scroll down to our form,

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:51.990
and currently our form doesn't look too great.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.570
Let's get to work on this now.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.745
Shrink the browser back down.

00:03:56.745 --> 00:04:01.700
We've already added certain class names inside of our views.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.580
We go to add hotel, close this down.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.110
We have this hotel form which is rendered as a mixin.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.525
If we go over to this we have

00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:18.080
each individual form group with the label an input surrounded by this form input wrapper.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.085
This can be used over in the style.css.

00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:27.445
First of all, form underscore input.

00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:29.580
We can add some margin.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.450
If we add one em and then zero,

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.710
this will add one em of margin to the top and bottom.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.010
Give in some space in between each input.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.975
Then we can go ahead and target the individual input and also the text area.

00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:49.585
Because we want this label to appear to the left of each input.

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:54.140
To begin, if we set each input to be the width of 70 percent,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.880
to make it a little bit narrower,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.735
this will then give us the space to add a label on the left.

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:02.920
We target the form input,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.030
and then each individual input and then we also need to target the text area too.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.860
Set the width to be 70 percent.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.185
Also the text line to be on the left.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:23.235
Save and then refresh. Okay, that's better.

00:05:23.235 --> 00:05:25.785
Now on to our label.

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:28.535
Again, the form input.

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:31.900
But this time we're going to be targeting the label.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.125
Set the display to be inline-block.

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:39.970
Then give this a width of 20 percent to

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.630
make sure this fits on the same line as the input.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.175
If we reload, we now have each label to the left of the input.

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:51.180
Onto this text area,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.500
we remove the border from all of the rest of

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.640
the inputs and give these a border-radius of five pixels.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.120
Let's also apply this to the text area so it matches.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:10.600
The border of none and then the border radius of five pixels,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.005
semi-colon, and then reload.

00:06:16.005 --> 00:06:19.800
Now it's exterior matches the rest of the inputs.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.010
Then finally down at the bottom we have

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.850
this large confirmed button inside of the hotel form.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.920
If we go down to button at the bottom,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.805
we gave this a class of button small.

00:06:30.805 --> 00:06:36.840
Let's copy this and over in the style dot css add the dot and paste this in.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.095
Let's make this smaller by adding the width of 100 pixels,

00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:50.475
and also some margin of 0.5 ems to give it some spacing, below the browser.

00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:54.350
There we go. Now the back to admin button and also

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.925
our confirm button at the bottom is now using this button small class.

00:06:58.925 --> 00:07:02.575
Now this looks a lot nicer for our small screens.

00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:08.225
Back to the home page and scroll down and everything looks pretty much as it should be.

00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:11.395
However, though, if we stretch the browser,

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:13.360
make this real wide,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.340
things begin to look a little too stretched.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.850
This is something we will move on to in the next video,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.410
where we'll begin styling the larger view by adding in a media query.
