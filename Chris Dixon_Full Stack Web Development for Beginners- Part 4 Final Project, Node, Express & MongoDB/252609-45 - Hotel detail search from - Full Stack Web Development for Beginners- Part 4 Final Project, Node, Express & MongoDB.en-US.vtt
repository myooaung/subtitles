00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.160
We now have a working search form in the header section.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.780
I'm now going to add a similar one to the hotel detail view.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.630
You may be wondering why we need to do this.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.715
Let's take a quick look.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:21.635
If we go to the homepage and then go to the hotel detail view for any of these hotels.

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:26.565
Click on the title to be then taken it to the full view.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:30.405
Imagine we were a user visiting this site,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.785
and then we'd like to look at this hotel and then clicked on it.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:37.160
At the moment, there's no way to personalize

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.105
this booking by adding our details which has the departure date,

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.664
the number of guests, and also the duration.

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:48.965
If we were visiting this hotel and we wanted to make a booking,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:55.760
the only way to do this would be to go up to the top navigation and create a new search.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.775
This may not be a huge problem at the moment because we don't have a lot of hotels,

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:05.285
but on a larger project with thousands of hotels,

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:07.915
this may become an issue for the user.

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:10.625
What we're going to do in this video is to create

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:14.005
a similar search form to the one inside the header.

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.949
We'll go to then place it down at the bottom,

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:20.035
but this is only going to have certain information.

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:23.105
We only need the duration,

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:26.680
the departure date, and also the number of guests.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.770
We're also going to remove the star rating and the price because we don't need

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.425
these since we already have the hotel selected, which we want.

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:41.515
Let's go over to our layout.pug and if we scroll down,

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:45.130
this is the search form from the top navigation.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.085
If we copy this section from the section of div,

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:53.085
all the way down to our submit button,

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:57.600
let's copy this and then head over to our underscore hotel,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.505
which is the mixin.

00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:04.370
I'm going to add this form in just under the cost per night.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.055
After here we can add

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:10.585
some conditional rendering to only display this on the current routes,

00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:15.110
which starts with a forward slash all, and then forward slash.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.040
If url.startswith,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.505
then add another string which is forward slash all and then forward slash at the end.

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:32.525
After this, we can then paste in our search form from before.

00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:36.550
If we scroll out, make sure this is all indented correctly,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.640
otherwise we'll get some issues.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.185
The search now we can indent the section all in one level.

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:48.135
Scroll down to the button, indent this in.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:51.215
At one level inside from the statements,

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:56.090
I'm also going to separate this section with a horizontal line with

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.570
the hr elements and then also add a h3 title of search for this hotel.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.530
Good. We already know which hotel we want to be searching for.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.140
We can add in the value.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.370
If we go down to the destination.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.530
Just on here, we can remove required.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.160
We can set the value to be equal to hotel,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.900
which is the information passed to the mixin,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.090
hotel and then dot hotel underscore name.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.495
Now the value of this field will now be pre-populated with hotel name.

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:45.850
Therefore, the user doesn't need to do a specific search for this hotel.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.050
We also need the duration,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.260
the departure date, the number of guests.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.415
We don't need the star rating since we already have the hotel.

00:03:55.415 --> 00:04:01.650
We can also remove the sorting order and leaving the search.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.285
Now if we give this a save and then go to the browser,

00:04:05.285 --> 00:04:08.360
reload on this hotel detail view,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.965
scroll to the bottom,

00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:12.670
and now we have our search form down here.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.850
We can see we already have hotel seven already inside,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.875
which we got from adding the value as an attribute inside here.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:25.805
This hotel also much is the current one which we're on.

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:28.880
Let just go back to the homepage and select

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.665
a different one and check this is still working.

00:04:32.665 --> 00:04:37.735
Scroll to the bottom, and now hotel four is now inside of our inputs.

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:40.530
Now we've selected the hotel we want.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.795
Let's try and personalize this so we can go ahead and place an order.

00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:49.550
Add a duration, a departure date,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.860
number of guests, click on search.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.550
Remember this form is already set up to go to forward slash results,

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.630
which is the same route as the form inside of our header.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.420
A lot of this should be already handled follows.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.340
We're going to forward slash results.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.400
Then we see an error at the bottom saying the ordering must be ascending or descending.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.140
The reason we're getting this error is because if we trace it back,

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.785
we're currently going to forward slash results,

00:05:23.785 --> 00:05:27.660
so forward slash results inside of our layouts,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.460
inside of our routes go to index dot JS forward slash

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.830
results goes to this hotel controller of search results.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.025
If we trace this back,

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:42.795
hotel controller, and then go to search results.

00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:47.520
We still trying to submit a query to our database.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.800
Also include in a star rating,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.680
and sort these by ascending or descending order.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.405
We still need to add some information to make sure that this is bypassed on this page.

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:02.665
The way we can do this is just about the top here.

00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:06.650
We have our two constants which store in this data.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.590
I'm going to use the operator to add in a value if one is submitted.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.915
The two pipes for all the value of one,

00:06:16.915 --> 00:06:20.400
and then the same below or one.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.660
Basically if we use in the header form at the top,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.420
we're going to receive the number of stars and also a value for the sort order.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.260
If none of these is received we then just going to add in a value of one,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.670
to each one of these.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.035
Therefore, this shouldn't cause any problems when searching our database.

00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:42.570
Now if we save this and then reload,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.560
we now get research results as expected.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.245
This time though, only returning the current hotel which the user has selected,

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:55.075
but also passing in the details on the right-hand side.

00:06:55.075 --> 00:06:57.005
Let's try one more.

00:06:57.005 --> 00:07:01.160
If we go to all hotels.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.220
Let's scroll down, if you go to hotel two,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.935
we have a form at the bottom,

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:10.200
with a value of hotel two.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.310
Let's try five, add any date inside here,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.445
two guests and scroll down,

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:19.985
and this is all now working correctly.

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:24.305
Now let's move on to the next section where we'll step things up a little,

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:29.580
and you will learn all about adding user accounts and authentication.
