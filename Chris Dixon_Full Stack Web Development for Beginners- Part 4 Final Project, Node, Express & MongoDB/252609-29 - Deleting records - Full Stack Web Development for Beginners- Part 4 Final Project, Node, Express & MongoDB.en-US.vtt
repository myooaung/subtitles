00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
The final big action we want to perform is to be able to delete items from our database.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.330
You will often hear the acronym CRUD,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.325
when dealing with databases.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:15.000
Which is short for the four main actions which are create,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.575
read, update, and delete.

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:19.775
We've already created data,

00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:24.810
we can also read data too and then in the last video we updated our data.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.365
It's now time to look at deleting records too.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:34.455
Let's go ahead and create a test hotel to work with over an admin folds/add.

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:37.215
That's our test, test,

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:39.700
and we can choose any image,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.885
any star rating is fine and the country and then confirm.

00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:52.140
After this redirect, we now redirected

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.745
to formal/all and then the ID of the country which we created.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:01.820
Grab this new hotels ID by copying this section here.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.680
Then check this is stored in a database over an mlab, so hit reload.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.715
Just double check, we have our test,

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:17.880
so go to the first section, and there we are.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.825
There's our test hotel inside of the database.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:27.425
If we go back over to our projects and then go to admin so forward/admin,

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.785
we can select, edit, and remove hotel.

00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:33.170
Just like we did in the last video,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.660
we can paste in hotel ID,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.835
which was created for tests,

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:42.620
confirm, and then we're taken to the full view and we will

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.570
have the buttons from the last video where we can update and delete the hotel.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.740
Click on the delete button this time and then forwarded to forward/admin,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.940
forward/our hotel ID, forwad/delete.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.025
This is because we said this earlier in the hotel detailed templates.

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:03.005
Open up the sidebar,

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.365
and then go into hotel_detail.

00:02:06.365 --> 00:02:10.015
This is the link which we said use inside of here,

00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:13.070
and this is what we're going to go ahead and handle in

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.355
the routers index [inaudible] file.

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:21.215
Close it down and then over in the index.js,

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:25.700
this time we're going to set router.get to be

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.395
the string winter scene of admin forward/our dynamic segments,

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:37.610
which is hotel ID capital I, and then forward/delete.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.230
This follows the same pattern as

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.805
the update section just above but this time using delete.

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:51.330
We're then going to create our hotel controller.delete hotel get.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.375
Then over to the hotel controller we can now create this function.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:06.490
Hotel controller.js and then down to the bottom,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.700
so this is exports.delete hotel guests.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.605
This will be a sync function so mark this as a sync.

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:19.975
As in our objects or request response and next fall or

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:26.380
middle ware setup all function so this is going to be pretty similar to a booth.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.395
We also need to ground this hotel ID from the premises, so paste this in.

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:35.770
Willing not to say a power hotel constant,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.185
so const hotel and this is going to be equal to await,

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:47.185
wait of a hotel model and then use the method called find one.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.750
This is going to find one record inside of

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.530
our database and we want to find it by the hotel ID,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.290
which we have stored just here.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.700
As an object, add this in.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.870
We want to find one record by

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.245
the underscore ID field and the ID we want to match to is hotel ID,

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:11.260
which is this variable just here.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.605
Then we can go ahead and do a rest or render to display the contents of our templates,

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:19.780
which just like before when updating,

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.260
we're going to render the same ad hotel templates.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.230
For this time, clicking and confirm at the bottom of our form.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.925
We'll then go ahead and delete our hotel rather than update.

00:04:30.925 --> 00:04:35.875
Add_hotel as in our object,

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:41.690
the title of delete hotel,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.215
an then passing our hotel variable.

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:52.230
The reason we're using this add hotel template once more is so as you can see all of

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.880
the hotel details influencables to make sure that this is the one we want to delete.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.845
We also pass in this hotel,

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:01.540
which we're going to be deleting.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.665
Once again, you can populate all fields inside of our form.

00:05:05.665 --> 00:05:10.270
Now if we say this makes you on the same routes as before,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.910
which is admin, our hotel ID, and then delete.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.150
We can now reload and now we get the add hotel form.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.585
Now what this mean? Now we have this get request all setup.

00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:24.685
We need to now handle how we delete the hotel.

00:05:24.685 --> 00:05:28.790
To do this, we can create a post request to the same route.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.680
Over to the index.js,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.900
let's duplicate this line here, paste this in,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.820
this time this is a post request and delete hotel post

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:53.590
over to the hotel controller and this is exports.delete hotel post.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.270
This is also a sync function since we're dealing with data from our database,

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.080
passing request, response and next.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.065
Next thing to do is to add our error handling we try and catch.

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:16.205
I just noticed above, we also need to add this into that too.

00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:21.915
Just for moments will ask the error and then pass our error to

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:30.600
next and then we can add this to delete hotel get too so try.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.850
We can add these three lines until a try block and then

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:46.365
add catch and emphasis to next with our error.

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:51.535
Good, so back to our post requests below inside of the try section.

00:06:51.535 --> 00:06:57.470
Again, we want to grab the ID from the parameters so we can copy this line here.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:04.980
This in an asset of our hotel so const hotel awaits,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.140
our hotel model and to remove an item from [inaudible] ,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.995
we can use a method called find by ID and remove,

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:15.815
which is fairly similar to the one we used above,

00:07:15.815 --> 00:07:19.105
but this one was find by ID and update.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.440
Down to our post request,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.830
we can again find by ID and remove.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.855
Then inside here all we need to do is pass in the ID of the hotel we want to remove.

00:07:32.855 --> 00:07:36.020
ID, the field we want to target,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.660
and then matches to our hotel ID,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.110
which is this constant just here,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.905
so semicolon at the end.

00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:46.940
Once we've deleted this hotel from the database,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.740
we'll then want to perform a redirect.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.075
Rest or redirect and where do you want to go too?

00:07:54.075 --> 00:07:56.825
Well, before when we're looking at updating hotels,

00:07:56.825 --> 00:08:02.779
it made sense to redirect to the current hotel with the updated information.

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:09.020
However, we can't do the same when delete in a hotel because this hotel no longer exists.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.980
Instead, I'm just going to redirect to the home route,

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.895
gives us a save and then over to the browser.

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:19.355
If we reload, so now we're currently on

00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:24.510
our test hotel and now for click ''confirmed'' creates a post request.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.270
This is a good sign were being redirected to the homepage.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.850
Now over to mlab refresh.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:39.150
We now down to 12 records so we have hotel 1, 2,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.385
3, 4, 5, 6,

00:08:41.385 --> 00:08:44.085
7, 8, 9, 10.

00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:47.505
On the next page we have 11 and 12,

00:08:47.505 --> 00:08:51.325
so it looks like our hotel has been successfully deleted.

00:08:51.325 --> 00:08:53.975
If yours been deleted, congratulations,

00:08:53.975 --> 00:08:56.720
you have now performed create, read,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.635
update, and delete actions on your database.

00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:05.735
This is a big step for our application and we've made a lot of progress.

00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:07.430
In the next section of this course,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.370
we're going to be pushing on with our projects by adding,

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:16.025
styling, more templates and features and generally making improvements.

00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:20.340
look forward to seeing you in the next section and bye for now.
