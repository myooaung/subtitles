00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.420
When dealing with anything new,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.710
just like Prog ,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.160
we really began to get better when we practice on our own.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.125
Without just following along.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:13.125
Here we can see the final version of the projects,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.030
which I would like you to go ahead and create

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.720
this header section from the top navigation,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.925
which includes the logo and also the links at the top,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.720
right down to the main beach image just here.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.025
If you feel confident, you can also add the search form two, which is in the middle.

00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:35.010
Just as a guide for where you're going.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.735
In this, we'll need to go inside of auto-layout dot Prog file,

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:40.760
inside of the body section.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.370
So just above this block content.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.885
So it's at the very top of the page.

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:50.825
I'll be going over all of this in the next video.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:52.700
So don't worry about messing up.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.485
It's all good practice.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.990
So I would recommend you pause the video

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.500
now on this final version and then it give this a go.
