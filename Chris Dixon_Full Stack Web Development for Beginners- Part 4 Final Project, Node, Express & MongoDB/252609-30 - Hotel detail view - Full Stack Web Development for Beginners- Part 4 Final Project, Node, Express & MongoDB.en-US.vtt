00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.570
In this section, we're going to be pushing on with

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.030
our projects and doing some general work,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.535
includes styling and improvements.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:13.590
I'm going to kick things off by working with the hotel detailed templates which

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.870
we created to display the hotel we searched for before editing or deleting.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.175
We're again going to reuse these templates in a few places.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:27.480
First of all, if we go over to the homepage or the home routes,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.000
and then click on any of our hotels,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.245
go down to the bottom of our templates,

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.050
we see an error message of not found.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.495
This is because we need to handle

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:43.170
these routes which you have at the top of forward slash all,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.715
then forward slash the hotel ID.

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:49.550
With these few, we can reuse the hotel at detailed templates which we

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.140
created and also adding these routes will fix other areas too.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.805
For example, if we go back to the homepage and then you click on,

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:07.320
see all, clicking on any of these hotels is again taken to the same route.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.610
So click on hotel one and we have the same routes of foward slash

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.035
all and then our hotel ID along with the error at the bottom.

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:18.330
This will fix both of these problems, and also again,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.525
if we go over to the hotelController.js and go to create hotel post.

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:32.110
Scroll up, so you create hotel post here and this res.redirect,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.670
also redirect to this same routes here.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.475
This is after we create a new hotel,

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:40.690
will then redirect this hotel detail page.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.340
This is a good one to get working now.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.185
Let's start with the route over any index dot js.

00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:49.295
If we scroll up, we should already have

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:52.160
the route or the get to the forward slash all route.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.055
Let's keep these in sequence and add this below.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:59.390
So router.get around this time, as we know,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.490
is forward slash all,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.660
and then the hotel ID,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.165
which you can add as a dynamic segment.

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:07.765
I'm going to call this variable the hotel.

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:10.805
This is also going to use the hotel controller

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:14.790
and then use a function called hotel detail,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.985
semicolon at the ends.

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:22.655
Then we can go ahead and create hotel detail over in the controller.

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:25.355
We can add this anywhere,

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:28.260
let's go down to the bottom.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.680
We start as always with exports,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.630
and then the name of hotel detail,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.940
and then set this to a sync function,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.919
pass in the request,

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.520
the response and also next,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.650
add the body of our function.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.600
Then I'll try catch block.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.160
So try and then catch which takes in the error,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.640
and then pass the error to next.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.454
Okay, good. We're going to begin by creating a couple of constants.

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:06.950
The first constant is going to grab the parameter,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.885
which is the hotel ID.

00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:13.465
We're going to use this hotel dynamic segments, which is in the URL.

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:15.870
Let's first say this is in a constant.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.945
So const, hotelparam is equal to the request dot params and then dot hotel,

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:26.850
which is the name we gave it.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.500
A second constant, which is for the hotel data.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.574
We're going to use this to search our database

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:37.825
using this hotel parameter and then find the unique hotel which we need.

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:39.970
We're again going to use await,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.900
to wait on states are coming back before moving on.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.410
We need to search for the hotel model,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.060
capital H, use the find method.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.090
Then we need to pass in the field that we want to find.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.110
We want to use the underscore ID fields and check

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.525
for any ID's which match our hotel param variable.

00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:04.110
Pass in the hotel param,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.225
add a semicolon at the end.

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.250
Then to finish this off, we're going to do a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.810
res.render to render out templates to the screen.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.950
The template we're going to use is hotel underscore detail.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.320
Pass in the title of

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.975
let's travel and then pass along our variable of hotel data,

00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:32.120
which is this variable here,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.030
which stores the unique hotel from the database.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.270
Now since we already have hotel underscore detail

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.770
inside of our sidebar and then in the views.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.540
We have this views down here.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.620
We only have this setup and this is also receiving the same variable name of hotel data.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.790
Now if we give this a safe,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.315
say the controller and then go back over to our browser and now reload.

00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:04.745
We now grabbing the hotel ID from the URL personally to our controller,

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:07.280
which is then getting the information back from

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.970
our database and then sending this to our hotel detail template.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.090
We should also see this is working if we go to

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.260
the homepage and click on any of these hotels,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.455
to be taken to the hotel detail page.

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:24.305
Let's also test the routes,

00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:26.030
which is all the hotels.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.030
Click on see all, and again,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.195
any of these hotels,

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:33.720
and this one's working fine too.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.110
Finally we can go to add new hotel.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.750
Go to our admin forward slash at and let's create a test hotel.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.000
Any information in here is fine.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.880
Then confirm, scroll down and there's our test hotel,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.034
which we just created and as we've seen before we get a res dot redirect,

00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:06.890
which goes through forward slash all and then this hotel ID.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.695
Although this hotel detail view at the moment,

00:06:09.695 --> 00:06:11.975
looks the same as all of the hotels,

00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:14.420
there will be some differences soon.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.490
When we go ahead and add some styling,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.670
multiple hotels will fit on the same page just like in this homepage here.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.280
But if you click on this and look at the hotel detail view,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.045
this will be a single view for just one hotel.

00:06:29.045 --> 00:06:32.060
This will also give us the space to add more details,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.345
such as a hotel description down near the bottom,

00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:40.980
and this is what we will do in the next video when we look at conditional rendering.
