00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.605
Now is the time to make our project look a little nicer with some CSS.

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:11.610
I'm going to begin by styling the header section for the small screen view.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.130
Let's begin by shrinking down the browser.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.685
So shrink this down and then over in Visual Studio,

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.490
we can also make this smaller too,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.385
open up the sidebar inside of our public file or public folder.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:35.550
Let's click on this and then we have a style-sheets folder with our style.css,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.750
and then close the sidebar.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.520
Inside here we have some defaults, styling,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.265
which is provided with the express generator.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:46.370
So I'm going to select all and remove.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.280
To begin, I'm going to add some general styling to the HTML on body sections.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.520
So as the HTML selector and then declare we want the background to be white.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.960
Then down to a body section and of course,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.900
feel free to make any changes to make this app more

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.315
personal or follow along with me if you prefer the same styling.

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:16.265
So the background for the bony section,

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:20.999
I'm going to give this a value with the hash of eee,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.110
the center this inside the browser and we can use margin zero

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.499
also set the maximum weight of the body to be 1500 pixels.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.950
This will make sure that on really large monitors,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.730
the content isn't too stretched and finally,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.700
some padding on the boundary of zero on the top and

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.970
bottom and warn M on the left and right.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.450
So we save this and reload.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.030
We shouldn't see too much of a difference for now,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.580
but we can just see the gray background color,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.950
IPO decentralized and also a little bit upon him.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.540
From the top I'm going to begin with the nav links,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.260
which are these ones just here and these have a wrapper of nav inside here.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.485
I'm going to change the display type to make use of the flex-box.

00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:19.120
So display flex, and then we can set the flex direction to the column.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.425
This will set the flex items from the top to bottom.

00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:27.570
Also the align items property to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.180
the center and also declared the background color. So much the logo.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.400
So set the background to a volume using the hash for

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.430
the hex values of 4dc2ca Reload this.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.820
There we go. So now our items are now centered in the middle of the page,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.300
and also have the same background color as a logo.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.835
It looks as though there's also some defaults,

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:58.085
margins and plains on here.

00:02:58.085 --> 00:03:01.300
Let's get to work with our unordered list.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.550
First of all, remove any default put in a URL,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.835
and then uses just over to the left.

00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:14.030
The individual list items.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.170
We can make these a little larger by setting the font size to be 1.2 em.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.680
The display to be

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.345
inline-block and then also the margin

00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:35.170
of zero on the top and bottom and ten pixels on the left and right.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.020
Reload. Okay, good.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.630
So now our list items are inline block,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.750
so they displayed across the page in online formats and also they are still below

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.775
the logo because we said the flux direction of column on the nav elements,

00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:55.535
which includes the logo and also our list items.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.895
So down to our list items here.

00:03:57.895 --> 00:04:00.175
We can then target the links too.

00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:07.225
So first of all, if we set the text decoration to be non saving reload,

00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:11.095
and this will remove the defaults on the line from our links.

00:04:11.095 --> 00:04:16.845
We can also remove this default color by setting the color value,

00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:19.920
I want to use a RGB color.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.910
So the first one is red value of 43, 40, and 40.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.604
The green and blue refresh,

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:33.535
which will give us this darker gray color.

00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:37.235
If we go over to our layout output file.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:40.460
So open the sidebar into the views,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.570
and layout that hook up to a form at the top.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.860
We added a wrapper classof.search nav,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.340
which is the main wrapper for all of these form items inside of our header and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.860
also each individual inputs also had a wrapper of dots input rapid too.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.165
So we'll go back to our style.css and begin working with our form inside the header.

00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:10.385
First of all, the main wrapper which was search nav.

00:05:10.385 --> 00:05:15.665
So search_nav. The backgrounds.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:20.430
I'm going to set this to a hex value of, c1e6e9.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.860
then make sure this is spelled correctly.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.315
Give that save and now we'll have the lighter blue color 404.

00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:34.365
A little padding inside here too,

00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:38.860
just add some spacing of 0.5 em.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.100
So next I'm going to move on to all of these items in

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.310
sort of a form by setting the display type to be flex.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.480
We can also give these a flex direction of column for the mobile view.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.915
Later on, we'll also change these to be back to the default row,

00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:58.715
which will then display these across the page when we have more available space.

00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:01.430
So let's target these in the CSS.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:11.075
We've got search_nav and we can only select the form which is inside of this class here.

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:14.780
Meaning the styles which are inside here will only display to

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.865
this particular form and no other forms on all sides.

00:06:18.865 --> 00:06:22.350
So display type or flex.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.000
The flex direction of column.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.744
So this is a fact and some retriever

00:06:29.744 --> 00:06:34.415
and then we can go ahead and target the individual inputs.

00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:38.135
So the individual inputs for the smallest green,

00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:41.135
we won't need to be the full width of the page.

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:44.675
Set the width to be 100 percent.

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:50.080
We can declare the heights of 20 pixels.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.420
Save this, and reload. Okay, good.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:01.960
Let's also add some margins and patterns to give you some space into. The padding.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:09.330
So 0.5 em on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.340
Skewed easy full width.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.535
So also some margin on the top,

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:21.370
space out from the ones above and we all need a little bit of margin of 0.3 em.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.805
Save and then reload.

00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:28.055
I'm also going to remove this default border around the inputs.

00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:33.070
So let's set the border to be a value of zero.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:39.095
Reload, and now we have this gray line removed from each one of the inputs.

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:41.300
At the moment on the mobile view,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.955
if we type into one of these destinations,

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:46.795
the text line is over on the left-hand side.

00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:50.810
I'm going to change this to be in the sensor by using the text align

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.480
property of center and also add some border-radius.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.270
So each one of these inputs of five pixels.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.450
Save then reload this and now we can see how text is now centered,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.355
and we have a little bit of radius on each one of the inputs.

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:12.605
Then down to the input refer,

00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:16.925
which surrounds each one of our label on input combinations.

00:08:16.925 --> 00:08:20.540
Just to add some margin on to the top and bottom to out

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:26.135
some foam spacing and also align this text inside the sensor for the label.

00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:30.210
So targets the input on a scale wrapper,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:39.210
the margin, the top and bottom values of 0.5 em,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.690
and then zero on the left and rights.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:50.160
We can align our labels with a text line of center. Save and then reload.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.975
Codes now look a lot nicer inside of the mobile view.

00:08:53.975 --> 00:08:56.480
We can now add some finishing touches to

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.165
the select inputs and also the button's down at the bottom.

00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:04.250
We can select these by the element's name.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.580
So select and button.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:13.045
Let's declare the heights of 36 pixels.

00:09:13.045 --> 00:09:17.595
The width on the small screen of 100 percent.

00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:20.600
So much of the rest of the inputs and also

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.655
remove the default border by setting to be none.

00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:27.920
Save and then refresh. Okay, good.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.550
So we needed an alpha of a form.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.520
The last thing I want to do is to target just the buttons to give this

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:42.395
a background color of cadet blue and also give us a border-radius of five pixels.

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:45.200
So much all the rest of the inputs.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.265
Okay, reload. Good. Our header section

00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:53.020
on our form is now looking a lot nicer on the small view.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.485
If we scroll down the final touch I'm going to make in this video is to set

00:09:57.485 --> 00:10:01.430
these header beach image and also any other images on

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.030
the site to be 100 percent to benefit

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:10.470
the container rather than overflowing like we see if we scroll to the right.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.575
So down below the button,

00:10:13.575 --> 00:10:16.245
select all the image elements.

00:10:16.245 --> 00:10:19.960
Set the width to be 100 percent.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:26.460
Refresh, and it instantly looks a lot better now.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:33.560
Good. Our header is now looking better on the small screen view next week click on to

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.990
continue we will be styling for mobile sizes both apply these to a hotel's and countries.
