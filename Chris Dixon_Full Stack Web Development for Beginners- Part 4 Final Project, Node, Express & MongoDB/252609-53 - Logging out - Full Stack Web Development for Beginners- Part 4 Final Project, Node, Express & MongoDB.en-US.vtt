00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.679
Since we have most things now setup with Passport,

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:08.985
logging out is a straightforward feature to now implement.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:13.635
Passport gives us a logout function on the request object.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.395
To terminate the login session,

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:22.170
the first thing we need to do is add a logout option inside of the nerve.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.504
At the moment we only have the sign-up and login buttons.

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:29.235
So over in here, layout a pug file.

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:32.550
We can also add a logout link too.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.235
Down to our views,

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:39.515
and then layout.pug. Scroll down.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:44.840
We can create a new list item after login, so li,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:55.170
which is also going to be a link with a href of /logout and also the logout text too.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.980
Later on, we'll make sure only one of

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.000
the login or logout links are displaying in the browser,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.245
depending on the user's logged in state.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:07.620
Over to the index.js,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.365
we can now handle this route too.

00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:19.290
Index.js under the user route, let's add router.get.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.520
The string of /logout,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.155
use controller, and this is going to be simply.logout.

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:33.120
Let's go and create this now,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.685
inside of the user controller.

00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:38.739
Scroll down to the bottom.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.740
Exports.logout, create our function, request and response.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.474
Inside here we can access the logout method on the request objects,

00:01:55.474 --> 00:01:58.055
which is provided by Passport,

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:05.209
request.logout, and then on the response objects,

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:12.360
we're going to do a redirect to redirect the user to the homepage after logging out.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.060
This is all we need to do.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.820
Over to the browser, we can now give it a go.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.300
Save this file, reload the homepage,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.440
and in fact, we'll try logging in first.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.365
Login. We are now taken to the homepage.

00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:38.900
Also the logout facility redirects us to the homepage too.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.535
To make sure this is working,

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:45.560
let's go onto a different routes, such as /all.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.695
Try clicking on log out,

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:51.395
and now were redirected to the homepage.

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:55.685
So I just want to make sure this is lowercase just to match the rest.

00:02:55.685 --> 00:03:01.830
So layout.pug, change this and save and there we go.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.225
So this all appears to be now working,

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:08.815
but we can not be a 100 percent sure at the moments.

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:10.670
In the upcoming videos,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.695
we're going to be providing some feedback to the user to let them know

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:21.410
when the login or logout was successful by adding flush messages.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.590
Also, we'll be doing other things too,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.615
such as working with sessions,

00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:30.935
adding conditional rendering to the login and logout links,

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:37.320
along with personalizing the header by displaying the user's name when logged in.
