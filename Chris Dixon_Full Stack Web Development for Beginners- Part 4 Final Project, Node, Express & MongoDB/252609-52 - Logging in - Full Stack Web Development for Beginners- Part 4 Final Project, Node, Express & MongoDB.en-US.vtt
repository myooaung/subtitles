00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.640
Of course, having user accounts inside rotates varies,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.980
is now use unless the registered user can also login when returning.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.790
This is what we now gone to handle in this video.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.834
Also, we're don't handle login in the user immediately after registering,

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.085
which is a nice little touch.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.745
We already have a login button inside of the header,

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:30.165
which links to the routes of forward slash login.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:35.865
Lets begin by handling this route inside of the index.js file.

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's head out today inside of the routes folder,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.450
and then go down to our user routes, which is just here.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.790
This is going to be a Get request,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.665
so routed or Gats.

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:53.520
The path of forward slash login.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.715
Let's use our use controller,

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:02.885
and then create a login gets or we use controller,

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:06.080
we can now set up this function inside here.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.105
Inside the controller, the use of controller,

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:19.850
and then it down to the bottom bring this a little more

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.500
exports.login gets equals our function

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.535
which takes in the request and the response objects.

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:36.345
Or function body, which is just going to simply rest or render the template,

00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:38.760
which is called login.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.680
Then options pass in the title of login to continue.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.710
So we go at the end.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.320
Of course, we also need to create this login at template too.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.415
We'll do that now over in the sidebar.

00:01:57.415 --> 00:02:01.965
The routes, sorry, the views.

00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:07.570
Click on the "New file icon", and then login.org.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.150
Let's begin by extending our layouts.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.540
Block contents.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.150
Level two heading with the title,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.625
which passed to our templates.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:27.595
Horizontal line to separate the title from the rest of our form.

00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:30.385
Let's begin by creating our form now,

00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:36.860
and decisions have the action which is going to be forward/login.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.130
The method is going to be a post requests.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.810
We're going to surround each one of our form inputs with the class of forming

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.225
boots.foam_ input and says for our CSS later.

00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:59.015
This is going to be a simple form input.

00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:01.625
It's going to have the email in one group,

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:06.080
the password, and then a submit button down at the bottom.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.250
First let's create our e-mail.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.595
Label for e-mail, and then the text for the label of e-mail two.

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:22.180
This input is going to have the type of email.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.805
This will provide some browser validation if the e-mail type is not correct.

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:33.440
Input type, we also need the name of email

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.530
2 and also the ID of email so match your label.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.650
The second one, and in fact,

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.080
we'll just copy this form input-group vicinities below.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.300
This one is going to be for the password.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.140
Also the text off password with the and just afterwards is

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.455
also a input type of password 2 the name,

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:12.315
and finally the ID 2 of password.

00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:17.854
The last thing we need to add down at the bottom is our final form inputs,

00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:21.005
and this is for our submit button.

00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:27.680
A button, this needs to have the type of submit.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.305
Submits a form, we can also add our CSS class of put in small.

00:04:35.305 --> 00:04:37.880
Keep the styling consistent,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.790
and then the text of login.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.450
Given our final I save now and bacause the browser,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.900
which now see if we refresh on this login routes,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.620
which now see our form down at the bottom.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.110
Once this form is submitted,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.150
we need to handle the post request to the same route.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.785
Over in the index.js,

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:04.970
we can handle this now.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.665
Let's duplicates this line here.

00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:12.280
This time is wants to be router dot post.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.660
We're going to be sending this post request to the same login routes,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.825
but only to do is change our function name to login post.

00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:25.110
Or we could use a controller.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.110
We first need to require the Passport module,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:38.095
since we'll be using the offense K method provided by this module right up to the top,

00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:45.080
let's setup our constant of passwords capital P. We are going to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.245
require the Passport module, at the end.

00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:54.830
Now on to login post,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.200
which I'm going to add right down at the bottom.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.745
Exports.login post is going to be equal to passports,

00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:10.805
which is our variable for the password module,

00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:13.860
and then adults of advocates.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.230
We set this login post b equal to pass boards,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.480
then Callie authenticate method,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.825
which provided with this module.

00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:29.740
The first arguments we need to pass in is the local strategy to handle the login request.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.035
Pass a in local inside here,

00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:36.075
separated by a comma.

00:06:36.075 --> 00:06:40.205
The second one is an object containing some options.

00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:45.900
Open up the curly braces and I'm going to add this onto its own line.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.430
Here I'm going to pass in two options.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.635
These will redirect the user when a login has been successful or unsuccessful.

00:06:56.635 --> 00:07:01.055
The first one is a redirect when the login has been successful,

00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:03.140
and we do this with success.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.260
Redirects, which is recognized by passports,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.610
and then will redirect the user to forward slash,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.220
which is our home route, separated by a,.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.600
We can also add failure redirect to.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.725
We're going to redirect to forward slash login,

00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:28.685
which will keep the user on the same login page.

00:07:28.685 --> 00:07:32.360
You should now be everything we need to login,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.590
we deleted only test users early on from mLab.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.340
Now, let's register a new user.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.365
Save this file over to the browser,

00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:46.990
we need to first sign of a new user.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.520
Let's go for our own user.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.460
Details inside here.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:11.220
A confirm O2 mLab,

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.750
give us a refresh,

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:21.605
and are used is now registered so let's try to login.

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:28.090
If we go back to user sign-up, back to homepage.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.805
First of all, let's click on the Login option from the navigation or I'm

00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:38.030
not a typo to see if we redirected to this forward/login routes.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.290
Scroll down our email and inside here,

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.700
and which comes out a incorrect password, hit "Login".

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.190
We're still redirected to this forward slash

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.075
login because there was an error with our password.

00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:59.630
Let's try a successful login this time and see for redirected it to this homepage.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.620
Let's give this one logo.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.590
Login with the correct details, and good.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.920
We now redirected to the homepage.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.704
Excellent. We now have the login facility working.

00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:17.335
We are relying on the redirect,

00:09:17.335 --> 00:09:19.640
so tell us if there is an arrow at the minute,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.905
but we will add some flash messages later on to give the user some feedback.

00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:30.470
The final step for this is to automatically log in the user after registering.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:36.020
This is pretty simple to do since we already have the login post already setup.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.610
We can just add these to the sign-up post routes.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.650
Over to our index.js,

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:48.415
we have this login post facility just here so let's copy this.

00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:52.625
Then we need to go to the post request when signing up.

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:56.210
Then after the signer posts, we can add a comma,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:02.490
and we'll add this on its own line stuff to here.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.205
We can also add login post.

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:11.150
Once the post request is being sent to the sign-up routes, which is here,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.090
it will then go to the Assign a post and then

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.130
immediately log in with this function that just here.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.860
Give this file a save,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.855
and then so expressed knows to move on to the slogan post,

00:10:23.855 --> 00:10:27.980
we need to call next in side of the sign-up post.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.620
To use a controller,

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.064
let's find our sign a post,

00:10:33.064 --> 00:10:35.035
which is just here.

00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:37.930
If we scroll down,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.990
we have this if sections check if there is any areas.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:52.140
Just after him and we can also call next and disregards moves on to the login post.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.550
Now, I have this, this is added in the else section,

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.545
which means there were no errors.

00:11:03.545 --> 00:11:05.525
Inside of this block just here,

00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:11.135
and we can now test this by adding a test user, so save this.

00:11:11.135 --> 00:11:13.740
Go to sign up,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.490
and then it's odd out test user.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:31.280
Click "Confirm", and then scroll down.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.715
We see we have a area down at the bottom of duplicate key index.

00:11:36.715 --> 00:11:41.465
Now, this may not be completely apparent what is going on here.

00:11:41.465 --> 00:11:48.155
This is basically down to some old indexes which we already have inside of our database.

00:11:48.155 --> 00:11:51.515
If we go over to mLab and take a look,

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:54.250
if we click on the users,

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.715
and then open this up, we have our user just here, which we setup.

00:11:58.715 --> 00:12:01.925
If we then click on the indexes,

00:12:01.925 --> 00:12:07.705
we now see we have a conflicting e-mail and also username index.

00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:10.275
We only want to go off the e-mail,

00:12:10.275 --> 00:12:13.920
so let's lead this old username from earlier.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.255
Click on this, deletes.

00:12:18.255 --> 00:12:21.240
Now back to sign-up,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.880
and let's try and resubmit the form.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:30.620
Good. Now redirected straight after the sign-up.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.915
If we go to mLab,

00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:36.080
click on our database.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.689
We now have our two users,

00:12:38.689 --> 00:12:42.775
which is also the Test 1 which we just added from before.

00:12:42.775 --> 00:12:45.740
It now looks like our user is logged in,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.780
I'm also getting the success redirect to the homepage.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.590
Good or users can now log in,

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.840
and next we'll look at login outs.
