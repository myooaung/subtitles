00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.385
Welcome back. If we head over to nodejs.org,

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:08.535
this is the official homepage of Node.js,

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:11.430
which we'll be using to build this final project.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.795
We see at the top there's some information about what Node.js is.

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.815
Basically, Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime,

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:22.710
built on Chrome's V8 engine.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.155
What exactly does this mean?

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:31.370
Well, V8 is engine which makes JavaScript work inside the Google's Chrome web browser.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.310
When we've been using JavaScript so far on this course,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.830
it's been running inside the browser.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.070
Chrome uses its own V8 engine,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.790
and also other browsers have the own version too.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.140
Historically, inside of the browser is where JavaScript is run, on the client side.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.220
However though, since Node.js was developed,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.305
we can also write JavaScript code,

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.390
which runs on the server too.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.535
One of the key things about V8,

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:02.025
is that it can also run anywhere.

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:04.400
Not just inside of Chrome,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.380
making it available to work in other applications too,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.290
which is wrote in the C++ programming language.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.405
With this, Node.js was created using the V8 engine,

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:22.475
which will allow our JavaScript code to be run on the server sign two.

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:27.574
This was huge for a lot of developers who already knew JavaScript,

00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:30.440
as they can now write the front-end and also the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.935
back-end of applications using the same language.

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:39.560
Before this, we would have to learn another server side language, such as PHP.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.070
Why do we want to run our code on the server?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.060
This is because it allows us to create dynamic web pages.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.855
This means, the web page is created on the server first,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:53.710
and can also include any dynamic data,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.905
pulled in from our database or other sources.

00:01:56.905 --> 00:01:59.770
Also, it can check if the user is logged in,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.115
for example, before sending back any sensitive information.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.475
If you've not already done so,

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:10.525
make sure we click on the download button for the current version

00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:15.000
of Node and go ahead and follow the installation instructions.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.030
This on our system will allow us to run Node locally and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.060
create a web server on our own computer for development.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.470
When we're downloading Node.js,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.660
it will also include npm,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.540
which is the Node's package manager.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.460
This is the collection of thousands of packages which we can use

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.605
with Node to build almost any type for project which we wants.

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:40.630
Also on [inaudible] 2 ,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.545
if we build something ourselves,

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.515
which we think may be useful for somebody else.

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.709
We can then bundle it into what's called a module

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.955
and also publish our own module two on npm.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:54.905
As we go through this project,

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:58.910
we'll be using npm modules to add functionality.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.910
Such as a module called passport.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.650
We search for passport,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.620
this is a Node module which we are going to be using to provide user authentication,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.090
so users can login with a email and password.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.455
We'll also use many more npm packages too, as a progress,

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:22.820
to allow our passwords to be encrypted,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.935
to allow file uploads,

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:27.245
for security and many more,

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:29.080
which will discover soon.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.310
This is Node and npm and an overview of what they can do.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.990
We'll discover more about them as we go through this project too.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.625
If your Node download is now finished,

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:45.335
go ahead and click through the installation steps to install on your computer.

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:48.540
Then I will see you in the next video.
