00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.070
For this project, I have provided some images which you can also use,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.290
such as images for the hotels,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.350
the countries, and also the logo.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.665
You can of course choose your own if you prefer.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:17.760
The ones provided are inside this folder called images,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.415
which I have here saved onto the desktop.

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.935
If you open up this folder,

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.115
we can see we have the beach,

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:28.070
which is one of the main images on the homepage.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.140
We have our logo and then our country's images and hotels organized in two folders.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.405
Let's also open up the project folder.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:42.110
Double-click on Let's Travel and then inside here,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.105
we can go to public,

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:46.900
and then to images.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.830
Then if we select the four items from our images folder,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.265
and then drag these over to the images folder inside of our projects,

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:01.535
so this is over and make sure these are inside of the images folder,

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:04.470
rather than just the public section.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.340
We should be able now to see these images,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.620
if we go over to Visual Studio code.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.960
Open this up and then the sidebar and then inside of a public,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.595
we now have the images inside of images folder.

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:24.570
If we go over to the index.pug,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.315
which is the main homepage templates,

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:30.150
we can test this out by adding a image.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.420
Underneath our text of Welcome to Let's travel.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.040
We can add our image,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.750
we can add some attributes inside the quotations to set the image to

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.185
use equal to our images which is the folder.

00:01:43.185 --> 00:01:46.949
Then let's go ahead and add beach.jpeg,

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:49.635
which is this one just here.

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:56.355
Note we don't need to add the public folder to our file path and then save this,

00:01:56.355 --> 00:01:59.550
open up Google Chrome or your browser,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.760
reloads and that's our image of the beach, great.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.405
Now all of our images and also our project structure is now in place.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.910
In the next section, we're going to dive deeper into

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.240
our project by looking at routing and templating.
