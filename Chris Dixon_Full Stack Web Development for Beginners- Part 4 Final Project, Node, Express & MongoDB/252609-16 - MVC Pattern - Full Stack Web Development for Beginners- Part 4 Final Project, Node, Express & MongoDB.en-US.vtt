00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.200
We're going to be structuring this project using what is known as the MVC pattern.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.070
MVC stands for Model View Controller and it's

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.030
basically a way of separating our logic into different parts.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.780
At the top of the diagram here we see the model,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.665
the model defines how our data should be structured.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:26.190
As an example, our hotel information will have

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.545
a model and this model will stay at that each hotel needs to have a name.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.590
It's name must be present,

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.615
and also a string which no longer referred to coat Islam.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.930
Also our hotel model must have a description,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.995
an image, a price, and so on.

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:49.880
Next up and probably the most easy to grasp is the view.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.635
The view, which as it sounds is basically the user interface.

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:58.100
We've already touched on this in the section where we've

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.590
created a page templates so this should be fairly straightforward.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.085
Then there is the controller.

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:10.035
This controller can update the view or send data to the model.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:14.120
A typical use for a controller in our project will be to search

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.139
our hotel model for matches based on a country,

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:22.720
then it's data can then be passed to the template or to the view.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.675
We've actually already done something similar in the last video,

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:29.225
where we looked at route parameters.

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:32.420
Instead of the routes index or js file,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.500
we use a controller to get the name from the URL,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.390
then we passed this name to the view to show on the homepage.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.090
We'll also be using the controller to do other things too,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.535
such as form validation when a user signs up before we push this data to the users model.

00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:55.820
This is a pattern which will be following for the rest of these projects.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.985
It's keeping nicely structured and organized.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:02.570
It may seem a little confusing to begin but we will

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.235
get lots of practice and it will soon become clear.

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:08.810
In the next video, we're going to be starting

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.620
this separation process by creating our controllers.
