00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.340
As usual, the choices for techniques around CI/CD are numerous.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.610
Let's take a look at how Ellen and Josh are viewing the suite of tools,

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.240
and how they apply to TechStream.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.240
As the CTO, Ellen has a decision to make.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.590
Globomantics, being a larger organization,

6
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.580
uses more traditional methods of CI/CD,

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.340
including the creation of processes with tools such as Jenkins and Octopus.

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.280
Being somewhat still new to AWS,

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.330
CodePipeline is a new opportunity to streamline the creation

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.940
and management of pipelines and deployments.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.960
TechStream, being a new startup style acquisition,

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.180
is nimble enough to be able to use exploratory tools and methods.

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.470
As a tech lead for Globomantics,

14
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.270
Josh is anxious to start using the new and modern technologies,

15
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.740
especially around the CDK.

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.730
However, since the entire suite of AWS Cloud tools,

17
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.190
including IaC in general, are new to the organization,

18
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.910
Ellen chooses to first formalize and adopt the use of

19
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.740
the CDK as an organization‑wide tool.

20
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.640
Then, down the road, she plans on migrating any existing tools to new technology.

21
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.120
During this adoption phase,

22
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.980
she's decided that basic level‑one constructs will be used to

23
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.440
create simpler pipelines for deployment,

24
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.440
until deployment processes can be folded into Globomantics processes.

25
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.270
Once the adoption phase is complete,

26
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.470
Helen wants to go all in on building fully integrated enterprise

27
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.140
deployment pipelines across the board with CDK pipelines.

28
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.330
With their versatility and ease of use,

29
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.330
these will eventually replace other tools,

30
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.340
such as Jenkins in the organization.

31
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.700
You've already seen a peek at some of the tools available to

32
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.450
avoid tight coupling with context and SSM.

33
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.830
In the next module,

34
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.040
I'll dive more into the tight coupling pitfall, and we'll

35
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.000
refactor our application to follow AWS well‑architected framework best practices around the subject.
