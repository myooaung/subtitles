Greetings fellow CDK enthusiasts.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,610
I'm Scott Tate, a cloud architect from blindspot.com, excited

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,600
to share a few hours a year time in the exciting world of

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,790
Infrastructure as Code with the CDK,

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,640
which has interest levels all the way up to the proverbial sky.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,540
It's been a long time since a technology has burst onto the

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,710
scene and taken the industry by storm as quickly as these AWS

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,780
CDK has. In just a short period of time,

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,670
the entire world of IaC has exploded as a result of the new structured

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,350
programming language capabilities now available.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,930
Avoiding 100,000 line CloudFormation JSON files, we can now

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,030
right a fraction of the code to achieve the same result in

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,050
one of the many structured,

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,050
higher‑level programming languages and take advantage of

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,740
object‑oriented principles along the way.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,640
As this is the next course in the CDK learning path,

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,780
I'm going to focus on more advanced topics around building CDK

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,560
applications. We'll first take a much need to dive into the critically

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,420
important subject of building organized application and stack patterns to

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,720
help you ensure sustainable growth in your AWS environments. Complementing

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,040
that, we'll then dive into the concept of managing and deploying

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,040
multi‑environment applications to AWS.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,340
To ensure we cover the gamut of advanced topics, I'll walk through

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,750
intra‑stack communication concepts in the veritable compendium of variable

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,180
storage methods we can use in large CDK applications.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,300
We're going to have some fun learning about building custom construct libraries,

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,840
and I'll go through the important topics of testing and securing them with

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,550
Jest testing and aspects. We touch on many subjects around the CDK that you

29
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,130
likely won't find in any other resources out there.

30
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:55,000
So I hope you'll stick with me and join the movement to advance IaC to new heights with the AWS CDK, here at Pluralsight.
