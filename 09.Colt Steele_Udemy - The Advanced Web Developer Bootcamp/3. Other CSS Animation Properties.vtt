00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.190
OK so we saw the very basic syntax who made that ugly animated rainbow text.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.090
Now I want to dive a bit deeper into some of the ways we can control or finesse the animations.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.820
So here's a list of properties We'll talk about in a kind of group them into two categories.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.140
The first are the very basic what I'm calling the usual suspects.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.790
Most of these have an analog to transitions for example transition dasht duration which you've already

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.500
seen or a transition timing function or transition delay.

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.310
So those should be pretty familiar.

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.490
And we also saw animation name which is just how we specify what animation we're referring to.

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.710
So those are pretty basic but then there are some more specific ones that don't have analogues in the

10
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.630
transition side of things.

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.020
That includes iteration count film mode direction and place date.

12
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.910
So I want to talk about those next.

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.420
And rather than making a separate video for each one I decided to kind of put them together in a single

14
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.380
reference video.

15
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.170
I've made different code pens to illustrate how they work and we'll breeze through them hopefully.

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.320
So there are four properties.

17
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.000
We'll take a look at.

18
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.420
In addition to these which we've already seen and hopefully you feel comfortable with.

19
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.630
So the first one is animation iteration count which we actually have seen as well.

20
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.880
But I just wanted to bring this back up on to repeat it because it's pretty commonly used.

21
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.710
So it allows us to specify how many times you want an animation to run.

22
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.870
So I have a code pen that I've made to illustrate animation iteration count it's kind of a mouthful.

23
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490
Currently it's set to infinite.

24
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.260
You'll notice this button is jiggling and it keeps going and going and going.

25
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.590
So the animation itself if you're curious is a combination of scaling and translating so it moves up

26
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.170
and down ever so slightly and grows and shrinks.

27
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.190
And that's essentially what makes a jiggle and the hardest part is getting the timing right.

28
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.890
I didn't make this myself.

29
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.350
This is copy or this is forked from an existing code pen.

30
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.560
It's really popular.

31
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.510
I think it's just called jiggle.

32
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810
So if you want to see the original you can find that.

33
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.320
But what I want to focus on is iteration count.

34
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.610
So as you can see it's still going but I could change it to two and if I save.

35
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.470
OK there's was our first one.

36
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360
Here's the second one.

37
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.200
Now it's done.

38
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.150
And I won't waste your time anymore.

39
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.570
But of course you could change this to be any other number that you wanted.

40
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.310
OK so that's animation iteration count.

41
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.830
Next up is animation direction.

42
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.920
And this one is a little bit less self-explanatory.

43
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.560
At least right off the bat.

44
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.090
Hence my subtitle let's just look at an example it'll be easier but it allows you to do is when you

45
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.180
have an animation to find you go from 0 to 100.

46
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.670
And what you could do is actually have it run in reverse if you wanted or you can have it Alternate

47
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.210
where it goes forward and then backwards and forwards and backwards.

48
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.540
But like I said it's easier to take a look at it in action.

49
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.920
So here's a demonstration.

50
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.710
So what I'm going to do first is actually turn off all animations.

51
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.320
So just with this rake here OK.

52
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.960
So I have three boxes one that has forward one that has reverse and one has alternate.

53
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.240
That's just the text right now being displayed but they also have classes.

54
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.050
So then I'm applying this animation slide right.

55
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.840
So they start here and they slide to the right.

56
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.280
Five hundred pixels translate x 500 pixels.

57
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.820
OK.

58
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.390
So that's that's it.

59
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.490
So without animation direction to turn that off and start the animation back up you'll see that they

60
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.680
all slide to the right and then start over and they continue forever.

61
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.500
I have iteration count set infinite.

62
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.360
So right now they're all uniform.

63
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.500
But if I uncomment this code that assigns animation direction to be reverse on this middle box using

64
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.780
the class reverse if I said that Dierich animation direction to be reverse I end up with this.

65
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.210
So they're in sync.

66
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.770
They're starting at the same time but this one instead starts at 100 and works backwards down to zero.

67
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.310
So it moves from right to left instead.

68
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.630
So that's actually very nice.

69
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.370
It allows you sometimes to reuse animations.

70
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.740
So if you want to have something happen mirrored on the left and right side or whatever it is you want

71
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.560
opposites you get the same animation just running in opposite direction.

72
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.750
You don't have to define a second animation.

73
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.250
You can run animation direction reverse and it does that for you.

74
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.910
And then that brings us to alternate.

75
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.820
And what alternate does is combine the two.

76
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.480
So it will run forward and then run backwards and then run forward and backwards and so on.

77
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.890
So if I uncomment this code you'll see that this bottom line focus on that goes backwards and forwards

78
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.700
and it keeps alternating these two continue in their single direction whether it's forward or reverse

79
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.450
alternate goes forward and then reverse.

80
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.790
Now iteration count doesn't have to be set to infinite for this to work.

81
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.210
I could change it to something like 3.

82
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.060
I just saved.

83
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.380
OK.

84
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.800
So there's our first one and the second one.

85
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.350
And now the third one.

86
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.710
Now it's done.

87
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.770
But you can see that the same direction is still playing the exact same way.

88
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.430
So that's unchanged.

89
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.720
That brings us to our next property which is animation film mode.

90
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.750
So this one is a bit different animation film mode.

91
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.930
We'll specify how an animation should apply styles before the animation actually starts.

92
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.430
And then after the animation ends and what I say before the animation starts that doesn't mean just

93
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.200
any time before the animation it means during the animation delay.

94
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.630
So there's a period where the animation is engaged but it's not actually playing.

95
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.190
If you have a delay.

96
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.420
So let me show you what I mean.

97
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.620
Here's an example.

98
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:56.150
I have for you out a bit so you can see them for paragraphs going across the page and all of them have

99
00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.780
been assigned this animation that they start as green but this animation here takes them to yellow at

100
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.190
zero percent and then red at 100 percent.

101
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.310
So it looks like this as I hover there's a delay but you'll see it goes yellow and then red.

102
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.060
So the key thing that I want to point out is that there's a delay right now.

103
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.540
I scroll up animation to two seconds.

104
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.050
So I hover and for two seconds nothing happens.

105
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.410
And then yellow to red.

106
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.880
So what I would like you to notice is that when I hover before it actually kicks in during that delay

107
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.820
it stays green.

108
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.880
And then after it turns red at the end it goes back to green.

109
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.550
So the animation delay starts nothing nothing happens.

110
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.110
It doesn't change color until the delay is over at which point it goes from yellow which was the animations

111
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.730
zero percent.

112
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.550
And it goes to read at the end.

113
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:56.780
And then once it hits the end of the animation it reverts back to the state from before which is green.

114
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.990
OK so what I've done on the other three is you probably can infer right now is I've gone ahead and applied

115
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.550
an animation film mode.

116
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.840
So let's take a look at forward's.

117
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:14.810
So what saying animation film mode forwards does is it takes the end state the 100 percent of the animation

118
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.980
and it will leave.

119
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.390
It will linger after the animation and so let me show you here.

120
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.930
I hover over forwards.

121
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.230
Nothing happened.

122
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.390
It goes yellow and then red and then it stays red.

123
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.260
Until I'm done hovering at least and it goes back.

124
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.440
So one more time it starts the animation delay works just the same way but it stays red at the end.

125
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.550
And then the next one is backwards.

126
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.790
And by setting it to be backwards animation film mode backwards it will take the 0 percent value of

127
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.810
the animation and apply that immediately during the animation delay.

128
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.900
So let me show you.

129
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.220
I hover and it turns yellow right away but there's still a delay until the actual animation starts.

130
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:06.060
So one more time turns yellow as soon as they hover and then it waits two seconds to start the animation.

131
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:12.330
And then at the end it goes back to green and then the final option is both.

132
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.970
And I'll show you that here animation film mode.

133
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.440
Both It just combines what forwards and backwards does.

134
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.320
So it will turn yellow immediately and then it will stay red after the animation ends.

135
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.470
So it turns yellow during the delay then the animation starts about now and then it stays red afterwards.

136
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.710
OK.

137
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.460
So that's the basics of animation film mode.

138
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.280
I'd say out of all of those the only one I ever see use is forward's.

139
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.400
Oftentimes you have an animation you want to run one time and then you want it to stay in that end state

140
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:51.110
afterwards in which case you would use forward rather than having it snap back to the initial state.

141
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.290
So the final property will take a look at his animation place state and what this does is it lets you

142
00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:00.160
specify whether an animation is running or if it's paused.

143
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.380
So it's pretty simple although I'll be honest most of the time when I end up using this is actually

144
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.390
through javascript where I'm manipulating this property but I'll show you a working demonstration.

145
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:18.290
So if we go to our animation direction demo change this iteration count back to infinite.

146
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.710
Make this a bit bigger too.

147
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.060
OK.

148
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.570
So we have them running.

149
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.410
What I can do if I scroll down.

150
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.120
Let's add something new here where I hover over any of these boxes.

151
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:38.800
It should pause the animation so I'll just do box hover and then the property is animation place state

152
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.460
and then paused.

153
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.310
So now when I hover over any box it will pause the animation.

154
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.690
Now the trick is just hovering.

155
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.080
OK.

156
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.530
There you go.

157
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:57.480
I caught one and you'll see it does posit it doesn't restart the animation from the beginning it restarts

158
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.660
from where it was paused.

159
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:06.060
So it's different than just completely starting the entire animation over or removing the animation

160
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.380
and adding it again.

161
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.420
Which is why it's useful for doing this.

162
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:15.600
Sometimes in javascript there are times where you want to pause an animation and then have it resume.

163
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:21.510
Other times you want to stop an animation altogether and have it start over and to do that you can't

164
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.760
use animation in place state.

165
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.220
You need to just remove the animation and reapply it through Javascript.

166
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.100
So as you can see this is how play state paused works.

167
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.950
You could do the opposite.

168
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.570
So I could have it start off as paused and then when we hover I could change this to running which is

169
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.230
the other opposite value.

170
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.970
And you can see when I hover it starts running.

171
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.190
Yeah.

172
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.340
So those are the four properties I wanted to highlight.

173
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.860
We have iteration count which allows us to specify how many times it should run.

174
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.570
And the key one is infinite.

175
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.800
That's a very common on.

176
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:03.620
Then we've got Phil mode which is allows us to specify what happened right before and after the animation

177
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.570
what state should linger or not linger.

178
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:13.700
Then we've got direction should the animation run from 0 to 100 or from 100 to 0.

179
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:21.600
Or should it alternate and then place date which allows us to pause or resume the animation.

180
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:27.360
OK so those four properties in conjunction with these four are everything that you need to create CSSA

181
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.280
animations.

182
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:33.590
We're now going to build a simple exercise together and then afterwards I'll show you a shorthand just

183
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.740
like there was for transition where we can combine all of these into a single line.
