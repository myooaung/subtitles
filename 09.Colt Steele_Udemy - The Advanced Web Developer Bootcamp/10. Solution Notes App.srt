00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,100
Welcome back I hope you are able to successfully add some features to this.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,740
Notes using the three in this video.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,680
I'll write out my solutions for this exercise before I write any javascript.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,570
Let me first take care of some small updates to the T.M. and CSSA files.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,240
First to handle the preview functionality.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,050
Let me add a new tag above the form where I put the preview.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,430
I'll give it a classic preview along with a class of hide.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,560
Since I want the element to start out hidde eventually I'll toggle this high class to determine whether

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,650
or not this element should be visible.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,440
I also need to add a couple of more buttons when to remove all notes and one for when I'm feeling lucky.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,470
I'll give these buttons their own classes so that they're easy to target with CFS.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,710
I'll also modify the type attribute of each button since only the first button should trigger a form

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,370
submission.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,020
I'll give it a type of submit for the other two buttons.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,840
I'll set the type to button.

16
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,630
This ensures that clicking on these buttons won't trigger a form submit and that submitting the form

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,720
by pressing Enter will have the same behavior as clicking on the add note button.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Great.

19
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,830
Next I'll hop into my CSSA file and modify my styles a bit.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,030
First let me tackle the previous class.

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,170
It should share some styling with the notes.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,820
Namely the width should be 75 percent and the margins should be the same.

23
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,480
There will need to modify these original margins of it.

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,250
It should also have some scows in common with each individual note namely the border radius and the

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,710
padding on need to adjust the margin of each note a bit so that the preview will be the same size.

26
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,490
Lastly I need a few brand new styles.

27
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,650
I need to put a couple of colors for my preview one for the background one for the border.

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,020
I'll also need to change the box sizing property from its default value to border box so that the preview

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,840
has the proper width next only to define the style rule for my height class.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,630
Namely that the display should be none finally.

31
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:10,550
I need to set some colors for my new buttons logo with red for the Remove button and green for the I'm

32
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,520
Feeling Lucky button for both of them.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,220
Also add a slightly darker color on hover

34
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,950
OK now it's time to get to the fun part.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,980
What's happened to our javascript file and implement some features.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,830
I'll take care of the more straightforward features first began.

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,910
Let me handle the remove functionality first.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,980
I'll grab the Remove button with D-3 and attach an event listener for clicks inside of the callback.

39
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,750
All I need to do is grab every element with a class of note and then call remove.

40
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:52,320
On this D-3 selection let's make sure this works out a note then try to remove all of the notes.

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,770
Great.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,610
Next let's implement the feeling lucky feature as you may recall.

43
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,390
Do you want to do here is totally up to you.

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,890
I decided to randomly update the font size for each note so similar to the last feature.

45
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,460
I'll first grab the button with D-3 then inside of the callback I'll create a selection from all of

46
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,050
the known elements.

47
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,530
However this time rather than removing the notes I'll call the style method and update the font size

48
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:27,600
inside of a callback style overturn a random pixel value from 0 to 100 remember.

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,130
Since I'm passing in a callback it will get involved for each matching element in this D-3 selection.

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,020
This means I'll get a different random font size for each note rather than a single random font size

51
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,630
for each note to share.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,910
If I refresh the page again it looks like this is now working too great.

53
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,100
Last but not least let's tackle the preview functionality.

54
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,140
Previously I grabbed the input inside of a callback to the form's image but now I want to reference

55
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,630
that input element in a couple of different places so I'll first move this variable declaration into

56
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,260
the outer scope while I'm at it.

57
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,660
I'll also use D-3 to select that preview element that we created earlier in each D.M. out.

58
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,200
Next I want to attach a listener on the input for input events when there's a new event I first try

59
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,460
to grab the current value in the input to do this.

60
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,350
I can use the input itself or the event target.

61
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:28,720
Once I have the input value I want to use that value to set the entire text of the preview.

62
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,230
I can also use the value to determine whether the preview should be shown or if the input is empty.

63
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,000
Then I should probably hide the preview.

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,040
Otherwise I can show it.

65
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:44,060
Put another way using the classmates in the class of hide should be present if and only if the value

66
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,830
in the input is the empty string.

67
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,050
Cool.

68
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,340
This seems to be working well almost.

69
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,890
Notice that there's a small bug if I submit a new.

70
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:02,250
Note the preview screen doesn't clear I need to duplicate some of the logic inside of my callback for

71
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,120
input events.

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,180
Once the formis admitted to avoid that application let me write a small helper function called Set preview

73
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:15,490
which takes an hour value and updates the previous selection based on the value passed in.

74
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,650
I can now use this helper function in two places once in the input callback where I pass and the value

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,730
input and again the Submit callback where I pass an empty string to force the preview to hide.

76
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,120
But to refresh the page again.

77
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,040
Cool that bug is.

78
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,260
I hope this solution makes sense and is similar to the approach you took when you're ready.

79
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,870
Head over to the next section.

80
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,900
I'll see you there.
