1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,350
Okay we're back to the recipes app and now it's your turn to finish up the app.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,220
Everything we've learned in this section you'll incorporate into the recipe app that we saw earlier.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,960
So let's get started.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,910
Earlier we made a component that looks like this.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,720
It's got our title our ingredients our instructions and image.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,860
There's one thing I wanted to clean up here I don't know if any of you noticed but I left this recipe

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,240
string in there and I didn't mean to.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,470
So let's take that out.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:37,180
So in here in my title I will remove that recipe string.

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,950
We go and I'll say that.

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,740
And now we don't have the recipe there anymore.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,650
And that matches up pretty well but it looks like over here.

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,610
OK so your goal is to get the app looking like this.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,930
And first of all this talk about breaking it down.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,830
So we've already broken it down to one component the recipe component.

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,160
But now we want to have other components in this application not just a single recipe.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,090
So the first thing you might think about doing is making a component for this Nav..

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,580
So I would make a nav bar component and then the next component you probably would need is a list of

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,440
recipes.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,590
So I would probably put all of these recipes inside a thing like a recipe list and then finally at the

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:24,830
highest level you would still have your recipe app and your recipe app would probably just be one nav

22
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,760
bar component that you render and then one recipe list that you render.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,950
And remember I expect all the things to be used here that we just learned so you would definitely want

24
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,950
default prop's that's how you're going to load this data.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,930
And you're also going to want to use Propp types where appropriate.

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,080
One last thing.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,130
Try to make sure you get at least three different recipes in here if you like.

28
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,500
You can copy mine.

29
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,770
These are my original recipes so please treat them well.

30
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,410
Anyways after this we'll talk about a solution.

31
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,030
So good luck.
