00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.700
All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.160
So we're going to dive into the code here and have decided to take these for transition properties and

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.870
break them into two separate videos just so that you don't get bored.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.840
Hopefully So the first two that we're going to take a look at are duration and property.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.830
So let's start off with transition duration which essentially says how long the transition should take

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.330
how long it should last.

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.000
So the syntax is pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.970
Transition Dasch duration and then a time one second or a decimal half of a second and you can also

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.350
pass in multiple values separated by commas.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.210
We'll come back to that after we take a look at the next property which is called Transition property.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.460
So we'll get to that in a moment.

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.850
But first let's demo these first two.

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.240
So I have a code pen open I'm calling it transition playground all that we have so far are two boxes

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.700
one called boring and one called animated.

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.220
But right now they both do the exact same thing.

16
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.680
There let's see they're purple they've got white text centerline that's pretty much all that matters.

17
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.630
There's a border radius and then as we hover the background changes and they double in size.

18
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.970
So you can see I hover turn red and they double in size.

19
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.820
Both of them do the exact same thing.

20
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.960
Nothing different.

21
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.510
What we're going to do is use transition duration to make this one take a little bit longer.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.180
We'll start off with one second.

23
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.510
So it has a class of animated.

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.800
So I'm just going to target that class that animated and then all we have to do is transition duration

25
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.530
one as if we want one second.

26
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.220
So the first one is unchanged but the second one now takes a second and you'll notice that it's applying

27
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.310
to both things that are changing both properties.

28
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.120
So the background takes a second turn red it's not immediate like it is here.

29
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.780
And the scale takes a second as well.

30
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.570
So we could also do something faster of course 0.3 seconds.

31
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.730
So that one still is instant.

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.800
But this one takes a little bit longer.

33
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.760
And even though it's only point three seconds it still feels very very different than this one here.

34
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.200
So you can see I mean I'm not saying this is a Curdy interface but you can see the difference that these

35
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.000
tiny changes can make just in the timing as to how something actually feels to a user.

36
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.100
OK I'm moving on now to our second property which is transition Dasch property.

37
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.030
And this allows us to specify which of the properties that are being changed.

38
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.050
Do we actually want to transition.

39
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.750
So we may not want everything to take a second or five seconds or whatever it is.

40
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.000
So in this case we have two things that are being transitioned the background and the transform.

41
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.780
And that's because by default everything is transition.

42
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.850
So if I added something else in here let's say add opacity and make opacity go to 0.5.

43
00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.140
So as a hover here I guess it's kind of hard to tell because we're also doing color but the opacity

44
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.430
is being animated.

45
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.290
It takes a second it's not happening immediately.

46
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.260
So if I actually slow that down I will be able to notice that.

47
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:15.140
Let's do two seconds so you can see that it's becoming clearer over those two seconds.

48
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.430
So that brings us back to transition property.

49
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.790
This allows us to specify exactly which properties should be transitioned and anything that we leave

50
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.810
out will not be transitioned.

51
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.340
So in this case I could say only background or only opacity or only transform I could specify multiple

52
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.970
color and opacity and I could keep going with commis.

53
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.490
There's not a limit there or it could say all which is what's happening currently even that we're not

54
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.670
explicitly stating that.

55
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.660
So let's try it.

56
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:55.330
Now let's go up here and all we do is add transition Dasch property and let's say we only want the color

57
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.550
the background to animate.

58
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.910
So I can say background or background color.

59
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.320
Technically it's better to be more specific as we go.

60
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.630
So only background color should animate this one still the same of course because we're not doing anything

61
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.140
to it.

62
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:18.240
But this one you can see that the opacity and the scale are triggered immediately.

63
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.400
And the color takes a bit but because that opacity is there the color is changing right away.

64
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.730
But that's actually the opacity So it's kind of confusing.

65
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.550
It might be clearer if I comment that out.

66
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.170
Now you can see that OK.

67
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.280
The scale is happening immediately but the background color is taking a second.

68
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.870
So the same thing applies to transform.

69
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.500
So it's actually change this up a bit and add in a rotation as well.

70
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.740
So we'll rotate it 45 degrees.

71
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.100
And remember we have to do these on the same line because if I try and do transform rotate as a second

72
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.570
line it will actually overwrite the scale and it will only rotate.

73
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.720
So if I want to have multiple transforms I need them to be together.

74
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.280
But the problem with that and what I'll show you here first here's what happens.

75
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:12.620
Currently only the background color is being animated but if I go back here and I change this to be

76
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.560
transform just like that.

77
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.330
You'll notice that both things are now being transitioned.

78
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.770
So I can't actually be specific here and say I only want to transition the scale or the rotation.

79
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.290
I can only say the generic transform which is scale and rotate so you cannot specify that which is kind

80
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.390
of unfortunate.

81
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.670
So we have one property being transitioned which is transform.

82
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.210
It just happens that transform has two components.

83
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.550
So you get rid of that.

84
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.750
Simplify it again.

85
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.070
And now I'm going to return back to this thing that I mentioned where we could have a comma separated

86
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.750
set of durations along with a comma separated set of properties.

87
00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:03.000
So I'll add in one more property this time let's also do border radius and let's have it at 20.

88
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.270
Let's make it 50 which should give us a circle.

89
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.860
There you go.

90
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.020
OK so it's becoming a circle here.

91
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.380
So what I want to show is that we can animate let's do background color

92
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.590
comma border radius.

93
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.900
So we're saying take two seconds to transition transition background and border radius.

94
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.810
But don't worry about our transform.

95
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.990
You'll notice the transform happens immediately.

96
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.770
It scales doubles in size.

97
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.050
But then the border radius turning it into a circle and the background color.

98
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.860
Take two seconds.

99
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.240
It's kind of cool looking actually.

100
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.850
So that brings us to what I just brought up which is we can also pass in two different durations so

101
00:06:51.850 --> 00:07:00.580
I could ask the background color to take five seconds and the border radius to take one second.

102
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.890
So the order does matter it's the order we established above.

103
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.070
But now you'll see that the background takes a lot longer to animate it's still going but the border

104
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.750
radius finished up pretty quickly.

105
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.670
So the order that things happen in is that the scale is immediate because there's no transition defined.

106
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:23.190
It's left out and any other things that we would assign here if we changed the font or the text color

107
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.740
font.

108
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.600
Not really eatable But let's say we changed the color of the text or the font size anything else that

109
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.430
happens in here.

110
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.450
It's not going to be transitioned it's going to be immediate Just like the scale is but the background

111
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.920
will take five seconds for the radius one second as you can see there.

112
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.780
All right.

113
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.650
So that covers those two properties transition property and transition duration.

114
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.030
We have two more to talk about in the next video and then we'll also see a shorthand way to put them

115
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.930
all together into a single line.

116
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.770
So that's coming up.
