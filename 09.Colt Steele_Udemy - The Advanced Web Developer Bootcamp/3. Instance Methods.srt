00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,090
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,090
In this video we're going to continue our discussion on the class keyboard and see how to add methods

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,020
which can be used by every single object created from the class in object oriented programming.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:19,080
We call these instance methods since the class creates objects or instances before 2015.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,160
These methods and properties were traditionally placed on the prototype object.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,840
Let's see what they used to look like.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,420
Here we have a constructor function for a student and a method called say hello which every student

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,220
will have.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,320
This method is placed on the prototype object of the student function which is accessible by every object

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,630
created from the student function.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,970
When the new keyword is used if this sounds totally foreign to you make sure to watch the videos on

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,940
object oriented programming with javascript.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,450
Now let's see what this looks like with yes 2015.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,330
In 2015 we place our prototype methods inside of the class just like what we did with the special constructor

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:57,990
method.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,560
Remember this code is just an abstraction for what we have used before.

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,610
There is nothing new going on here.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,350
It is also far more efficient to create instance methods and to place those methods inside of the constructor.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,920
If we place methods inside of the constructor they are redefining each time we create an object from

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,370
that class.

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,520
Now that we've seen instance methods or methods that can be accessed by objects created from the constructor

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,090
function how can we create class methods or methods directly on the constructor function and S-5 these

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,650
methods are placed directly on the constructor function.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:39,000
Here I'm creating a method called student which returns true if the object passed to it has a constructor

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,820
property which is the student constructor.

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,840
You may have used a similar method like this to see if something is an array.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,300
Notice that the array that is array method is directly on the array constructor.

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,280
This is the idea of a class method.

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,420
So how would this work in 2015 we'll see exactly how in the next video Ceara.
