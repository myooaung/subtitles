00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,040
They're welcome to the next section.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,720
So this section is all about CSSA fluxbox.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,310
Fluxbox is a new ish layout module.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,620
It's been around for a while or a couple of years at least but it wasn't widely adopted and it wasn't

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,880
widely supported across all the major browsers.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,250
But that's now changed.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,190
Making this a really good time to learn.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,480
So what is fluxbox.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,360
Well according to the docs I did not write this.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,420
It's a more efficient way to lay out a line and distribute space among items in a container even if

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,790
their size is unknown.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:38,700
So what this really means is that the days of hacking together weird kind of buggy layouts using floats

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,780
and clear fixes and tables whatever other tricks you know are over.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,540
If you use flex boxes like Xbox makes laying things out inside of a given box whether it's a div a section

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,080
and NAV whatever the content is it makes it much much easier to distribute it and not only distribute

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,610
it in one place but have it grow or shrink change depending on the size of the screen.

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,910
So basically it makes it very easy to lay things out and to make Responsive Web sites things that traditionally

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,720
were very difficult like vertically centering content or having a bunch of children instead of a parent

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,550
div or a parent box and having them take up the exact same width and height.

20
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,440
Even if the width and height is unknown Those are all very very doable using Fluxbox.

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,140
But what I will say as a quick word of warning is that there is a little bit of syntax that you have

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,190
to get used to up front if you've never come across text box until now.

23
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,440
There are a bunch of properties we're going to go over.

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,530
I've done my best to try and order them in a nice way.

25
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,970
Fill the section with lots of examples lots of practical things but there's no way of getting around

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,980
the fact that there's just a lot of properties we have to talk about.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,230
So that's the only hurdle to using it.

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,410
Once you actually understand it it's very simple it's easy to use but there's a couple of things you

29
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,500
just have to get past conceptually before it starts to click.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,270
So with that said I have a simple visual example here.

31
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,460
Imagine that you have three items.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,820
These three things here red orange and yellow representing images or divs or maybe columns of text.

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,740
Anything three items.

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,760
They don't even have to be the same the same size but I made them in this case.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,720
This is one potential way of arranging them in a container.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,770
So they're inside of something else.

37
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,820
This little white border here.

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,570
So what I'm going to show you are some of the ways using Fluxbox that we could rearrange this very very

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,820
easily with a single line.

40
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,810
I could shift them all over to the right side.

41
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,280
Not something that's you know incredible that you couldn't do with flex or without flex box but I can

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,150
also space them evenly across this container with a single line.

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,950
Or I could take this middle box and make it take up twice as much space as the left and the right boxes.

44
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,350
Also with a single line or I could do something like this I don't remember.

45
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,100
I think this is eight times as large as what I calculated.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,620
Basically I can make this a lot larger and then have these two other units columns whatever these are

47
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,650
on the right side be much much smaller.

48
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,830
But I could also do something crazy and switch to a vertical lab have columns or a single column instead

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,710
of a row.

50
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,770
Also just a single little line to do this here.

51
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,180
Now not everything in fact spikes is a single line that is not the point I'm making more the point I'm

52
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,490
making is that we have a single box filled with three three items whatever they are doesn't matter.

53
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,110
But using Fluxbox we can arrange them in tons of different ways.

54
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,310
Just three items.

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:45,210
So imagine now we have multiple items multiple rows multiple columns all the possibilities but just

56
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,970
with three items there's already a lot.

57
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,080
And this isn't everything.

58
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,540
This is just kind of a quick preview.

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,210
In fact I highly recommend that you check out this VSS tricks a complete guide to fluxbox.

60
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,140
If you have any questions and it just makes a great visual reference but it's full of diagrams like

61
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,310
the ones I've created here and it really is a great reference.

62
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,410
So if at any point you have questions about the properties I'm showing you you can see already how many

63
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,900
properties there are how many diagrams there are here to illustrate things.

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,910
Don't let that intimidate you we're going to go slow and go through all of the important properties

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,480
in a relatively well-thought out order but just keep this open.

66
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,350
If you're someone who likes to refer to visual docs so as I mentioned all of those potential odds are

67
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,130
things we could do just using Fluxbox and without really having to write much code at all.

68
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,000
OK so before we go on to actually writing code and learning the properties I just want to give you a

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,720
heads up a little roadmap for whoever going.

70
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,430
So there are two types of properties that we're going to learn the properties that apply to a container.

71
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:55,010
So the big white box here and then properties we apply to the individual items inside those containers.

72
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,170
We're going to start off by talking about the container properties.

73
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,960
There's five that we're going to focus on.

74
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,000
And along the way we'll build a couple of little projects and nav bar a side bar and then we'll move

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,130
on to flex item properties and build a couple of projects as well.

76
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,390
So I'm doing my best to incorporate real world examples along with that conceptual underpinnings of

77
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,400
fluxbox and try to make that the least boring possible so that further ado let's get started talking

78
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,690
about container properties.
