1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,820
Already.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,700
So this video will be super quick.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,310
I just want to talk about browser support for fluxbox.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,230
So in the past this has been the main problem with fluxbox.

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,310
When people don't want to use it it's not because they don't like how it works.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,280
The fact that it works and how it works is the selling point.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,060
The problem in the past has been that it's not well or hasn't been well supported.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:30,690
However if you look at can I use dot com right now and we look for flex you can see it's fully supported

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,000
across all modern browsers currently without any prefixes.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,420
However in Internet Explorer if you can can make that bigger.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,340
It does say partial support only because is a large amount of bugs so it still is supported fully without

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,360
prefixes.

13
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:57,620
But there might be some bugs if I click show all you can see it has a rather lackluster history going

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,280
back.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,900
There was a lot of yellows and reds.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,890
So it was not supported in IEEE at all until 10.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,520
Same thing here with mobile.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,030
Safari has been a problem in the past.

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,980
So you can see here.

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,280
The other thing I should mention is that specification has changed over time.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,110
So if you did want to add backwards compatibility for old versions of Safari that say I'll zoom back

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,440
in for Safari 3.1.

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,770
It says only supports the old flex box spec and does not support wrapping.

24
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,310
So you'll have to use prefixes like Web Kit.

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,900
In this case but on top of that the syntax is actually different.

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,490
Here's an example of some old flex box that I found.

27
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,040
There's different property names.

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:54,500
For example instead of display flex its display box instead of wrap you have multiple boxed lines.

29
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:03,070
We have box dash flex vertical align there's a couple of different things that just box pack.

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,190
There's another one.

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,100
So those don't exist anymore in the current browsers.

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,760
My advice to you would be it depends really on what you're doing.

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,300
But in 99 percent of the sites that my students make and their audience most of the time they only need

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,050
to worry about modern browsers and maybe a version or two back.

35
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,210
There's no reason that I can't think of a reason that you need a portfolio site or something like that

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,730
that supports ideate for example.

37
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,760
But if you do want to do that I've included an article that I like.

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,820
There's two of them actually.

39
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,280
One is called mixing old and new.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,120
For the best browser support for using Fluxbox mixing old and new.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,310
So this talks about how if you wanted to support as many old browsers as possible you will have to support

42
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,560
the old flex box and tax that has changed over time.

43
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,890
And there are some strategies for that here.

44
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,820
But another option is this article here that talks about how do you deal with browsers that don't support

45
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,180
it so old ones let's say ideate What do you do.

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:09,470
So you can have no fall back and your site will just look however it looks you know on an old browser

47
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:16,340
like this one here I hate actually without fluxbox because those styles don't apply but you can also

48
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,150
add in different fallbacks or alternative solutions.

49
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,310
And this article goes into it.

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,100
If that's something you care about so you can use C S S or javascript to create a fallback.

51
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:33,710
Basically you write code that will be using Fluxbox and then backup code when there is no flex box detected.

52
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,660
So again if you want more information check this out.

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,620
So to summarize you do not need prefixes for any of the current versions of browsers.

54
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,620
That's a big deal but if you do want to support older browsers and older versions you need prefixes.

55
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,080
And just to be safe you can always use the auto prefix or so we could do something like

56
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:05,000
let's get rid of this here and we can do display Flack's for example or justify content center and you

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,020
can see what we end up with over here.

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,620
So you could use that there's no harm in that.

59
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,550
But the good news is if you're only worried about current browsers you don't have to worry about any

60
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,490
of this at all.

61
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,130
OK.

62
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,260
So that wraps it up.

63
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,560
Things have come a long way for fluxbox.

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,450
The future is looking bright.

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,770
Oh my gosh.
