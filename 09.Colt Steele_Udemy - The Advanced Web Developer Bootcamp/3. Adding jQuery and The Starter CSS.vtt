00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.040
OK so in this video we have two main goals.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.610
We're going to make sure we update query installed and working which should only take a couple of seconds

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.590
and then we're going to get the starter team out and see a code in our application.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
So rather than having you watch me type 70 something lines of C S S one by one I'm just going to give

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.960
it to you.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.980
We'll paste it in.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.960
This is not the focus of this section.

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.780
It's more about single page apps API is a query.

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.010
So we're not going to freak out about this.

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.530
I'm going to give it to you and we'll be able to breeze through that part hopefully.

11
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.620
So without further ado let's install a query and really installing it's not quite the right term.

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.270
Let's just include it.

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.020
So an index that himself.

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.860
We're going to add a script tag and we're going to go to code that Jay quarried outcome which I can

15
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.110
never remember that you are ill.

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.090
I just googled a query and then click on Jay queery CDN and then move click one of these for Jay query

17
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.660
three point X. If you want uncompress if you want to look at the source code I'm going to do modified.

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.790
Copy this.

19
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.010
There's a button here actually I always forget about that.

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.140
Go back to cloud 9 and paste it in our head.

21
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.530
And I'd like to indent this a little bit better.

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.520
There we go.

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.260
And now let's test it out.

24
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.110
Is it working.

25
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.230
So we could just refresh our page.

26
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.840
Well I need to start our server up.

27
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.630
So let's try that again.

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.920
Looks good.

29
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070
Let's refresh here.

30
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.470
We still have in our app just this single line.

31
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.540
But if I open up my console I make this a bit bigger if I refer to dollar sign.

32
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.870
There's no problem.

33
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.980
So I can do something like Dollar Sign body double click and then a function in there and we'll just

34
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.480
alert correct just like that.

35
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.830
And let's see if that works.

36
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.870
If I could not screw up the syntax.

37
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.720
There we go.

38
00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.790
Right.

39
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.570
OK.

40
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.400
So if I click the body I get an alert trajectory is working.

41
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.730
It's good to know.

42
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.570
OK.

43
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.440
So the next thing is to just add in R C S S.

44
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.290
So we'll go to APS-C assess and delete what we have.

45
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.260
And I've included as a resource in this video as a file that you can download the C S S code.

46
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.270
You can also look in my workspace and just copy to see assess.

47
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.420
It looks like this.

48
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.710
So we've got styles for the body setting the font including a font appear.

49
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.520
Then we've got styles for the header and then see the form and then the main list.

50
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.990
So there are a couple of classes we'll be using things like list and Dot task done but mainly we're

51
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.730
not going to be worrying about this.

52
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.610
So I will say that if you're a fresher page you'll see a couple of changes but we still haven't added

53
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.840
in our age to m-L.

54
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.910
So that's next.

55
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.700
So an index that each team will not going to delete everything but in our body we're going to delete

56
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.360
what we have aside from our scripts that we included.

57
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.680
And I'm going to replace it with this code.

58
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.470
So it's actually really simple.

59
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.520
The starting markup.

60
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.540
So we have our H-1 has to do with a span around list.

61
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.210
So it's styled slightly different.

62
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.340
We refresh the page you can see every go I'm way zoomed in.

63
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.950
By the way 200 percent.

64
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.620
And then below that we have nature too simple to do with step built with node whatever subtitle you

65
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.700
want and that it for our header.

66
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.980
Although this indentation is slightly off then we have a section with class equal to form.

67
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.170
And inside there's a single input with ID of to do input which is here.

68
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.940
And then finally we have a well with the class of list that's empty but we'll be adding in lies.

69
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.330
It doesn't want to autocomplete my.

70
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.530
Here we go with our to do's and those will be going down here.

71
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.550
Perfect.

72
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.700
So we want that empty because we're going to do that with Javascript.

73
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.460
And I'm actually going to end the video here.

74
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.510
We have J were installed and we have the starter edged him out and started to see assess which again

75
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.520
are included.

76
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.480
So if you don't want to type them from scratch even though each time it's not bad it's the SS It's pretty

77
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.140
lengthy.

78
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.460
80 something like.

79
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.450
So I definitely recommend that you pay set in and then make sure J Corey works.

80
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.870
So in the next video we can start fetching our data.
