1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,880
This exercise you'll build a memory game.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,330
So the game includes 16 cards you can click on a card to see its color and then you're trying to find

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,120
the matching color.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,110
That's not it.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,600
If you don't find a match the cards go away.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,990
But if you do find a match they stay visible.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,600
So there you go.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,540
Those two don't match and they go away.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,240
So you'll keep playing until all the matches are visible.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,100
Or you can click this new game button here and the board will reset and you'll get a new new random

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,290
game.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,130
So now there you go.

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,210
There's no other match.

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,570
So building this one might be a little tricky.

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,960
There are a lot of different conditions you have to keep in mind when you're planning out these state

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,260
transitions.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,780
So what you could try to do is get started now.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,240
See how it goes.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,180
And if you feel like you're stuck.

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,510
Come back to the video at this point in a few seconds.

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,380
I'm going to give some hints but if you're excited to get started.

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,210
Hit pause now and try to do it on your own try to get as far as you can on your own and then come back

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,230
here and see some hints

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,770
OK welcome back.

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,660
I'm guessing you're stuck.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,390
So I'm hoping these hints will be helpful.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,210
First of all one thing that I did which I think was very helpful was I made a an an object called Card

28
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,590
state and the card can be in one of three states.

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,730
It could be hidden which means you just see the gray or it could be showing.

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,200
Which means that it's up but not yet matching anything.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,250
Or it could be matching.

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:49,070
So I use the state object inside of my state for the app and my app state looks like this.

33
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,970
It's 16 objects.

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,510
Each one has an ID card state and a background color.

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,240
I start the state out all of them hiding because the game starts with all the cards face down.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,580
And then I shuffle the cards and make that mistake.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,180
So my state is equal to an object which has the property cards and inside of it you get a shuffling

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,440
of this array.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,750
The next step would be to figure out what happens when a card gets clicked.

40
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,830
Well you need to figure out how many cards are currently hidden or showing and make the appropriate

41
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,050
transition.

42
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,140
So I hope that is a good starting point.

43
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,200
Good luck and if you're still stuck Don't worry the solutions up next.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,430
But I really encourage you to try to get through as much of this as possible before checking out the

45
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,450
solution.
