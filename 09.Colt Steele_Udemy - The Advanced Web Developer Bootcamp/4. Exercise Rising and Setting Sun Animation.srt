1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,970
All right.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,520
So we've seen a lot of the syntax around keyframes and now it's time for you to put some of that into

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,300
practice.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,780
So we have an exercise.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,060
This one is a bit different.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,880
We're not going to make anything particularly beautiful or even useful to be honest.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,870
It's really just focused on making sure you understand how to animate things.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,840
So most of the animations that we do day to day on a typical Web site are small and often they're hard

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,230
to notice and you're not supposed to notice them you don't want them to stick out.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,720
There's things like little scales or Wiggles or a loading icon where it's tiny.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,050
You're not doing a full page animation.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,670
So what we're going to do is the opposite we're going to start off with something big.

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,530
It's not beautiful but it's big and noticeable.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,890
I think it's a good idea to start off on a big scale when you're animating it's much easier to see what's

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,840
happening if you're doing things wrong.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,330
And basically it's a good way to understand keyframes early on.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,250
So we're going to make an animated sun and a sky.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,020
So there'll be a sky that changes color and the sun rises from one corner and then sets in the other

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,530
corner and also changes color as it goes.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,440
So the end result.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,730
Like I said very simple.

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,740
Not that useful but it's a good exercise to make sure you grasp how keyframes work.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,610
But shortly we will be building a CSSA loading icon really a whole animated loading page.

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,300
And that's something that's a lot more likeable to most development work rather than a sun in the sky.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,380
But we're starting here.

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,510
So first thing I'll do is show you what my version looks like yours does not have to look like this.

27
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,940
It's very ugly he said.

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,860
But notice there's two things.

29
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,910
There's well there's three there's a grass or Earth or whatever this is that's not animated at all.

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,510
But then there's a sky back here and a song.

31
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,960
So if we take a look first at the sun you can see that it's rising and falling.

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,280
But as it does that it also is changing color so it gets bright yellow at the top here and then as it

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,340
goes back down it becomes orangey and red at the very end.

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,480
And then it's orange over here as it rises and then it becomes yellow again and then separate from that.

35
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,880
We also have a sky.

36
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,920
So for a split moment it's dark right there.

37
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,200
Then it becomes pink and then it slowly becomes blue in the middle of the day.

38
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,340
And then as the sun sets it becomes pinker as if sunset and then dark as if night and so on.

39
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,000
So that's our animation that's what we're going to make.

40
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,330
You don't have to get this exactly the ark of the actual sun doesn't matter the exact colors don't matter

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,820
how wide this is it really just about having two components sun and a sky.

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,400
So you'll find the starter code code Penn included as a resource in the video.

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,860
It's very bare bones.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,190
There's a grass div which you won't touch.

45
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,410
And then there's a sun div and the sky is just the body it's the background of the body.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,750
So it's the only part that's showing here.

47
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,680
So what you'll need to do is animate the sky first.

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,070
That's how I recommend you do it and then attempt the sun.

49
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,910
So all you'll do is for the body you'll add your animation here.

50
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,010
Whatever it is animation name and you'll define your animation down below.

51
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,060
Same thing for the sun.

52
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,780
Ill defined an animation and then assign it to the sun class.

53
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,790
But before you go off and attempt this here's a chart that kind of goes through the steps the frames

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,130
that I recommend you do for the sky.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,010
So the sky animation it goes from dark whatever this color is dark blue or you can just do black to

56
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,820
pink at 10 percent then to blue at 30 percent blue again.

57
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,220
They're at 70 percent pink at 90 and then back to dark.

58
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:40,340
And I did that because really the majority of the sky is blue and there's only a tiny bit where sunrise

59
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,610
and sunset that it's pink yes.

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,200
Not.

61
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,630
You know it's not accurate because night would be just as long as the blue but where our sun doesn't

62
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,250
account for nighttime right now.

63
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,070
It's a very quick sunset and then it rises immediately afterwards.

64
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,460
So we start with that.

65
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,040
Here I have it actually running with just the sky animation.

66
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,170
So all you should have is it starts at dark and goes to pink and then spends a long time transitioning

67
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,680
to blue and then a long time going back to pink.

68
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,410
Here he goes and then it goes to the dark colored for a moment and then back to pink and so on.

69
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,760
So get that to work first and then move on to the sun.

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,630
So the way the sun should work is that again there's two pieces you're moving it.

71
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,570
I use transform translate.

72
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:30,380
So you can translate the sun over and up and so on and then down using transform translate and then

73
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,020
the color changes as well.

74
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,380
So the specifics don't matter that much about the path it takes.

75
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,030
All that I really care about is that you're animating the sun in a path and that along the way the color

76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,900
goes from orange to yellow to red.

77
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,600
But I deliberately wanted this to be different.

78
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,560
The the keyframes the percentages you're using this year are 25 50.

79
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,150
This is broken into quarters.

80
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,850
This guy has broken down into non-regular intervals.

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,680
Zero to 10 10 to 30 30 to 70.

82
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,090
So it doesn't match up.

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,460
And that's by design.

84
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,200
I want you to have two different things animating at the same time that are happening together.

85
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,640
So they're running together but they're not you know 0 25 50 75 100.

86
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,120
Same thing is happening at the same points in time.

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,410
So that's really the key here.

88
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,870
The sky play around with the colors if you'd like use these percentages and use these percentages for

89
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,630
the sun and make it set or make it rise excuse me and then set and change color as it goes.

90
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:26,960
All right.

91
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,720
So in the next video I'll have my implementation.

92
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,690
You can also just take a look at the solution coding next video as well.
