00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.430
In the previous video we added state to show and hide the recipe form.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.340
Now for our last feature we'll add delete

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.580
to we will need to add a delete button to the recipe component.

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.250
Let's start by adding our GSX for the delete button.

5
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.550
And let's just make sure that shows up OK.

6
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.940
We've got our daily buttons.

7
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.940
Now we need to make them do something when they're clicked.

8
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.500
So inside of our button we want to add a on click callback.

9
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.050
And since the state isn't owned by this component it should be passed in.

10
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.240
So expect an unduely method to come in as a prop but we also need another piece of state.

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.990
We need to know which recipe this is that we're about to delete.

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.430
So this component will also take an idea for the recipe so that undelete can pass that in as a parameter

13
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.670
to the callback function.

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.680
And we also need to remember to restructure that from this top prop's.

15
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.160
Now let's use unduely in our buttons on click event

16
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.010
as you can see we're creating a function that invokes undelete for us and passes the ID of the current

17
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.770
recipe so that inside of our recipe app we know which recipe to delete.

18
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.940
Next we need to pass an undelete method down from the recipe app into the recipe component let's implement

19
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.050
undelete.

20
00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:01.590
I'll start by adding it to the constructor.

21
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.750
Now there's a number of ways to implement this so that we can take that recipe out of our recipes array.

22
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.670
But I like to use filter in this case

23
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.620
and filter will only return elements for which the callback function is given returns of true value.

24
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.780
So in this case I'm going to write a function that returns true if the ID is not equal to the ID that

25
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.310
was passed into this function and false otherwise

26
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.230
so the callback function again will only return true if the idea that we're on is not equal to the idea

27
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.910
that we are given.

28
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.770
Which means that the idea that we want to do it will be taken out of the new array.

29
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.660
And now we just need to set state

30
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.030
that should be up for the implementation.

31
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.720
Let's pass it through the recipe list into the recipe.

32
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.690
And we need to change your recipe list to also pass that into the recipe component.

33
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.690
Let's add it as a prop that.

34
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:34.490
And now inside the render method we want to use on the inside of the map.

35
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.080
All right so now we have unduely being passed in from the start props.

36
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.710
And because we're passing in everything in the recipe state we're also passing on the ID here.

37
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.360
So we've got the undelete method and the ID so everything should work.

38
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.880
Let's give it a try.

39
00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:13.430
First I'll add a new recipe.

40
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.360
OK so saving works just like we saw before.

41
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.340
Now was try to do the

42
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.180
deleting works as well.

43
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.770
So that's it for the app.

44
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.050
The goal with that demonstration was to see how callback functions are passed down into child components

45
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.290
and how state gets affected in a somewhat larger application than what we've seen so far.

46
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.020
Next up you'll be working on your own app involving state and prop's.
