00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.980
OK so now that we've seen a bunch of these ISIS animation properties I'm going to show you a shorthand

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
that will allow you to combine them into a single line if you want to just like we did the transitions

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.260
we had the separate properties you could combine them into one line if you preferred to do it that way.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.420
It doesn't really give you any advantage or it doesn't have any functional difference except that it

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420
can shorten up your code.

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.070
Now my personal opinion with keyframe animation is that if you're setting every property like this line

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.120
does here I kind of find this hard to read difficult if you had a bunch of these on your page or in

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.090
your C Ss.

9
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.960
It's not my preferred way of doing it.

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.850
But if you're only setting a couple of things like this.

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.960
This I think this is perfectly acceptable.

12
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.990
That's just an opinion though.

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.020
The other thing I should point out is that the order kind of matters but it also kind of doesn't.

14
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.430
So what I mean by that is that you have flexibility in what you put first as you can see in this case

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.920
the name of the animation slide in comes at the end.

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.810
But in this case change color comes first or jiggle comes first.

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.220
So you have flexibility around things like that but there are rules.

18
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.100
And if we go to the documentation I actually show you if we scroll down there is this line the order

19
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.390
is important within each animation definition.

20
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.440
The first value that can be parsed as a time is assigned to the animation duration and the second one

21
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.670
is assigned to animation delay.

22
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.810
So the first one has to be animation duration.

23
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.620
The first time that is.

24
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.580
And the second time is animation delay.

25
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.770
So that doesn't mean that you have to put those at the very beginning.

26
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.820
It just means that the first thing that it encounters that is it time will be the duration.

27
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.060
And the second one will be the delay.

28
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.520
And then there's a second note the animation order or the order is important within each animation for

29
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.610
distinguishing animation name from other keywords.

30
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.950
So if we take this example here it will parse this first.

31
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.550
That's the animation name.

32
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.350
Then it encounters a time remember the first time it is assigned to animation duration.

33
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.110
Then there's a second time that's assigned to animation delay.

34
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.220
But in this case there's only one time.

35
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.250
And so it gets assigned to animation duration.

36
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.470
OK so let's try to.

37
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.460
Here I have a simple box moving from left to right.

38
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.920
The animation is very basic translating x 500 pixels.

39
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.170
So what I have is animation name animation iteration count animation delay animation duration.

40
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.070
So let's try and combine them all.

41
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.780
I mean to comment them all out and rewrite it.

42
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.800
But I'm going to do animation.

43
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.810
Do slide right.

44
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.110
That's the name the duration.

45
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.680
We can do two seconds then we have a couple of options.

46
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.710
So on its own it's already working.

47
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.790
But if we wanted to we could specify I want that to be is in and it could save and you can see now it's

48
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.810
easing in.

49
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.530
Hopefully you can detect that.

50
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:04.140
Starts off slow so we could also add an interation count of infinite and save perfect.

51
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.860
What about a delay.

52
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.320
Well let's do a two second delay so as I save it will stop for two seconds.

53
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.860
And now it precedes.

54
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.850
Finally we could do something like direction and make that reverse.

55
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.610
And there you go.

56
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.720
So we have that delay at the beginning.

57
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.880
Let me save or edit this so that it restarts.

58
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.080
So it starts to the left for two seconds and then moves from the right because it's going in reverse.

59
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.230
So hopefully you can see that the order doesn't really matter so I can do the same thing I'll comment

60
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.530
this one out.

61
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.210
I will do exactly the same but I could do four seconds slide right and just leave it at that.

62
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.080
It will take four seconds to slide right.

63
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.990
And in this case I put the name at the end and it put the duration first.

64
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.950
And if I wanted a delay I could either put the animation delay here like one second and we'll pause

65
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.650
for one second and then start moving.

66
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.350
Or I could put it afterwards.

67
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.510
So there's a lot of flexibility with it really.

68
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.600
The main rule to keep in mind is that the first time that is parsed is the duration.

69
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.650
The second time wherever they are is going to be that delay.

70
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.820
And then you know make sure your animation names aren't conflicting with any of these possible values.

71
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.860
They don't name your animation infinite for example and you'll get to go OK.

72
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.680
So that's all there is to the shorthand.

73
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.360
The next thing we'll do is actually build a little loader CSSA animated boder using this shorthand.
