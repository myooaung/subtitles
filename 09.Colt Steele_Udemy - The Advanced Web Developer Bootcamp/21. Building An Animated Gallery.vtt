00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.870
All right.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.910
So we've learned a lot about CSSA transitions.

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.320
Let's now try and make something with them what we'll do is take a image gallery that I've already created

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.180
for us a basic image gallery that doesn't have any effect and will add some simple animated hover effects.

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.030
So let me show you what that will look like.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.720
Here's the completed version.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.060
We only have three images in this case.

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.090
But as I hover over them you'll see there's a couple of things that happen.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.550
I'll break it down in just a moment.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.760
But essentially you have an icon that appears and then a color as well overlay.

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.320
But there's actually more behind the scenes that you may not be aware of at first glance.

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.950
So we're going to implement this these transitions.

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.070
There's a couple different components like I mentioned.

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.410
So I've broken it down here.

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.370
There are there are three basic pieces.

16
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.420
There's a background div that's behind the image that you actually don't see when the page loads.

17
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.700
And then there's the image that goes on top and then finally there's an icon that's on top of both of

18
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.440
those.

19
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.030
So what we're doing is hiding the icon and then showing it when the user hovers.

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.350
And at the same time we're actually changing the opacity of the image so that you see the underlying

21
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.410
color.

22
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.010
So this fades a bit and we see that red.

23
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.640
So let me show you one more time.

24
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.900
The icon appears an image Dims are actually just dim the opacity changes so we can see some of that

25
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.970
red behind or in this case some of the blue behind or the teal green color behind.

26
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.610
So that's the basics.

27
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.420
But there's a couple of things that this example will actually allow us to do that I think are a little

28
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.450
bit more fun than just regular transitions.

29
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.490
And if you're at all curious about these images these are three that I've taken.

30
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.660
Photography is sort of a hobby of mine.

31
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.760
So sometimes I try and include my photos in the course so three photos.

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.760
But that's not that important and underlying them there is a div for each one.

33
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.030
So if I comment out one of these images let's take this one and save.

34
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.780
You can see behind it there's a blue div and the same here there's a red one and there's a green one

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.430
behind this image.

36
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.930
Then we have the image on top and then on top of that there is an icon.

37
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.680
The icons are done with font.

38
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.290
Awesome.

39
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.110
If you're not familiar with that it's a awesome library that has a ton of different pre-done icons that

40
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.740
you can reference and use by just importing fun awesome which I do right here up top and then referencing

41
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.670
a dash whatever the name of the icon is.

42
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.520
In my case I did camera PA and a cloud.

43
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.090
So we have those three components and each one of them are inside of a div called item.

44
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.020
So that item div is one photo plus a background behind it plus the icon.

45
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.720
So there are three different items.

46
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.660
OK.

47
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.530
So a couple of things you might notice first of all this icon seems like it's not in the middle.

48
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.960
So we will address that with our animation and with the scale.

49
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.890
But let's start off with something easy.

50
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.530
When we hover over one of these images why don't we change the opacity so we can start to see that color

51
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.020
behind it just like we do here.

52
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.520
So to do that it's just a simple hover.

53
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.390
So let's scroll down.

54
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.160
Make this a bit bigger as well and I'll go down just do it at the very bottom for now.

55
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.250
So will you give that item.

56
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.800
So all items when they're hovered over change the image

57
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.360
and make the opacity zero point three.

58
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.370
Now when I hover you can see that we're getting that color from behind.

59
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.000
So that's the very first thing there's no transition yet.

60
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.680
But that's the first property to change.

61
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.100
So let's add in a basic transition.

62
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:54.680
I'll start by adding a very quick point three five second transition to everything in the item div..

63
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.630
So just sort of a catchall.

64
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.420
So the reason I'm doing this is we're going to animate the opacity here as well as the icon which is

65
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.600
also inside of this item div..

66
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.610
So I could affect them all with a single transition but I need to use this star because if I just say

67
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.420
div that item and I add a transition in here let's say transition I'll do something very obvious first

68
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.840
one second is an out and I'll do it for all properties.

69
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.270
That doesn't affect our hover because the opacity change is happening on the image.

70
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.320
It's not happening to the item even though the image is inside of the item.

71
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.010
So if we want it to happen we want the transition to apply to everything inside the item div which includes

72
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.860
the image and the icon.

73
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:52.160
Well in that case we'll save use this star and now it takes a second for that transition to happen.

74
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.350
And then once we start applying things to or effects to our icons those will also take a second.

75
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.420
But of course we don't want them to stay one second long but I'll keep it there for now just so that

76
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.800
it's easy for us to see what's happening.

77
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.850
OK so another small note that you may not have noticed.

78
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.310
If you take a look at the end state of this animation.

79
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.970
So where are we seeing the read through and you compare it to the end state of this one.

80
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:25.610
Notice that the image is a lot Dolor we can't see those bright colors popping through like we can here.

81
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.350
So this is a choice that I made and a common choice that you'll see.

82
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.430
You can actually make this image greyscale at the same time as you're changing the opacity and a lot

83
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.230
of people like that effect that the gray out effect kind of draws your focus away from the image and

84
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.370
towards the icon and makes icon stand out more.

85
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.660
So that's really simple to do.

86
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.630
There's actually a property called Filter.

87
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.460
And we can just do greyscale is the filter 100 percent.

88
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.340
So not something that we've seen in the course but a fun little property.

89
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.040
And actually if I just do greyscale you see what happens when I hover all that color goes away and on

90
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.940
its own it's actually kind of a cool effect.

91
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.190
You might prefer just to leave it like that and have the icon be colored totally up to you.

92
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.450
But I'm going to also add that opacity.

93
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.570
So you can see now that we get the red but all those other colors are gone.

94
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.610
So let me commentate out here all hover over it.

95
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.130
Comment that line out

96
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.320
and save you can see now the colors back and my uncommented the color goes away.

97
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.320
So not mandatory but a nice little thing to know that you can do.

98
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.100
OK.

99
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.320
So we have our one second transform let's make it point five seconds for now.

100
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.870
So it's a little faster.

101
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.240
So now we're going to conquer the icon and let's talk about how it actually works.

102
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.720
So if we focus here as I hover it happens pretty quickly but the icon doesn't just appear out of nowhere

103
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.880
it didn't fade in.

104
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.460
It actually scales up from the center.

105
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.190
So that's a hover away you'll see it shrink down and then scale up.

106
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.900
So what do you know.

107
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.160
We know how to do that using transform scale.

108
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.620
So that's what we'll be doing.

109
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.800
We'll start it off as hidden by using scale set to zero.

110
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.130
So by scaling something to zero it doesn't show up.

111
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.620
But it allows us to animate it to scale of one when we hover.

112
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.020
And that will keep us this growing effect.

113
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.980
And then the shrinking effect when the hover ends.

114
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:36.070
So let me show you if I scroll down here and add in a div dot item covered just like before but this

115
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:43.000
time the target the icons instead of the item because we want this effect to trigger when I hover anywhere

116
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.780
over the item not just where the icon is.

117
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:53.530
So to do that you don't put the hover on the icon and put the cover on the item and what will change

118
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.090
here is do a transform

119
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.540
scale to.

120
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.330
And you can see it's growing.

121
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.210
Now this isn't what we want.

122
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:11.620
In fact what we actually want is for it to start at scale 0 and end at scale 1.

123
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.800
Right now we're going from one to two.

124
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.910
So I'll leave it at that for now.

125
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.750
Transform scale too.

126
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:27.800
But what we need to do is change that initial scale so that's div that item icon and actually I'm pretty

127
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.030
sure I have that appear somewhere else but I'm going to write it.

128
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.560
Yeah I do.

129
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.460
I'm going to write it separately so you can just see the new code separate from the starter code.

130
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.920
So it would be a better practice in the completed code to combine these so I'm not duplicating selectors

131
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:48.950
but I'm not going to do that here just for clarity sake and all we'll do is set the transform to initially

132
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:54.820
be scale 0 and you'll see they go way.

133
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.240
And now when I hover they're growing to scale too.

134
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:06.380
So let's change that to be scale 1 and we're getting that effect yes it's still in the wrong place but

135
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.980
we're getting close.

136
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.630
So what we've done is set scale zero as the initial state and it's going to scale one on hover.

137
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:20.540
And remember that transition right now is coming from here where we added this item star all properties

138
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.180
anywhere inside of an item on anything inside whether it's an image or an icon should take half a second

139
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.390
is in out.

140
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.380
So the next thing we should do is move the icon to the middle and actually very simple in our case where

141
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:41.570
we can do is just add to the transform translate it using percent negative 50 percent common negative

142
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.660
50 percent.

143
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.220
We're going to move it 50 percent up and the left and you might think that's enough.

144
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.950
But actually if I hover it looks like it's not working.

145
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:59.450
But the reason is that it is translating negative 50 negative 50 when it's not showing up because scale

146
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.350
is zero.

147
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.020
But then when we hover we just said scale back to 1.

148
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:11.870
And if you remember from our transform videos earlier on if you re-assign transform it overwrites everything.

149
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.650
So in this case we're only assigning scale 1.

150
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.040
So it's essentially deleting this part.

151
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:26.160
So what we can do is just copy that down here and add that in as well so that at both points it's translated.

152
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.370
So it's moving it over and scaling it to zero at the beginning.

153
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.980
And then when we hover it stays moved over.

154
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.860
And it scales it to 1.

155
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.550
Now it works.

156
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.050
So now we have the basics done.

157
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:44.540
All that's left is if you wanted to tweak it to match some of the more fancy timing that I included.

158
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.820
So rather than making you watch me type the whole thing but I'm going to do is just copy some of the

159
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.330
timing in.

160
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:58.640
So here we have a curve and a transition as well as a delay actually 100 milliseconds that affects when

161
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.100
we hover over the item it affects the icon.

162
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.710
So basically this transform and rather than doing all we could just make this transform because that's

163
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.370
the only property that's changing on the icon.

164
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:20.250
So now as I have for see if you can notice that it grows a bit and then shrinks back down a tiny bit.

165
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:27.690
So if I made that a full second it might be easier to see savey again.

166
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.880
There you go.

167
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.440
So gross a little too far and then comes back.

168
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.300
And that's because of this curve here.

169
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.470
But I'll go back to 300 milliseconds.

170
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.930
So notice though when I hover away we still have that same effect from before.

171
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:48.390
We don't have this fancy Kubic as a curve where it grows and then shrinks.

172
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:55.950
We actually have is just the initial Trents transition that's being set right here so we can change

173
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.730
that if we wanted to.

174
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.990
This is only impacting when we hover.

175
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.730
It doesn't impact when we leave.

176
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.720
So what we can do is go to div dot item.

177
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:12.400
I said the same thing except without the hover and whatever we put here will happen after the hover.

178
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.760
So let me fix this up to be transform as well so are more specific.

179
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:23.900
But let's say I made this one second long you'll see that when we hover is still only 300 milliseconds.

180
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:31.130
But then as I leave it takes a second and we get a very similar transition.

181
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.050
There we go.

182
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.110
So I'm going to leave that except turn it back to 300 milliseconds without the delay.

183
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:48.220
So that delay I'm not well-versed in the psychology behind this but I believe that there is I read something

184
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:55.000
somewhere a long time ago that having things feel too fast or too slick it sometimes can be a worse

185
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.730
experience.

186
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.720
Obviously you don't want long load times or anything but in this case a tiny delay of 100 milliseconds

187
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.890
on this icon makes it feel a little more natural.

188
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.540
But we don't have a delay on the color and the Grayskull that's happening.

189
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.600
And that's fine.

190
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.790
And the very last thing if you want can make this a little bit faster.

191
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:21.430
And now we have the same effects that I had in the initial solution code of course.

192
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.730
Tweak this however you like play around with these curves.

193
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.670
You know people don't just come up with these sort of curves out of nowhere.

194
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.850
Most of the time they're using an editor like the ones that I've shown you before.

195
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.800
So if that's something that you are curious about and you're more inclined to actually create your own.

196
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.200
Definitely try that out.

197
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.880
Use one of those using tools.

198
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.010
I think that one was called Caesar and it allows you to draw a chart and graph and it will convert it

199
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.690
to the appropriate quadratic curve.

200
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.060
All right.

201
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.060
So you can see that transitions are useful.

202
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:57.280
You know we didn't have to do anything crazy we really only have a couple of transitions here on a couple

203
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.320
of properties.

204
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:58.980
OK.

205
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.640
So we enjoyed building that.

206
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.970
Now we're moving on to another type of animation just called animations.
