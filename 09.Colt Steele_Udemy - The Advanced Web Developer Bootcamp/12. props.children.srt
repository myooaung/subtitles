00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:06,940
We just finished up our recipe app and there's one more thing about prop's I wanted to get into before

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,110
we move on from this section and that's Propst children.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,490
So our objectives will be to first describe what prop's that children does and secondly to read more

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,870
about Propst that children helper methods.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,450
So what are Propst our children.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,830
It's a collection that you have access to inside your component and we'll see an example to help clarify

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,310
what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,720
So imagine this let's say I want to make a row component like this where I can just put the row tag

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,250
around some other content.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:45,460
It doesn't matter what content is whether it's a paragraph a div or an H-1 and then everything inside

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,070
that row component will be displayed in a row.

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,660
So how do we get that to work.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,980
Well use props start children.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,990
So as you can see here I'm defining some styles to make anything inside of this row component displayed

15
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,920
in a row.

16
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,790
So the styles here are going to be we're going to display flex.

17
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,810
We're going to do flex direction row and then we'll justify contact with space around.

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,810
And now this props to our children is a collection of all those elements that are inside and it could

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,960
be all different types of things.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,160
So no matter what gets passed in those will be displayed in a row and we'll get something that looks

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,200
like this.

22
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,550
Now that's just one example of using children.

23
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,050
There's a lot more that we can do.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,960
So at this point I suggest checking out this blog post by Max Stoiber.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,690
He's a very active re-act developer who contributes to open source a lot and he's got a very very good

26
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,740
writeup about all the things you can do with props that children.

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,370
So at this point I'd say read that check it out and then move on to the next section.
