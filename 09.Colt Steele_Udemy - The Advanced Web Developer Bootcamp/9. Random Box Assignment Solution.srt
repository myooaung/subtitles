00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,310
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,650
Let's talk about a solution to this random box problem.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,380
So I think one of the hardest things to do in programming is starting from a blank page.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,990
So let's go step by step and talk about how this works.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:23,160
First of all I'm going to need my class to create a component and I'll call it random box and our component

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:32,010
always extends re-act out component.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,020
Next thing will always need a render method.

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:40,930
So by that and remember we need to randomly choose a couple of attributes so the first one will be font

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,390
size.

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,780
Now what my font size to be a random pixel value between let's say 20 and 100 pixels.

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:57,100
So I'll create my font size here and said equal to the floor of a random number

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,420
times 80 and then add 20 to it.

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,240
So it starts at least 20.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,470
Next thing I want a random background color so I'll create that as well.

15
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,990
They're red green or blue

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,590
or black as well.

17
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:35,180
And I want this to be a randomly chosen index saw do math that floor of math at random

18
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,510
times for

19
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:48,170
greats all I'm doing there is randomly picking index to access that array.

20
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,370
Next up let's return our Gas-X so I'm going to return a div

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,560
and inside of that div I just want random box

22
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,550
but this div has to have some properties related to this font size and background color so do that I'll

23
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:26,530
use the style attribute and inside of that style attribute I'll pass in an object.

24
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:35,480
The first thing I need to do here is set my font size So let's say my font size is now equal to font

25
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,670
size x.

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:48,660
Next up I want to set my background color so I'm going to make the background color here equal to background.

27
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:55,000
And this is kind of a lot of wasted code so let's change this variable name to background color and

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,280
then just make it a single expression here.

29
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,640
And after that we just have our normal styling so I'm going to paste in some styles here and talk about

30
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,880
them.

31
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,100
We wanted white text so color white we want to center the text in the div..

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,980
So I use display flex and then just to line items center and justify content centers as well.

33
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:23,940
And then we want the div to be a fixed height so the with 500 pixels and the height here is 200 pixels.

34
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,070
All right so our component looks good but there's one step left.

35
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,920
Remember we've created the component but we haven't actually rendered it in the DOM yet.

36
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:40,130
So the last step here is to add a react on render.

37
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,270
And I want to pass in as the first parameter of that random box component.

38
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:59,570
And the second parameter is the element that I want to attach it to and the DOM saw it again this div.

39
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,730
And there you go.

40
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,750
It should be all set.

41
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,920
Let's check it out in the browser

42
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,210
Yep there it is.

43
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,650
And we get random sizes and random colors.
