1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,540
All right let's get going.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,970
So let's start off with the ugly ex-aide char syntax.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,720
So we're going to start by selecting the button and we might as well just knock all four of these out.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,710
So I'm just going to call this one ex-aide char PTEN equals document query selector.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,340
And then you said ID.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,980
You could also use a document that get element by id and then I'm going to fast forward as I select

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,150
all four buttons.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,430
OK I have the four button selected using those ideas.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,920
Now I'm just going to use Exige our button and set up a quick listener then and here will make our new

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,990
ex-aide char.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,180
And that's going to be new text.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:53,780
Each TTP request my favorite phrase then we'll do our ex-aide char send and also are open.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,760
And before we go any further we should add that you are all that we need.

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,020
So we'll make a variable for you r l equals u r l here.

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,850
Perfect.

16
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:14,000
And then we're going to open a get request to that you are just like that.

17
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,630
So this should send the request but then we need to actually process that we need to do something afterward.

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,700
So we'll add in our ex-aide chart on ready state change.

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:36,490
And then in here if statement if they are not ready state with a capital S equals four and ex-aide chart

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:45,970
status equals 200 then let's do a cost that log ex-aide Charcot response text.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,160
Let's see.

22
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,210
Does it work.

23
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,340
I open up the console.

24
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,310
I click on exit char button and nothing's happening.

25
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,030
So let's see if I click listner works I'll just do an alert here.

26
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,000
And now if I click that still not working.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,900
Silly mistake I'm missing what I'm listening for.

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,320
There you go.

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,300
Hopefully you saw that for me.

30
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:20,160
So now I click SH Are we get high and we get our data perfect So our data is in an array.

31
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,370
But remember it's Jaison even though it looks basically like only a string it's inside of an array.

32
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,090
So we need to parse it first.

33
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,570
So we're going to do.

34
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,520
Jason parce Charcot response text.

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,980
Let's save that to a variable called the VAR quote perfect.

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,200
Now let's just print out quote

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,130
We should get rid of that alert.

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,960
But that looks good.

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,640
So we want quote zero.

40
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,560
So let's save the quote.

41
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:04,790
Add the zero on the end here and now and we click should just get the raw quote.

42
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,240
Perfect OK.

43
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,990
So we have that let's get rid of our annoying alert and now we just need to do the part to actually

44
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,250
update this paragraph here.

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:26,190
So I'm going to select it var let's call it display equals document queries selector with the ID of

46
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:37,310
quotes and then all we have to do is set display dot in inner text because the quote that comes back

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,000
that we just got to make sure it works.

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,790
Perfect OK.

49
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,060
So that's our version using SH are.

50
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,140
Now let's move on to fetch.

51
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,320
So we have this fetch button.

52
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,700
We need to add our listeners for that and we're sending our fetch get request to you or else we have

53
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,030
right here.

54
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,510
So fetch you Arel and then our DOT then

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,060
our function and then we'll also add a dime catch

56
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,600
OK.

57
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,630
So let's just do an alert here.

58
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,250
Error.

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,010
Good enough.

60
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,240
Then let's do a constant log request.

61
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,470
Make sure it works.

62
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,160
Open up the console click the fetch button and we're getting our data back.

63
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,620
So this is now where we need to do our Jason.

64
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,310
So will do request that Jason just like that.

65
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:41,920
Then

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
and will cancel that log our data.

67
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,140
You don't have to nest then.

68
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,830
But I'm going to do that for now.

69
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,890
That's quick.

70
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,120
Perfect.

71
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,720
And we just to that log data zero there we go.

72
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,950
So the last thing will do is just steal our logic up here where we're just setting the displays in our

73
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:13,640
text equal to data zero.

74
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,790
Let's see if it works looks good.

75
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,260
H.R. still works and fetch works.

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,070
OK.

77
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,770
Now we're moving on to our Jay query button.

78
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,590
And in order to go any further we need to include J query.

79
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,160
So open up the queried page.

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,920
I'm going to include the minute script.

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,170
You can also the easier way for using code Peniche just include it over here but I'll just include this

82
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,600
save.

83
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,760
Now I can reference a query and why not let's do this one the query way.

84
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,270
So rather than selecting the button like this.

85
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:55,250
Let's actually do a dollar sign and the button is called the query.

86
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,950
Is that right.

87
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,910
Yes.

88
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,480
Click.

89
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,570
And then in here we're going to send our Ajax request I'm going to use get Jaison and that you are all

90
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:07,910
we want.

91
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,500
It's just called you Arel.

92
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,810
Well then

93
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,260
and remember that our response in this case actually it's better if we make this up done.

94
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,210
So Jake Weary Way and will do a cost that log response.

95
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,150
So let's see what happens.

96
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,310
I clicked the J.Crew button and look at that.

97
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,750
We don't even have to parse our data or anything because we're using get Jason so we can just call it

98
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,610
let's just name this data instead of response because it's not the entire response it's just the data

99
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,760
from the response and we just want data zero.

100
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,730
There we go.

101
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:53,050
So to actually update this paragraph down here we're just going to select the ID which is quote and

102
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,460
then set text to be data zero which is what is coming back from the API.

103
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,900
There we go so fast.

104
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,430
SH R and J Cory are working great.

105
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,660
Finally we have access.

106
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,090
So we need to include it.

107
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,270
I'm on the ex-CEO skit page.

108
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:19,540
Copy this script here and just include that with a query.

109
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,220
So now I'm going to use this X years button.

110
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,500
I've already selected come down here and do an event listener.

111
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,310
Technically you know I could mix J query with this as well but I'm kind of making the point that you

112
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,430
may not need a query all the time so I'm not going to do that.

113
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:48,940
And let me make sure I don't forget to say this one is quick that we're looking for perfect and in here

114
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,630
we're going to do our X-post dot get what's the URL appear safe to variable already.

115
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,480
And then we add in our then

116
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,330
we'll just you come to that log.

117
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,500
And let's at our catch we don't really have to handle errors on this one but just good to get in the

118
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,390
practice of that.

119
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:14,990
OK.

120
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,460
So let's see what happens when really quick it.

121
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,850
Great.

122
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,280
So we're getting our data back but it's actually inside the response itself so we want response data

123
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,970
which gives us this.

124
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,050
And then we just want to access zero again.

125
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,700
And finally we want to take this and actually update this paragraph.

126
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:44,990
So just a matter of display in our text just like we did earlier equals that and there we go.

127
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,190
So let's compare them.

128
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,010
We have these four different ways of writing it.

129
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
Start at the top.

130
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,760
The longest bulkiest is the X H.R. syntax.

131
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,630
Then we've got fetch which is not too bad.

132
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,790
I like fetch and texture pretty good.

133
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,910
The only problem of course is that it doesn't work in Internet Explorer.

134
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,130
So that's kind of a big issue.

135
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,330
Then we've got a query really nice beautiful.

136
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,470
So I would say that people don't like this but it's really easy and short but it comes at the expense

137
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,180
of having to include a bunch of other stuff you may or may not need.

138
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,460
And then finally we had ex-U.S. which actually is not really fair to compare the syntax to this because

139
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,590
we're not handling any errors in here so we could add the dot fail and that would make this seem a little

140
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,460
longer.

141
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,230
Anyway the point is that these are very similar in syntax.

142
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,880
They work across all browsers.

143
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,550
There's no compatibility issues.

144
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,550
But this comes with a bunch of extra stuff.

145
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,030
You may not need and if you don't want it and you just care about making your requests then use x yes

146
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,510
or use fetch and just don't care about Internet Explorer users.

147
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,530
OK.

148
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,360
Kind of a long exercise there.
