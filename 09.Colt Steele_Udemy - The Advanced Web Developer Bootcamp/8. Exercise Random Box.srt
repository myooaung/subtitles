This assignment you'll implement a component called random box and the random box is just a div with

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,670
some text inside the text random box.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,970
And every time this div is rendered you'll get a different random font size here and a potentially different

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,210
background color.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,530
I only chose four different background colors so it could be red green blue or black.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,050
But essentially the idea is every time you refresh something different can happen to the styling.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,120
As you can see after the refresh I've got a different background color and a different font size.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,260
And I'll refresh once more.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,390
And now I've got red background color and slightly different font size.

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,080
So that's the idea there's some structure below give it a shot and we'll have a solution right after.
