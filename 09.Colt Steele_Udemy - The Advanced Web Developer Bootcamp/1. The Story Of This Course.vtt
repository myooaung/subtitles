00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.000
Welcome.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.130
So this course is quite a bit different from other courses in its scope its complexity and its structure.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.640
So I want to first talk about how it came to be and what makes it special.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.650
I'll keep it brief.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.480
First I should say hi.

6
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.190
Hello my name is Colt.

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.660
I have a face.

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.570
Those are professional photos of it.

9
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.000
Here's one I'd prefer.

10
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.330
Me and my cat look out for her to make an appearance or two throughout the course so some days I wake

11
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.960
up and I think that I made developer who specializes in teaching.

12
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.390
Other days I wake up and think that I'm a teacher who specializes in developing and other days I just

13
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.200
don't really think about it it's kind of a weird thing to think about.

14
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.110
But truthfully I think those are the two things that define my life the most.

15
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.760
Teaching and coding.

16
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.880
So I've been teaching people to code for 6 years now seven years.

17
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.510
Initially in boot camps around San Francisco these three to six month programs that were very intensive

18
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.630
take people from zero experience up to the point where they can get a job.

19
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.380
Then I left and started making online courses.

20
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.630
This is one of those courses I've been doing that for about two years now.

21
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.830
So that's enough about me.

22
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.730
You can read my bio if you want to it's kind of boring but it has more information.

23
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.270
So back to the story of this course.

24
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.430
So here's a less than beautiful diagram I created that is supposed to represent a talented developers

25
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.330
skill level.

26
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.160
There are a ton of course is out there.

27
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.720
Some of mine included that focus on the first 60 percent of this bar.

28
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.670
The foundational topics things like Tim elsea s and Javascript maybe some intermediate things like throw

29
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.140
in a couple of advanced topics but it's really focused on the bread and butter of development.

30
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.420
But what about the other stuff.

31
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.120
All the important things.

32
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.430
Once you've mastered the basics that's what this course really focuses on.

33
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.710
We really want to help students level up their skills fill up this bar.

34
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.600
So what are the topics that we need to cover in order to do that.

35
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.520
Well there's a lot of them here so you can see as they appear.

36
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.050
So this is a very diverse list of topics.

37
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.210
But every single thing here is for a reason whether we're talking about things like react and redux

38
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.490
some of the trendiest most popular technologies out there or things like testing and Object-Oriented

39
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.830
Programming which are less glamorous but are really important skills to have as a developer to learn

40
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.960
more about the curriculum.

41
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.050
Please watch the following curriculum over the video.

42
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.570
It goes into a lot of detail.

43
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.730
So this is a ton of content.

44
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.520
It's honestly it's kind of insane for me to do it all my own it would probably take a year or more.

45
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.260
So instead I got the team back together.

46
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.100
So who is the team you might ask.

47
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.930
Well the team is a group of trusted instructors that I've worked with for years.

48
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.720
A lot of the time when instructors pair up to teach online they haven't even met in person they haven't

49
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.230
worked together before but this is really different.

50
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.530
The team I'm referring to is a real team in real life.

51
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.320
We worked together for years teaching people how to code in person in San Francisco.

52
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.780
These are some of my favorite people I've ever worked with.

53
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.640
So we have Ellie Tim and Matt.

54
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.460
These are the photos they provided me with when I asked but I prefer these.

55
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.140
Sorry you'll learn a lot more about these guys as the course goes on.

56
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.680
But I just want to highlight that each one of them brings something to the table.

57
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.190
For example Matt right here who sadly no longer has that mustache.

58
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.520
That's really really good with math is a math Ph.D. actually.

59
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.130
He's a published author but more relevant to this course.

60
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.670
He's really skilled with D-3 and data visualisations.

61
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.830
So that's something that I frankly I'm terrible at visualizing data using D-3 creating interactive diagrams

62
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.670
dashboards.

63
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.130
So I'm really thankful to have him here because his content on that is much much better than any content

64
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.090
I could produce.

65
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.320
So I'll leave it there for now.

66
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.810
This course is really unique in a couple of ways.

67
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.660
The scope the diversity of topics that we cover as well as the structure of our team the fact that we've

68
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.060
all worked together that we know each other's teaching styles and that we're bringing our off line boot

69
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.440
camp experience back online.

70
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.080
So next up we'll take you on a journey through the curriculum and it really is a journey because there's

71
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.440
a lot to talk about.
