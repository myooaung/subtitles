00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.590
OK.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.160
So let's get started on the code should be pretty quick.

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.570
I'm here in the code pen with the starter code and the first thing I'll just mention is that I've zoomed

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.260
in here.

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.240
Yours will definitely look smaller because I'm zoomed in to make the font bigger appear but I'll zoom

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.410
out at the end to show you what it looks like at a normal scale.

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.380
OK.

8
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.720
So first let's talk about what we need to do.

9
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.800
Our plan of attack what we want to do is turn this left side bar of class side bar into a flex container.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.920
So this flex container will then have to device inside of it.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.000
Ignoring that the subsequent children just to direct children to divs inside and essentially we want

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.620
to send one up to the top and one down to the bottom.

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.370
So what that really means is that we'll need to turn this flexi container into a column flex direction

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.790
call them lay out and then we can play around with the spacing.

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.590
Once we do that.

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.500
So again turn it into a flex container with display flex and then we'll turn it into a column rather

17
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.640
than a row and then we'll spaced these two things appropriately.

18
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.490
Then we'll add some space or padding on the sides to make them look a little nicer.

19
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.220
OK.

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.800
So we have our side bar.

21
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.370
Let's just add display flex and see what happens.

22
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.660
All right.

23
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.400
As you can see things end up automatically bunched together.

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.170
You can font's a little bit but you can see what's happening.

25
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.860
So what we want to do is instead of have the default for flex direction which is row.

26
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.770
So our main axis is going from left to right this direction you want it to go from top to bottom.

27
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.410
So what we'll do is just change flex direction to column just like that and save.

28
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.800
OK and we're back to where we started.

29
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.950
So that might seem a little pointless but the next move is what will make it worth our time if we visualize

30
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.850
our border around our box.

31
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.900
Let's just do 10 pixels solid pink.

32
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.530
You can see we have all of this space here.

33
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.570
We're not using.

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.770
And remember the property that allows us to distribute space across the main axis is justify content.

35
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.390
So we could do justify content.

36
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.820
And if we tried to center it our main axis goes from top to bottom so it centers it vertically which

37
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:35.340
is not what we want what we want instead is to center it with space between so space dash between will

38
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.310
take that space and distribute it.

39
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.140
So it takes you know our first section puts it up here our second section puts on the bottom in between

40
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.760
is our space.

41
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.890
You could have also tried space around but that's not quite what we want.

42
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.210
We want space between we want this flush against the edge as much as possible.

43
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.820
OK so that gets us roughly what we want we can comment out the border and delete that.

44
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.670
Yeah we have some of the spacing issues.

45
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.440
If I zoom out the only other thing to address as far as flex box is that right now we have a problem

46
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.510
when we make it very small vertically which probably doesn't happen very much.

47
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.420
But part of the spec was that it needed to go over it needed it to wrap it into two columns which it

48
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.370
doesn't right now.

49
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.010
So that's a very simple fix.

50
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.090
All we need to do is do flex wrap colon wrap.

51
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.340
Remember the default is no gap.

52
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.530
But if we change that and now and try and resize it again you'll see there we go.

53
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.010
We get that crap.

54
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.380
He goes over to the other side creates two columns only when necessary.

55
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.970
OK so that's the end of the Flex box portion.

56
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.140
Hopefully that was straightforward enough.

57
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.170
It used all the properties we've learned it until now.

58
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.620
Display flex flex direction justified content in Flex wrap.

59
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.240
Now if we wanted to just make this a little bit nicer You can either go to the individual sections which

60
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.650
we haven't really style debt that section and just apply padding and we could just do 10 pixels.

61
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.130
Technically we don't need it on all sides.

62
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.940
We don't need to on this side or on the bottom really.

63
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.630
Maybe we want it on the bottom here so I'm just going to do padding 10 pixels but you might just want

64
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.480
padding left 10 pixels if you want things flush.

65
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.310
But I like it better as padding 10 pixels and that pretty much wraps it up.

66
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.000
You can play around with this a bit more maybe 20.

67
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.690
I don't like that as much.

68
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.730
I guess the only thing that we could add rather than doing padding just to the section if you think

69
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.240
these are a bit cramped if you look at the solution.

70
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.530
I did have more space there.

71
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.940
I just took this padding 10 pixels and moved it into the individual items.

72
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.860
There we go.

73
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:04.590
So now we have 10 pixels and 20 between 10 on the side 20 between 10 on the bottom and 10 on the side.

74
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.990
So really not that important to the flex box portion of this section but if you're interested.

75
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.280
That's how I achieved it.

76
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.730
All right.

77
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.680
So moving on from here we have a couple more properties then we'll build another little widget and then

78
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.540
a couple more properties and then we'll build something else.

79
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.710
OK in a.
