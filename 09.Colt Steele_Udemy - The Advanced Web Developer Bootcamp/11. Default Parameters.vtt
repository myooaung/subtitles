00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.830
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.800
In this video we're going to be discussing another very helpful feature that as 2015 gives us default

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.890
parameters let's create a function called ad that will accept two parameters and return the sum of those

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.170
two parameters.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.640
If we don't pass anything to this function we'll get back not a number because the value of A and B

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.880
are undefined and undefined plus undefined is not a number.

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.890
So what if we want to set a default value for these parameters.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.990
If we don't set anything for the value of a let's set it to 2 we would have to have some conditional

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.700
logic inside of our add function to do that.

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.960
So let's make an if statement checking to see if A is undefined and if so we'll set a to be 2.

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
You can imagine that with lots of parameters and different kinds of values that becomes quite tedious

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.470
to do.

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.020
Thankfully yes 2015 helps us out here.

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.460
We can assign values to our parameters using an equal sign and then specify a value.

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.280
This value will be the default if nothing is passed to the function when it is called.

16
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.390
We can set anything to be a default value numbers strings booleans arrays objects and even functions.

17
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.450
Let's see what our add function looks like when we assign a default value of 2 and 2 if we invoke this

18
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.330
function without passing in any parameters we'll get back for if we just pass in a single parameter

19
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.230
of 10.

20
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.740
We'll get back 12 since the second parameter has defaulted to 2.

21
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.860
You can easily start using default parameters in your code to help reduce conditional logic and confusion

22
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.300
in the next video.

23
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.830
We'll take a look at another kind of loop to help write even more concise code see that.
