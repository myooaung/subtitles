00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.450
Now that we've learned about create re-act app we need to learn about javascript import statements.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.720
These are used all over react so understanding them is pretty fundamental.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.050
I should also mention that import statements aren't reac specific.

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.900
They're part of a new javascript standard that's being implemented in browsers right now.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.040
Our first objective is going to be to import a component from another file.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.740
The second is to export a component from another file.

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.020
And these two objectives really go hand-in-hand.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.800
And finally to use export default versus exporting something not by default we'll see what that means

9
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.660
as we go.

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.650
So let's go back to our Hello World project in cloud 9 Okay we're back in cloud 9.

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.110
And let's take a look at actually as to start looking at some imports and tax.

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.910
So the top of the file and at the top of pretty much every re-act component you'll make you want to

13
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.740
say import reacts Khama component from react.

14
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.810
So why is reacts without the curly braces and component has curly braces.

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.480
Well re-act is the default export from the file and component is export from that file but not by default.

16
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.510
So we'll see examples of this as we go.

17
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.620
Notice at the bottom of this file that we export app by default.

18
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.940
How is that used.

19
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.270
Let's look an index Jap's.

20
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.760
So in this file We're importing app from dot slash app.

21
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.020
Now notice there's a relative path.

22
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.730
So in order for this to work app yes an index chaffs have to be in the same directory.

23
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.010
If app were in another directory called component's it would be dot slash component's slash at.

24
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.370
But since they're in the same we'll just use dot slash.

25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.130
Now also it's important to notice that app doesn't have the curly braces around it and that's because

26
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.550
app was exported from app just by default.

27
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.050
And the name here when you export something by default isn't actually important.

28
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.590
So I can rename this to pizza and this would also be pizza.

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.460
So the default export name can be anything you want when you import it but that's not true of components

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.180
that aren't exported by default.

31
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.340
Let's go back to objects and change the export to be not default anymore and then see how that affects

32
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.450
our imports statement.

33
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.220
So we're back in.

34
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.240
And now I'm going to remove the default from the export.

35
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.070
And now you see again error here.

36
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.730
In order to fix that we need to put the things we're exporting in curly braces.

37
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.370
All right so now app is getting exported.

38
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.990
Now if you still have your server running or if you start your server again let's go check it out.

39
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.540
You should get this air export default import as app was not found.

40
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.580
And that's because we're trying to get inside of index Jap's import app as a default from app.

41
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.000
But it's not a default export anymore.

42
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.460
So in order to fix this problem you have to put in curly braces.

43
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.340
And now if I go check out my server it's fixed.

44
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.960
Let's say though that you're really stuck on this pizza name.

45
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.350
So if I go back to index yes if this was not a default export I could still rename it using as.

46
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.830
So I could say app as pizza.

47
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.260
So this name here still has to match up with the the name that was exported from app from this file.

48
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.710
But now we can rename it to something else when we import it.

49
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.990
And I'd also have to change this the pizza and if I save that again no errors.

50
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.590
Now that we know a bit about import syntax let's try to take that Moxey component the pet component

51
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.220
that we created earlier and add it to this app and then I swear that this will be the last I talked

52
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.880
about my cat.

53
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.820
So let's let's work on that.

54
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.350
So if you recall our Moxey component looks like looks like this.

55
00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.870
We've got her name a picture and her hobbies down here and the code looks something like this.

56
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.220
So we had a hobby list component and a pet component and then we were rendering the pet.

57
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.050
So let's get rid of Agis and implement the pet in the hobby list.

58
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.510
I'm going to start with the pet.

59
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.410
So the first thing I'll do is copy this code over

60
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.780
and make a new file called Pet Jap's.

61
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:32.620
So let's kill the server and then I'll just say touch pet that Jesus touch source pet that Jesus and

62
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.730
as you can see we've got this pet jazz file and then I'll just paste all my code in there.

63
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.560
OK.

64
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:52.920
And I remember the first thing we want to do is import reacts so all imports reacts and component as

65
00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:01.910
a non-default import from reacts and pay attention here to that re-act is not a relative import.

66
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.610
So we don't use dot slash anything that's in your node modules you don't need to use relative path and

67
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.740
I spell import correctly.

68
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.590
There we go.

69
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.760
And then the last piece here is we take off this react because we're importing.

70
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.060
Come on ants.

71
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.840
Spell that right.

72
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.450
Great.

73
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.990
OK.

74
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.410
So now we've got an import re-acting component and we've got our class.

75
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.350
The last step is to export default.

76
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:45.730
And you can also decide to do it where you do the expert default right at the top.

77
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.890
I prefer to put the export at the bottom of the file but it's really a matter of preference.

78
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.260
Either way is fine.

79
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.190
So I'll stick with export at the bottom.

80
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.560
And now the next step is to update our index Jap's.

81
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.260
So if I go over it index just I no longer want to import.

82
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.290
I'll change this to Pat and I want to import that from my pet Jasc file.

83
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.940
And if it's a jazz file you can leave off the extension.

84
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.110
So just pet is fine.

85
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.480
And then I'll change my component name to pet as well.

86
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.980
All right.

87
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.270
Now let's take a look at that

88
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.580
isn't there.

89
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.560
So I forgot to take out the hobby less from my component because we haven't implemented that yet.

90
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:44.820
So let's go back to the pet Jap's and remove the hobby list for now.

91
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.830
So I've saved that

92
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.700
and we get a warning here that the image element must have an Propp.

93
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.920
So I'll go back and fix that.

94
00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:07.990
Also I thought I had that but that's OK with Allt equals Moxey picture.

95
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.980
Well Scott Moxey

96
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.770
all right now everything is running without any warning so let's open this up.

97
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.670
And as you can see we've got moxie and we've got the text most of the text except for the list.

98
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.020
But the problem is we lost our styling.

99
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.380
So how do we bring our styling over let's do that next.

100
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.650
So if you remember our component we had this first component CSX that has all of our styles.

101
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.990
So let's grab the CSSA and bring it over to our app.

102
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.940
I'll just copy it all

103
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.620
and go back here and create that file.

104
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:56.090
So typically you'll call this file the same name as your components or touch source pet.

105
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:03.750
That's the SS and I'll put all my CSSA inside of there.

106
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:10.580
One important point to make here is that all the styles inside of your pet that SS should only apply

107
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.550
to the component and that's true for pretty much all of these except for this app.

108
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.840
Well there's sort of two problems.

109
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.290
We no longer have an element with the ID app and this doesn't apply to our component specifically.

110
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:34.580
So I'm going to take that out and where this really belongs is inside of this index CSSA file and rather

111
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.700
than app.

112
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.250
If you remember what index looks like it's going to be brute

113
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.810
so I'll rename that to route.

114
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.870
Save it and then save our pet.

115
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.700
And I've also got a typo here.

116
00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:05.110
The next step is to import pet that CSSA into our component so I'll just say import thought slash pet

117
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:13.360
that see us and notice here that it's not a javascript file anymore so we have to add the CSSA extension.

118
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.130
Now it's restarted the server and check it out.

119
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.370
OK our styles are back.

120
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.840
So that looks great.

121
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.060
The last step would be to add that hobby list component as well.

122
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.100
I'm going to leave that to you as an exercise in the next section.

123
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.320
So good luck.
