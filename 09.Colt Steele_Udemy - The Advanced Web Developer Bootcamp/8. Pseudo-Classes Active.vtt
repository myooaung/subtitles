00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.800
OK.

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.920
So we have one more pseudo class to discuss which is called active and I save this one for last now

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.510
because my favorite is definitely not not to hit on it too much.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.220
That was a little harsh at the moment but because it's confusing or it can be confusing especially when

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.210
you compare it to something like hover which is very clear cut.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.710
There's not much ambiguity around what it means to hover over an element that is a clear state but in

7
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.870
my experience students have often kind of gotten tripped up on the distinction between focus and active

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.820
and it's not really helped by the MDA and descriptions or at least not up front.

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.920
So if we take a look at the description for active.

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.070
Well first here's my kind of distilled version triggers when an element is being activated by user in

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.770
quotes.

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.470
It's coming straight from the dark.

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.120
That is not my language.

14
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.800
But what does that really mean.

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.980
Being activated by user versus receiving focus.

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.640
And if we actually go to the dark ages then cleared that well up front.

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.030
If we look at active it's generally triggered when the user clicks on an element or selects it with

18
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.840
the keyboards tab key.

19
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.160
And if we go back to focus it is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps an element or selects

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.710
it with the keyboards tab key.

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.550
So those sound very similar.

22
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.310
They are very similar but they're different they're different pseudo classes and they apply to different

23
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.910
states.

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.040
So to really help understand this I think it will help actually just to dive into code Penn and to just

25
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.860
write some code to illustrate it.

26
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.580
All right.

27
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.980
So a good place to start.

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.450
A very common scenario is actually using buttons alongside the active pseudo class.

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.200
So we'll do that ourselves.

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.390
And by the end of this we'll have three different states all on this one button or any button on this

31
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.660
page.

32
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.650
Technically we just happen to have one.

33
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.850
We have hover.

34
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.530
We have focused and active.

35
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.690
We will have active.

36
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.740
So let's start with the red button Colan active.

37
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.540
Just a small note if you had a space here.

38
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.360
It really breaks the entire thing.

39
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.180
So if you're having trouble at home that can be a pretty common thing that I've run into.

40
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.490
So button active let's make it very clear let's make it orange

41
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.490
just like that and let's increase the font size to be 30 pixels.

42
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.270
I'm actually not sure what it currently is that that might be much too big of a number but it's fine.

43
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.900
We're not really worried about that.

44
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.260
All right.

45
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.340
So let's trigger this to just refresh your memory.

46
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.740
We've got hover I've got focus but now when I actually click on something I don't know if that showed

47
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.530
up in the video very well I just did a quick click you've got a very brief view of our big orange button

48
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.730
and if I actually want to see it I need to click and hold.

49
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.320
So while I am clicking on this button it is active.

50
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.150
So again we've got hover and then I click and I briefly get active but then I released.

51
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.730
So I'm back to focus with it currently has the focus of the page and then I could hold down and actually

52
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.960
right now I have both active and hover at the same time you notice that the click me is white which

53
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.470
is not specified in active it specified in the hover pseudo class or the selector corresponding to that.

54
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.210
So I have two states at once and I can release and I still have two states at once.

55
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.940
This time I have focus and hover.

56
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.210
Now I just have focus.

57
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.890
So that makes a bit of sense.

58
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.990
And know it's kind of annoying to go over all of those.

59
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.200
Let's make it a bit clearer though active is not a state that only applies to buttons.

60
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:41.540
So let's let's do it to our paragraph paragraph active and let's just make it yellow.

61
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.870
All right.

62
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.200
So I hover over it nothing happens.

63
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:52.530
Tab key nothing happens because I can not have a focus or a focused paragraph.

64
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.240
Focus only applies to inputs and buttons and text areas.

65
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.960
But I can click on this paragraph and turn it yellow by making it active.

66
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.400
Well not this yellow.

67
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.550
That is a bad coincidence.

68
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.490
This yellow here.

69
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.670
There you go.

70
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.010
And I could do the same thing.

71
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.260
Let's also do it to all eight ones so I'll just use both of them separate them by commas active H-1

72
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.780
active paragraphs should both turn yellow.

73
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.040
So it's not active now it's done here.

74
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.000
OK.

75
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.200
So that mostly wraps up what I want to discuss around these three pseudo classes.

76
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.090
Hopefully that helps you see the distinction between active and focus.

77
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.400
Focus is a state that can persist it's sort of the the idea of clicking into something traditionally

78
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.900
at least or something having focus it maintains focus.

79
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.340
Whether you are interacting with it at that moment or not for example that input has focused right now

80
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.590
or this button now has focused active is a more immediate state has to do that yellow is again it has

81
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.790
to do with clicking or tapping on something in that moment.

82
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.300
All right.

83
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.440
So those are the three superclasses classes I want to talk about the next thing we'll do is actually

84
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.430
build something using them.

85
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.250
So I'm going to be mind blowing but it's a pretty nice looking button that has three different states

86
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.740
are actually four if you include the Baystate.

87
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.130
So we use these three pseudo classes in conjunction to style one button.

88
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.090
Make it look good hopefully.

89
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.340
All right.

90
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.230
That's coming up.
