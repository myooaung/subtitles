00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,040
Welcome back in this exercise let's build another histogram.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,600
If you look at the resources for this exercise you'll see that I've given you the same data set for

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,240
my scatterplot example what I'd like you to do here is pick one of the variables we studied earlier

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,940
and make a histogram to display that variable.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:25,940
For example here I've created a histogram showing the median age of the population in different regions.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,880
Your goal in this exercise is to implement a similar type of histogram.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,160
You can choose to look at median age or any other variable.

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,830
If you're up for a challenge there's a bonus here to notice that as I adjust the range and put on the

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,830
bottom I'm altering the number of bins in the histogram in order to get this working with the axes adjusting

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,970
appropriately.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,690
You may need to look into an access method we haven't talked about cultic values.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,770
It's similar to the thresholds method we discussed in the previous video.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,680
Good luck with this histogram if you get stuck or want to see how I solved the bonus.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,320
You can take a look at the next video.
