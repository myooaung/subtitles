00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.930
All right.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.660
So the first pseudo class we'll talk about is hover and I have the docs open for it here and I'm D-n

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.820
the hover.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.450
She is a pseudo class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.190
Typically that would be a mouse but does not necessarily activate it.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.660
So it's important you know it doesn't mean clicking on something that will not trigger it.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.890
But hovering over something will.

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.710
Here's an example a very simple one.

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.950
What this will do is whenever a user hovers over any div that div will turn purple background they will

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.990
turn purple.

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.830
So the syntax selects all divs on the page in the Huffer state.

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.580
So this only affects them when they're being hovered over.

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.180
Otherwise the div is in whatever other background color we have set.

14
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.820
Next thing we'll do is give it a shot on our own.

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.210
So I'm using code pen for this.

16
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.110
It's just a quick example if you're not familiar with code pen it's an in browser editor for Front-End

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.850
technologies.

18
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.480
TMLC and Javascript it's great both as a developer and a teacher.

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.900
I can share things with you.

20
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.370
So my code will be here and you'll be able to see it and view it long after this video ends.

21
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.840
But also it's a great way to view other peoples code so you can search for things you can share code.

22
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.770
There are thousands and thousands of code pends people.

23
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.120
Bill towd ranging from very simple things to amazing complex tools and websites people have built.

24
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.070
So if you never use it you can sign up.

25
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.020
And then you can click on the new pen button on the homepage.

26
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.160
Here is the create button.

27
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.660
New pen.

28
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.800
I'll just go back have pre-created one.

29
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.240
I'm going to minimize that javascript don't need that.

30
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.100
And basically from here on out anytime you see me using code pen I'll be doing it in a separate code

31
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.740
pen itself a separate pen.

32
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.460
So they call them to keep things separated so every video will have its own.

33
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.300
So if you want to go back and view them you can see them all under my profile but they're also included

34
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.720
along with every lecture or corresponding lecture as a resource.

35
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.030
OK so I'm going to start really simple.

36
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.960
We'll have an H1 and this H1 will just say I am in H-1 and we'll have let's say a paragraph.

37
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.750
This is a paragraph.

38
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.670
This really doesn't matter and we'll do one more thing let's do a button click me.

39
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.620
Perfect.

40
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.080
You can see him getting that live down here.

41
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.020
In fact I'll make this a bit bigger Just so you can see it.

42
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.870
OK.

43
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.530
So we have three elements.

44
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.680
Now let's go ahead and style something let's use H-1 colon hover.

45
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.270
So in the hover state only Let's do background color pink.

46
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.040
It's going to be very ugly.

47
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.700
So currently it's not pink but I hover immediately turns pink.

48
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.350
It's as easy as that.

49
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.520
Now of course we'll be working towards making more beautiful things and making them beautiful.

50
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.280
It's not really just a matter of better colors but it's also has to do with the actual animation.

51
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.530
It is very jarring.

52
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.720
This is an immediate transition and if I had another one here let's just say I am also.

53
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.810
Each one and I save both of them turned pink when I hover over them.

54
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.160
All right so that's the basics of it.

55
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:21.010
But just to show you I can do the same thing for the button that's two button hover and this time let's

56
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.370
make the background let's do something other than background let's do the color itself white.

57
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.040
All right.

58
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.310
So we were to each one.

59
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.030
Nothing happens to the paragraph.

60
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.770
And our button turns white.

61
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.110
Very ugly yes.

62
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.070
But it immediately gives you feedback that you can click this or that.

63
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.790
There's something here and that's pretty much all there is to hover.

64
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.180
So and the video here that I'll say is that we are working towards making things that look a lot nicer.

65
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.340
This is very basic but this is the foundation right if we want to do anything upon a hover when it user

66
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.250
mouse is over.

67
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.750
This is the best way to do it using C assess the question.

68
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.580
As I mentioned in the last video is not how to do it but really what to do what's the animation itself.

69
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.090
And that's what we're going to learn.

70
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.130
That's what we're going to focus on is how do we make it take longer.

71
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.710
How do we affect the timing of it.

72
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.460
How do we make it more beautiful of that rather than just an immediate jarring transition.

73
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.120
So that's coming up but first we're going to talk about the two other pseudo classes very briefly focus

74
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.740
and active.
