00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.960
Now talk about re-act Deb tools this is a really valuable Chrome extension that will install and then

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.530
see what it can do.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.180
First of all in the Chrome Web store you can search for re-act developer tools and then add it to your

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.070
browser.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.300
I've already got it installed so I'll go back to the app that we looked at before and do a little debugging

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:32.450
to get the to get to the re-act developer tools to get to the Riak developer tools.

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.720
You'll open up your chrome developer tools and it's not visible here but you'll have a extra tab for

8
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.020
reacts.

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.950
We make that slightly smaller so you can see we've got re-act here.

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.160
If you don't see re-act it's probably because it's in this overflow section.

11
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.180
And when you use the re-act developer tools you'll be able to see all the components that you have in

12
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.790
your component hierarchy by using this inspector when you click on a particular component.

13
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.820
You can see the props.

14
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.790
And if I go up here I can see the state that I've got as well.

15
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.100
So that's a pretty cool feature.

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.200
Another cool feature is that you can go over to the elements tab and inspect the normal Dom without

17
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.440
your component hierarchy being visible.

18
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.740
And then I can select something in the DOM must say this ally.

19
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.920
And then if I go over to the react have the component that render that I will already be selected and

20
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.770
expanded.

21
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.140
So that's pretty cool.

22
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.340
We can sort of get a view into what the Riak component is doing to that Dom element

23
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.940
and other cool features that we can see state updated in real time.

24
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.180
It's going to be a little tricky with this application because we have to restart our app in order to

25
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.210
see the change.

26
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.940
But the ability is still there.

27
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.800
If something is going on your application you can get to the component you want inspected state and

28
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.810
then when you're using application you could see the state changing.

29
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.440
So that's it for this video we'll use the re-act developer tools more throughout the course.

30
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.430
But next up let's work on an exercise.
