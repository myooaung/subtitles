Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,850
In this video we're going to go over solutions to the 2015 inheritance exercises.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,790
The first thing we need to do is make a class for a vehicle inside of this class will create a constructor

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:20,540
method and will pass in a make model and year inside of this function.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,610
Let's attach some properties onto the keyword.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:32,090
This will specify the stop make equals make the stop model equals model and the this year equals here.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,920
We then need to create an instance method called Start which just returns the string vroom.

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,030
We're also going to create an instance method called two string which will return the make model and

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:52,770
year are this dot make this dot model and this year we're using template strings here to help us out

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,500
quite a bit.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,620
Next we need to create a class called car which will inherit all of the methods from vehicle.

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,290
So let's use the extension keyword to do that.

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,710
Inside of the car class will make a constructor method which will also accept a make model and year

14
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:16,880
and invoke super and pass and make model and year if we'd like we can also use the arguments array like

15
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,330
object and spread out all of the values.

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,620
We'll also need a property called Number wheels which will set to for.

17
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,040
We're going to use very similar logic for our motorcycle class.

18
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:34,670
So let's create a class for a motorcycle which will extend from vehicle and inside here Meeka constructor

19
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,720
method that's almost identical to the car except this time the number of wheels is to instead of spreading

20
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,710
out the arguments.

21
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,900
We could once again pass each arguments separated by a comma but that would be very challenging when

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,740
we have lots of parameters and that's all for the inheritance exercises.

23
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,900
See you in the next video.
