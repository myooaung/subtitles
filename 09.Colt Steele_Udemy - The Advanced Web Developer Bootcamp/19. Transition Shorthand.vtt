00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.030
All right.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.120
So the last bit of syntax with transitions that you need to know is the shorthand way of writing them

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.180
all in one line.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.980
So those four properties of color coded them here a bit of a rainbow.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.130
So rather than having to do transition Dasch property tradition dasht duration and so on we can just

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.140
write transition colon and then pass in for values.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.250
So the first one is transition property.

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.990
So in this case this is saying transition the background have it take one point in five seconds that's

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.780
the duration the timing function you should use is ease in and the delay is one second.

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.790
So you can take four lines and compress them into a single line.

11
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.960
This is a lot easier a lot nicer in my opinion and also way more common.

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.190
The other thing I should point out before we dive into the code is that you can have multiple transitions

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.780
you just string them together with commas.

14
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.250
So rather than doing three or four separate properties and separating them with commas if you go up

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.890
to this example background comma border radius one second Come on second five second comma two second.

16
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.910
You can actually combine them together.

17
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.440
So I'll show you how to do that into a single line.

18
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.040
But let's start with this one.

19
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.710
So we have our animated box as a hover.

20
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.460
Let's actually add a delay just so we're using all four transition delay.

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.220
Let's make it wait one second before it starts.

22
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.490
So now one second goes by then it triggers and moves.

23
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.350
So I could rewrite this entire thing like this transition.

24
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.830
The name of the property which is transform.

25
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.360
Next up we have the duration two seconds.

26
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.960
Then the timing function.

27
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.670
So we could either copy this or all just use is in or the suit is out.

28
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.430
And then after that comes a delay.

29
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.990
So one second so I can now comment these four lines out.

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.910
I've replaced them with this one line.

31
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.640
They're technically not identical because I didn't use this cubic curve.

32
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.170
I'm using E's out instead.

33
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.760
But you could just replace it.

34
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.380
OK.

35
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.030
So let's see what happens.

36
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.100
So I'm going to hover takes one second and then it triggers uses is out over two seconds to transition

37
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.280
the transform.

38
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.920
All right.

39
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.220
So as I mentioned we could have multiple things that we're transitioning.

40
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.640
So let's go back here and not only use transform translate X let's also do background color and let's

41
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.850
make it Teall.

42
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.350
So right now there's no transition affecting background.

43
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.160
So I hover in and immediately turn to Teall but everything else still works.

44
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.610
So now let's say we wanted to add in a transition for that I just add a comma and I'll type background

45
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.090
or background Dasch color.

46
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.430
How long do I want to take.

47
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.620
Let's have it go pretty quick.

48
00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.070
Let's do half a second and then let's also have it use linear and we won't add a delay.

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.680
Let's say I want it to happen immediately.

50
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.590
So we don't always have to have a delay.

51
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.520
Like I mentioned.

52
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.930
So what will happen here is that the backroom color will start changing immediately.

53
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.290
It will only take half a second then it will start moving one second after we've covered.

54
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.280
So essentially we'll have a half a second pause after the background color changes.

55
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.970
So let's try to hover.

56
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.150
It takes half a second.

57
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.680
Changes color and then moves.

58
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.820
I will try one more time.

59
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.100
So it should kick in immediately.

60
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.270
There's no delay for the background color.

61
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.360
So that starts changing right away.

62
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.930
But there's still a transition.

63
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.910
It's not an immediate shift unlike this one here.

64
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.000
And we could keep stringing them together if you wanted.

65
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.840
One thing that I will say is if you do have a lot of these what you'll see commonly is people just use

66
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.390
returns to space them out because it can be kind of a lot of syntax to take a look at.

67
00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.040
So you just add commas to separate them out and you can add as many transitions as you'd like.

68
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.610
All right.

69
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.690
So that's it for now.

70
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.310
That's the shorthand version of transition takes four properties combines them into one.
