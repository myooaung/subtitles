00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.890
Next up we have another pseudo class that's often used to trigger animations which is focus.

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.250
So my little description here is that it triggers when an element receives focus and you have you wondering

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.740
what does that actually mean.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.760
And if you read the docs it doesn't necessarily make it that much clearer but here on M.D and says that

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.020
the focus pseudo class represents an element such as a form input that has received focus.

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.620
It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboards

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.320
tab key.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.960
So there's this idea of something having focus which is not exactly the same as something being clicked

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.130
always.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.990
Which is kind of confusing which I'll get into with an example.

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.840
For now let's let that be.

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.140
So in this example selecting all inputs just like I did with the hover where I did all divs when there

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.670
hovered on this time all inputs or any input that has the focused state.

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.130
So if the user clicks in the input or uses the tab key to navigate to that input showing that it has

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.300
the focus of the page make the text read show that the user is currently using it or they're currently

16
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.050
focused on that input.

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.440
So back in code pen let's add a simple and put it after the paragraph We'll leave it as input type Pickle's

18
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.670
text.

19
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.560
Here we go.

20
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.690
We have a beautiful looking web page.

21
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.130
So this has focus are ready when I click on it.

22
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.770
We're not styling it on our own but by default this is the kind of outline effect you get depending

23
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.560
on the browser you use it might look different but this is the browser default focus style because it's

24
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.510
important to show that something has focus.

25
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.580
Otherwise it's very confusing if you can't see what can put you working with it would make for a very

26
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.640
bad experience.

27
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.400
But we can override that of course.

28
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.050
And we're going to not that we're going to improve it very much in this case.

29
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.090
But when would you input focus.

30
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.380
But do let's make it more obvious let's do background again.

31
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.980
Let's make it green.

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.770
How about Teal.

33
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.230
I like to save.

34
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.180
All right.

35
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.480
So it doesn't have focus and now it has focus.

36
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.710
Now it doesn't.

37
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.760
So that works as I said you could also use the tab key.

38
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.890
So it just hit it.

39
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.560
It's kind of hard to tell.

40
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.210
Now the button has focus.

41
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.070
I'm using the tab key.

42
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.900
Now I'm on the code pen page and I'm cycling through.

43
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.180
So me start over here.

44
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.880
OK.

45
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.780
I just hit it again one more time hit tab.

46
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.000
It has focus so I can do that with tab or clicking.

47
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.110
You'll just have to trust me when I say that I'm using tab and when I go to the button.

48
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.020
This currently has focus as well but nothing's happening to it because we didn't style it.

49
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.860
So let's do that now.

50
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.600
So a select button colon focus.

51
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.660
And let's do two things.

52
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.900
And I can read pretty.

53
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.990
But let's start with the border radius.

54
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.020
So we'll make more rounded corners.

55
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.690
Let's do 10 pixels and then let's also do background color and I'll do a hex this time.

56
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.740
So just showing you.

57
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.210
You know you can stuff this with multiple things that you're changing or styling not just a single background

58
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.740
color of course.

59
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:14.900
So now I can tab over and now that button has focus it's turn green and it's rounded that as soon as

60
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.440
I'd tab away or select something else with focus it goes back to that boring old state until I hover

61
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.320
over it.

62
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.250
And that's pretty much it for focus.

63
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.390
We have one more pseudo class that will take a look at which is active and then we'll move on to actually

64
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.010
making prettier animations.
