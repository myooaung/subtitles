00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.930
All right.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.720
So the next property will take a look at.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.760
It's called a line items and if you read this definition here sounds very very similar to the definition

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.740
for justified content.

5
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:18.030
It says it defines how space is distributed between items in Flex container along the Cross access and

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.990
that's the key of it.

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.260
That's the crux here because just if the content and on line items do the same thing but on a different

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.030
axis so a line items works on the cross axis while justified content allows us to specify the spacing

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.280
how that space is divided and divvied up and spread along the main axis.

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.150
So to put that in visual terms if we take a look our main axis I didn't put it in here but it is going

11
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.900
from left to right.

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.750
And in this case our cross axis goes from top to bottom.

13
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.290
So we'll come back and revisit these exact property are the exact values.

14
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.570
But if you notice these three things are these four things are aligned on the main axis in the center

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.020
but they're not on the center vertically using the cross axis.

16
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.960
Instead they're at the start of the cross axis.

17
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.770
Here's the opposite using a line item so you can send them to the bottom vertically or we can use stretch

18
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.250
which is something we'll see.

19
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.960
It's actually the default value.

20
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.540
They will take up the entire container.

21
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.610
We can center them vertically as well.

22
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.940
And when I say Center them vertically that's only because our Cross access happens to be up and down.

23
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.030
But if they were reversed then we would be centering it horizontally whatever the cross axis is.

24
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.750
And then there's also this one will take a look at called baseline.

25
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.710
OK.

26
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.560
So these slides are here for us a reference but I'm going to do is just go through them now with our

27
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.100
code.

28
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.920
So if you notice I did I got rid of a lot of the extra properties we had.

29
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.100
All we have is display flex right now.

30
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.460
And if you notice vertically these things go all the way up and down they take up the entire container

31
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.070
and that's because the default value for a line items is stretch.

32
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.160
So if I add that in.

33
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.110
Nothing changes takes up the entire container.

34
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.580
As you can see.

35
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.160
So what I want to do is change it.

36
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.200
So let's change it to flex.

37
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.610
Start and you'll see that they move to the top and only take up a minimum amount of space they need

38
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.270
and all that white space is shoved to the bottom.

39
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.660
Remember our main axis is from left to right.

40
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.780
We didn't touch it or cross axis from top to bottom.

41
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.300
So by aligning it to flex start line items works on the cross axis.

42
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.570
So the start is here.

43
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.350
The end just down here.

44
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.940
So that's the result we get.

45
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.050
So those flex and

46
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.460
all the way down there.

47
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.540
Now one thing I want to do very quickly is show you if I change some of these font sizes so everything

48
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.740
is uniform right now.

49
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.240
But if I change some of the font sizes Let's take box to and make that one font size 200 pixels

50
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.190
and let's do the same thing.

51
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.950
Let's do 150 and then let's do box four.

52
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.390
Make it smaller font size 80 pixels maybe.

53
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.460
And then one more which would be Box 8 font size.

54
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.950
That's two hundred and 25 pixels OK.

55
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.010
So we got some different sizes going on.

56
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.390
Actually I mean make went even smaller.

57
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.070
Let's do a box for font size.

58
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.530
Let's go with 50.

59
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.020
OK.

60
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.680
So the reason I'm doing this is to show you how that space is being distributed even though they're

61
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.440
not the exact same size anymore.

62
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.600
It's pushing everything down to the bottom.

63
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.380
Everything is flush with the end of the cross axis.

64
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.520
So if you change that to start the opposite happens.

65
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.750
Perfect.

66
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.970
There are obviously a couple of other things we could do.

67
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.270
Like center.

68
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.860
And so what that does in this case is center them vertically as you can see.

69
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.390
So if we wanted to center them horizontally as well.

70
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.210
Remember that's going to be using justified content because our main access goes from left to right.

71
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.720
So we could do that with justify content center as well.

72
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.770
That looks kind of cool and it centered vertically and horizontally.

73
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.570
Now there's one more possible value that I'm going to talk about which is something called baseline

74
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.560
and what baseline does is it allows us to actually a line item based off of the baseline of the font

75
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.550
to the text.

76
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.010
So I made a little diagram for this one.

77
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.560
Here we have four different things different sizes.

78
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.170
When we align them with baseline we can draw a perfect line even though I made a little bit crooked

79
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.880
and didn't do the best job here but the idea is that these are in line.

80
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.760
So it's actually very handy if you're trying to find these things that are of different sizes different

81
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.460
fonts.

82
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:23.770
So I'll show you that change of line items to baseline and you can see all of this font of the text

83
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.140
is aligned pretty cool.

84
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.240
OK.

85
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.120
So if you feel good about that you feel comfortable with how this works.

86
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.770
The lines across the are it allows us to specify the space distribution across the cross axis.

87
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.740
Go ahead move on.

88
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.260
But I will show you how it works when you're working with columns and reversing things and all of that.

89
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.760
So I'm going to change this back to flex start.

90
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:57.980
And now what I'm going to do is change our flex direction to column and.

91
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.830
And to make this more manageable.

92
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.980
I'll comment some of these out just so that we don't have to keep scrolling to see everything.

93
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.250
Let's work with maybe four of them and well our font sizes are fine for now.

94
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.520
I'll just zoom out to show it all to you.

95
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.030
OK.

96
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:22.760
So now remember our main axis goes from top to bottom and our cross axis goes from left to right.

97
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.360
So the reason they're centered vertically from top to bottom is that we have justified content centering.

98
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.450
So if I comment that out now they're up in the top left corner so we could change has to be flex and

99
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.260
and you'll see they move all the way to the right side.

100
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.030
OK.

101
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.980
So we also have center as we've seen and they're aligned in the center horizontally and if we go back

102
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.350
here change just if I contact to center now it's aligned horizontally and vertically but they're in

103
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.690
a column this time.

104
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.860
OK.

105
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.390
So the other thing that we can do of course is talk about rapping.

106
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.560
So if I add in Flex wrap colon wrap nothing happens right away.

107
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.960
And that's because there's nothing to wrap.

108
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.230
So it's uncomment all this stuff that we commented out.

109
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.840
Now we have two columns different sizes different fonts but they are centered.

110
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.060
We'll learn how to control the space between them by the way just a little bit.

111
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.600
But for now we don't have control over that.

112
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.740
So rather than doing a line item center we can do a flex.

113
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.780
And in this case.

114
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.960
OK.

115
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.630
Or flex.

116
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.870
Start.

117
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.150
You can see it hopefully right now you get the picture what's happening is that when we work with a

118
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.730
column that's wrapping our main axis from top to bottom cross axis from left to right.

119
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.770
And what we're controlling right now is this left to right cross axis.

120
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.470
So by doing Flex start everything starts over here.

121
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:06.080
If I change it back to center we have it centered across the cross axis and I'm really hitting that

122
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.850
a lot.

123
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.580
It's probably driving me crazy but it's important.

124
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:15.200
And if you don't see that if you don't visualize that main axis the cross axis it can be really hard

125
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.840
to understand what the heck is going on.

126
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.460
Where's that space coming from.

127
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.030
OK.

128
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.050
So that wraps it up.

129
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.910
Next we're going to see a similarly named property that allows us to control the space between rows

130
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.320
or columns in this case.
