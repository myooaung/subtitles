Up next is Redux I want to take a second here to mention that redux isn't required for building a re-act

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.690
application as you've seen yourself.

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.790
We've been able to build some fun applications without it.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.090
Read X can be a useful tool because it allows us to keep all of our state in a central place called

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.000
the store.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.150
But many applications do not have enough complexity to necessitate redux in the future.

7
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.910
You'll have to make your own decision to include redux or not well now that we've gotten that warning
