00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.420
Welcome back in this section we're going to master the ins and outs of joining data to HVM out elements

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:14.010
using D-3 in this video will join data to existing page elements and also use D-3 to create new elements

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.940
on the fly.

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.610
In the next video we'll learn how to use D-3 to remove elements that no longer have any data attached

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.600
to them.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.480
We'll also talk about more advanced ways to join data and elements together.

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.760
Finally in the third video we'll talk about updating elements when new data comes in and we'll learn

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.470
about D-3 is general update pattern.

9
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.320
Let's get started.

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.360
We'll begin with basic data joins and enter selection's.

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.200
Before we dive in though let's take a step back and try to get a better understanding of decreased purpose.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.900
If you look at the D-3 Web site the first sentence describing the library says the D-3 JSA is a javascript

13
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.110
library for manipulating documents based on data.

14
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.750
But what exactly does that mean.

15
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.400
Let's take a look.

16
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.650
The biggest difference between interacting with the domino theory versus in vanilla javascript is that

17
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.960
D-3 provides us with a streamlined way to connect elements on the page to some set of underlying data.

18
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.230
This also allows us to more easily alter the look of elements on a page based on this data.

19
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.470
Let's take a look at an example.

20
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.090
As usual we'll begin with some simple issue.

21
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.610
Now this time for a page that displays movie quotes you can copy and paste this code into your favorite

22
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.440
text editor or just head over to the live site and hop into the chrome console.

23
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.960
In our example or storing the data for the quotes inside of our javascript we've got access to the quote

24
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.500
itself.

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.630
On with the movie The quote came from and the movie's release year and rating.

26
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.860
Let's see how we can use D-3 to add these clicks to the page.

27
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.080
The patterns for joining day to day elements and adding those elements to the page can be a little confusing

28
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.920
at first.

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.080
Let's first write out the code check that it works and then talk about what's happening.

30
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.150
Here's some code that styles the list a bit and as the movie quotes to the page

31
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.520
when we run this code we see that it works.

32
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.710
Now let's analyze this code line by line.

33
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.680
First we're using D-3 to select the Snowbird list in or restyling it a bit.

34
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.990
Nothing surprising there.

35
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.590
Things start to get a little weird in the next line we're telling D-3 to select all the list items inside

36
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.050
of the list but there aren't any list items inside of the list.

37
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.690
You might think that D-3 should return something like No from this function call but that's not how

38
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.050
D-3 rolls.

39
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.240
If you look at the return value from this select all we still get a D-3 Selection object.

40
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.790
As you might expect though the selection has no notes.

41
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.970
Let's move on to the next line here we're using the data method and passing an array of quotes.

42
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.650
This is where we're beginning to harness the power of D-3 state of mind.

43
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.800
What we're essentially saying is that we want to take each piece of data in the quotes array and attach

44
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.190
it to a dom element.

45
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.850
In this case NLI still might seem confusing since after all there aren't any allies to attach the data

46
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.740
to.

47
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.270
But if we take a look at the selection returned from that data you'll see that it has two new properties

48
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.380
enter and exit.

49
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.870
Let's focus on enter.

50
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.360
It has an array with five elements.

51
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.620
Each element is an Internet and attached to each node is a double underscore data property with some

52
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.360
movie quote data.

53
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.920
So what's going on here.

54
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.230
Essentially D-3 has created some placeholder notes for us and those nodes are bound to the data.

55
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.820
These elements don't exist anywhere in the dung.

56
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.290
But with a bit more work we can attach these elements to the page D-3 provides us with an entry method

57
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.670
that creates a D-3 selection with those entry nodes.

58
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.970
So that's what we're calling next.

59
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.340
Finally we can use the pen method on our entire selection to place our entire notes onto the page as

60
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.190
list items

61
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.570
in the very last line.

62
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.940
We're setting the text of each list item with the callback function.

63
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.640
This is a pattern we saw in an earlier video.

64
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.280
Now though we can talk more in depth about the structure of the callback when we pass a callback from

65
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.300
one of these methods.

66
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.630
The first parameter in that callback function will always refer to the data bound to the current element

67
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.170
by D-3 by convention.

68
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.210
Your argument is typically called D for data.

69
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.900
Should you need the index of that piece of data in the array of data.

70
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.440
It's made available to you.

71
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.930
The second argument in the callback in our example.

72
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.540
Each element in our quotes array is an object and each object has a quote property.

73
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.110
So by returning the quote inside of the callback degrees accessing the quote property in the data bound

74
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.310
to our new list item and using that data to set the entire text of the element.

75
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.920
This pattern can take some time to get used to but with a little practice you'll get comfortable with

76
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.810
it as it's one of the most common things you'll be doing with D-3.

77
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.520
Now that we know what we're doing let's make a couple other enhancements I'll refresh the page so that

78
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.230
we can start from the beginning this time.

79
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.050
Let's show the movie title in here as well as the quote.

80
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.810
Let's also add a bit more style to the list items.

81
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.600
And let's also make short quotes if you're bigger on the page.

82
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.920
I'll double the font size.

83
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.430
The quote is fewer than 25 characters.

84
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.180
As a side note if you're comfortable with as 2050 era functions a great use case for them is in these

85
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.650
three callbacks aero functions can really help clean up this code making it more compact and readable.

86
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.730
One last thing.

87
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.780
Now that these list items are on the page.

88
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.080
What if we want to select them later once they're in the dome we can select them with D-3 just like

89
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.990
we did in earlier videos.

90
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.740
No need to mess with data joins or enter selections.

91
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.970
Fortunately the list items are still bound to the quote data.

92
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.710
So if we want to style them based on the data we can do that at any point in the future.

93
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.100
To finish up let's colorable list items based on the movie rating.

94
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.420
First of all make an object that converts Raving's to colors.

95
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:28.040
Then also the background color list item based on a movie's rating.

96
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.360
Cool.

97
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.170
Because of the syntax mastering Gaina joins in D-3 takes practice.

98
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.730
Next video will get more practice by learning about exit selections.

99
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.490
I'll see you there.
