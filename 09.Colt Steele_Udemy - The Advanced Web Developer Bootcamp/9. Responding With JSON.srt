1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,960
So this will be a super quick video.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,550
All they want to do is talk about how we respond with Jason.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,920
Our goal here is to build a baseline on API.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,790
So how do we actually respond with Jaison.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:19,080
The answer is pretty simple actually an express resod send is dynamic depending on the content we send.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,410
So if we're passing a string it will render this or respond as h Timo.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,440
But if we pass in a javascript object like let's say the message is.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,970
Hi from J.

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,430
Yes object.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
Something like that and I restarted the server.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,580
I refresh if I go to our slash or route route notice it's treated as Jason.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,230
I have the Chrome extension Jase on view so it makes it a little prettier.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,220
But this is Jason here.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:59,280
So if we provide an object to rest that send it to the Send method it will convert it to a string and

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,150
then send that as japes on.

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:07,890
But there's also a red dot Jay sun method which will do the exact same thing in this case.

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,520
If I restart shouldn't notice any difference.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,320
Yep nothing different.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,790
And that's actually because in the red does send the source code.

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,730
It actually calls presta Jaison.

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:28,260
So send is sort of the parent that in its source code has a check that says OK I passed an object if

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:35,820
I was then pass it down to the J method which in turn I believe calls Jase on that string of phi and

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,570
then responds with Content-Type Jaison.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,620
Anyway so you could use dot sand or dot Jaison.

25
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,760
I like to use Jason because it's more explicit that this is Jason even though it doesn't really matter

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,910
as long as we're passing in in objects like this.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:58,460
The only thing I would add if we passed a string like this rest and this let's do data.

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,620
A bunch of numbers and I send that restart our server.

29
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,360
Notice that it's not treated as Jason and that's because it's not just on it's actually edged him out

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,480
because I use send and send the text strings.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,210
So it assumes that sieged him out.

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,580
But if I passed the exact same thing.

33
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,600
Let me just change this to Jason.

34
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,650
It's a string containing an object.

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,760
But this will treat it as J song it might be hard to tell.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,780
But if we use postman which if you're not familiar with it it's a really nice utility that helps you

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,480
make and inspect requests.

38
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:45,650
So if I send a request right now using redstart Jaison instead of our express app we get content type

39
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,720
is application slash Jaison.

40
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,750
And if I go back and change it back teres does send restart and I send the same request the same you

41
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,160
or I get request this time it says text but each time.

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,190
So bottom line I like to use that Jaison it's more explicit that this is Jason that you're responding

43
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,390
with even if you can get by with send.
