00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.510
All right.

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.320
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.620
So we have our API running back and with Express Mongo node.

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.280
Now we're going to create our re-act front end.

5
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.370
So the first thing we need to do.

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.990
I'm going to make a new tab here we want to keep our server running by the way.

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.520
So we're going to have our backend server.

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.770
We're going to have our mongoose or excuse me or Mungo's server the database and I can make a new terminal

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.380
now and I'm going to create the re-act app and eventually run it here so will have three different things

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.250
going at the same time.

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.020
So I'm going to go into the full stack to do app and now I'm going to run create dash re-act dash app

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.130
and let's call this to use the front end.

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.720
Call it whatever you want but make it different from the Sea-Doo API.

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.750
And of course this takes forever.

15
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.420
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

16
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.430
I'll cut this out.

17
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.590
Oh right.

18
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.600
Twenty years later I'm back.

19
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.330
And our create racked up has created.

20
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.370
It's done.

21
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.860
Now the CD into it.

22
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.200
So that's the to do's front end.

23
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.000
And let's just start off by running NPM start and you might think everything's nice and rosy we should

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.010
get our basic create re-act app starter code or start starter index page.

25
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.330
However there's a small problem.

26
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.440
The problem at least in Cloud 9 is that the default port that it's going to try and use is the same

27
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.330
port that our existing server backend server is using 80 80.

28
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.000
So we get this problem this error.

29
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.040
That's already running on port 80 80.

30
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.260
It's probably.

31
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.310
And it gives that guess what it thinks it is.

32
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.550
This process it gives us the process ID and it asks us if we want to choose another port.

33
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.620
I'm going to say no and it will cancel everything and I'm going to go back over here to our node app

34
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.400
and if we look at the API index J.S. you can see this line here which is setting the port variable equal

35
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.580
to whatever the port is in the process study in an environment variable or by default 3000.

36
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.020
Now on cloud nine ADHD is what process that you need up port is set to automatically.

37
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.540
So again this is really only something you have to pay attention to if you're using Cloud 9.

38
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.380
But it's important to know about what I'm going to do instead is take advantage of the fact that I can

39
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.040
manually set process on invite up port so I could make a file called EMV and set a port variable in

40
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.510
there.

41
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.150
But the other thing I can do is restart the server.

42
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.970
So I'm going to close out of this and I'm just going to type.

43
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.650
Port equals.

44
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.810
And I'm going to do 80 81.

45
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.080
So as long as this matches what I had an index that yes process that port in all caps and I run node

46
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.060
index j yes takes a moment but you'll see that our app is now running on port 80 81.

47
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.620
And in fact if I go back here and I type colon 80 80 we don't have anything anymore.

48
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.920
In the past we did go to 81.

49
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.630
I now get my application.

50
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.010
So nothing is really changed.

51
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.240
We're just using another port but we've freed up port 80 80 for create re-act up.

52
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.860
Now we could do it the other way around.

53
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.610
And it doesn't have to be 80 81 by the way or 80 80 could be 3000 in 80 85.

54
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.970
It really doesn't matter.

55
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.570
But those are kind of standard ones.

56
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.320
So it doesn't matter which way we do it we just need to have two different ports going so we can have

57
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.390
these two apps running at the same time.

58
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.650
They have to be running at the same time.

59
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.010
OK so now let's go back to create re-act up NPM start.

60
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.150
And we shouldn't get that error anymore.

61
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.140
Might take a moment slow starter.

62
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.640
Do you.

63
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.940
OK here we go.

64
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.620
It's now it's on localhost 80.

65
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.550
You can click on this click Open and here is our reactor.

66
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.520
So right now it has nothing to do with our API.

67
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.100
Let me go to slash API slash traduce.

68
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.930
They're not connected in any way.

69
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.420
But we at least have two servers running.

70
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.720
So this is our front end and eventually it will be connected to this.

71
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.060
OK.

72
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.310
So we're up and running there.

73
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.200
And the last thing we'll do with this video is just go into our create react up to do is front and open

74
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.710
up source go into app.

75
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:29.390
And let's just delete most of this stuff in here and I'll just put this is to do app and we'll save

76
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.800
and just make sure it updates OK.

77
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.410
Perfect.

78
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.950
So we now have a blank slate.

79
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.110
We have our app running.

80
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.830
We have the back end running.

81
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.170
Now the real work starts.

82
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.130
So in the next video we're going to define our first component and we're going to get some code showing

83
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.630
on the page.
