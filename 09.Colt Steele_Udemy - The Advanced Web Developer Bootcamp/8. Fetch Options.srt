1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,690
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,920
So this will be a quick video.

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,190
I just want to show you how you can provide options to fetch.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,110
So when you run the Fed method the first thing you always have to provide is that you know that the

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,980
request is going to but Optionally you can include an object here that contains key value pairs for

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,210
the options you want to provide.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,720
So things like method the default of course is get which we've been making without specifying method

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,840
but you can override that or change that to the post.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,190
You can also include things like a request body send some data along.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,600
You don't have to use this Jaison to string a five by the way but this makes it a lot easier.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,230
So you don't have to manually make each of these a string and worry about quotes and double quotes and

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,280
all of that.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,400
The other important thing is we can provide headers so we can specify things manually.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,040
So let me just show you how that works.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,630
We go over to fetch options example I've created.

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,500
It's basically the it's exactly the same code we had from last time.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,600
All it does is make a request to this bitcoin API and then print some of it out and if we monitor it

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,280
right now if I go over to my network and then look at a chart and I refresh the page and I resize this

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,940
a bit we have our fetch.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,660
Made here as you can see no longer next H.R..

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,770
This is coming from code pen by the way.

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,040
So we have our fetch and if we actually look at it like this a little easier for you to see it's a get

23
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,130
by default.

24
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,740
OK.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,390
So all of that just to prove how it works by default.

26
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:42,190
But now if I change it by passing in the Options object and I say method is now post and I save all

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,890
refresh.

28
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,670
The first thing you should know is that this API does not have a post and point.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,640
So it's not going to be happy about me trying to make a post request to this but that doesn't matter

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,960
for our example because we can see here if I look at it it was sent as a post the status code was a

31
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,270
five hundred not good but it was still a post.

32
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,470
OK.

33
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,820
So that's method.

34
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,610
We can also do things like send body along the way a lot of people like to format.

35
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,760
This is like this.

36
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:13,780
So we'll have.

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,280
Body is equal to.

38
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:24,170
And you could just pass in plain data like a string like this is the body the request just like that

39
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,910
and I need to make sure this is still the post because get requests don't have bodies.

40
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,310
Now we do this Refresh will still get an error 500 error.

41
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,560
But if we actually look at the request and I think we have to scroll down to see the body.

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,580
Here we go.

43
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,770
This is the body of the request.

44
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,870
So this is all just an interface for manipulating the request.

45
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,100
We're going to send it as far as Jason docstring ify.

46
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,790
I'll just copy this over to see can see how it's commonly used.

47
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,690
So something like this body.

48
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,050
And then it's equal to adjacent string of phi an object with some strings in it.

49
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,380
And if we look at what sent scroll down you can see it here if we view the actual source.

50
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,800
It's all strings.

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,670
So we didn't have to manually turn that into strings just on that string afraid does that for us.

52
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,000
All right.

53
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,890
So I promise I'd keep this video quick.

54
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:27,020
Let's wrap it up so you can provide an options object containing key value pairs of the various options.

55
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,800
We've seen method and body.

56
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,140
There are more.

57
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,980
Those are probably the most commonly used but there are more.

58
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,850
If we go to M.D and I'll include this page in the resources you can see we can also specify things like

59
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,410
headers so we can manually specify headers and their values or credentials.

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,080
That's pretty commonly used as well if we need credentials for a request but there are other things

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,850
like redirect and refer refer policy signal I don't actually I have no idea what that is but basically

62
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,400
if you want to learn more about these options and the various options that you can provide you can read

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,980
more about them on these docs.

64
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:04,710
OK.

65
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,150
So that wraps up the basics of providing options to refresh your quest.
