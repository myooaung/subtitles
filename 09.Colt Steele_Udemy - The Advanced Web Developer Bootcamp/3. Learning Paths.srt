00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,100
This video I'm going to highlight what we're calling learning paths because our curriculum so massive

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,780
covers so much we thought we should make some shortcuts to get to specific topics.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,200
So you definitely don't have to go through everything at once.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,120
And the first route I'd suggest is the S.M..

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,520
It's the simplest one the shortest one basically just the first three sections.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,880
We talked about the basics of CSSA animations using keyframes as well as transitions.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,900
Then we talked about CSSA lay out with flex fluxbox and then we build that Web site project the entire

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,370
company web site for our fictitious mountain guides.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,130
The next suggestion is what we call the modern JSE guru.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,870
They don't all have cute names like this but this one does.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,020
This is basically a would be focused on picking someone who knows the basics of javascript who really

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,310
wants to get the language down.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,520
So we talk about Asynchronous JavaScript.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,800
You learn the basics of promises but also what's happening behind the scenes with the stack and heap

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,890
and that sort of thing.

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,010
Then we talked about object oriented programming closures the keyword this advanced Array methods testing

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:10,160
with jazzmen and then iest 2015 is Tony 15 part 2 is 20 16 and 17 as well as the guest to password refactor.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,060
So this is all focused on the language itself purely on Javascript.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,180
Next is the D-3 and SPG person.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,550
If that's something that you're interested in getting to data visualization all you really need to focus

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:31,140
on are D-3 in the DOM D-3 data joint an update pattern and working with SPG intermediate D-3 advanced

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,540
graph types and building a data dashboard.

23
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,620
So these six sections would be where you should focus if you only care about D-3 next complete re-act

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,300
path which takes some more time to focus on concepts along the way that will make it easier to learn

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,240
react.

26
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,110
So you can just skip to the content.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,050
But if you don't know some of the key concepts from 2015 like Aero functions then writing re-act might

28
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,930
be a little bit trickier.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,620
It's not impossible but it will be much easier if you start with creating your own base on API section

30
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,950
and you go through single page maps.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,670
It's 2015 up to 16 and 17 and then focus on the Riak content.

32
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,650
So that wraps it up.

33
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,840
We have the complete Riak path the D-3 and SPG person path the modern Jesus guru and they see us as

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
master.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,690
So if none of those appeal to you there's nothing wrong with just going through the course at your own

36
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,130
pace going through all of it.

37
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,280
By all means if you want to do that just cover so much.

38
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,290
We figured we should give people some options.

39
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:28,740
OK.
