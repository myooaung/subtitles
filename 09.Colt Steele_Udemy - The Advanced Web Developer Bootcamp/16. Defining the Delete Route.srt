1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,400
So we almost made it.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,310
We have one more round to define.

4
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,270
This one is a delete route to the same path as the previous two or we have to do id variable in the

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,210
path instead of updating or retrieving information.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,610
We're going to delete that too.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,040
So this is where we would send a request when a user clicks on the trash can or the X button to remove

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,100
it to do for good.

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,510
We would then send a delete request to this you know of course this idea is going to be 5:06 blah blah

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,990
blah a KBG you know what I mean.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,410
The idea itself.

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,340
So we're going to do that and to do that we're going to pop over to cloud nine and define our router

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,150
dot delete and just copy that.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,880
It's going to be the exact same.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,660
So rather than a put or a get to delete request then we need our Goodall's callback here.

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,640
And we can start off with a basic Let's just do a red dot send.

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,160
Ok ok i'll delete something.

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,550
Just make sure we're able to trigger this and to do that.

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,790
We're going to need to use postman again so we can go to the same path we have this idea here but rather

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,160
than a PUT are going to find delete.

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,660
And let's see what happens.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,390
There we go.

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,980
We get ok ok i'll delete something.

24
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,810
So rather than responding with that we need to use DBI to do the magic line is dot remove.

25
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,780
And all we have to do is give it an object that gives it a key and value.

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:32,480
So the key that we want it to remove by it's going to be the ID and the incoming ID is request up harams

27
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,670
dot to do Id.

28
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,800
So whatever this ID is used that to then go find it and delete it.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,370
And then when that's done we're not going to have to do really to send back.

30
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,180
We don't want to do that so we can just rest up and rest.

31
00:01:52,190 --> 00:02:06,580
Jason a message and let's just say message is we deleted it just like that and we'll have to catch that

32
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:13,540
says if there's an error let's send error.

33
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,750
OK.

34
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,340
So let's make sure that this works.

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,830
Restart the server.

36
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,510
Let's send our get request to see all the do's and let's pick one to delete.

37
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,700
Let's get rid of bake croissant.

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,030
I no I'm picking on that one.

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:35,090
Let's take that you are well Senator request as a delete request and it says we deleted it.

40
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,360
Let's go back and do a get.

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,250
I'll just repeat that get request to slash API slash traduce and it's gone.

42
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,950
So we're done.

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,270
It works perfectly.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,410
That's it to delete.

45
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,380
Very simple.

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,450
We now have five functioning routes.

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,970
All that's left to do in the last video is to refactor this a bit so that our main to use file is a

48
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,620
little less cluttered.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,250
We'll actually reduce it down to five or six lines of route code by moving things into a helper.
