00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.250
Welcome back I hope you had fun building your scatterplot in this video.

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.780
I'll walk you through my approach to a solution.

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.980
As you can see my app jast doesn't have much going on as I often do when dealing with SPG.

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.610
Let me start by creating some variables for the width height and padding.

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.110
I think you'll find that most of this code looks really similar to what we saw when we were first learning

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.420
about scatterplot and axes.

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.840
The biggest difference has to do with how I filter my data.

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.470
I'm interested in a relationship between four variables cellular subscribers literacy rate median age

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.890
and urban population rate.

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.270
Therefore if a country doesn't have data on one of these variables I want to remove it from my dataset

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.150
in order to remove incomplete objects from my data set.

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.770
I'll first write a small helper function called must have keys this function will take in an object

13
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.970
and will check whether the object has values for each of the four keys I'm interested in to do this

14
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.420
a loop through my array of keys and check whether the value for that key in my object is null.

15
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.600
If it is I'll return false.

16
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.470
But if the object has non-null values for each of these keys I'll return TRUE cool.

17
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.600
Next I'll use this helper function by calling filter on the region data passing in this helper and storing

18
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.150
the results in a variable called data or data variable will consist only of regions that have data on

19
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.530
each of the four variables.

20
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.380
I'm interested in.

21
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:41.340
It looks like this is working region data has 195 elements in it but data only has 146 elements OK.

22
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.110
Let's keep going.

23
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.430
Next I'll set up my scales as you may remember.

24
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.320
I want to measure literacy rate on the x axis and cell subscribers on the y axis.

25
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.600
So for the x axis I'll create a linear scale inside of the domain.

26
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.920
I'll use D-3 dot extent to find the smallest and largest literacy rates.

27
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.570
Since these values should be mapped to the SPG bounds in the Range method pass in an array.

28
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.100
It starts from padding and goes up to with minus padding r y scale will look pretty similar.

29
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.450
Let me copy and paste the scale.

30
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.820
I'll just need to make a few adjustments.

31
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.350
Most importantly I'll change the variable name then I'll change the key.

32
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.380
I'm interested in inside of the callback to 3Com extent.

33
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.720
Finally I'll change the range so that I'm referencing the height.

34
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.260
I'll also do the same trick we've seen before and flip.

35
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.540
The largest and smallest values so the smallest data point gets mapped to the lowest part of the SPG

36
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.520
as I mentioned before.

37
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.000
I'm also interested in visualizing a couple more variables.

38
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.790
I'll use the radius to visualize the median age and I'll use the fill to visualize the proportion of

39
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.050
a region that lives in an urban area.

40
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.740
So I need two more scales one for each of these variables.

41
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.420
Again these scales will look very similar to the ones we've already made.

42
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.710
We'll need to change the variable names and the callbacks we pass and D-3 that extent will also need

43
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.330
to change the range for the radius scale I'll go from 5 to 30 per the fill scale.

44
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.770
I'll go from green to blue enough with the set up.

45
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.160
Let's plot some circles since I'll need to reference it in a few places.

46
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.350
I'll start by selecting the SPG with D-3 and storing the selection in a variable while I'm here.

47
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.940
I'll set the squeegees width and height next.

48
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.090
Let's apply our common D-3 pattern to add circles to the page from the SPG.

49
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.780
I'll select all circles join my data.

50
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:50.520
Hop into the enter selection append circles and then set attributes for the C-x C.Y. are and fill attributes.

51
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.390
I've already built the scales so I just need to use them inside of the callbacks to after while I'm

52
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.210
here I'll also give each circle a white stroke so that it's easier to spot circles when they overlap.

53
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.130
OK let's refresh the page nice.

54
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.100
There are calls.

55
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.800
We're not finished yet though.

56
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.790
I still need to add some labels and axes.

57
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.850
This pattern should look basically the same as in the earlier video on axes to start.

58
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.330
I'll create a variable called x axis and store three axis as its value.

59
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.870
I'll pass the X scale and the D-3 that access bottom then set the text size it is using text size and

60
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.580
text size outer next I'll do almost the same thing for the y axis.

61
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.260
The only differences are that I'll use the Y scale a left axis and the size will depend on the width

62
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.480
not the height while I'm working on text.

63
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.890
Let me also briefly add a style to the CSSA file so that my grid lines won't just be black lines great.

64
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.510
Now let's append these axes to the page for the X-axis.

65
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.580
I'll grab the SPG append a new group transform it so that it's at the bottom of the SPG and then call

66
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.340
the X axis next.

67
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.160
I'll do something similar for the y axis though I'll need to transform it a bit differently.

68
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.750
OK that's it for the axes.

69
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.440
Lastly let's add some text labels for the x axis.

70
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.760
I'll add a text label.

71
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.260
Move it to the bottom middle of the SPG.

72
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:32.580
Bump it down just a little bit with the D-y attribute Center attacks and add label next for the y axis

73
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.770
or append a text element.

74
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:43.350
Rotate it adjust its location center the element and then add some under-taxed getting the y axis label

75
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.150
in the right position is a little tricky.

76
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.470
So don't worry if this takes a couple of tries.

77
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.200
Lastly I'll add a title once again.

78
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.410
I'll append a text label and place it this time at the top middle of the SPG.

79
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.230
I'll bump up the font size of it and then add a title saving refresh

80
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.650
awesome.

81
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.670
There is my completed scatterplot.

82
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.600
If you're curious about visualizing other relationships feel free to pick a different collection of

83
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.790
variables.

84
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.170
In this case it looks like there's a small positive association between cell subscriptions and literacy

85
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.810
rates.

86
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.260
But it also looks like there's a positive association between literacy rates and median age as well

87
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.870
as literacy rates in urban population.

88
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.210
I can tell that this is true because circles at the right end of the scatterplot tend to be larger and

89
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.040
bluer.

90
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.930
I hope this video is helpful when you're ready.

91
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.420
Let's start learning about histograms together.

92
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.270
I'll see you in the next video.
