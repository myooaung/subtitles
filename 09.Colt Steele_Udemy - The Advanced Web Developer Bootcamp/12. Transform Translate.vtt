00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.960
All right.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.360
So now that we have a high level overview of transform Let's actually dive into some of the functions

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.120
that they talked about.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.770
And the first one we'll talk about is called translate or translation.

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.130
So what this will allow us to do is essentially shift something across the screen up or down left or

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.980
right or any combination of those using x and y coordinates.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.230
So here's an example.

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.890
This will take all divs and shift them over a hundred pixels on the x axis axis.

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.900
In this case translate X there's also translate Y and then there's also just a translate where you can

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.170
pass into values which I'll show all three versions just a moment.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.850
So again transform is a property colon the function.

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.830
And in this case I'm using translate X which will shift this over all divs one hundred pixels to the

13
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.570
right.

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.070
So rather than just trusting me let's hop over to code Penn I have a very simple demo setup.

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.080
I have four paragraphs their styled exactly the same.

16
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.190
Right now they just have a width and height to make them square 50 pixels and then a background color

17
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.670
so we can see them no content inside.

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.840
However I've given two of them classes.

19
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.530
Move right and move down.

20
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.960
They currently don't do anything.

21
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890
There are no corresponding styles but we're about to change that.

22
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.930
So what we'll do is use translate to move this paragraph to the right so we'll select it first.

23
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.250
Well do not move Dasch right.

24
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.960
Or we could have just done move right and we'll start.

25
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.370
Let's change the color.

26
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.140
So it stands out a bit background color.

27
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.150
I gave myself a little cheat sheet appear so I didn't have to remember these.

28
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.450
Not that it matters.

29
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.120
OK.

30
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.520
So this blue one you want to shift to the right.

31
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.280
So we'll use transform colon translate and we'll start with translate X and it's up to us let's say

32
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.420
let's do 100 pixels to make it clear.

33
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.500
And there we go.

34
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.570
It's moved over 100 pixels to the right.

35
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.840
Now I could do a thousand pixels move it far away.

36
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.650
You could do one pixel and just barely shift it.

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.600
But I'll keep it at 100 for now.

38
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.510
I could also do negative like let's do negative 10 and you could see starts to go off the screen.

39
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.540
But it is offset 10 pixels.

40
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.620
OK back to 100.

41
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.410
Let's do the same thing now for move down.

42
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.840
And let me just copy this color again.

43
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:46.100
It's a white background color so this div here at the bottom that yellow orange one will do a transform

44
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.530
and make this a bit bigger.

45
00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:00.120
And rather than doing translate X I'm going to do translate y this time and move it down let's do 20

46
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.260
pixels for now.

47
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.190
And you can see it shifted down.

48
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.930
If I comment this out and save comes back up on comments it moves down.

49
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.860
So that's the basic tip translate.

50
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.650
But I did mention that there's a third variation just regular translate where you pass in two values.

51
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.170
And so we can take a look at that.

52
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.200
Now let's do it with a hover.

53
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.120
So P hover we'll translate things over it.

54
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.460
So we'll do a transform translate and not X or Y you just translate and then let's pass and something

55
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.970
like 20 pixels comma 20 pixels just like that.

56
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.080
So now let's go to this first one here.

57
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.300
You can see I've translated it down and to the right because I did 20 pixels to the right 20 pixels

58
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.140
down x and then y goes.

59
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.580
Same thing here.

60
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.550
And you might notice something a bit odd.

61
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.390
When I do it on the two that have already been translated over it's not moving down to the right and

62
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.400
that's because translite is still working with the same original origin.

63
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.560
So it still is treating our paragraph like it was centered over here.

64
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.710
And so it's moving at 20 pixels down and 20 pixels over from here which should be around there which

65
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.940
is what's happening.

66
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.140
Same thing here.

67
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.750
It's only moving it over 20 pixels because we've already shifted it down 20 pixels.

68
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.010
So there are ways around this.

69
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.210
But the honest truth is that usually you're not translating things like this if you want something to

70
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.650
start out 20 pixels over or 100 pixels over.

71
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.870
You just have it start out there without having to translated translate is usually used in cases like

72
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.380
this.

73
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.050
Even though this is a hideous and it's not even animation.

74
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.250
This is a hideous experience.

75
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.070
Translators usually used when it's triggered.

76
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.700
So something is rotated something is translated over scaled whatever the transform is.

77
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.430
It's not usually happening when the page loads because otherwise you should just have that default state

78
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.350
already initialized there's no reason to have to use transform when there are plenty of other valid

79
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.350
ways of moving things.

80
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.540
So this is really mainly reserved for things like animations hover whatever other states you have.

81
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.190
OK.

82
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.630
So just to wrap up translate the passage in along with transform so we can't just do translate on us

83
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.120
on its own it's part of transform the function.

84
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.730
There's translate X translate Y and then translate which takes X and Y and then that weird little gotcha

85
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:46.270
thing is that if we've already translated something over if we then further translate it still working

86
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.190
with the original origin.

87
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.650
Like I said there is a way around this.

88
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.330
There's a property that allows you to change the origin.

89
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.960
But really the better way of doing it is just putting something where you want it when the page loads

90
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.580
and then translating it from there rather than doing a double translate.

91
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.400
OK so let's translate.

92
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.140
We're going to move on.

93
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.290
Talk about rotate and scale next.
