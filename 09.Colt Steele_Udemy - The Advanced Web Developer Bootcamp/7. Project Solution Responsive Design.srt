00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,140
Welcome back in the last video we finished building our marketing page for mountain travel.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,940
The site looks good on desktop but there are large pieces of the design that don't look great.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,670
When I reduce the screen size in this video we'll finish up this project by using media queries to add

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,290
some more responsive design.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,760
Let's do this piece by piece.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,790
First I'll deal with the general style rules here I'll make just one change.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,360
The sections have a lot of padding on small screens so I'll set a media query for screens that have

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,400
a max width of 800 pixels

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,330
and inside of this query I'll reduce the padding for our sections.

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,550
Next let's deal with the header.

11
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,770
I'll set up another media query here for the same with

12
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,400
on small screens.

13
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll reduce the padding on the header

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,530
and also change the flux direction to column so that the list of links will drop below the mountain

15
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,600
travel text.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,950
I'll also add to the bottom margin on tax so that the links have a little bit of breathing room.

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,030
Let's quickly save and refresh.

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,220
Here's what our NAV looks like now on a smaller screen.

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,020
Now let's move on to the hero area

20
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,020
here.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,950
Reduce the minimum life from 100 B.H. to 600 pixels.

22
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,780
Also reduce the font sizes for the H-1 and H-3

23
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,160
and reduce the size of the button

24
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,340
next.

25
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,230
Let's make the images in our destinations section more response's

26
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:21,410
here I'll add a couple of break points one at eleven hundred pixels and one in eight hundred pixels

27
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,980
per screen smaller than eleven hundred pixels.

28
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,390
I'll grab the large and small list items.

29
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,980
And set the flex basis to 50 percent

30
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,560
on screen smaller than 800 pixels.

31
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,930
I'll set it to 100 percent so that each image will get its own row.

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,810
Let's take a look at this in action on small screens.

33
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,160
I have one image per row

34
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,660
then two images each taking up 50 percent.

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,170
And when the screen is wide enough the small and large classes provide different style rules for the

36
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,600
widths OK let's move on to the package's section

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,420
here again I'll update the fluxed basis for list items in my grid on screens that are narrower than

38
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,570
800 pixels.

39
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,720
I'll set the flex basis to 100 percent and shrink the padding

40
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,640
just a few more sections remaining for the testimonials.

41
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,660
I once again checked against a max width of 800 pixels

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,850
per smaller screens all reduce the font size and the margin for the quotes

43
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:19,970
and I reduced the font size for the author's.

44
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,390
Now let's move on to the form.

45
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,710
This doesn't look great on screen smaller than around 950 pixels.

46
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,880
So here I'll use a media query with a larger max width

47
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,200
per screens narrower than 1000 pixels.

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,810
I'll give the input a flex bases of 100 percent

49
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,440
and I'll remove all margin except the bottom.

50
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,000
Lastly we come to the FOTR

51
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,840
on small screens.

52
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,540
I'll set the fluxed direction to column

53
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:26,040
I'll also send you the text in our p tags and give them some bottom margin.

54
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,800
Finally I'll need to adjust the margin on the social media icons a bit so that they're centered in the

55
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,580
FOTR.

56
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,940
One more time let's save and refresh

57
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:51,280
as you can see this site now looks much better on a narrower screen.

58
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,480
I hope you found this project useful as you can see styling Web sites is much less painful when you're

59
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,450
using Fluxbox when you're ready.

60
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,850
Let's change gears and start learning some javascript.

61
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,250
You'll see him and COPEMAN next section.

62
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,210
I'll see you again when you get to D-3.

63
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,300
Have fun and I'll see you soon.
