00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,650
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:07,170
In this video will quickly recap what we've learned over the past couple videos we can easily create

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,920
constructor functions and prototype methods using the class keyword.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,900
But just remember that the class keyword is an abstraction of using functions and objects.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,650
Yes 22:18 does not add any built in support for classes under the hood.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,180
We're still using all the same tools we saw with yes 5 constructor functions and prototypes to add class

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,860
methods with yes 2015.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,630
We do not place them directly on the constructor.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,890
We use the static keyword and to implement inheritance we use the extends keyword and use super to invoke

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,400
methods by the same name in the parent class.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,270
Finally all the yes 20:15 class syntax we've seen is an abstraction of using functions and objects.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,500
There are quite a few people in the javascript community who do not strongly endorsed these new features

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,040
because of the abstraction.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,820
But you will see the Klasky keyword quite frequently in frameworks like re-act angular and much more.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,430
Thanks again for watching these videos.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,830
Looking forward to each of you some more.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,580
Yes 2015.
