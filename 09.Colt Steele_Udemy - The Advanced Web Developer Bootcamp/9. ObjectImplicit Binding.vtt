00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.990
Now that we have a good idea of how the first rule works when the keyword this is outside of a declared

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.990
object.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.190
Let's see what happens when the keyword this is inside of a declared object.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.260
The second rule which we call the implicit or object binding states that when the keyword this is found

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.140
inside of a declared object the value of the keyword this will always be the closest parent object.

6
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.250
Let's see what we mean by that by looking at the code on the slide.

7
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
Here we have a Person object with the keys of first name.

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.110
Say hi and determine context.

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.700
Let's start with the say hi method inside of this function we are returning the value of the string.

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.410
Hi concatenated the value of the first name property on the keyword this since we see that the keyword

11
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.300
this is inside of a declared object.

12
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.250
We look at the closes parent object to figure out what the keyword this refers to.

13
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.680
You can see that the closest parent object is the person variable which means that the keyword this

14
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.290
refers to the person object.

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.010
Now let's examine the determine context method.

16
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.710
This function should return.

17
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.770
Sure false.

18
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.180
Notice we're using triple equals which will always evaluate to a boolean.

19
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.310
What do you think this function will return.

20
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.750
Think about where you see the key word.

21
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.450
This is it inside or outside of a declared object and is there a function that is creating a keyword.

22
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.260
This we see that the keyword this is inside of the person object which means that it should be that

23
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.320
person object.

24
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.440
So this expression should evaluate to true before moving on.

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.090
Take a second to review this code and try putting it in the chrome console or text editor to see exactly

26
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.880
what's happening before we continue.

27
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.370
Check your progress with this next exercise.

28
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.820
Even the code here.

29
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.220
What should the key word this refer to inside of the person object.

30
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120
Take a second and pause the video if you'd like.

31
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.600
The answer is actually the window but why.

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.920
Remember that a keyword this is defined when a function is invoked.

33
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.470
Since there is not a function being run here to create a new value of the keyword this value of the

34
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.020
keyword this will still be the global object.

35
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.510
Now we said in our definition that the value of the keyword.

36
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.280
This will always be the closest parent object.

37
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.650
Let's see how things get a bit tricky with nested objects.

38
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.460
Now let's walk through some more complex code.

39
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.760
Here we have a nested object we see here that we have a person variable this time the first name property

40
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.720
is called.

41
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.170
Once again we have a say hi method to determine context method.

42
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.610
Take a second and think about what those functions will return when they're invoked.

43
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.390
Now notice we have an additional key in this person object called dog.

44
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.350
The value of the dog key is actually another object.

45
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.840
So let's examine the nested object inside of the dog object.

46
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.900
We have a key of say hello which is a function that returns the string Hello concatenated with the value

47
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.960
of the first name property on the keyword.

48
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.630
This using the tools for determining the value of the keyword.

49
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.870
This calls the video and try to figure out what the value of the keyword this is.

50
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.320
So what did you come up with inside of the say hello function.

51
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.490
What does the key word this refer to the person object the dog object.

52
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.110
Or maybe even the global object.

53
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.480
Well let's go back to our first rule which states that if the keyword this is not inside of a declared

54
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.600
object it will be the global object.

55
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.690
However in this case we see that the keyword this is inside of a declared object called Person.

56
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.250
So we move on to the second rule.

57
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.710
The implicit binding the implicit binding states that the value of the keyword.

58
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.360
This will always be the closest parent object.

59
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.120
This is where things get a bit tricky even though the declared object is person.

60
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.780
There is an object inside Cobbe dog which is the closest parent object to the say hello method.

61
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.100
Now that we know that the keyword this inside of the say hello method refers to the dog object.

62
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.740
What is the value of this stuff.

63
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.340
First name since the dog object does not have a key or first name.

64
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.350
The value will be undefined.

65
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.280
So when we invoke the say hello method by typing in person that D'Agata say hello you can see your returns.

66
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.030
Hello undefined.

67
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.990
We can also see that our determined contacts function is returning false because inside of the dog object

68
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.510
the key word just does not refer to the person object anymore.

69
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.800
So how can we fix this.

70
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.780
What if we want our say hello method to return Hello Colt instead of hello.

71
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.620
Undefined we would need some way of explicitly changing the value of the keyword.

72
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.230
This and that is exactly what the call apply.

73
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.370
Combine functions do for us in the next video.

74
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.230
We'll see the third rule for determining the value of the keyword this using call apply and bind.

75
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.510
Things are getting exciting.

76
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.750
See you in the next video.
