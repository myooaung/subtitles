00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.780
Welcome back I hope you enjoyed this.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.720
SVGA drawing exercise in this video I'll build four flags from scratch will get pretty close approximations

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.510
to the flag designs for four countries the Bahamas Jamaica Macedonia and South Korea.

4
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.690
I've done a little bit of set up already.

5
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.970
As you can see I've got four SVGA in this code and each one with an ID that identifies the country.

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.690
I've also used the ID to set width and height for each flag.

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.380
Most of these flags have a 2 to 1 ratio except for South Korea which has a 3 to 2 ratio.

8
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.240
I'll start with the more straightforward flags and work my way up to the more complex.

9
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.730
First let's tackle the Bahamas.

10
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.690
I could do this by drawing three rectangles in a triangle but to make things a little simpler.

11
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.010
Instead set a background color on the SPG which is the same as the blue color on the flag.

12
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.730
This way I only need two shapes a rectangle and a triangle for the rectangle.

13
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:11.580
All these are recked elements and set the following attributes x y with height and fail for the triangle.

14
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370
I'll use a polygon.

15
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.920
Here I'll just declare the points any one in the top left corner one in the middle and one in the bottom

16
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.650
left corner.

17
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.140
The default is black so I don't need to Cetaphil here.

18
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.770
Cool let's move on to Jamaica.

19
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.660
I've used the same background color trick here but I'll set it to black for the green and yellow parts

20
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.380
of the flag.

21
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.230
I could create a bunch of different polygon or patho elements but instead I'll just create two one for

22
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.920
each green triangle to add the yellow part of the flag.

23
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.520
I'll set a stroke and stroke width on the polygons since both polygons will have the same color styles.

24
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.150
I'll create a group and set stroke stroke with infill attributes at the group level.

25
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.240
Inside of my group I'll create a polygon for the top triangle.

26
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.760
Note that if I put the corners of the triangle at the corners of the Viji the yellow stroke also applies

27
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.700
to the top.

28
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.700
I don't want to fix this.

29
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.000
I'll back up the top corners so that they fall outside the bounds of the SPG.

30
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.760
Now I can do something similar for the bottom triangle just with different y coordinates OK.

31
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.720
Next for Macedonia.

32
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.370
I'll set the background color to this red shade and then I'll create a group whose bill is this yellow

33
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.230
color to get the rays coming out of the circle.

34
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:45.580
I'll just make four polygons one for each diagonal one for the vertical raise and one for the horizontal

35
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.210
ones.

36
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.630
I had to play around a bit with these coordinates to get the flag looking right so don't worry if this

37
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.430
takes a guess.

38
00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.900
Check next I'll place the circle in the middle of the flag and give it a read stroke so that the rays

39
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.710
are separated from the circle.

40
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.210
Onwards to the last flag.

41
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.310
This one is definitely a little trick.

42
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.310
First let me focus on the black bars to draw them I'll create a group and set stroke stroke with and

43
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.590
transform attributes.

44
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.590
Ungroup I'm transforming to the center of the SVGA because I'm going to create these lines vertically

45
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.370
and then rotate them and I want to be sure I rotate about the center of the Viji not the origin which

46
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.810
is in the upper left corner.

47
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.250
So that I can practice with paths.

48
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.880
Let me use patho elements for most of this.

49
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.040
First I'll draw the three lines at the upper left in the six lines and the bottom right of the flag

50
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.380
for the solid lines on the left.

51
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.490
Move the cursor.

52
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.470
Draw a vertical line down.

53
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.420
Move over.

54
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.060
Draw a vertical line up.

55
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.490
Move over again and draw another vertical line down.

56
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.540
Then move over to the other side of the SVGA take a similar approach but this time only to draw a short

57
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.430
line down.

58
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.910
Move the cursor down a bit.

59
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.540
Try another short line down.

60
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.210
Move the cursor over a bit and so on.

61
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.360
So that I don't need to keep track of absolute coordinates.

62
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.210
I'm using lower case letters for the bulk of this command.

63
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.120
This looks pretty good.

64
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.140
So now let me rotate it.

65
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.830
Great.

66
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.360
Next.

67
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.640
Do something very similar for the second set of lines.

68
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.340
I just need to adjust where the solid lines and dashed lines are.

69
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.630
Once I've got this I'll rotate in the opposite direction.

70
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.310
Cool.

71
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.520
Now I need to do is put the circle in the center.

72
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.750
I'll use three different elements to do this.

73
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.930
But if you're awesome at SVGA paths you can do it with fewer elements.

74
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.590
First I'll just draw a red circle in the middle.

75
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.680
Next I'll draw a blue arc to get part of the lower half of the blue area.

76
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.730
I'll just guess and check until I find the right mark from the endpoint of this blue arc.

77
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.880
I'll draw a second arc to the tail of the blue shape once again using guess and check until I get something

78
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.630
that looks reasonable like before.

79
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.320
I'm using lower case letters so that I don't have to calculate the absolute position of these coordinates.

80
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.760
This is getting closer but now my blue area is too big.

81
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:29.210
So I'll make one more element Redpath to cover the extra area I created with my blue pass.

82
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.550
I'll start by creating an arc for the head of the red area and then create one more arc to cover up

83
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.670
the rest of the unnecessary blue.

84
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.650
That's it.

85
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.400
These are our four flags.

86
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.520
Again there are many different ways we could have done this with SVGA.

87
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.810
This video just highlights a few approaches.

88
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.450
I hope this was helpful when you ready.

89
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.180
Let's move on and talk about integrating SVGA with D-3.
