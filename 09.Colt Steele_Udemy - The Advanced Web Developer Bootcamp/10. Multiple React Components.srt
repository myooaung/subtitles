1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,880
Now we're going to add a little bit of complexity to what we've done so far.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,870
So everything we've talked about up until now has just been one single reac component but in practice

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,320
you're right many components and you use those components to create other components.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,820
And this video will have two objectives.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,860
First will render an array of jazz acts.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,590
And then after that we'll refactor it a bit to use a react component inside of another component.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,210
So let's get to some code.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,610
Here's our component from last time.

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,390
Remember it's a pet component.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,920
It's got a div our name Moxey here a picture of Moxey and then a list of her hobbies.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,120
So if we take a look it looks like this.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,170
So you've got some styling and some classes to make it look a little nicer than before.

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,210
But let's do another refactor now.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,010
Let's see if we have a variable number of hobbies down here.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,590
We don't want to have to list them out by hand.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,490
So one thing we can do is we can create a javascript array

17
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,980
and now we've got three things in that array instead of two.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,150
Now we can use curly brackets inside of our GSX to render this array into GSX Elyse.

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,480
So let's change this.

20
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:36,050
To be hobby's dot map in our map callback will transform these strings into GSX elements.

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,980
So I'll start out with H.

22
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:52,730
That'll be the string for my hobby and then I want to return an ally that renders H.

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,830
And I also don't want to forget about my style so my style here as well.

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,680
All right so if I move these.

25
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,730
Now I have three hobbies instead of two sleeping eating and curling.

26
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:18,550
But if we look in the consul will see that we have a warning here that tells us that we need a unique

27
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,720
key prop for each child an array iterator.

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,670
This is happening because of the map that we're using mapper turns an array.

29
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:32,650
Anytime you render an array and react you need to give each element a unique key which is important

30
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,420
for reacts rendering.

31
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,820
So let's add in that key and the key should be a unique number that has something to do with the data

32
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,880
that we're displaying.

33
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,880
Unfortunately we don't have a great unique number right now.

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,650
So I'm just going to use the index in the array and that's not really a great unique key because if

35
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:00,460
the array ever changes and we lose an element or add element that ID that index could change.

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,010
But in this case our arrays never changing so the index will be OK.

37
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:17,610
Now as you can see the air goes away and we still have our list here.

38
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,150
Now we've successfully rendered a list of GSX components for our next task.

39
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,670
We're going to refactor this to use two components instead of one.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,840
So will simplify the pet component and add a new component that the pet component uses will start by

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,390
creating our new component up above and I'll call it a hobby list.

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,900
It's going to extend re-act component

43
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,720
and just like other component will need a render method.

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,470
Now I want this component to take care of the rendering of that hobby list.

45
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:00,670
So first grab this array from the pet and put it here.

46
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:11,770
And next I'll take this code and use that as our render.

47
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,010
And I want to return that GSX

48
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,590
just format that a little nicer.

49
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,150
OK so now we have two components are hobby list and our pet.

50
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,070
But so far the pet doesn't actually render the hobby list.

51
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,850
So how do we get that Javie list to be rendered inside of our pet again.

52
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:44,140
Well we just use the GSX component so it's called Javie list up here.

53
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:51,370
I can just put a hobby list right inside this component and this is really the power of reacts.

54
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,300
We are composing more complicated component.

55
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,210
In this case the component out of a simple component the simple component being the Havi list.

56
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,850
So this is what we'll do throughout the course we'll use multiple components to build up something larger

57
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,010
and larger.

58
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,620
And let's take a look at this in action one more time.

59
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,340
It looks like I've got an error here so let's debug.

60
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,850
Ah ok so style is not defined.

61
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:30,240
I made a mistake so inside this else we were still using the style but it's not defined in this component.

62
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,380
So I also need to grab style out of here.

63
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,910
And use that one in here.

64
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,680
Also So now with that change.

65
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,810
Yep my components working and the errors are gone.

66
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,690
That's all we've rendered a list of GSX elements and we've used two different components to compose

67
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,040
our app.

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,480
Next up we'll be looking into something called prop's which makes our components more customizable.
