1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,690
OK.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,750
Next up we're going to get our to do's to accurately reflect their completion status if they're done

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,490
or not.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,670
So if completed is true we want them to have strikethrough and a grey out applied automatically and

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,720
have actually created a class for that.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,550
I just called it done.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:27,000
So we want to conditionally apply that class done if the to do is completed so we can actually just

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:33,610
add in an IF statement to say if new to do got completed.

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,720
So if that's true by default it's false.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,260
So every new to do is false but if it is completed then and we could do this on a single line but this

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,390
isn't very long so do it on a second line.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,160
We're going to new to do that add the class done.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,250
So that's only if it's completed.

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:02,690
And before that let me actually go in here and add in to do completed as well.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,190
Let's refresh our page and you can see they're all currently falsified she is false she's false but

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,580
she's falsified she's False her car false.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,060
So we actually can't see anything.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,380
So let's remedy that.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,350
Let's take this first bite.

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,390
She's going to go to postman ascend to get request to get all the recent dues you know to take you out

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,010
here or that Id paste it in.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,170
You only need to do this if you don't have any to do set or marked completed.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,090
And we're going to do a put request in the body we're going to instead of doing name or mood we're going

24
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,840
to do completed and set that to true because right now it's false.

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,030
Send that and you can see we get it back it says completed is true.

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,570
If we do a get request Well let's do or get request to slash API I-Slash to do it.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,460
We have one that is now completed.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,290
Let's take a look and if we refresh our page you can see now we have true showing up but we're not getting

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,560
the strikethrough that we want and that's because of a silly mistake.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,930
If we look here I'm referencing if new to do is completed but new to do is what we've created here.

31
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,560
So it doesn't have anything to do with completed.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,250
It's just an ally.

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:23,150
So we want to do that completed which is for each part of data for each thing in the array.

34
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,450
We're calling it to do so to do that completed that should do the trick for us.

35
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,830
And there we go.

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,080
So things are loading correctly as refresh the page.

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,110
We get data from the very beginning if things are completed they are reflected here.

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,330
So we'll get to the updating them so that we can click to toggle that status to send an update request

39
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,740
in a future video.

40
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,510
Next we're going to focus on actually creating new to.
