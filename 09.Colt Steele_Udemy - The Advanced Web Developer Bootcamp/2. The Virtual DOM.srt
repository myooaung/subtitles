00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,840
Before we get into events and react let's take a step back and talk a little bit about the virtual Dom.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,200
So the objectives for this section are going to be to describe the virtual Dom define a synthetic event

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,520
and describe changes that are happening in the new version of react react 16 so the virtual d'armes

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,750
the data structure stored by re-act that tracks changes from one render state to the next render state.

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,490
And if something is changed from one renders the next the browsers Dom will be updated.

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,140
So essentially what this means is that Riak keeps track of all the changes you make when set state is

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:46,440
called and then it decides how to change the DOM based on what happens to the virtual Dom.

8
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,610
So the process of reconciliation sort of in a visual way looks like this.

9
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,590
Let's say we have an app and inside of that app component we have three instr. components.

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,020
Now some said State happens and let's say we remove one of the instructors.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,450
So after that remove all the virtual Dom will get change from the version on the left to the version

12
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,330
on the right.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,920
And because of that change there's a component in the actual Dom the browser's Dom that needs to be

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:25,470
taken out so that re-act component needs to be unmounted that process to figure out what changes happened

15
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,040
and what what needs to be updated and the DOM is called reconciliation and reconciliation is one of

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,490
the awesome features of react.

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,450
You don't have to worry about the details of updating the dog every time you want change something you

18
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,900
just describe the changes you want to make in a declarative way.

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,410
So you go from one state to another state and then react figures out how to make those changes happen

20
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:57,140
in the DOM re-act also provides the concept of synthetic events and synthetic events are similar to

21
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,450
browser events all the same synthetic events exist as made of browser events.

22
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,940
But the main difference with synthetic events and browser events are that the synthetic event API is

23
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:14,300
the same across any browser synthetic event essentially smooths out all those API differences and makes

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,810
it one uniform API.

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,480
Now if you want access to the native event you can still get that.

26
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,090
But I've never had to do that in code so I don't think it will be high on your priority list.

27
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,100
OK so let's talk a little bit about reac 16.

28
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:36,250
The update is known as fiber because that's the name for the new reconciliation engine that's coming

29
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,980
in re-act 16.

30
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,080
So there's a couple user visible features in re-act 16.

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,370
One of them which I think is pretty nice is the ability to return GSX elements as an array or as just

32
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,960
a string from a random method.

33
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,620
So in this example below there's a render method and typically in re-act 15 and before you can do this

34
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,100
you couldn't return an array of multiple elements you always had to return one high level component

35
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,440
and then put all your components inside that and oftentimes what you ended up having to do is create

36
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:18,300
extra wrappers just to make a certain render work but no longer and re-act 16 you can now return arrays

37
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,930
Another new feature and re-act 16 is this air boundary feature.

38
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:33,550
Dan AdMob the creator of redux and now an employee at Facebook created a blog post about air boundaries

39
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,830
which is a new feature and we act 16 I would say read that it will do a much better job of explaining

40
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,970
it than I would.

41
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:47,460
It looks like this so you can isolate components in your application with an air boundary and definitely

42
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,890
read up more on that in this blog post.

43
00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:00,440
Lastly I want to say re-act 16 includes fiber and fiber is the new reconciliation engine in react now.

44
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:07,050
There won't be many API level changes because of fiber so the majority of re-act is exactly the same

45
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,940
between 15 and 16 as far as the API is concerned.

46
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,310
But there are some really cool new abilities that Riak now has because of the fiber rendering engine.

47
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,870
So I would I would suggest watching this YouTube video to learn more about that than Clark has a great

48
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:31,520
talk at the last reac come about fiber and I think its a really approachable toxo definitely worth checking

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,990
out.

50
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,320
That's it for this one.

51
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,820
Next up we'll talk about events.
