00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,940
Welcome back in this section we're going to continue learning about 2015 and we're going to go over

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,970
a concept known as destructuring and see how to structure objects and then the next video the structure

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,450
arrays the word destructuring may sound a bit weird.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,030
So let's define it.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,100
Destructuring is the idea of extracting values from data stored in objects and arrays.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,990
Let's see what we mean by that first examining when this might be useful.

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,280
You can see here that we have an object called constructor with the keys a first name and last name.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,510
If we wanted to create a variable called first name and assign it to the value of the first name property

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,570
on the instructor object and do the same for a last name variable.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,650
Here's what that might look like.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,010
What we're doing here is extracting values from data stored in objects.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,200
This process is quite a bit tedious and only gets worse as we have more nested objects.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:01,250
Restructuring allows us to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,330
The code here might look a bit strange at first.

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,920
So don't be too intimidated.

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,970
This is a really helpful addition to javascript.

17
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,520
Over here we have the same object as before but notice our variable declaration of first name and last

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,340
name.

19
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,660
Left hand side of the equal sign is wrapped in an object.

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,150
What we're doing here is creating two variables.

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,920
First name and last name which are the structure or unpacked from the instructor object.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,640
If we take a look at first name and last name we can see they are the same as before.

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,630
Now the catch here is that we have to name our variables the same exact names as the keys in the object

24
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,930
we are destructuring.

25
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,700
What happens if we want to make different variable names.

26
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,640
No problem.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,420
You can simply add a colon and a new variable name.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,490
You can see here that we have now made two variables.

29
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,090
First and last a destructuring instructor objects.

30
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,710
Now let's take a look at a more complex example of one destructuring really helps in this example.

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,050
We have a function called create instructor which accepts a single parameter called options inside of

32
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,770
this function.

33
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,990
We're checking to see if a value for the options parameter was passed in and if not we're signing it

34
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,330
to an empty object.

35
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,250
We're then creating a few variables called name and is hilarious.

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,870
Which are either values inside and the options object or default values that will make finally or returning

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,050
an array of values.

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,790
The first property can last property on the name object and the value of the IS HILARIOUS variable.

39
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,160
If we invoke this function a few different ways we will see that we can get some default values and

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,960
if we pass in our own options we can modify the output of the function.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,100
Now let's see how this can be refactored using destructuring.

42
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,350
This is going to look quite strange at first.

43
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,520
Let's try to walk through it piece by piece.

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,410
What we are doing here is passing in a deep structured object as a parameter to a function and specifying

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,960
the keys of name and is hilarious with default values at the end of the parameter.

46
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,170
We're assigning the whole thing to be an empty object so that as 2015 knows that our default parameter

47
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,960
is a structured object.

48
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,860
If nothing is passed in we default to the structure object as the parameter.

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,190
To recap we're passing in a structured object as the default parameter where assigning as the default

50
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,890
value an empty object.

51
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,900
So that 20:15 knows we are restructuring an object.

52
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,290
If nothing is passed in we default to the structure object as the parameter.

53
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,840
Now let's take a look at another useful case where we can restructure objects and pass in fields or

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,610
keys in an object as parameters in S-5 if we wanted to display properties from an object we can pass

55
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,210
that object in as a parameter and return some values.

56
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,500
Here's what that might look like.

57
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,710
So how can the structuring help if you know the names of the keys that you will be using from a single

58
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,670
object.

59
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,260
You can be structure those keys as parameters.

60
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,070
Here we have a function called display info which accepts an object with bickies of name and fame color.

61
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,420
If we create an object with the keys of name and fame color we can invoke this function and restructure

62
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,450
the instructor object you'll see object restructuring quite a bit in popular frameworks and libraries

63
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:23,390
like react and angular to since it's a very useful way of unpacking values from objects and even nested

64
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,460
objects.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,010
Destructuring is not the most intuitive concept.

66
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,730
He is 2015 and it takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it in the next video.

67
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,260
We'll see how to structure arrays and then we'll practice a bit more with destructuring.

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,500
See you in the next video.
