00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,160
Welcome back in the next couple of videos we're going to continue learning about 2016 and 17.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,390
Fortunately these new additions to the language are much smaller than as 2015.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:19,800
We're first going to examine two new features and yes 2016 will then talk about 2017 by introducing

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,590
new string methods and one of the most impressive features of 20:17 async functions.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,730
Finally I'll talk about some new features that are coming to javascript soon.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,960
First let's talk about 2016 and two very small features that it gives us thankfully yes 2016 is much

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,820
much smaller than 2015 so there are only two main additions to the language.

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,110
Let's learn about the first one.

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,060
The exponentiation operator in quite a few other languages.

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,020
There exists an operator to figure out the value of one number to the power of another for 2016.

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,220
This was done using math not power.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,850
But now we can use a handy operator with two asterisks.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,890
Let's see what that looks like here.

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,800
We're simply using two asterisks instead of not but how it's a more concise way to calculate a value

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,090
if we'd like.

16
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,790
We can also use the exponentiation operator along with an equal sign similar to the way that we do.

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,070
Plus equals minus equals and many more.

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,760
Anytime you find yourself using math DePauw refactor it with the 2016 exponentiation operator the second

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,150
helpful feature is something you might have already been using without knowing it's part of 2016.

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,970
In 2015 we saw that strings now have a method called includes which returns true if the value passed

21
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,960
to it is included in the string otherwise it returns false.

22
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,020
In 2016 arrays now have an includes method as well which is an excellent replacement for using index

23
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,480
of to see if a value exists inside of an array.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,520
It works just the same way as string dot includes.

25
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,890
We can go from using index of and a comparison operator like greater than or triple equals to using

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,140
a method that directly returns a boolean.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,010
If you find yourself needing to see if a value exists in an array you can now use includes And that's

28
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,970
all we have for 2016.

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,740
I hope that wasn't too underwhelming.

30
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:20,210
After everything we saw earlier but remember the time difference between 5 and yes 2015 was almost six

31
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,900
years.

32
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,100
So they had a lot more catching up to do.

33
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,480
Now that you've seen these two features to yes 2016 let's learn a little bit more about 2017 and practice

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,560
with some exercise.

35
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,890
See you in the next video.
