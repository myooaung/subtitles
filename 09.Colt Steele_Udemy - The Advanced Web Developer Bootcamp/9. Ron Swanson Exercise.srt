00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,230
So we've now seen four different ways of sending requests with javascript.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,990
We started out with the essay.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,520
Then we moved down to fetch then we saw Jay Querrey and we finally saw X-post.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,390
Now we have a quick little exercise where you'll be able to compare the syntax by writing a request

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,650
for different ways.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,790
So this is a starter code you're going to make a Ron Swanson quote generator.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,380
If you don't know who Ron Swanson is that's not necessary to complete this exercise.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,430
He's a character on a TV show called Parks and Recreation.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,170
Apologize if you are not familiar with it.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,500
Here's his Wikipedia page if you care to read it.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,290
He has a bit of a cult following.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,670
He's crazy hyper masculine he loves meat woodworking hunting whiskey and breakfast foods.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,440
So he has some funny quotes in the show.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,720
That's all that really matters.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,000
And actually that doesn't even matter what really matters is that there's a free API that we can use.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,570
So this the API here include the link in the starter code and as well as as a resource with the video.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,190
But every time we request this we get a different quote OK.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,110
So what you're going to do there are four buttons here.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,120
One for X H.R. one for each one project query and one for X..

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,690
I'd like you to just write the same request for different ways.

21
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,270
And if you don't care to do it then just do the actio side of things and compare that to the H.R. if

22
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,240
you feel good about S.J. query Don't worry about making your code efficient refactoring it.

23
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,290
It's not you know this is not a very typical use case where you'd have four different ways of writing

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,440
the same request especially including two libraries like Jay queery Natsios.

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,130
It doesn't make a lot of sense but it's an exercise so hang in there you'll need to include J Crew yourself

26
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,820
and include Acciona as well and then write those for requests.

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,160
There are four different buttons.

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,040
Each one has an ID so you can select it easily.

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,010
So try it out.

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,140
And when you're done it should work like this.

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,510
We click one of these and see.

32
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,670
Give a man a fish and feed him for a day.

33
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,620
Don't Teach a man to fish and feed yourself.

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,750
He's a grown man and fishing is not that hard.

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,710
Very funny Ron.

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,890
Very very funny.

37
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,570
So I only have the actually close button hooked up right now as an example.

38
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,530
But all four of these should work by the time you're done with it.

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,990
And then I'll have a solution video.
