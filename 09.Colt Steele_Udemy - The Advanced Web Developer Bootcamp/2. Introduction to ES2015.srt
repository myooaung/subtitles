00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,550
In this section we're going to talk about 2015 and quite a few of the new additions that it brings to

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,990
the javascript language.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,460
We'll understand what 2015 is and how the term came to be.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,820
We'll refactor code to use LET and Konst and template strings to avoid concatenation.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,480
Then add erro functions to write less code and see object enhancements to write cleaner code.

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,450
We'll discuss a new kind of loop and explain what default parameters are and then we'll learn about

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,760
rest and spread and how to unpack values from arrays and objects using a technique called the structure.

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:41,080
Before we dive in let's quickly recap what exactly yes means and dispel some confusion around some of

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,020
the many terms that there are in order to do that we need to go back to 1995.

10
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,540
Back in 1995 Brendan Eich of Netscape was tasked with writing a programming language for the browser

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,150
that was initially named Mogae later live scripts and finally javascript at that time.

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,630
There was another browser competitor Internet Explorer which was built by Microsoft in order to compete

13
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,580
with Netscape Microsoft reverse engineered Brendan.

14
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,290
Ice language and named a js script since there were now two different languages for different browsers.

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,860
It became difficult to build applications for both.

16
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,300
So Brendan like looked for an organization to help standardize the language to stop this problem.

17
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:28,750
And in 1996 the European Computer manufacturers association or eczema was brought on to help standardize

18
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,190
the language.

19
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,700
In 1997 the first version of ECMAScript called Yes one was released and implemented in browsers and

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,700
as the language grew.

21
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,810
Yes two and yes three were released in 1998 and 1999.

22
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,490
Yes.

23
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:49,750
Four never ended up being released and in 2009 a large update to the language was added with S-5 in

24
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,880
June of 2015.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,620
Another large update to the language came with ESX but since the popularity of javascript was growing

26
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:03,130
so much the TC 39 which is the committee votes to add new features into the language decided that they

27
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,780
would be releasing new changes every year so they renamed ESX to 2015.

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,200
And since then every year new features have been added and will continue to be added to the language

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,680
in this section.

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,730
We're going to start learning about 2015 and then explore new features to the language with as 2016

31
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,580
and 2017 in the following section.

32
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,920
These features are commonplace in more modern code bases and frameworks and libraries like react and

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,040
angular too.

34
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,560
We can see that as 2015 gives us quite a bit of enhancements but don't be too intimidated by this list.

35
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,450
By the end of the next two sections you're going to know what all of these things are.

36
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,030
We've admitted a few Yes 20:15 topics which you will see far far less frequently.

37
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,600
But there are links in the section notes where you can read about those topics.

38
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,880
So let's get started with as 2015 and a brand new keyword Konst.

39
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,900
See you in the next video.
