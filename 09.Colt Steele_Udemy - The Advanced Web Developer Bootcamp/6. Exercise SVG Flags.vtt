00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.690
Welcome back in this exercise you'll get to practice working with SVGA elements by trying to draw some

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.270
flags here you can see images for the flags of different countries around the world.

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.910
Pick four of these flags and try to draw them on your own with SPG.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.060
It's up to you how much of a challenge you want to give yourself.

5
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.870
Clearly drawing the flag of a country like Cambodia will be more challenging than drawing the flag of

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.250
a country like France.

7
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.840
I'd start simple and pick a couple of flags you think will be relatively straightforward.

8
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.800
Along with a couple that will be more of a challenge.

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
You should also push yourself to try to use the path element for at least one of these flags.

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.730
Since we'll be seeing this element quite frequently when we get to more complex visualizations with

11
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.820
the if you'd like more direction.

12
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.100
Here are four flags that I built in that you can try to recreate.

13
00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.100
I picked the Bahamas Jamaica Macedonia and South Korea.

14
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.500
Good luck drawing some of these flags.

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.330
Remember there are multiple ways to draw any one of them depending on which SPG elements you'd like

16
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.090
to use in the next video.

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.210
I'll show you my solutions.

18
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.940
I'll see there.
