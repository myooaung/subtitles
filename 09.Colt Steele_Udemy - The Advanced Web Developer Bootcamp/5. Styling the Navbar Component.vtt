00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.820
All right.

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.410
So in order for this next section to work I've added a couple of images that I encourage you to use.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.890
You can use your own images but I have attached a couple N.S.A..

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.460
So if you take a quick look at our folder structure we see inside of the SIRC folder inside of images.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.210
We have these five images.

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.700
You are free to use those or use whatever images you'd like in this application.

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.350
This is going to be important when we sell the application.

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.280
So what do we want to do.

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.490
Let's make the nav bar a little bit nicer.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.550
We're going to do most of that inside of our index that's the SS So let's take out the boiler plate

11
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.760
and add a background color to make this a little bit nicer than that standard white we'll add E6.

12
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.230
He says zero.

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.490
Can you give us a nice grayish color.

14
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.890
Well inside of here some navs styling.

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.890
We'll start with a class of Nambour and it's out of here with the cherry a little bit of margin bottom

16
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.100
in one room.

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.190
Since we're using bootstrap for we want to use these relative measurements

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.900
We'll also make sure that any links inside of our nav bar have a font weight.

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.170
Bold one it those links pop a little bit in the number.

20
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.420
What's also added a bit of styling for the nav bar.

21
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.360
Any time when you hover over a list item inside of there what the color of white will give that a text

22
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.230
decoration.

23
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.600
Underline should be underlined.

24
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.870
We hover over and also look at a cursor a pointer.

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.940
So if we hover over it will look a lot nicer like that yours right.

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.030
Right here on the left let's add a couple of other things that we have.

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.890
We want to make sure inside of our nav bar anytime we have images we want to make sure those display

28
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.890
nicely as well.

29
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.910
So any images inside of our nav bar brand will use the direct descendant selector will add a display

30
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.990
of him on block so we can add some with or height on it.

31
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.980
We'll get that a little bit with 20 Edsels And what about it a radius to make it a little more circular

32
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.360
of two pixels.

33
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.470
If there are any images inside of our Gnab our brand now will be styled a little bit more nicely.

34
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.590
Let's also add a little bit of margin on the bottom of two pixels and we'll give it a little margin

35
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.450
of five pixels.

36
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.670
We're really just adding some generic styling giving a little breathing room between our elements.

37
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.200
This you can customize on your own.

38
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.680
I'm just going to start with a bit of boilerplate to make it look a little bit nicer.

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.110
What else do we want here.

40
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.120
We're going to add one more to give R U L and R with the items a little bit more breathing room.

41
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.950
So that's a well with a class of NAV nav bar nav inside a list item.

42
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.740
We're going to make sure that we have a lower margin.

43
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.360
We'll get that from the top of zero on the bottom zero and left and right we'll give that half around

44
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.840
going to be a couple more to go here.

45
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.610
So I had a class of onboarding that was our wrapper class that we saw in our HABCHI s.

46
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.360
So inside onboarding any nav bar and even the class of Napp are inside of there.

47
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.250
We had a background image that is going to be our first background image we're going to use that's going

48
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.670
to you are all from flash images flash navs slash BD Dappy N.G. and we'll give that a background size

49
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.280
of 100 percent make sure that covers the entire nav bar.

50
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.470
Make sure you get a semicolon there let's go see that and take a look at the styling.

51
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.020
And we're making some progress we see that we're home with a nice linear gradient that we have in the

52
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.590
background.

53
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.780
But we need to clean up those lost items a little bit.

54
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.330
We need a little bit more us to make those horizontal instead of vertical.

55
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.680
So for now let's keep this as will change just a little bit with some know.

56
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.950
Right now we don't have the warbler logo.

57
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.750
We'll put that in a little bit.

58
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.260
So inside of an hour let's go change a little bit of our HD now instead of our NAV bar.

59
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.860
You want to bring in our wonderful warbler logo.

60
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.440
So how are we going to import that logo.

61
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.020
Well we can do that using an import statement.

62
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.070
So we're going to import a logo from Doctor flash images slash warbler dash logo ducky Angie.

63
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.860
And where are we going to put this logo.

64
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.190
Or we can use that as our SIRC attribute.

65
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.300
So inside of our container fluid we'll add another div with a class of nav bar header.

66
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.900
So a little bit more bootstrap styling that we need.

67
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.230
And let's change that SIRC from an empty string to that specific logo.

68
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.880
Make sure you get those quotes out of there.

69
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.510
So GSX can evaluate what that variable is and we do this correctly we should see the warble logo there

70
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.520
is.

71
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.320
Will move us in the middle but right now let's keep it where it is.

72
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.720
How about this.

73
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.770
What's that smell.

74
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.810
Some things will be incorrect with my container fluid.

75
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.680
I want to make sure that I just make sure that I have those two inside of there and that's good.

76
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.650
But it looks like I have a small issue with the way that my container fluid is set up.

77
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.510
I want make sure that this did this closing is not where it is but actually right before the closing

78
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.680
of the Nav. so that everything is laid out horizontally that's going make those line up correctly to

79
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.250
make sure teener fluid encompasses everything.

80
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.680
And that just encompasses where the logo is.

81
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.490
So it made the bar a little bit nicer.

82
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.410
So those things aren't actually displaying a color of white when we hover over.

83
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.050
So what are we doing incorrectly here.

84
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.840
What's the why that might not be the case inside of a class of nap or anything.

85
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.060
That's a list item that we hover over should have a color of white.

86
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.130
So was it not the case.

87
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.260
Well we do have a class of number and we do have list items.

88
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.900
So how can this child isn't applying.

89
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.510
Well let's go to the crumbed of tools and debugfs So it's go take a look at one of those and let's go

90
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.730
see in the computer tab that the color is coming from reboot.

91
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.970
US looks like my style below is being overwritten.

92
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.010
So that's the case.

93
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.720
Well of hover is a little bit more specific than our list item of power.

94
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.760
So let's go change this.

95
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.000
Yes.

96
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.580
As to not be a list of ever.

97
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.880
But in a other.

98
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.270
And we were first page we can hover over and now we're getting that white collar.

99
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.160
This is just some specificity concerns with the SS McCrum dev tools are really wonderful to help us

100
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.470
debug that.

101
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.430
Let's also make sure that the links on our own have a color of white so inside whenever we have a knob

102
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.050
bar with any anchor tag that's a hover.

103
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.660
It's white but also lets make sure that any of our anchor tags on their own are white as well.

104
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.080
So now they're white makes it look a little bit better.

105
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.950
So use the elements tab to debug some of your CSSA issues to look at the computed section.

106
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.760
You can also click on a specific style and take a look at computed.

107
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.950
You can also take a look at Styles and click on to see those hover States as well.

108
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.090
If you want to debug what it looks like when that element is being hovered over super super helpful

109
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.790
when debugging you see us use these tools as much as he can.

110
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.810
So he built a bit of a cleaner and as far we haven't done too much with the idea.

111
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.180
But it's looking a lot better.

112
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.260
And the next action we're going to add a component to display the home page we're going a style that

113
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.550
as well and get started more working with react and read us.
