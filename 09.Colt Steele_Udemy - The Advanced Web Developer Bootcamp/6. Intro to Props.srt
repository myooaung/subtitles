1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:07,470
Now we'll talk about a really important concept in re-act called prop's So this is what we'll be using

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,160
extensively to hold immutable data.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:20,310
Our objectives for this video will be to define props and to use props inside of a component.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,690
First of all what are props.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:28,010
Well props are immutable data is passed into your component and it's accessible in your component as

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,350
an object called the Stop props.

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:37,940
So imagine we have this show text component and we had a parameter passed in as a prop called text.

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:45,770
We have access to that parameter via Vistar props and the note here says that this refers to the instance

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,970
of show text.

10
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,120
So if you're a member of the key word this in this case this will be referring to the instance of this

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,530
class.

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,430
So this class instance has an object called props.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,570
And one of the keys of that object is text.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,260
Since this is a normal javascript object with a property when we put it in the curly braces here the

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,310
string that comes back will be the string was displayed in the view.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,330
So how do we pass a prop in.

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,960
Well when we use GSX to render show text we just added as a an attribute basically.

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,820
So this is a prop called text and the value that prop is going to be.

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,700
This is a proper name text and this is what our code looks like except without the comment.

20
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,680
I mentioned this already but it's really important and worth repeating.

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,930
Props are immutable so you cannot change this stuff props in the first example here.

22
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,010
This not props not text equals something Caza type air.

23
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,360
So re-act won't let you do this at all but you can do this in your reactive component and you should

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,360
never ever ever do this.

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,900
The idea of a prop is that it's immutable.

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:07,020
So when you change the stop process in your render method your you're breaking things and reacts in

27
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,550
this last example.

28
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,970
You might be thinking that you want to create a prop that the user didn't provide for you.

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,270
And this again is the wrong way to do it.

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,420
So we'll learn something later called default prop's that it's the proper way to set initial props that

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,210
the user didn't provide you.

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,110
But again this is incorrect.

33
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,160
Never ever create a new property that doesn't exist on this dot probs.

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,750
So all of these examples just to make it crystal clear are wrong.

35
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,970
You should not do any of these things.

36
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,170
Never ever ever change the stop prop's in your component.

37
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,690
Next up will write some code and get more practice with prop's.
