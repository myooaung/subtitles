00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.210
All right.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.810
So the next re-assessed transform function that will take a look at has to do with increasing or decreasing

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.680
the size of a given element.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.200
It's called scale.

5
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.540
So you can see a quick example here.

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.500
The syntax is very similar to what we did with translate.

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.810
So we have transform colon and then a function that we pass in.

8
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.040
In this case for not doing translate X or Y we're going to work with scale.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.580
And there's also scale x and scale Y which you'll see in a bit but to start this simple line transform

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.820
colon scale too is going to double the size of all divs.

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.770
So it increases the X and the Y dimensions by 2.

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.520
Let's hop over to code Penn and play around a bit.

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.130
So I have two divs here or excuse me two paragraphs here.

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.970
Both the text Hello and side one with the class transformed.

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.190
But it's not transformed yet.

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.860
The only difference is the background color at the moment.

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.840
So they're both 50 by 50 pixels.

18
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.210
One of them has a teal background color.

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.830
The font is white.

20
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.630
Doesn't really matter.

21
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.720
And there's a two pixel border that's there for a reason that we'll see in just a bit.

22
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.190
So transformed the class only has a different background color.

23
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.670
Now we're going to actually apply a C S transform to scale it.

24
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.120
So again the syntax is transform colon and then a function.

25
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.130
Not in caps.

26
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.180
And in this case we'll do scale.

27
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:35.140
And if I just pass in a single number like that you can see it immediately grows to twice its size.

28
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.330
Now we'll talk a bit about why is being cut off.

29
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.180
Where you know where it's going and how the scale is being applied in just a second.

30
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.930
But I just want to show that you can do things like 10.

31
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.110
Notice that if you can see this everything in this paragraph every aspect of it has been scales including

32
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.030
the border.

33
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.440
It's now ten times larger and the font the text it's a bit hard to see.

34
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.240
It's very hard to see it's basically gone.

35
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.720
It's being cut off but you can see a bit that's been increased.

36
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.410
We can also go the other direction and shrink it.

37
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.190
There we go it's half as large.

38
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.060
Could go very small one or two very very tiny.

39
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.410
But if it's human you can actually see it still there.

40
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.240
The text the border it's all there.

41
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.630
OK.

42
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.420
So that's the very basics of scale where we can apply the scale evenly across the x and y but we can

43
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.740
also do things like this only scale across the x axis so the height remains the same.

44
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.430
Everything in the y axis if you look at it take a look at the border here.

45
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.020
This is the original border dimension on the top and bottom.

46
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.790
But our border on the right and left you have to trust me on the left but on the right that we can see

47
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.060
has doubled in size.

48
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.260
So we're stretching it we're making it twice as long and we could do the same thing for why if you wanted

49
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.710
to.

50
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.650
Now it's twice as tall twice as long across the y axis.

51
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.760
So you can do those individually.

52
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.790
You could also you know we can shrink it and make it half as tall but you can also combine them by just

53
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.680
doing scale and passing into values.

54
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.250
So rather than doing two to double it on the x and y to basically double its size overall we can pass

55
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.640
and a comma here and then a second number let's say 5.

56
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.020
So this will make it twice as long across the scale at two times across the x axis scale up by five

57
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.580
times on the y axis.

58
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.740
So it's five times as tall or we could go the opposite direction and shrink it across the y axis an

59
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.030
elongated double it on the X.

60
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.450
So that's really it to scale on its own.

61
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.090
There's only a scale scale x and scale y that we're concerned with and to a scale you can pass in a

62
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.780
single number like we saw.

63
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.290
Let's go with something big.

64
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.430
How about 7.

65
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.360
That will increase it by sevenfold scale at seven times.

66
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.090
Or we can pass in two numbers like three and five.

67
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.390
So rather than doing scale x and scale y separately.

68
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.800
Now the next thing I want to talk about has to do with where the origin of the transform is happening.

69
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.940
So if we go back to our double double across the x and y.

70
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.960
Notice that it's getting cutoff right.

71
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.500
We don't see the left quarter.

72
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.020
We don't see the left part of the H here.

73
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.030
What's happening is that it's taking the initial origin here which is the middle of this paragraph right

74
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.320
about there and it's scaling it evenly from there.

75
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.160
So it grows outwards to the right to the left up and below top and bottom I guess we can change that.

76
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.460
So what we could do instead is say I want the scale to happen from right here and grow two times this

77
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.150
way and two times that way to the right and down the name of the property we care about is called transform

78
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.340
origin and there's a ton of different ways to use it as you can see here.

79
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.050
So we're not going to go over all of them or even most of them.

80
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.420
I'm just going to point out a couple of things we can do with it.

81
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.980
So if we go back here to our double scaled transforms paragraph if I want to instead change the transform

82
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.730
origin to this top corner here that coordinate is actually 0 0.

83
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:27.100
So I can transform it again and give it a transform origin 0 0 and what that will do is set the origin

84
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.820
to this point right here.

85
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.760
So that might be slightly different than what you expect.

86
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.410
00 in the C S coordinate system is the top left.

87
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.980
It's not down here.

88
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.710
This is 00 as you can see let me reset it again back to here.

89
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.520
This doesn't move this stays flush right there.

90
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.250
And it scales this way in that way.

91
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.220
So uncommon.

92
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.390
Both of them and there we go it skills.

93
00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.960
OK.

94
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.860
So we can play around with that as well.

95
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.710
You know if you wanted to you could give it a coordinate here.

96
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.470
Any coordinate.

97
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.030
But another thing that we can do that's even simpler is just give it a direction like left right.

98
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.090
We could even say Center and that's where it will scale from.

99
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:24.910
So I could say transform origin is left and what that will do is basically say transform from the left

100
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.190
side but it doesn't specify top or bottom so it's going to keep the center for the y position.

101
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.430
But transform it from the left side for x.

102
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.710
If that makes any sense.

103
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.970
So essentially if I go back and uncomment that initially is transforming from the center out in both

104
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.270
directions from the middle but then by saying transform origin left it's going to take the x component

105
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.750
the X scale and do it from the left side over here.

106
00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.970
So it will still move up from the middle and down from the middle but it won't move left and right from

107
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.660
the middle instead it will move from the left side.

108
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.770
So I could also pass in a second value here.

109
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:18.450
Like bottom and now it's scaling up from the bottom so it's going from the left and from the bottom.

110
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.980
Or I could do left top which is the same as zero comma or no comma is the same as zero zero.

111
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.370
Just like that we get the same result as left top.

112
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:38.890
So if we change just the right it scales to the left from the right side.

113
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.880
So the origin is here now.

114
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.400
And so it's going that way.

115
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.270
So we could do the same thing just to wrap this up.

116
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:52.670
If we pass into values that say would double it and the X and we shrink it on y.

117
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.960
Now what I can do set up right top.

118
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.900
Let me just show you what it looks like without changing the origin.

119
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.490
So from the middle right now it's shrinking from the middle and then doubling evenly.

120
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.880
So the left until the right.

121
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:13.140
Now if I go back and let's change the transform origin to now be from the left we see the entire thing

122
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:20.980
because that to hear the double is happening from the left this direction but we could also say left

123
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:29.630
bottom and now the shrink scaling down is happening from the bottom and it's shrinking towards the bottom

124
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.470
because we passed that value that's less than 1.

125
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.280
It's shrinking down.

126
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:39.290
So if I change just to be 5 it now overtakes everything.

127
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:45.380
The bottom stays the same the position and it scales up way up here five times.

128
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.370
So let's do three instead.

129
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.140
Now you can see the tech scales like that.

130
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.310
And just to hit this home again the default is going to be Center.

131
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.650
You often do want things to actually scale from the center.

132
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.330
That's a logical way to scale them but if you're worried about things overlapping or if you're trying

133
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.690
to apply something in a particular direction transform origin can help you.

134
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.470
All right.

135
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.510
That's it descale.

136
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:15.110
Just to recap we have scale on its own with one value scale with two values like this.

137
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.000
And then we also had scale x and scale y along with transform origin.

138
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.650
All right.
