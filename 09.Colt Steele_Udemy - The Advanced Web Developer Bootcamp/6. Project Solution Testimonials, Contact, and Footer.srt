00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,760
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,920
We've already built the bulk of this marketing page in this video.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,390
We'll finish things up by adding sections for testimonials.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:15,930
A contact area and the FOTR first a section for testimonials

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,310
as with my other sections.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,200
I'll start with the title and an H.R.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,660
then for each testimonial.

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,350
Add to be tag's one for the quote and one for the author of that quote.

9
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,500
I'll include three testimonials so that six p tags are pentagonal

10
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,940
these testimonials will come from cold Ellie in 10 to save time.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,410
I'll quickly paste in what they have to say about their love for mountains

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,170
this already listees.

13
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,800
I'll just add a few style rules for the quotes

14
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,390
bump up the font size.

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,060
Then out the font weight

16
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:46,550
decrease the line height from the default for r p tags and include some margin.

17
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm satisfied with how this looks.

18
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,050
Let's move on to the next section.

19
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,470
By now the pattern for these sections should be familiar.

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,160
After creating a section and giving it a class inside of it.

21
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,370
I'll make an H-3 a p tag and then a char

22
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:31,260
next below the H R O out of form to grab people's email addresses.

23
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,990
Let's save

24
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,560
this form doesn't look so great but everything else is in the shape so let's hop back into the style

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,050
sheet and add some form styles.

26
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,720
I'll use fluxbox for the form Santror things

27
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,580
wrap the content

28
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,050
and set it with

29
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,400
next I'll give the buttons and Patti

30
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,880
I'll give the form put some padding to as well as some margin

31
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,140
then I'll update the font size and color

32
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,460
and lastly use the flex property to ensure that the input takes up the rest of the available space.

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,890
Nice.

34
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,540
Our firm doesn't do anything but at least it looks good.

35
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,870
Lastly let's take care of the FOTR how out of FOTR tag and inside of it.

36
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,830
Put three children

37
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,060
a couple of tags and a list for social media icons

38
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,760
inside of this UL o icons for Twitter

39
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,500
Facebook and snap chat.

40
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,370
And inside of my PITA's I'll paste in some text

41
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,630
OK.

42
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,920
Let's tackle this stylin

43
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,060
once again.

44
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,850
I'll rely on flex box pretty heavily.

45
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,790
I'll set my footers use fluxbox and all line items to the center and justify the content so that elements

46
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,120
have space around them.

47
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:10,790
I'll also set the background color font color and padding.

48
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:22,790
I also use fluxbox for the UL and give each L-lysine margin on the left

49
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,660
then for the tags.

50
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,480
I'll make the tax all uppercase

51
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:49,820
decrease the font size reduce the opacity and vertically align the elements in the center using Fluxbox.

52
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,980
There we go.

53
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,430
This completes the silent for our marketing page in the next video.

54
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,420
We'll add some media queries to make their design more responsive.

55
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,700
I'll see you there.
