00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.550
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.580
So it's time for another exercise this time.

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
You're going to use fetch to build a random user generator.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.430
Not the most useful thing ever i know but there is an API that's free and public that will give us random

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.810
user data and we're going to build a simple little widget.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.710
You click a button here and we get random user data here.

7
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.740
So let me show you how it works.

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.800
Here I've got a random user.

9
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.010
Every time I click I get a new random user.

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.490
So I've got a name profile picture that's coming from the API.

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.840
A user name and email and a city.

12
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.750
There's a bunch of other data that comes back from the API.

13
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.500
But this is all I chose to use.

14
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.510
We can keep going to show you the API itself.

15
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.070
The link is in the resources but this is it.

16
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.570
So we get one result.

17
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.610
It's an array by the way.

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.020
And in that array there's only one thing one object.

19
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.450
So we can see gender.

20
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:06.180
We've got name location that's from getting city from e-mail username is coming from log in username

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.040
and think Oh and picture I mean using the medium sized picture.

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.880
So that's all the data we need here is the API itself.

23
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.660
Like I said it's in the resources.

24
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.310
So the way it works is to have starter code so you don't have to write any success or HMO.

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.580
This is the starter.

26
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.630
It does nothing.

27
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.410
You don't need to write all javascript to select the button have a click event fire that actually sends

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.160
a fetch request.

29
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.040
This API gets data back extracts the important information and updates it.

30
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.910
The other thing I'll point out is that you don't need to change the team at all.

31
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.960
I've already given IDs to everything you need to update.

32
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.080
So for example this right here that says John Snow right now has an ID a full name so you can select

33
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.000
that javascript and update the entered text to be whatever you know.

34
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.070
ISABELLA.

35
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.720
Oh boy.

36
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.740
Shroeder.

37
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.700
So something like that.

38
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.420
Same thing with user name for King of the north right now.

39
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.300
So there's an idea there.

40
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.400
We've got an ID for email and an ID for City and then for the photo.

41
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.660
Where are you right here.

42
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.440
Theres an idea of Avatar and youll be updating the source of that rather than the text.

43
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.640
So thats the basics.

44
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.050
Try the starter code I actually go ahead and include the link and starter code as well commented out

45
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.130
and go from there.

46
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.180
The last thing I'll mention is this is what my finished fecche request looks like in the solution.

47
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.190
So if you want to try and match this syntax I have named a bunch of functions handle errors parse J

48
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.700
saw an update profile.

49
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.210
These are all things I defined.

50
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.480
So my fecche itself is really short and clean inside the click handler.

51
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.910
So if you want to try and follow this you can it's really just a stylistic preference.

52
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.550
But it's how I'm going to do the solution as well.

53
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.080
So it's not required but if you like this try and match it all right.

54
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.610
Give it a shot.
