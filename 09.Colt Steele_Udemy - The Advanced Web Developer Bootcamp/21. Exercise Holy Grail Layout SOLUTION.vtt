1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.830
All right.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.200
So let's get going here.

3
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.870
The first thing we should do is just identify what needs to be a flex box.

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.560
So I mentioned the entire body is a flex box meaning that we have a three column layout flex direction

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.950
column.

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.410
Here's our first column our second column is this entire middle section and then our footer is the third

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.270
column.

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.770
Then inside of this second column we have another flex box and in that one we're working with the Rollei

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.660
out most of the time.

10
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.590
At least we have our side of main content and decide those are the flex items.

11
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:42.380
They started a row but then as we shrink they changed to a column layout and finally the nav bar up

12
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.430
here is also a flex box a very simple one and all we do is set justify content to space between to force

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.050
this left and that to the right.

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.000
The only two items inside.

15
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.950
So let's get going.

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.890
Like I said don't worry too much about the colors right away.

17
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.880
But let's start by setting the body and make sure this is big enough to be flex.

18
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.580
Display flex and then we're going to change it right back to what it looked like.

19
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.230
At least it will appear that it's the same by doing Flex direction column.

20
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.520
So we have a column now or three columns.

21
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.980
We have one here for this header.

22
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.440
Then we have all of this in a column and then our third column here.

23
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.200
So let's give our header and footer of background

24
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.440
and I'll just start with blue.

25
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.340
OK.

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.880
So we have these three columns.

27
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.330
Now the next thing we could do.

28
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.510
I'm just going to remove the margin from the body.

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.730
Not necessary but I'm going to ask you to do that here briefly.

30
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.700
The next step is let's give our body a min height.

31
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.120
100 pixels or excuse me 100 VH perfect.

32
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.870
And then from here we have a couple of options.

33
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.410
Let's go ahead and work on this middle section.

34
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.540
The main turn that into a flex container and set it's flex direction to row which is the default.

35
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.640
So that's going to be main.

36
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.620
And then we'll just do display flex because this is also a flex contain.

37
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.210
And we're already kind of looking good.

38
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.310
Let's not worry about heights just yet.

39
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.160
Let's focus on how they're distributed.

40
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.540
So the next thing that we could do is add in our flex basis and remember that I mentioned that we want

41
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.940
the main content to take roughly 60 percent and the side in the side roughly 20 percent.

42
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:51.470
So we can actually do that if I work on an article that's what the main content is inside of.

43
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.280
And I give it a flex basis of 60 percent

44
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.540
can see doesn't have a background just yet but it takes up all of that.

45
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.000
So let's give it a background to read.

46
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.570
Cool.

47
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.650
Now we have side now of an aside.

48
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.770
So let's do the same thing now.

49
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.190
And I'm going to do them separately just so we can get them different colors even though they're going

50
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.650
to have the same flex basis of 20 percent.

51
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.880
But I will make the Nav. orange and then I'll make the aside.

52
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.700
Yeah.

53
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.190
Next we can tackle the ordering.

54
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.280
Because what we want is the side have to be on the left to come first before the main content.

55
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.120
And this layout.

56
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.300
So the easiest way to do that is to go to the Nev. side enough and just give it order.

57
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.560
Negative one.

58
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.510
Now that's not the only way you could do it.

59
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:57.080
You could have gone and given an order of 1 and then Article order of 2 and then the a side order order

60
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.250
of three or any consecutive numbers.

61
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.990
Or they don't even have to be consecutive.

62
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.960
And the numbers that are larger than the previous but negative one is the easiest way to send it to

63
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.960
the beginning.

64
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.180
OK.

65
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.900
Now let's tackle some height.

66
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.620
Let's give this main section this.

67
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:26.650
All of this here a height so that the main and we're going to do men high 800 X ok but also openness

68
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.160
in a full page.

69
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.180
So we can take a look at what we have.

70
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.480
All right.

71
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.490
Oh I'm also weighs in.

72
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.330
So I'll keep this at 100 percent OK.

73
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.110
So you can see what we have right now.

74
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.840
So we're getting closer.

75
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.750
Let's make the top and bottom nabs larger as well.

76
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.360
So we'll come in here.

77
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.010
We have a header and footer.

78
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.030
Let's just give those a min height of 100 x.

79
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.940
We could also just to be clear do flex basis 100 peaks because remember they're in a column.

80
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.570
So height is going to be flex basis and we could do the same thing instead of Monheit 100.

81
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.840
We could do flex bases.

82
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.580
Now the next thing we should tackle is how it behaves when things start to shrink and I'm actually fine

83
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:30.850
with how it's flexing so far up until this point I guess are a sides inside now of our taking up kind

84
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.620
of a lot of space compared to the main.

85
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.230
That's OK.

86
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.820
All I really care about is the break point where you want it to stack.

87
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.370
So that break point is 640 pixels.

88
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:52.530
So let's come down here and find that we have are at media all and we're going to do Max with 640.

89
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.130
OK.

90
00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.410
So whatever we put in here will apply when it is less than 640 pixels and all we want to do is switch

91
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:07.720
this main right here the flex container from display or from flex direction row to flex direction column.

92
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.490
So we'll select the main flex direction column.

93
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.490
Nothing changes but of course we come here right at 6:40.

94
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.890
There we go.

95
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.330
Now let's take a look at what's actually happening.

96
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.550
It's kind of bizarre.

97
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.660
It's all taking up the tiniest amount of space possible.

98
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.280
And that's because we haven't assigned any flex growth to anything.

99
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.890
So let's come back here and let's go to our article and give it a flex grow of one.

100
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.340
Everything else has zero by default.

101
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.990
So as we shrink it notice now what happens.

102
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.960
Our main content takes up all the available space but we may want to give our side the side.

103
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.590
The side a bit of space as well.

104
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.750
Those are kind of small.

105
00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.050
So maybe we want that proportion to be something like three to one potentially.

106
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:06.010
So we'll go here I can just copy this for now we will refactor this just to be clear.

107
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:12.360
I'll go to my Nav. and the aside and I'll give them Flixster of one and then the article will get Flick's

108
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.530
grow of three.

109
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.540
So it takes three times as much if the available space.

110
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.850
So here we go and that looks good enough to me.

111
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.320
You could change that around.

112
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:28.710
You know we could do something like five times as much space.

113
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.190
You can see kind of like that one more actually so maybe I'll leave that.

114
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.520
But anyway the idea is you know we're changing that proportion.

115
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.260
How about for.

116
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.180
I think it's a nice middle ground.

117
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.880
Perfect.

118
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.770
OK.

119
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.150
Next up let's tackle the issue of the order.

120
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.730
Very simple to change this.

121
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.390
All we want is this side enough to go back where it belongs which is after the main content because

122
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.590
by default that's the normal order.

123
00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:02.190
So we actually have to do is at that breakpoint if we select that side of which is just a Nev. right

124
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:09.410
here and all we have to do is change to order to zero which everything else has an order of zero in

125
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.710
that container by default we didn't change them.

126
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.640
We only gave it negative 1.

127
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.760
So by sending it back to zero it goes to the normal order.

128
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:24.780
As you can see here perfect side of the side footer looks good.

129
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.660
You can see it over here you can go to 100 percent.

130
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.210
All right the last flex boxy thing to take care of is the NAVs here.

131
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.410
So it's hard to see but we have these two lengths.

132
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:41.280
And what we want is one on the left one on the right and they are centered vertically as well.

133
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:48.180
So tackling that just need to make our head her fluxbox so we can select our head or somewhere.

134
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.570
Let's do it up top.

135
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.430
Display flex the default flex direction is fine.

136
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:06.520
But now we set justify content to be space between and all that space is put between the two.

137
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.990
So we get shoved to the left shove to the right now to make them vertically centered.

138
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:17.100
What's the name of that property line items center.

139
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.130
There we go.

140
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.340
The monks are a bit hard to see with this color.

141
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.600
We'll come back to that in a bit.

142
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.000
If you really care to see me change the colors.

143
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.040
All right.

144
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.970
So the last thing that we could do is go through here and just update and sort of doing Flex bases in

145
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:40.180
Flex grow can come in and just do flex and use those properties so we can change this to be 4 0 for

146
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:45.630
shrink and then 60 percent and get rid of that and that.

147
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.120
OK.

148
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.990
Same thing here we can do flex 1.

149
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:58.270
Let's have it shrink 1 and then we'll also give it 20 percent perfect.

150
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:05.780
So we can get rid of that and that and not do the exact same thing for the side.

151
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:11.090
So just a shorthand to shorten that up a little bit cool.

152
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.440
Make sure nothing has changed.

153
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:19.790
I'm zoomed in make sure that the real size.

154
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.730
Those are nice breakpoint looks good.

155
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:28.970
Now of has the requirements you got these three sections of the same height and we have our footer.

156
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:34.720
One other thing that you might notice is that when we get to our mobile layout I need to refresh your

157
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.860
your term mobile.

158
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.260
We have the space in Swelp where our are is coming up and what we can do to fix that.

159
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.750
If we inspected this we would see that our main section this section right here in the middle when we

160
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.360
go to this vertical lay out it's not taking up all the available space.

161
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.190
We have this empty space here inside the container.

162
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.980
Well how do we divvy up available space.

163
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.150
How do we tell things to grow.

164
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:07.170
We use flex growth so we can do that all we want to do is go to our main jobs right here inside the

165
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:17.610
media query and set flex grow to one so it can be confusing because we're talking about multiple nested

166
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.570
containers.

167
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.630
But what we're referring to is the space that this thing takes up.

168
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:28.200
So remember it's in a column layout already we're not talking about the main flex box we're talking

169
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.980
about the main flex item.

170
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.170
So that makes sense.

171
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:40.380
So this row as we shrink becomes shorter and we have more space and we can tell you to refresh the page.

172
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:46.470
You can tell it to use up all available space because the header and footer don't have flex Grosset

173
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.730
to anything is set to zero by default.

174
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.440
So by setting this to 5 0 1 it grows to take up all that space.

175
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.590
Okay.

176
00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.540
So pretty much all we have left if you care is cosmetic things which honestly doesn't really look much

177
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.180
better here.

178
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.660
But if you are a stickler and you want to make it look exactly like this.

179
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.880
I'll show you that.

180
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.400
Otherwise we're done.

181
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.260
OK.

182
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:14.460
So if you do care all that we do is give everything a border radius margin and some padding.

183
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.930
So I'll just do that.

184
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.470
Maybe here.

185
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:24.660
So I'm going to select everything inside the main That's the easiest way of doing that as well as the

186
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:32.320
header and footer and I'm going to give it a margin of 4 pixels not 40.

187
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:41.840
I'll give it padding 5 pixels all around and also give it a shorter radius of 7

188
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.410
or 7 pixels.

189
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.970
OK so all we really have left if you care the backgrounds and some of these colors and the font.

190
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:04.060
And like I said really not that important but if you do really want to see it I'll just fast forward

191
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.030
and show you the colors as I change them.

192
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.710
OK.

193
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:12.710
So I gave the article a background ECF 0 EF 1 in case you're wondering.

194
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.830
Then I gave the nav background 9 5 8 5 8 6.

195
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:24.520
The aside background that blue and the header and footer background as well then I changed the background

196
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.720
of the body to make it darker.

197
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.110
And change to font.

198
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.930
And finally I gave our anchor tags no text decoration and the colored black that would get rid of that

199
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:41.450
link styling and coloring the visited link color.

200
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.880
So if we take a look now does not look good.

201
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.900
I'm not claiming it does but it matches what I wrote the specification to look like.

202
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.390
Cool and I'm zoomed in.

203
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:57.020
So if out we go looking good enough good enough.

204
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:02.900
All right so that demonstrates some of the power of Xbox we have three flex containers here a bunch

205
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.680
of nested things you know media queries.

206
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.460
Very simple.

207
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:11.690
We don't have content really in here but it's as easy as filling in the blanks hopefully changing colors

208
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.670
making things look nicer but the layout works very well.

209
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.040
It is awesome.

210
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.810
All right.

211
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:18.510
We're done with that.
