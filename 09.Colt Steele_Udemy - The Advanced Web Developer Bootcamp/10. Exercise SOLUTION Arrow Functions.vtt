00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.590
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.880
In this video we're going to go over solutions to the aero functions exercise.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.640
The first thing we need to do is refactor the triple and filter function which maps and filters over

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.210
an array of three factor that are using aero functions and place all this code on one line we'll remove

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.750
the function keyword and make sure our parentheses are in the correct place.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.230
Remember if you have one parameter to an arrow function that parameter does not need to be wrapped in

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.690
parentheses for the next function.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.460
Double odd numbers or solution is going to look quite similar.

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.330
We need to make sure that we're replacing our function keyword with an arrow function and if we take

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.390
away any existing return statements and curly braces we also have to make sure that we're using a function

11
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.210
expression for the next function map filter and reduce.

12
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.140
We can place the map and filter functions all on one line and use the arrows syntax without the return

13
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.420
keyword and then replace the reduced function with arrow function syntax.

14
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.330
But make sure that we have this on multiple lines with curly braces and the return keyword.

15
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.630
Since reduce accepts more than one parameter to the callback we have to place parentheses around those

16
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.880
parameters in the next function.

17
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.900
Create student.

18
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.280
We accept two parameters.

19
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830
First name and last name.

20
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.380
There's a bit of a gotcha here.

21
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.860
Since we're returning an object literal We need to make sure we actually use curly braces here so the

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.780
arrow function knows to return an object in the last exercise.

23
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.160
We have an instructor object with the first name of Colt and to say hi method which invokes a set time

24
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.810
out after one second and cancelled out logs.

25
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.730
Hello destock.

26
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.270
First Name the issue here is that the keyword this will refer to the window when that function is run.

27
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.260
So we need to use an arrow function to set the correct value of the keyword.

28
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.120
This inside of the callback to say time out.

29
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.010
We're going to replace the function key word with an arrow function so that the keyword this refers

30
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.520
to the instructor object and that's all for the functions.

31
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.710
See you in the next video.
