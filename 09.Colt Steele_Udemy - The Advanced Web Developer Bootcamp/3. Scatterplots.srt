00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,520
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,620
In this video we'll use what we've learned about working with men's axes and scales and D-3 to build

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,000
our first scatterplot.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,810
In keeping with the theme let's graph some more birth data as always.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,460
Here are a couple of links to some starter code.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:26,510
This time around I've got data not only on earths but also on population land area and life expectancy.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,070
This data is organized by region and is from 2011.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,110
Let's visualize this data with a scatterplot on the y axis.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,560
I want to measure life expectancy on the X-axis.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,410
I want some measurement of birth's rather than looking at the birth numbers directly though.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,280
I'll look at births divided by population.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,090
This will give me a measurement of births per capita rather than yes the total number of births in the

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,050
last video.

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,600
We learned how to use various D-3 methods to help us work with our data here will need to use those

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
methods again.

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:10,060
First let's create a scale for the y axis in order to do that will calculate the minimum and maximum

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,400
in our dataset.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,700
Since the y axis is measuring life expectancy.

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,860
This is the property will need to return in our callback function.

20
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,220
Note that from here on out I'll be using aero functions for these callbacks wherever I can.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,390
Once we've got our man in RMX we can create our scale as in the previous video.

22
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,710
We're mapping our minimum to the height and our maximum to zero.

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,750
If you don't remember why we do this.

24
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,210
Go back and re watch the last video.

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,700
This looks pretty good so far.

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,660
But before we move on it's worth mentioning a small reactor we can do here.

27
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:52,090
There's a fair amount of code duplication in our logic calculating them in and the max we could pull

28
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,470
the callback out into its own named function.

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,850
But we can also use D-3 is built in extent a function which calculates both the minimum and maximum

30
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,130
in the dataset and returns both values to us in an array.

31
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,710
Here's a quick example.

32
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,390
In this case we've got an array of people and want to know the range of ages the extent method will

33
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,260
return to us an array with both the smallest age and the largest one we can call this function inside

34
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,610
of our scales domain indirectly.

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,840
Let's do that now.

36
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,820
That's better.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,090
Now let's move on to our x axis here we'll want to do basically the same thing just with a different

38
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,900
scale.

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,260
We'll want to return Deedat births divided by Deedat population rather than just D-CA life expectancy

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,630
cool.

41
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:49,590
Now let's make our first scatterplot first will set the width and height of our SVGA then we'll create

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,940
an empty selection of circles and join our data to it.

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,730
After that we'll hop into the enter selection append new circles and begin to style them the coordinates

44
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,710
of the circle are based on our scales pronounce.

45
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,620
Just to get something showing up on the page let's set the radius of each circle to be five.

46
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,380
Now let's refresh the page one circle for each region.

47
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,680
As you can tell there's a fairly strong negative association between life expectancy and births per

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,640
capita.

49
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,870
The higher this measurement of birth rate the lower the life expectancy so far so good.

50
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,990
But there are a couple of issues with this visualization.

51
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,180
One is that the circle's towards the edges of the SPG are getting cut off because their centers lie

52
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,840
along the edges of the SPG the most common way to fix this problem is to set some padding for the SPG

53
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,580
and then update our scales to account for this batting now and we have a data point.

54
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,990
It's a man or a max.

55
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,970
It won't be mapped to the corner of the S.A.G. but will be offset by our padding value.

56
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:02,770
Let me add some padding quickly and then refresh the page that looks better.

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,200
Let's add some more functionality right now our scatterplot helps us visualize the relationship between

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,180
two variables life expectancy and births per capita.

59
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,150
But we can visualize even more relationships by adjusting other aspects of the circles.

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,000
To other attributes we could adjust based on the data or the fill in the radius.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,190
Let's use these attributes to make our visualization a little more interesting.

62
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,220
For the Phil will adjust the color based on the country's population density.

63
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:39,770
That is it's population divided by its area let's cover things so that low densities are green and high

64
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,850
densities are black.

65
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,360
How can we do this scale linier is got us covered.

66
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,590
It can do more than Map numbers to numbers.

67
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,110
It can also map numbers to colors.

68
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,320
Check it out this scale works by converting colors to R.G. B values.

69
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:03,060
So the smallest density gets mapped green the largest gets mapped to black and so on with this scale

70
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,940
we can now adjust the field based on the population density

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,280
nice as you can see.

72
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,330
It looks like one country has a particularly high density Wesley.

73
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,390
Let's use the radius to provide us with some more insight on what the radius of each circle be based

74
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,190
just on the number of births not on the births per capita.

75
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,330
For this we'll need one more scale.

76
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:37,820
There we go now our scatterplot helps us to visualize the relationship between four variables births

77
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,380
births per capita life expectancy and population density.

78
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,660
That's it for now in the next video.

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,770
We'll keep working on this graph so that we can improve its readability.
