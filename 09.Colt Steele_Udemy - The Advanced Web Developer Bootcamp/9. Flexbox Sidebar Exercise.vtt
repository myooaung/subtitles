00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.120
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.440
So we've made it through our first couple of flex bikes properties.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.350
I know there's a lot of them and going through one at a time.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.460
It's maybe not the most exciting thing.

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.040
So I'm trying to break it up with a quick little exercise here.

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.180
We'll make something that might actually be useful or at least a little component that will be useful

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.980
later on.

8
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.850
So what we're going to do is do an exercise but because it's very early and if you're brand new to flex

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.180
Xbox this might be a bit intimidating.

10
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.570
I'm going to give some optional hints at the end of this video.

11
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.790
So introduce what it looks like.

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.650
Show you the starter code show you the end result and then you can pause the video and do the exercise.

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.310
Or you could look at the hints if you want a little extra assistance.

14
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.240
I'd definitely recommend you try it without the hints.

15
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.000
And then if you need them look at the end of the video and then as always in the next video I'll have

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.890
a solution.

17
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.140
So what do you make.

18
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.920
It's going to be a sidebar on the left side of a web page.

19
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220
Here is the starter code.

20
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.630
This is not the finished product.

21
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.530
We have a couple of five different things links that are up at the top left and you'll use fluxbox to

22
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.460
arrange them in a nicer way.

23
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.200
So they look like this.

24
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.250
So very simple.

25
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.170
Like I said just a couple of lines of flex block CSSA you'll need to do three items on top two on the

26
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.720
bottom.

27
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.300
And along with that I'll show you the working code.

28
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.390
Here it is.

29
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.130
It's also as I scroll down you'll see things adjust.

30
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.600
And then what do you know something happens.

31
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.650
How do we do that.

32
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.420
Well there's a property in fluxbox.

33
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.360
So doing this without Fluxbox is doable but if you know how to do that just put that aside and do it

34
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.360
with fluxbox because it's much easier and much faster.

35
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.190
OK so that if you feel like you're good to go Here's a starter code.

36
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.480
This is what it looks like.

37
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.530
We've got a div that has everything inside of it with a class called sidebar.

38
00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.490
And then we have two divs the class called Section and instead of those We've got three items and two

39
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.490
items.

40
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.880
So don't change edged him out unless you want to style unless you want to add something to make it even

41
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.710
harder or you want to update the text or something to suit your needs.

42
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.400
All you need to do is come over here and update some of the styles.

43
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.240
I will add a quick note that fluxbox on its own will get you very close but you'll need something to

44
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.620
add some space here.

45
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.390
If you care about that to make it a little nicer using some other non flex box properties.

46
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.950
But that's not really the point of this.

47
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.660
OK.

48
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.670
So if you're ready to go give it a shot.

49
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.120
Open up.

50
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.190
This started code and try it out.

51
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.980
If you do want some hints here we go positivity if you don't want them really just one hint here.

52
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.510
Just to show you how this actually breaks down.

53
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.490
So this is the item you'll make the flex container.

54
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.900
So this section this div that houses everything.

55
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.060
It's a flex container.

56
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.620
And then inside of it there are just two items this top one and this bottom div and the key has to do

57
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.740
with how they're arranged.

58
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.640
So a lot of times people have trouble thinking about this in terms or a lot of times people have trouble

59
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.040
with flex blocks early on thinking in terms of columns versus rows because rows are I guess easier to

60
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.070
wrap your head around to conceptualize.

61
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.060
But this needs to be a column.

62
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.000
And if you think about it that way if this is the main axis we have this space and it's being shared

63
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.730
evenly or split evenly between these two between.

64
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.680
That's the end the space between these two items.

65
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.940
And then the last thing I'll say is that if you want to add some space here you can just use padding

66
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.920
or margin if you want it to do that.

67
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.620
And then to get the wrapping to work this part right here kind of gave the hint.

68
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.470
There's another property you can use.

69
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.390
OK.

70
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.690
So give that a shot in the next video.

71
00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.530
I'll have a solution.
