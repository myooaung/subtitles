1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,010
All right.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,650
So let's go over a solution to the Sungai exercise.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,080
This is just my solution my version.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,210
Like I said in the initial video where I introduced the problem there's not just one way of doing this.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,260
What's really more important is that you have two of these animations going at once something that's

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,800
relatively like a son and something that's relatively like the sky.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,480
So we'll start off by implementing these sky animation.

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,660
Here's a little helper chart that I made.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,770
So we have six different frames that we care about the six percentage values and corresponding background

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,320
colors.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,550
So we want to go from dark blue to pink to blue to blue to pink to dark blue.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,400
So the colors themselves aren't that important.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,700
I'll start off with just black pink and blue and then I'll go put the appropriate hexadecimal codes

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,850
if you care to see what colors I used.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,640
So let's do that.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,490
Now here I have a starter code.

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:57,030
The first thing I can do is define my animation and let's call this actually what I'll do is make this

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,090
bigger.

19
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,560
The only problem with that said it will cut off part of the sky and the grass to the right.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,840
So it makes everything bigger but it also impacts the trajectory of our sun which you will see in a

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,330
moment.

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,480
But for now we have a bigger font and we'll do keyframes.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,660
We need a name.

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:23,640
I'll just call this cycle sky colors whatever you want to call it and we'll add our values.

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,350
So we have our 0 percent will do background color is do black.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,440
And then we have our next one 10 percent background color was pink.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
And then I'm just going to copy those but change this to be 90.

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,290
We want to go back to pink.

29
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:51,090
And then at 100 I want to be back to black then in the middle we have 30 and 70 that we want to be blue

30
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,210
and you might be wondering why do we need to say that twice.

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,980
Why not just say 50 percent we want it to be blue.

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,760
And the answer has to do with how the actual transition from pink to blue occurs.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,470
So if I just if I didn't have these two instances if I only change the color to blue one time halfway

34
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:15,240
through sunrise or the let's call it golden hour between pink and blue would take a long time until

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:22,530
it gets to halfway and then it would not stay blue at all it would be pure blue for one moment and then

36
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,520
it would start transitioning back to pink.

37
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,500
But in reality the sky is blue for a long time in the day.

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,690
There's only a short moment where it goes from pink or yellow or whatever color the sky is at sunrise

39
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,710
until it turns full blue.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,010
So that's why I did it.

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:44,730
But I'll show you if we put in 50 percent and I just make background color blue.

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,280
Then of course we now need to get this running but we have it defined.

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,290
We'll go up to our body.

44
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,740
This is the sky right here.

45
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,430
This is the thing that we're changing so if I made this pink You can see that's what we want to affect.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:07,470
So we'll add our animation name which was Cycle sky colors colors or colored colors and then we need

47
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,760
to do a couple of other things.

48
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,370
Animation duration how long should it take let's say five seconds to start.

49
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,560
And as soon as I say we can see it runs but of course only runs one time and then we're done.

50
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:27,860
So let's change that to animation iteration count infinite.

51
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,980
And let's just add animation to play zero which we don't have to be explicit about but it's better to

52
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,700
do that.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,260
OK.

54
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,470
So what keeps you running.

55
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,880
Now if we pay attention to this you'll see that.

56
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,410
Oh.

57
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,160
Another thing that we could do before I forget is add animation timing function.

58
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,630
Let's make that linear.

59
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,920
So that we have the same transitions between all of them.

60
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,120
So let's start off okay.

61
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,830
And those black very quick to pink and it transitions to blue and then a long transition to pink.

62
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,490
But if I change the order here instead of doing 50 percent it should be blue.

63
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:19,640
If I instead say at 30 percent and 70 percent we want it to go back to blue.

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,270
You'll see now that it stays blue for a long while in the middle and then goes back to pink.

65
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,930
Hopefully you can see the difference on the video.

66
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,610
If not if you care.

67
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,860
Play around with your own values or rewind and you'll definitely notice it.

68
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,070
So now let's focus on the sun.

69
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,950
So the specifics of the exact path you have the sun take the exact shades of color don't matter really

70
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,650
what I want to see is that you have a sun starting roughly in the bottom left and in the bottom right

71
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,440
and it goes up at some point and comes back down.

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,540
Now the angles and everything doesn't matter.

73
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,260
Maybe you want to make it a nicer arc.

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,290
This is not really that accurate for how the sun actually moves but the keyframes that I defined the

75
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,490
percentages are zero 25 50 75 and 100 percent.

76
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,170
And we'll start getting it to move.

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,080
We'll ignore the color until the end.

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,300
So to move what we're going to do we could we have a couple options but the one we use is transform

79
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,400
translate.

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,160
That's the best the most optimal way to move an item on the page as far as the browser rendering process.

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,430
As I explained in a previous video so we'll hop over to Copenhagen and the first thing we'll do is define

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,300
that animation.

83
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,200
So keyframes let's call it Sun motion.

84
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,680
Sort of sounds like a startup name or something on motion.

85
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,380
So we have that in there and the next thing that we'll do is let's start with just zero percent and

86
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,210
then 100 percent.

87
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,810
So the start and the Finish we'll have it move across the screen on the x axis.

88
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:55,890
So at 0 percent we'll do transform translate as to zero pixels comment your pixels We'll have it start

89
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,920
where it is.

90
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,310
But then at 100 percent

91
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,700
we'll have it move over to the right part of the screen and this number will depend on your your screen

92
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,090
and basically the computer you are using so I'm going to do 1920 pixels.

93
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,000
It doesn't really matter what you do do something experiment with a number that works best but don't

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
spend too much time.

95
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,000
So we have that defined.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:31,400
Now we need to go and assign that information to the sun selector sun motion and then we'll add in a

97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,310
duration.

98
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,550
Make it match what we have for the sky which is five seconds.

99
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,470
And if we hit save you'll see it starts moving not only goes once.

100
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,950
Let's be explicit and add an animation iteration count which should be infinite and also add an estimation

101
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,140
timing function which should be linear for us.

102
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,690
OK so we have the sun moving across the screen and it keeps going.

103
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,310
If I zoom out you can actually see how far it goes all the way to the edge of the screen.

104
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,870
And then wraps around it.

105
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,840
There's a couple things that are different though than the solution.

106
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,410
If you look here and let me zoom out to 100 percent you'll see that the sun actually sets below the

107
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,070
grass.

108
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,670
So that's something to consider.

109
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,620
We'll come back to that.

110
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,460
Let's now focus on the 25 50 and 75 percent frames.

111
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,270
So we'll go back and define those zoom back in so you can read this a bit better.

112
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:32,970
Here we go.

113
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:44,660
So at our 25 percent are 50 percent and 75 percent and inside of them we'll be doing a transform translates

114
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,360
so I'll copy that but we're going to have different numbers of course.

115
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:57,830
So the numbers that I have personally for this first one are going to go to 330 pixels at 25 percent

116
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,480
followed by zero pixels Y.

117
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,590
And then we'll go to 860 for our halfway point.

118
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,810
And we're also going to go negative 50 on the y axis which will make it rise up and get cut off a little

119
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,240
bit by the top of the page which is a choice that I made I want it to continue to move upwards.

120
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,930
Then we have 75 percent which will have sort of 1920.

121
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,760
We have 13 ninety pixels 0 pixels on the y axis.

122
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:36,090
So if I save and I zoom out you'll see that I have a rough arc but it's not quite there based off of

123
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,620
the start.

124
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,770
And it kind of started setting and then it flattened out.

125
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,390
So to fix that I will translate 200 pixels down on the y axis at the beginning.

126
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:53,930
So it rises from below and you will also end 200 pixels below and define zoom out to 100 percent.

127
00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:00,540
If you take a look it's close but there's still a problem over here where the starting position of the

128
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,960
sun is already on screen on the x coordinate as well.

129
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,010
So you can see it starts about over here.

130
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,480
Not in the corner.

131
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,680
So we can change that by just shifting it minus 200 pixels to the left.

132
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,700
And now you'll see it starts rising from the corner and setting in the corner.

133
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,050
But like I said in the assignment video did not want you to get hung up on the exact coordinates.

134
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,200
It can be frustrating.

135
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,550
What's more important is that you just have it going up and down.

136
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,190
It could be setting or rising here and setting here for all I care.

137
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
So the last thing is the color.

138
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,590
So if we go back to our guide it should be orange here and then change to yellow at 25 percent and then

139
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,940
yellow and yellow for 50 and 75 and change to red or orange red at 100 percent.

140
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,980
So we can do that very easily.

141
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,240
All we want to say is that 0 percent background color should be orange.

142
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:00,190
And then at 25 percent should change to yellow.

143
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,970
And then at 100 percent we want it to go back will not go back.

144
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,820
But we want to make it read is is close but you'll see that it's yellow and then it starts changing

145
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,790
to read the entire way down basically between 25 and 100.

146
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,670
We don't want that.

147
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,460
So we're going to duplicate background color yellow at 75 percent.

148
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,630
So it should stay yellow from 25 to 75.

149
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,140
You can see it now it starts transitioning.

150
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,140
Perfect.

151
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,750
So let me slow everything down so we can just take a closer look.

152
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,620
Ten seconds.

153
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,730
And also this one should be at 10 seconds.

154
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,220
They start at the same time there's no delay.

155
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:43,160
Now you can see that it goes pink for a bit the sky stays blue for a long time as does the sun with

156
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,780
yellow.

157
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,370
And then they both transition to sunset colors sunsets and it starts over.

158
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,980
So we have two animations going with two different sets of intervals.

159
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:59,770
We're doing quarters over here even quarters in here we're working with zero 10 30 70 and so on.

160
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,640
Now if you do care about the exact hexadecimal codes that are used you can come over here and look at

161
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,760
them inside of the code pen.

162
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,490
Basically I just use typical flat colors instead of doing the default USS Blue or yellow.

163
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,240
I use these hexadecimal codes.

164
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,100
So if you want look at the solution that I've posted and you can use those exact colors if you care.

165
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,060
All right.

166
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,170
So that wraps up the exercise.

167
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,080
Hopefully you are able to see how easy it is to actually get a keyframe animation working maybe how

168
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,440
frustrating it can be to to deal with animating translations transformations dealing with pixels and

169
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,750
coordinates and all that.

170
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,730
Either way hopefully I had a good experience.

171
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,250
All right.

172
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:40,830
That wraps it up.
