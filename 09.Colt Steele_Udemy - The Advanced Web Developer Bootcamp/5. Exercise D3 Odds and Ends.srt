00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,540
Welcome back in this exercise your goal is to build a new visualization that incorporates a tooltip

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,280
and transitions while pulling data from an external file.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,200
There are a number of free data sources online.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:20,620
You can look at data from the UN the United States Census the World Bank or something else you find

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,570
on your own.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,930
I've provided a few links in the resources.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,280
Here's a sample project you could build.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,910
I've pulled a bunch of data from the World Bank so that I can graph methane versus CO2 emissions per

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,990
capita for different regions around the world.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,550
I'm also visualizing the percentage of energy consumption that comes from renewables with the fill green

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,950
circles represent regions with a higher proportion of renewable energy use.

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,230
Lastly the size of the circle corresponds to the fraction of the region's population that is urban larger

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,140
circles correspond to regions that are more urban as you can see.

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,040
I've got a tool tip that provides details when I mouse over a circle.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:08,370
I've also got a range and but update the year on page load and when I update the year the circles don't

16
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,660
move automatically.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,510
Instead they transition smoothly between their previous state and their new state this visualization

18
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,880
is a little more advanced because I had to pull data from a few different cxxviii files but even though

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,400
the amount of data being graphed is substantial.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,450
The code I used here is all stuff I've seen before.

21
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,000
Good luck working on your own visualization.

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,830
Make sure to create your own tool tip.

23
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,540
Add some transitions and pull data from an external file source using one of the methods we learned

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,260
about in the last video such as D-3 dots ESV or D-3 digests on.

25
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,980
I'll show you my code for this visualization in the next video.
