Hi there Natalie here in this video I'd like to introduce the CSSA project will be working on together

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.170
here I've got a sample Mark Page for a web site that offers adventure tours in the mountains.

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.960
When I load the page I've got a couple of CSSA animations and then I can scroll down the page to see

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.480
more details on these mountain adventures.

5
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.130
This site uses fluxbox.

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.990
And as you can see it's also responsive if you'd like to recreate this page on your own free.

7
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.920
I've got some starter code in the resources along with screenshots of what the page should look like.

8
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.340
By doing a project like this from scratch will definitely be a bit of a challenge.

9
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.890
So don't worry if you get stuck in the next few videos I'll thoroughly walk through the code used to

10
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.600
create this page.

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.970
So if you rather code along step by step that works to when you're ready to see the code used to build

12
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.840
this page I'll see you in the next video.
