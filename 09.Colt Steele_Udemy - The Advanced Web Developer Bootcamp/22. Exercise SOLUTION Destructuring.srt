00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,530
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,640
In this video we're going to go for solutions to the restructuring exercise.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,160
The first function we need to implement is called displaced student info and it accepts an object inside

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,990
of this object.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Will this structure the keys of first and last and then return a string.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,860
Your full name is first and last.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,400
You can use template strings to help clean up our code for the next function.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,370
Print full name will be doing something very similar except here will directly restructure from the

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:35,310
parameters so I will place an object with the keys of first and last as a parameter to the function

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,720
inside of this function will return the string.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:46,260
Your full name is first last and once again use template strings to help clean up our code in the next

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,680
function.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,790
Create student.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:54,120
We're going to pass in a structured object that has a default parameter with the keys of likes javascript

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,250
and the value of true and likes.

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,770
Yes 2015 with a value of true.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,150
We also need to make sure that we assign this to an object.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,010
Now let's create a string called Start with the value of the student and then write a little bit of

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,130
conditional logic to see if likes javascript and likes.

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,350
Yes 2015 are both true.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,990
If so will concatenate to the string likes javascript and yes 2015 if likes javascript is true will

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,980
simply just add like javascript.

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,530
Otherwise we'll see if likes.

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,670
Yes 2015 is true and if so we'll add likes.

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,930
Yes 2015 to the string.

26
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,120
If none of these conditions are true we'll simply add does not like much.

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,790
Finally all return our strict for the final exercise we're going to write a function called reverse

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,500
array which is going to use array destructuring to swap values in an array.

29
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,800
Will Start by creating a loop and initializing a variable.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,540
A zero will loop as long as I is less than the length divided by two.

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,850
Since we're going to start from the beginning and end we only need to go up to the middle we'll then

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,870
increment by one at each iteration inside of the loop.

33
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:11,280
We're going to take the value at eye and the value add array Len minus one minus I which will start

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,560
at the very end and go towards the middle and we will assign it to its opposite.

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,480
What we're doing here is destructuring the array and swapping the values in the beginning and the end

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,360
and working our way to the middle.

37
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,620
When we're done looping will return the array and that's it for the destructuring exercises.

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,550
See I'm in the next video.
