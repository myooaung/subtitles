1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,940
I want to start introducing our first container right now and the first container is going to be called

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,860
nav bar dodginess now part of us is going to be pretty simple.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,890
We're really just going to display a couple of links in an avatar.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,170
This will allow us to log in and sign up as we continue adding authentication.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,880
The text of this nav bar will change if the users logged in or not on their side then they'll be able

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,630
to log out and create a message.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,310
Right now we just bottlings for sign up and log in for worry about the number.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,350
Let's make sure that we use bootstrapped Stout's application.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,960
So let's go to bootstrap Let's go grab the latest CDN for bootstrap for software can download scroll

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,110
down a little bit and go make sure that we grab this link.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,850
We're not aware of that bootstrap Javascript.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,810
So we're just going to get to yes us and inside of our application are indexed at each DML.

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,810
We're just going to paste in that link.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,560
We'll also have a link to this in the notes you can access it faster in the terminal was going start

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,450
this application and see if our Hello world looks just a little bit better.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,030
And it looks like we have great if we want to double check this.

17
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,320
We can go to the Network tab.

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,670
Click on CSX and the first page and it looks like bootstrap is actually being loaded.

19
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,330
That's great.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,150
Now we have this track.

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,410
Let's actually start building this nav bar inside of our nav bar.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,900
Yes.

23
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,630
We're going to place this nav bar inside of containers because this is also going to connect to the

24
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,510
redux store number the number is going to change if the user is authenticate it.

25
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,070
And if the users authenticated will display some information for logging out or creating a message.

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,460
But right now we're not going to worry about that.

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,270
So what kind of things do we need in order to have our For First we get to import react.

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,170
And will the structure component from react.

29
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,710
You're going to see this all over the place.

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,960
We're also going to include the link component from re-act router.

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,550
And since this is a container we also want to connect it to our redock store.

32
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:11,390
So import connect from reata redux the glue between those two.

33
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:18,430
All we want to do is make a class called nav bar that extends a compile and inside of our component.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,170
We also want to make sure that we render and when we render we're going to return some GSX what are

35
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,110
we going to return.

36
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:32,380
Let's start with an element with a class of NFR nap or extend expand some bootstrap for classes just

37
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,500
to get us started.

38
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,830
We're also going to want a class of container fluid to make sure we get a full width and inside here

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,170
we're also going to have a link that takes us to the home page and this link I'm home in is coming from

40
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,900
re-act router Dohm that allows us to build navigation.

41
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,990
We want to make sure we use the link tag and not an anchor tag.

42
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,960
We'll also add a class name of nav bar.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,910
Brant let's also make sure we close that link tag and close those quotes with Barbara and inside of

44
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,800
this link we'll place an image with an RC of what will be the logo.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,950
Right now we don't have the images yet so we'll just add an alt of warbler home will add these images

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,810
a little bit later.

47
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,250
Let's just get the setup done first.

48
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,290
So when we click on this we would like to go back to this route.

49
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,480
We don't have any route set up.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,960
We're just building the nav bar to get things started.

51
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:40,250
So it's at and what else do you want to do was add a little bit more to or for now after the did.

52
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,140
We're going to have a know with a glass of now I've never been out of that bar.

53
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,030
Right.

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,140
This is going to push these elements that we placed inside of you to the right of our number one make

55
00:03:51,140 --> 00:04:01,910
a list item with a link inside and this link is going to go to slash south.

56
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,930
Right now we don't actually have these routes.

57
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,950
We're just building a couple of links and so take us to the sign up page and component.

58
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,060
We don't have that yet once again.

59
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,890
We're just building some links to start with our navigation.

60
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,310
Let's make another one that's going to go to sign him.

61
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,660
And that allows me to log in.

62
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,280
So I'm not worried too much about connecting things to the Reebok store but we're going to need here

63
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,210
eventually is the current user because if the current users authenticated we don't want to show them

64
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,190
sign of in logon we want to show them something different.

65
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,420
So let's actually just make a function call it maps to props and then start connecting to our redux

66
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,040
or do we pass in some state from the redux.

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,710
We return an object and the current user will be placed on props and the value will be from state.

68
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:49,730
Everything we get on the current user We're then going to export this de-evolved connect and we're going

69
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,580
to ram with maps the props.

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,300
We don't have a map dispatched to props so we can just pasand No this is going to change a little bit

71
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,320
and we'll wrap this again in and out our.

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,750
So we're not using the redux story yet but it's going to be important later.

73
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,780
So we're going to come back to this when the user is authenticated and change those links from Sign

74
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,210
up to sign in to create a message and log out.

75
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,560
We'll come back to this in a little bit.

76
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,850
But we're setting up the foundation to heal to come back and easily add that functionality.

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,590
So let's see if this and that and our.

78
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,370
Let's go make sure we wondered the nav bar.

79
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:33,580
So inside of our address we're going to wrap all of this and itive will get this div a class name of

80
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,360
onboarding.

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,950
Well style is a little bit later.

82
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,630
This is just a nice wrapper div and a wrapper class for our two components that we placed inside of

83
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,920
here.

84
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,820
We'll have a class with nav bar and we'll add another one later.

85
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,730
We'll have a component of nav bar but we have to make sure that we import that nav bar from that flashed

86
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:57,850
nav bar which can take a look at what this looks like now in the browser and you look at that beautiful

87
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,810
number I promise we'll style it in a little bit.

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,890
I just want to start with the functionality to sign up and log in.

89
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,640
If you could do wrong you would actually see the routes change.

90
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,810
We just don't have any components that are being rendered when we go to those routes.

91
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,230
What we'll do in the next section is make this nav bar a little bit nicer and add another component

92
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,390
to display a homepage.
