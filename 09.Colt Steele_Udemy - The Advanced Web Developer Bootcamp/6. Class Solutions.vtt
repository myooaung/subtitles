Welcome back in this video we're going to be going over solutions to the Klasky word exercise here.

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.820
We need to refactor a constructor function from S 5 to use the new as 2015 class syntax.

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.180
So we'll start with the class keyword and specify the name of our class which is person and place curly

4
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.370
braces after inside.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.020
We'll define any methods for our class.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.960
The first method we need to define is a special method called constructor which will accept a first

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.770
name last name.

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.660
Favorite color and favorite number inside of here will place code very similar to what we would have

9
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.280
in our constructor function.

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.200
By assigning properties onto the keyword this let's assign first name last name favorite color and favorite

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.670
number to be properties on the keyword this with values as the parameters passed to the constructor.

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.340
The second method we need to add to our class is an instance method called Multiply favorite number

13
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.820
which accepts as a parameter a number and returns that number multiplied by the favorite number property

14
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.690
for every object created from this class using the new keyword inside of this instance method will multiply

15
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.390
the number passed to the method and the favorite number property for the object we're invoking it on.

16
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.350
And that's all for these exercises.

17
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.910
See you in the next video.
