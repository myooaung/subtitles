00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.860
Welcome back in this video we're going to introduce the assignment.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.130
You'll be working on which is to refactor some S-5 code into 2015.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.190
We're going to be using everything we've learned in the previous section to examine the code base and

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.730
include some E.S. 2015 features that we have seen.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.030
If you're not familiar with the term refactoring it means restructuring existing code without changing

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.610
its external behavior.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.230
If we've refactored correctly our application should do exactly what it was doing before but our code

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.020
should be more readable and understandable.

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.540
Now that we have an idea of what will be doing let's take a look at the application will refactor.

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.400
Here we have a game called Guess the password which gives a list of potential passwords and we have

11
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.680
to try to guess the correct one if we're wrong.

12
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.650
We'll see how many letters in our guests are in the correct password.

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.720
So let's get started.

14
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.050
Here we see quite a few words and we have to figure out which one is the password.

15
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.540
So let's try one you'll see here we have a certain amount of letters that the password contains.

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.720
So let's keep guessing until we find the correct one.

17
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840
If we get it right we can play again.

18
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.760
You'll see here but we're starting with 10 words and four guesses.

19
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.900
Feel free to try out the game a couple of times before looking at the code.

20
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.620
And when you're ready there's a link to the get hub repository.

21
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.090
If you'd like to see the code.

22
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.220
And there's also a zip file included in the section notes so you can get up and running right away.

23
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.800
All you need to do is open the index that HD and all file in the next video will walk through the code

24
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.030
and see where we can refactor to use yes 2015.

25
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.810
See there.
