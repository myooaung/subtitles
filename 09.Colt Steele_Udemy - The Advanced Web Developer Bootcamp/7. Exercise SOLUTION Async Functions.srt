Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,420
In this video we're going to be going over solutions to the async functions exercise here.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,660
We're going to be reacting some of the solutions to the promises exercises but we'll be using yes 2017

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,260
async functions.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,160
Take a look at the get most followers function first will start by making sure that this is an async

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,700
function using the async keyword.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:30,030
We'll then make sure that we create a variable and assign it to the result of a waiting a promise we

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:38,100
can take out any DOT bands and just make sure that we have the same exact output as before for the next

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,840
function starwars string.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,690
Let's prefix this function with the async keyword and make sure that we start removing all of the dot

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,480
bands for each of our AJAX calls.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,210
We need to make sure that we assign variables to be the result of a weighting each one of these promises.

13
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,480
So let's go through each one of these and make sure that nowhere there are any chance we'll make sure

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,980
that all of our AJAX calls are also prefixed with the away keyword.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,990
Let's just make sure we name our variables appropriately and make sure we're still outputting the same

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,030
information as above.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,090
That looks great.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,140
And that's all for these exercises.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,290
See you in the next video.
