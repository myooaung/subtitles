00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,470
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,080
In this video I'll walk you through my solution to the pie chart exercise.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,130
In the last video you may remember that I recommended you build this chart in three stages.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,210
First build the chart for a single year.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,450
Next get the range input working so that you can change the year and finally add the inner chart that

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,710
shows data by quarter rather than by month.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,540
Let's walk through the solution in these stages.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,830
First I'll build the pie chart for the first year in the data set.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,400
Just like in the earlier videos on pie charts I'll begin by setting an SPG width and height and by calculating

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,430
the minimum year my dataset Eventually I'd like to color code each one of my arcs to prepare for this.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,150
I'll build an ordinal scale to convert months to colors to do this.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,570
Let me first create an array of months.

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,450
This array will be important later on because the months are arranged in chronological order.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,260
Next I'll create an array of colors these colors are based on D-3 scheme category 20 but include colors

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,860
that are not part of that scheme.

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,220
Cool once I have these two arrays I can create a color scale using scale ordinal.

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,580
My months will be their domain and my colors will be the range.

18
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,210
Let's hop into the console and test the scale out as you can see the first month is mapped to the first

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,770
color the second month is mapped to the second color and so on.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,350
Next let's take care of some basic setup for the chart.

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,780
First I'll select the SPG set it to what height and store it in a variable.

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,990
Then I'll append the group to the SVGA that will be the basis for my chart.

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,970
Just like we've seen before.

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,630
I'll center this group and give it a class so that I can easily target it later.

25
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,440
I'll also append a text element to the top of the SPG.

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,950
I'll add a class to it.

27
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,000
Center it and style little bit.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,150
In order to reduce code duplication I'd like to try a function that's responsible for drawing the graph.

29
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,140
This may seem like overkill now but it will be a lifesaver when we want to get the range and coworking

30
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:22,190
so I'll write a function called Drog wrath which takes in a year based on the year of my data set.

31
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,380
I also set up my pie chart.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,390
I'll create a variable called Arkes and assign the value based on the 3 pi.

33
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,010
I'll use the value method to specify I want to graph births and I'll use the sort method to sort my

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:42,840
Ark's here I want to sort things chronologically so I'll use the index of the month in my ordered month's

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,400
array to determine the sort order.

36
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,430
After that I'll create a path function using D-3 that arc.

37
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,790
Since I know I'll add an inverter later.

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,430
For now I'll set the inner radius to be positive.

39
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,070
Now I also left my chart group create an empty selection and join the data I get back when I pass my

40
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,910
year data into the Ark's function.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,200
I'll store this in a variable called outer.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,420
Since it's the outer chart one thing that's nice about this chart is that the number of arms is always

43
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,140
the same.

44
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,740
So I never have to hop into the exit selection instead for any you arx out a class of Arc and set the

45
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,900
fill for the merged selection I just need to update the attribute.

46
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,580
Note that this Enter selection only matters the first time I draw the graph.

47
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,970
After that the update selection is the only one that will have anything in it.

48
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,470
Finally I'll update the text in the title.

49
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:46,340
I do it here rather than when I originally appended the text element so that I can avoid some duplication

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,590
when I need to update the text.

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,830
Now all I need to do is call this function and pass in many

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,150
next stage too.

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,240
Here's where having the drug graph function really pays off.

54
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,360
First I'll put the input into the DML and set it step to one.

55
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,960
I'll also Center it in the ss.

56
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,940
After that I'll use the readout Max to grab the largest year and then all I need to do is select this

57
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:25,010
input set it's min max and its value and inside of the event handler for input events call the draw

58
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:35,300
graph function and Hassen the event target value looking good stage to complete for the final stage.

59
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,350
I've just got to do a few more things.

60
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,590
First I'll create an array of four colors for the forequarters I'll also need to append a new chart

61
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,450
group.

62
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,060
I'll give this one a class of inner chart.

63
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,180
I'll also need to tabulate Earth counts by quarter in order to do that.

64
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,900
Write a helper method called Get data by quarter which does exactly that.

65
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,280
Given some yearly data I'll first create an array which keeps track of births for each quarter then

66
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,010
a loop through my data and store the current element in a variable called row.

67
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,400
I can determine the quarter for row based on its month's position in the ordered month.

68
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:22,560
For example if its index is 0 1 or 2 it must be in the first quarter this expression will give me the

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,180
quarter for any of my objects.

70
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,540
Once I have the right quarter I can update the appropriate object in my order Talley's array.

71
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,160
Finally once I'm done looping I can return my tallies by quarter

72
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,670
next.

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,770
I'll need different pine arc helpers for the second chart to generate the arc objects.

74
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,280
I'll use D-3 PI and passen the same callback to the value method.

75
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:53,660
But now I can just sort by the value of the porter key my inner path will also be similar though the

76
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,960
Radie I will be different.

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Once I have these I can join my data to Ark's inside of the inner chart by taking my year data call

78
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,270
and get data by quarter on it and calling in a Arc's on that.

79
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,780
Then I can go through the same patternist before I didn't set up a color scale so I'll just keep things

80
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,700
simple and use the index to find the right color in my quarter colors array.

81
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,110
Also I need to use my inner path function to set the attribute instead of my path function.

82
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,850
That's it.

83
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,070
Let's save and refresh great now.

84
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,270
Stage 3 is complete.

85
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,490
I hope this video was helpful.

86
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,950
This completes the section on intermediate D-3 in the next section will cover some miscellaneous topics

87
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,280
that we haven't been able to get around to yet.

88
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,680
I'll see you there.
