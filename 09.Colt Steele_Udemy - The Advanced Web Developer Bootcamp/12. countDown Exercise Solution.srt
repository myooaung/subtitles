1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,250
Let's take a look at a solution to this countdown problem.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,510
So I'm going to start off with the name of my function countdown and it's going to take in the number

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:19,080
of seconds I want to count down until now remember the goal of this function is to console log.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,980
Let's say if I passen for here it will console log for.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,960
Wait a second.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,930
Three.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,070
Wait one more second to one.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,000
And then finally cancel log ring ring ring and stop counting down after that.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,980
So I know I'm going to need a set interval.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,300
And I also know that that set is going to need to stop.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,170
So we'll save the interval ID

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,650
I'll pass in my non-MS function here.

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,330
And because this countdown is going to print something every second I want this to run every 1000 milliseconds

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,460
or every second.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,960
All right.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,870
Next up we will subtract the number of seconds that we've got.

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:19,680
So since this runs after a second we will start off by subtracting and then if my seconds are greater

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,280
than zero

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,400
so that's when I want to just print the number that I have right now.

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,340
And otherwise

21
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,650
I want to cancel log.

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:55,720
Ring ring ring.

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,650
And at this point we know that we counted down to zero and we don't want to count down any more.

24
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:06,940
So I also want to clear my interval and I'll pass in the interval ID that we saved up here.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:08,980
All right.

26
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,220
So that should do it.

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,270
Let's test it out.

28
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,290
I'm going to count down.

29
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,060
Let's use for

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,430
three to one.

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,600
Ring ring ring.

32
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,670
And now we're done.

33
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,900
There's nothing left to do.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,990
So the interval is stopped.
