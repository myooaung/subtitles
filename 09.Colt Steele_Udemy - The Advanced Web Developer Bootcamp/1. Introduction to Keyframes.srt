1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,620
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,650
So the next big animation topic will cover has to do with keyframe animations.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,020
Now keyframes are another tool in the animation arsenal but unlike transition's they allow us to build

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,470
much more complex multi component multi-state animations and on top of that they also allow us a lot

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,030
more control over the details of how the animation works.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,620
Things like the timing when it starts.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,670
How many times it repeats and so on.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,780
So we'll see how they work in just a moment but first let's compare them to what we know transitions

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,890
so transitions allow us to animate a single state change.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,540
We have a red circle and it changes to a yellow circle and we can tell it how long that transition should

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,970
take or we have a square and it's actually animating to a circle because a border radius and so on.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,010
Or we can have multiple things that are changing at once right.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,370
We could have a square that's changing to a circle and at the same time the background color changes.

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,880
But it's one state to another state a start and an end.

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,920
Keyframes allow for much more complex multi state animations so that we don't just have a beginning

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,390
and end point but we can define as many in-between points as we want.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,970
So that's really really important to making complex awesome animations.

18
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,240
So here's a little diagram I made for transitions.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,780
We can go from state A to state B.

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:29,640
Here we have an orange circle going to a red circle and we have control over how long it takes the timing

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,150
function.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,670
If there's a delay but that's pretty much it.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,560
But with keyframes we can do things like this.

24
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,410
Let's say we have that same orange circle and we want it to end up as a red circle.

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,120
We could do that with the transition but what about if we want other things to happen along the way.

26
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,650
Well suppose this is mimicking a sun.

27
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,010
So we have sunrise and sunset.

28
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,640
What we want to happen in between is the sun is going to rise up using transformed translate and it's

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,540
going to change color.

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,800
It's going to become yellow in the middle of the day.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,490
So we could move the sun up and over to the right.

32
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,700
We could make it a little bit lighter orange.

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,130
And then we could continue that make it yellow at the middle of the day and move it upwards into the

34
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,710
right and then maybe this is noon towards the afternoon.

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,020
It moves back down stays yellow and then finally it ends up as red at the end.

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,890
So rather than going directly from A to E in this case or 8 A B we're actually going A to B to C to

37
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,780
D E.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,460
So we have a lot more control we can define these these points along the way that we want things to

39
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,180
happen at.

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,670
So I can say exactly halfway through if this is the beginning and this is the end exactly halfway through.

41
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:52,440
It should be let's say 300 pixels up and 300 pixels over and it should be yellow and then I could say

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,470
well actually in between that at 25 percent of the way through or 75 percent we can define these key

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,810
frames and to turn keyframe.

44
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,570
So later on we'll actually have an exercise where we build a rising sun like this rising slashed setting.

45
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,310
And we also will have a sky in the background that's changing to the appropriate color if it's sunrise

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,230
or sunset noon night time and so on.

47
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,420
So that's coming up.

48
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,740
But let's start off with something a little bit tackier a little flashier.

49
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,450
We're going to make some animated text that flashes the colors of a rainbow while also growing and shrinking.

50
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,250
Maybe a sort of a throwback to the early 90s Internet ads.

51
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,080
And the reason we're going to do this is that I think will help explain how keyframes work and the basic

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,210
structure of them.

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,690
So here I have a timeline.

54
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,100
It goes from zero to the end of the animation in the very beginning to the end 0 and 100.

55
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,490
And the way that keyframes work is that along that interval we can define at any point that we want

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,340
a keyframe I can say that halfway through something should happen or 1 percent of the way through or

57
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,810
79 percent of the way through something else should happen.

58
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,140
Now I'm only going to do very basic ones here.

59
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,630
As you can see we've got a 25 percent 50 75 percent and 100 percent.

60
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,480
So I'd broken it into quarters but we could continue to break this or break it into an even intervals

61
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,110
which we'll see you later on.

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,390
So what we're going to do again is have some texts.

63
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,340
Let's say it's a paragraph and at the beginning I can say OK.

64
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,400
0 percent.

65
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,720
It should be red color of red and the font size should be 20 pixels.

66
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,870
And then at 25 percent color should be orange then at 50 percent.

67
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,050
The color should change to yellow and the font size should be 40 pixels.

68
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,220
So what will happen is that from 0 to 25 it'll go from red to orange 25 to 50 Ogo from orange to yellow.

69
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,720
But then we have font size and we only specify it at 0 and 50.

70
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,420
So that font size will change from 20 to 40 evenly across this interval here.

71
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,010
So we don't have to specify we want it to be 30 pixels here.

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,130
So then at 75 percent will change color to green and then 100 percent will change color to blue and

73
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,690
font size.

74
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,960
We'll go back to 20.

75
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,170
So what will happen let's just focus on the color that all change fade between red orange yellow green

76
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,440
and blue.

77
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,920
So it won't be these instantaneous flashes.

78
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,210
Rather there will be a fade between them and then we have font size that will start at 20 pixels.

79
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,540
But then in the middle of the animation it will have enlarged to 40 and then it will shrink back down

80
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,070
to 20.

81
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,750
So here we could sort of visualize what it would look like if we have the text Hello as read that grows

82
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,440
a little bit and change it to orange at 25 percent then it grows to its peak hello as it turns yellow

83
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,750
and then it shrinks back down and changes green and then it goes all the way back to the initial size

84
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,880
and is blue.

85
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,050
But now imagine that rather than being displayed as a timeline this is happening in real time and you

86
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,590
would see something like this very cheesy.

87
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,600
Like I said not the prettiest thing you've ever seen but I think it illustrates in a very very simple

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,310
way how keyframes work and this is something that you could not do with transitions.

89
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,250
You could have a single transition from here to here or from here to here but we can't specify all the

90
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,910
steps along the way.

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,450
The last thing I want to do is showcase a couple of fun cool animations I found on coed Penn that are

92
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,890
built using She says keyframes.

93
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,820
So here's a walking cat.

94
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,680
And as you can see there's a couple of animated components.

95
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,820
We've got this background scrolling by and then we've also got this cat that's moving.

96
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,120
So this is definitely tricky to make to make it look good.

97
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,280
Obviously to have these assets and to know how to animate something to make it lifelike very very difficult.

98
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,220
But underlying it is some pretty simple core concepts the same keyframes.

99
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,090
Here's another example.

100
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,960
Little picks a large tree with a flashing star on top and falling snow.

101
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,550
So this is all dictated with keyframes although there's a lot of things that are being animated.

102
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,870
This is definitely a lot of CSSA behind this.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,730
But if we looked at a single thing let's say this star here there's a couple of keyframes at the beginning

104
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,700
it's small perhaps and then it grows and then it shrinks back down to sort of like we did at that rainbow

105
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,690
text Here's a fun one.

106
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,140
Mr. Jelly fish jelly fish pierce the s s animation.

107
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,570
So I've got a bunch of bubbles rising up.

108
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,800
Then we also have the jelly fish who has moving tentacles.

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,540
It has eyes that blink and it also has this little I don't know fin up top that moving and a shadow

110
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,150
that's moving along with it.

111
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,120
So there's a lot of things going on here but underlying it see is as keyframes.

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,930
And then finally this one is maybe the least exciting but it's actually very difficult and impressive

113
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,940
in my opinion this clock here.

114
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,430
There's a lot of things happening.

115
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,020
So we've got it actually works the time itself isn't accurate but it works in the sense that the hour

116
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,030
hand and minute hand the second hand are moving at the correct speeds and we have an updating readout

117
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,120
down here as well.

118
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,770
So the animation here is not that difficult just involves using rotate.

119
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,270
But there's a lot of things that are happening at the same time and a lot of time keeping underlying

120
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,720
it.

121
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,560
OK.

122
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,870
So I'll leave it here.

123
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,920
And this video sort of had a conceptual overview of keyframes saw roughly how they work but we actually

124
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,170
haven't implemented them we haven't seen the syntax.

125
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,570
So in the next video we're going to make this very simple rainbow animation but actually write the code

126
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,190
and see the keyframe syntax.
