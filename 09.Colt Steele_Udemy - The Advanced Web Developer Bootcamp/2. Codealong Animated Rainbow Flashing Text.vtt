00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.570
OK in this video we're going to make this animated rainbow text changes colors and then also shrinks

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.020
and expands.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.620
So the first thing we'll do is go to a code pen or whatever text editor you'd like to use and add our

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.680
single h Kim l element and make this bigger.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.680
Just a paragraph and we'll add our text Hello or whatever text we want to expand and shrink and change

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.860
color and that's it.

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.520
Now back in my slides there are two steps really to working with keyframes.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.680
The first one is that you define the animation itself.

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.100
So on its own nothing will be animated by this code.

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.990
Nothing will change immediately if I copied this and pasted it in into my code pen but I would have

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.040
to do it then assign the animation to an element.

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.820
So it's two steps defining it and then assigning.

13
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.330
So the actual definition itself looks like this.

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.920
The basics are to start with at keyframes.

15
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.760
And again I'm not showing all the vendor prefixes you can use a prefix or for that.

16
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.980
So it just at keyframes.

17
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.120
And then after that you must name it this name can be pretty much anything but it should be a name that

18
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.260
encapsulates what the animation does something like jiggle or rainbow text or spin or something like

19
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.500
that depending on what the animation does.

20
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.100
So those are the two beginning things.

21
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.760
And we have open curly brace inclosing curly brace and then inside we define all of our steps we can

22
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.030
add as many steps as we'd like.

23
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.730
I'm just doing 0 percent 25 percent 50 percent 75 and 100.

24
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.860
But if we wanted we could also add in a 6 percent and 7 percent or we could have ZERO 37 percent and

25
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.260
100 and that's it.

26
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.310
So really that's up to you.

27
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.450
And what your estimation requires.

28
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.390
But in our case where we're doing even intervals.

29
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.140
So let's actually go define this now.

30
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.280
So we'll start off with at keyframes rainbow text.

31
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.350
And then inside we just start with 0 percent.

32
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.340
What happens there.

33
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.270
Well we're going to set the color to red and font size to be 20 pixels.

34
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.090
And then at 25 percent and quarter of the way through we want color to now be orange and we're going

35
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.600
to leave font size alone and we'll only change that at 50 percent where we want it to be at its peak.

36
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.430
You want font size to be 40 pixels and color should be yellow.

37
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.200
We make this a bit larger so you can see the whole thing.

38
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.740
So we're part of the way there.

39
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.380
75 percent color is green and that's it.

40
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:53.370
And then we have 100 percent color is blue and font size goes back to 20 pixels.

41
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.130
OK.

42
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.520
So as I mentioned nothing changes here.

43
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.730
Our paragraph is on style and nothing is affecting it.

44
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.510
So we need to do now is actually apply the animation.

45
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.840
So there's a bunch of new properties here that you haven't seen.

46
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.880
And don't worry we'll go over them in future videos.

47
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.830
There's a lot of properties including a couple that actually aren't here.

48
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.340
But what we can do is just copy this for now.

49
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.600
Go back over to my SEE assess and paste it in and you can see it starts animating right away.

50
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.030
So the first and most important thing I want to highlight is this animation name.

51
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.750
So this must match whatever animation we want it to correspond to.

52
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.290
So rainbow text refers to this animation we define down here.

53
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.830
And so that's the animation that's going to start.

54
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.770
But then there are a couple of other things.

55
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.090
How long do we want it to take animation dasht duration.

56
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.210
Right now it's three seconds.

57
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.540
I could slow it down a lot.

58
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.760
Now you can see it progress is much lower.

59
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.520
I could do it one second and we get a very quick animation.

60
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.360
And of course we can change the timing function just like we did for transition.

61
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:06.860
So I could do is in perhaps and if I slow it down to get to five seconds you can see the impact that

62
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.520
it has compared to linear

63
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.990
so that should be review of timing functions.

64
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.130
Although the property is called animation timing function not transition.

65
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.930
Then we've got an animation delay.

66
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.650
So this is another thing that's new that we haven't been able to do yet.

67
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.690
Nothing is triggering this animation.

68
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.130
It's running as soon as the page loads.

69
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.200
There's no hover there's no state change that initiated it.

70
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.660
Instead it's going right off the bat.

71
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.030
I could add in a three second delay and if I refresh the page now it's not animating it's not animating

72
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.030
but now it starts animating.

73
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.000
So that's the point of animation delay.

74
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.880
And then we've got iteration count.

75
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.980
So we'll play around more with this.

76
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.010
But as you can see it set to infinite.

77
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.530
So this is how many times the animation runs.

78
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.090
So if we wanted to we could change that to two.

79
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.350
Now if I say if I reload the page OK the animation goes I guess it's a little slow right now five seconds.

80
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.480
But here's our second time through.

81
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.840
And then as you can see it just stops and we're done.

82
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.180
So even in this quick little intro video where we see the syntax for the first time hopefully you can

83
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.850
see we have a lot more control over these animations.

84
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.850
Yes we're doing a trivial silly little thing but there's a lot more that we can do even just with this

85
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.780
single animation to make it rainbow.

86
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.800
We can have it run infinitely ten times one time 50 times you can have a delay and so on and we could

87
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.300
also like I said we could add in another point in here so let's say I wanted to get purple in as well

88
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.860
so I could say that OK.

89
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.740
Eighty five percent.

90
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.770
We're going to set color to blue.

91
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.510
And then at 100 it will turn to purple.

92
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.570
And what will happen here is that we no longer have this evenly spaced interval of color.

93
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.360
So it goes from red to orange to yellow to green.

94
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.870
At the same interval.

95
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.830
But then it quickly jumps to blue and then quickly jumps to purple.

96
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.520
So let me enlarge had a bit so you can see it.

97
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:16.030
We put this back to infinite affection spell it OK and I'll zoom in and pay attention to how fast it

98
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.830
changes to blue and into purple

99
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.260
as you can see it's much shorter.

100
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.710
So you know we can put whatever we want in here just to show you another example.

101
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.210
I don't have to estimate the same exact properties.

102
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.990
I could do something crazy like halfway through.

103
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:41.570
Add in a transform let's do translate X and we'll move it 200 pixels across the screen.

104
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.710
So now it's not only changing color and shrinking and growing but it's also moving across the screen.

105
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.380
And this is as good a time as any to mention that yes I'm breaking the rule that I set out earlier that

106
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.930
the four properties you should try and animate are opacity rotate scale and translate which are all

107
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.180
transforms rather than using scale.

108
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.250
I decided to use font size and color and I was really doing that just to make this as clear as possible

109
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.450
and involving the least amount of new information.

110
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.650
But yes if this was going to be on a production site I don't know why you would want this but if you

111
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:21.100
did it would be much better to replace font size animations with scale which could achieve the exact

112
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.900
same effect but it does it much more efficiently.

113
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.340
OK.

114
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.950
So that wraps up this video.

115
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.930
We saw basically how to define keyframe first.

116
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.240
Give it a name define the individual frames the steps along the way.

117
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.640
And then we saw how to assign it to an element.

118
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.210
In this case all paragraphs which I guess I should specify I add another paragraph here.

119
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.570
They both have this animation.

120
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.980
So it gets annoying very quickly in this case.

121
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.050
And then we have these other properties around things like duration timing function iteration count

122
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.100
and there are actually a couple more that aren't here.

123
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.980
So we'll focus on those later on.
