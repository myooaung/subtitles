Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.000
In this video we're going to talk about adding methods and properties directly onto a class.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.420
These methods and properties are called statics and make use of the static keyword.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.930
Let's see what that looks like.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.280
To add a static method on a class we simply add the word static before it let's create a class called

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.180
student and add a static method called is student to see if an object is created from the Student class

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.880
by checking the constructor property.

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.850
To use this method we simply invoke it directly on the class.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.750
Let's create a new object from the Student class and see if it has been created from the Student class

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.230
and it has about an empty array.

11
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.790
We expect this to return false and it does.

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.290
So when are static methods useful.

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.740
Sometimes we don't want every object created from a class to have its own method.

14
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.010
Specifically when we want to use the method without creating objects from that class think about a time

15
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.290
where you use the static method.

16
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.080
How do you see if something is an array in javascript.

17
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.330
Remember we can't use of these type of array returns objects.

18
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.190
So instead we commonly use array is array.

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.310
This method is array is a static method on the array constructor function.

20
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.510
You might have come across some other static methods like object or create to create new objects or

21
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.770
object or freeze to prevent an object from being modified.

22
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.740
If you haven't encountered these methods no worries will be introducing quite a few more static methods

23
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.410
that yes 2015 gives us.

24
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.340
So you'll clearly understand the value of a static method.

25
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.290
Before we continue with some more new keywords that he has 20:15 gives us when working with classes.

26
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.240
Let's practice a bit with instance and class methods.

27
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.800
Good luck and I'll see you in the next video.
