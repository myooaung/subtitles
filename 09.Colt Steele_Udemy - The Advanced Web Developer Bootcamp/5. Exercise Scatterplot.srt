1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,770
Either in this exercise I'd like you to use what you've learned so far to build scatterplot your scatterplot

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,790
it should include label the axes and the title you can use whatever data you like but if you want to

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,070
just get started quickly and the resources you can find a javascript file with a bunch of miscellaneous

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,740
statistics from different countries and regions around the world.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,420
All of this data comes from the data sets on data dot UN dot org specific data sets I uphold are under

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,030
W.H. 00 data.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:40,060
Then World Health Statistics then demographic and socio economic statistics I've put together a few

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,670
of these datasets into one javascript file.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,660
I was curious about cellular subscriptions per 100 people.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,140
Literacy rates for those aged 15 and up.

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,020
Population growth rate fraction of the population that lives in urban areas.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:01,590
Fraction of the population that lives on less than $1 per day and median age.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,630
So these are the keys that each object has.

14
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,110
Note that not all countries had data for each one of these variables.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,170
If there was no data set the value to null.

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,000
Note also that there may be some slight variation in the year of the data.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,380
Most data points come from 2012 though some may be a year or two older.

18
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,190
I've only kept the most recent data point for each one of these regions and each variable I use this

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,570
data to throw together a quick scatterplot.

20
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,710
As you can see from my labels I've graphed cellular subscriptions on the y axis and literacy rate on

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,590
the x axis I visualize two other parameters by adjusting the fill in radius for each circle.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,160
But if you want to know what exactly those attributes are measuring you'll need to check out the solution.

23
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,240
For now I just start playing around with this data and seeing what kind of visualizations you can come

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,760
up with.

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,030
Good luck building your scatterplot if you get stuck.

26
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,770
You can see how I approach the problem in the next video.
