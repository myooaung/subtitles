00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,350
Welcome back in this video we're going to go over solutions to the 2015 methods exercises.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,250
The first problem we need to implement is the copy object function.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,490
What we'll do here is use the object that assign method.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,580
So let's return object or assign and pass an empty object and the object we'd like to copy.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,510
Remember we don't want a reference to the previous object.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,900
So we'll pass in an empty object as the first parameter the object assigned.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,130
The next function we need to implement is check if finite which will accept some value.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,440
And here we can return the handy number God is finite method.

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,860
This will return true if that number is finite and false.

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,960
If we pass something that is not Next we need to implement a function called are all numbers finite

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,910
which accepts an array and checks to see if every single number is finite.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,600
Here we can use the every function on the array and pass in a number that is finite.

13
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,910
This will return true if every number is finite.

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,700
The next function we need to implement is convert array like object which accepts some object and returns

15
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,180
a converted array.

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:16,520
Here we'll use arayed up from and past in that array like object to convert it into an array in S-5.

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,610
We would have had to do this using array that slice dot call but a got from is much friendlier.

18
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,360
The last method we need to implement is display even arguments.

19
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,030
What we'll do here is convert the arguments array like object into an array and filter all of the values

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,900
that are even using filter.

21
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,460
We can use erro functions here to clean up our code a bit.

22
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,330
You might have solved this using the rest operator and that's totally fine.

23
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,100
There will be plenty of times where array up from or the rest operator will accomplish the same thing

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,550
and that's all for the 2015 exercises.

25
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,640
See you in the next video.
