00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.820
In last video we create the card component and made the cards clickable.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.940
Now that set up the game reset the nav bar

3
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.610
inside the nav bar will add a function called on new games so that the prop types

4
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.480
and have actually already got it here.

5
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.290
So I'm going to get on a new game out of props so the structure here and then I'll use it as a click

6
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.560
event inside the link.

7
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.060
Great that's it for the nav bar.

8
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.330
Now we need to create the function inside of the memory game and pass it in

9
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.440
so let's call this function handle new game

10
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.980
in this function we want to do two things we want to copy the state and set all the cards to have a

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.330
state of hiding and then we want to shuffle the cards and then set that as our new state.

12
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:16.750
So let's do that.

13
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.200
So in this map I'm destructuring each card and then setting the card state for each one to be hiding

14
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:38.690
next time shuffling the card so we have a new arrangement of cards.

15
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:48.680
And finally we're setting state so I'd see that working.

16
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.720
I forgot one thing we need to pass it into the nav bar component.

17
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:08.150
Now see that working.

18
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.910
The colors are changing and our Reset seems to be working so it looks like that's all good.

19
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.570
Now the only thing left is to update the handle click function so that it has the correct logic for

20
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.410
the game.

21
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.460
If two cards are visible and they don't match they should be flipped back.

22
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.560
But if two cards are visible and they do match they should stay

23
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.300
so start by getting rid of this code.

24
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.160
The first thing I'm going to do in this function is actually define another function and I'm going to

25
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.860
call it map card state.

26
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.050
It's going to take three parameters the array of cards an array of IDs to change.

27
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.070
And lastly what state those IDs should have.

28
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.960
So it'll go through the array map each element.

29
00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.110
And if the element matches the ID that we're looking for then we'll change the card state.

30
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.990
There we go this is our map card state function.

31
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.930
As I said it takes our array of cards.

32
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.220
The idea is that we want to change in the state that we want to change into.

33
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.710
It will map over the card and if the ID that we're on matches any of the IDs to change then we will

34
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.390
update that card with the new card state.

35
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.540
Next we'll grab the card that we want out of the array.

36
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.880
So that's the card that was just clicked on.

37
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.590
Next we're checking if the card we just found if it's state is not equal to hiding then we don't want

38
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.240
to do anything right if the cards are already showing we don't want to turn into a hiding card.

39
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.690
So if that's the case just return.

40
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.160
Also we have a piece of state called no click so if no click is ever true.

41
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.480
Then we also don't want to do anything.

42
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.880
We'll see that in just a second or we're going to use it for

43
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.720
next will set a variable called no click and we'll start out as false

44
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.030
and we're going to use this to decide if the user can click again or not.

45
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.400
So if there are zero non-match showing or one non-match showing then the user can click right.

46
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.370
There are two non-match is showing then the user can't click for a certain amount of time.

47
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.210
Next we're going to use the map card state function that we created above and map the card that was

48
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.090
clicked on to be showing because we know the card state has to be hiding at this point.

49
00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:06.820
Now I want to filter that to only get showing cards back.

50
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.790
Now let's just get the idea of those showing cards.

51
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.700
Now we have an array of cards that are currently showing and we have those cards IDs and I supposed

52
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.140
that from

53
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.850
now we need to decide a couple of different cases.

54
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.080
So first of all we want to check if there are two cards showing and if there background colors match

55
00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:01.560
so this is the case when we do change the state of both these cards to Matching.

56
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.900
Otherwise there are two cards showing and they do not match at this point.

57
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:21.250
So then we need to hide them or hide them after they've been shown for a little bit of time.

58
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.590
So first I'm changing the card state of the showing IDs to hiding.

59
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.880
So these ideas were the two that are showing.

60
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.430
And now I want to make those IDs two hiding cards.

61
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.410
Next I'm going to change the no click variable from false to true.

62
00:06:46.120 --> 00:07:03.200
And then I want to set state with the cards and no click.

63
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.600
Now you'll notice I use cards here not hiding cards.

64
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.920
So I'm going to keep the card showing for a certain amount of time.

65
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.910
And then after a set time out I will hide them.

66
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.800
So we need a callback function for after the set state is done.

67
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.720
And inside of that callback function after a set time out we're going to change the card states from

68
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.990
showing to hiding.

69
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.360
So you can see here we've set the state to have two cards showing.

70
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:45.290
And then after one point three seconds we have two cards hiding or we had the whole hiding array which

71
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:51.670
includes those two cards that we've now hidden and we've changed the no click from true to false.

72
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.950
So while those two cards are showing you can't click anywhere else.

73
00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.340
And then afterwards after the 1.3 second delay they are hidden.

74
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:09.370
Let's change that three.

75
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.560
And if this is the case we just want to return we don't want to do anything else in this function.

76
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.700
Otherwise if you've gotten down to the bottom we'll do a set state with our cards and no click

77
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.240
so reach the set stay in only two cases.

78
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:37.970
1 if there's only one card showing that's not matched or the other case would be there's two cards showing

79
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:44.090
that now do match if there are two cards showing that do not match will be inside of this statement

80
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.240
and will hit the return and stop here.

81
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.770
So let's check out our app now and see if it works.

82
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:05.650
As you'll notice the matches stay and if I get two things that don't match I can't click a third time.

83
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.170
So

84
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.280
there we go.

85
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.650
That looks good.

86
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.450
So that's our application.

87
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.630
Good job so far.

88
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.000
Keep up the good work.

89
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.750
Next we're going to be doing component lifecycle methods.
