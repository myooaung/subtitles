00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.400
OK so we have one more property to take a look at before we go ahead and build our first little mini

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.060
project and that property is called justify content justify content.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.330
You may be familiar with if you've used it before but in this context it's very very useful.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.110
It allows us to specify how the space inside of a flex container should be distributed between the different

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.000
items and the key point is along the main axis.

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.250
So back to this diagram here we have three items.

7
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.960
There's space over here.

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.820
So this would be one way of distributing the space but we could put it on the left side as well.

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.910
Or what if we put some space here some here some here and some here or center everything in the middle.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.420
There's a bunch of different options.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.880
So the key idea is how do we space things out using the available space across the main access.

12
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.660
So it's not referring to this space the top and bottom.

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.550
In this example just across the main axis or if we had a column layout like this.

14
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.050
This is the main axis.

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.170
There isn't any available space in this diagram.

16
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.200
But in some of the things that we've come up with there would be space.

17
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.280
So how would we assign that space going up and down not left to right like we had in this example here.

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.900
So if we set justify content on the container to be flex and notice that all of our content moves to

19
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.640
the right side because our main axis starts here and it ends here it goes to the flex and it doesn't

20
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.570
change the order so it's not the same as flex direction.

21
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.170
It still goes one two three four.

22
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.730
It's just that the white space is on the left.

23
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.600
If we change the value to the center it now centers all of the content.

24
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.530
So it doesn't put space between them lumps that together and put space on either side to center it.

25
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.440
The next value is called space between and I'll show all of these in practice but I want to just go

26
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.020
through these as a quick reference space between well take the space and divide it between the elements

27
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.010
so it doesn't put it on the edges just in between the different elements.

28
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.360
However many there are five ten twenty two however many along with space between there's also space

29
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.440
around.

30
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.170
And what this will do is take the space and evenly divided around all the items.

31
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.050
And you might be wondering and this diagram it looks like it did a bad job of making it even.

32
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.920
But actually what it does is it takes the space on the left and add to the right and then it does the

33
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.740
same thing to the left of this one in the right.

34
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.730
And so we get double space or we have two items meeting versus single space which there are ways of

35
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.350
remedying that but by default this is what it does.

36
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.840
OK.

37
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.170
So that's enough slides.

38
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.400
Let's go to the code.

39
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.740
If you feel like that's enough of an explanation for you then go ahead skip this but I'm going to demonstrate

40
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.630
some of it.

41
00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:03.450
The first thing I'll do is I'll turn off flex wrap and I'm also going to change this back to flex direction.

42
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.390
Row and I'll get rid of that height OK.

43
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.370
And the other thing I'll do is make these a lot smaller.

44
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.460
Let's go with 100 pixels.

45
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.740
Perfect.

46
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:25.930
So they don't take up the entire container so we can set justify content let's do flex and can see everything

47
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.800
moves to the right.

48
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.330
Very easy simple way to do that without actually changing the order of anything.

49
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.450
And this is a good point to mention.

50
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.890
The default is flex start if you come at that hour.

51
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.400
It makes no difference.

52
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.920
OK.

53
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.070
So that's flex start flex and a very useful one center wheel center all those items automatically.

54
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.230
You don't have to do anything else.

55
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.810
We also have as we mentioned space between which you look at that very useful as well.

56
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.730
If you're trying to do any sort of grid system or you want to have content evenly spaced.

57
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.550
There you go.

58
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.590
Same thing you know if we delete a bunch of these gcc to show you the magic effects box they're still

59
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.470
evenly spaced and we can make them larger say 200 pixels.

60
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.890
We're not having to update margin or border or anything.

61
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.110
We could dynamically change the size and that spacing will change as well.

62
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.920
Let's go back to having all these here.

63
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.130
Let's go back to 100 pixels so that space between.

64
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.210
There's also space around.

65
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.610
And yes it's uneven looking.

66
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.940
But if you account for supporting this in half the left half belonging to one the right half one to

67
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.780
two it is actually applying the exact same space around them.

68
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.710
OK so let's go back to center

69
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.820
and now let's change this to be road reverse flex direction.

70
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.630
So it still works.

71
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.930
Just going to show you a couple of combinations.

72
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.980
Let's go back and change this to column now.

73
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.530
And you're not going to see much again because we don't have a height that we've applied to our container.

74
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.920
Let's apply a height to our container and let's also allow them to wrap.

75
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.740
OK so we have all these little items in here that are centered and wrapping.

76
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.110
Now it's kind of a weird way out.

77
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.310
I'll give you that resume out so we can see exactly what's happening.

78
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.960
Here's our whole container.

79
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.130
So we set first flex wrap to wrap flex direction to be calm.

80
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.130
So our main axis goes from top to bottom and our cross axis goes from left to right.

81
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.010
So it goes one two three four five and then over to the right and wraps six seven eight nine and remember

82
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.220
justified content is along the main axis.

83
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.740
So that's this way.

84
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.240
So we're not talking about any of this whitespace in here or in here it's just this space this space

85
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.480
this one and this space.

86
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:11.550
So by setting it to center it's distributing them in the middle vertically so let's do instead of center

87
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:22.160
let's do space between now we have vertically evenly spaced at least in a given row vertically evenly

88
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.750
spaced items.

89
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.340
And if we did flex and what do you think will happen.

90
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.380
What's your guess.

91
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:38.190
Save we have that white space up top now and our content is pushed to the end of the main axis.

92
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.990
So hopefully this is starting to make sense of the whole main axis cross axis.

93
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.450
Why it's important that you understand that because if you don't have a good understanding of those

94
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:53.010
two directions those two axes then it can be very difficult to understand what's happening.

95
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.000
Like I said ignore this.

96
00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:02.040
This horizontal space for now we're solely focusing on the main axis and its direction.

97
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:08.410
So if you want to stick around also show you know if we change this to be instead of column we could

98
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:17.570
do column reverse and we can change justify content to be Center.

99
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.630
Just to show you possible combinations and instead of rap.

100
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.390
Rap reverse getting crazy here.

101
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:31.380
So what we're doing now our main axis starts here and it ends up here so top or bottom to top but our

102
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:39.800
cross axis because we did wrap reverse goes from right to left and on top of that we're setting justify

103
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.810
content to be center so vertically.

104
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.480
These things are centered along the main axis from bottom to top.

105
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:55.560
So yes you could play around with that and change that to space between and now same thing except that

106
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.650
space is evenly split up.

107
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.310
OK.

108
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.020
You're probably bored of this by now.

109
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.740
If you're still there we're going to move on to actually building something using these properties together

110
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.120
in the next video.

111
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.800
See you then.
