00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.640
High there over the course of the next several sections you're going to learn an incredible amount about

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.750
a popular javascript library called D-3.

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.790
I love building visualizations with D-3 and helping other people learn it.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.090
But before we get into the details I thought it would be good to showcase just a few examples of what

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.230
D-3 can do.

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.340
First a little background D-3 is a javascript library that is used to make data easier to read and understand

7
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.580
through compelling visuals.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.630
One of the key developers of the project is Mike Bostock who had a stint as a graphics editor for The

9
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.660
New York Times.

10
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.680
If you ever played around with any of the interactive articles from The New York Times Web site it's

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.550
likely that there was an D-3 at work under the hood For example here's a cool story they ran in 2015

12
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.220
that asks readers to predict the relationship between the percentage of children who go to college versus

13
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.270
their parents income percentile.

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.930
After making a guess.

15
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.090
The article digs into the numbers a bit and also shows you how other readers guessed I won't spoil their

16
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.350
results for you.

17
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.080
Feel free to check it out on your own if you're interested.

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.890
Cool examples of B-3 about on the D-3 Web site the examples page is fairly exhaustive and they all do

19
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.120
something different.

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.780
Scrolling through this page should give you a sense for the scale of what's possible with the three.

21
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.240
If you're looking for even more examples a Web site called the putting offers up visual essays every

22
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.450
week there's a lot of great material here.

23
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.530
For instance here's a visualization that displays the top grossing films of the past 50 years against

24
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.540
a timeline of historical events for the United States.

25
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.190
Here's another one that visualizes data from characters on the TV show The Office there were visualisations

26
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.420
for each character's share of dialogue as well as sentiment analysis which shows how negative each character

27
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.980
is based on what he or she says.

28
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.930
I've built quite a few visualizations of my own too.

29
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.960
Here's one quick example.

30
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.630
Here's a project that uses United States Census data to visualize how popular different names are over

31
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.710
time.

32
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.960
For example my name peaked in popularity right around the time I was born.

33
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.010
By default the chart gives you data nationally but you can also click on a state to see the trend for

34
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.550
that name.

35
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.930
In only that state.

36
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.940
Here's how my name's popularity has changed in a few different states.

37
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.710
Here's an example showcasing the type of thing you'll be able to bill by the end of these three sections.

38
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.370
Here I've got a dashboard with several different visualizations all regarding carbon dioxide emissions

39
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.500
by country and by year.

40
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.570
On the left I've got a world map with countries colored by how much CO2 they produced for that year.

41
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.400
The closer to green the less the pollution the closer to red or black the worse the pollution.

42
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.780
I can change the year from the header and I can toggle between emissions and emissions per capita.

43
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.070
I can also mouse over a country to see the data being visualize on the right.

44
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.550
I've got the same information visualized as a pie chart.

45
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.160
This lets me look at emissions by country as a fraction of total emissions if I mouse over one of the

46
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.640
wedges in this chart.

47
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.600
I can see the same information as before but I can also see how much each country polluted as a percentage

48
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.000
of total CO2 emissions for that year.

49
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.240
Finally I can also click on a country to see that countries trends over time with the bar chart on the

50
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.070
right.

51
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.970
For example China's CO2 emissions skyrocketed between 1990 and 2011 emissions per capita increased dramatically

52
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.820
as well though the US's emissions per capita were higher by a factor of nearly 2.5 than 2011.

53
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.960
I hope I've shown you enough D-3 to peak your interest.

54
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.350
Now that you've seen what the theory can do let's learn how to use it in the next video.

55
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.180
We'll get started with D-3 basics.

56
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.800
I'm looking forward to it and I hope you are too.

57
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.950
I'll see you in the next video.
