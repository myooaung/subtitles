1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,740
OK.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,630
So it's time to learn our flex box property.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,700
It's not one that's actually on this list and that's because it's a property that is not specific to

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,820
flex fluxbox that property is display which you're probably familiar with but we're using it with a

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,390
value that you may not have seen before but we'll get to that in just a moment.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,620
First I want to show you our starting point.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,340
So this is a flex box.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,920
Let's lay out if you want to call the lay out a very simple thing to create.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,250
We have four divs inside of another div..

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,850
Another container.

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,160
And by default those four divs are going to be on separate lines as you can see here one after another

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,740
in this section.

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,400
I've made a bunch of diagrams.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:47,120
Really a lot of telegrams using this sort of language is visual language of just divs or blocks whatever

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,830
you want to call them colored boxes that are being arranged in different patterns.

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:57,740
So again here's what it would look like without flex box no styling aside from the color and the font

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,660
size just for divs inside another div.

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:07,070
But if we change one property of the container this outside div they're all inside of where there's

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,050
this big border I can suddenly get them to all go on the same line.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,330
And that first little bit of magic looks like this display flex.

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,710
So as I mentioned this is not a flex box specific property.

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,240
Display is something you're probably familiar with but by setting display to flex we are setting the

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,660
container div or whatever the boxes that we're working with a header section and NAV whatever it is

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,300
we are setting it to flex which makes it a flex container.

25
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,930
And this is what we get.

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,120
So those four boxes that were one after another vertically are now all together.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,820
Shoves the left side of this box.

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,580
Now I'm not saying that's what you want.

29
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,860
I'm not saying that's the end result but just that one little line makes a big impact.

30
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,700
Let me just illustrate that to you.

31
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:06,710
So here I have the exact same thing except I have 10 divs are actually nine divs different colors and

32
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,110
they're inside of a div called container.

33
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,790
So nine boxes inside a div called container.

34
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:22,400
And if I just select that container and I set that display to flex immediately they all go in line like

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:32,710
that and let me give my container of border 10 pixels solid black and you can see that this container

36
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,610
goes all the way across.

37
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,410
But there's a bunch of unused space for some reason and everything is shoved onto the left side.

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,900
The order is still the same but the divs themselves are much much smaller.

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,890
If I get rid of that display they take up a lot of space.

40
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,490
Now display flex they're much more condensed so I'm going to leave it at that.

41
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,810
That's the magic of display flex.

42
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,980
Why would you want that.

43
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,690
Well you'll see in just a bit that this is for you a lot of control.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,850
You can move things to the right you can space them out.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,350
You can move them up and down.

46
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,980
Basically this is just starting the process.

47
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,010
This is the first property that anytime you use fluxbox.

48
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,330
You have to apply to the container.

49
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,680
I'm trying to keep the video short in this section so that's all I'm going to talk about in the next

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,240
video.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,250
We're going to talk about some basic terminology.
