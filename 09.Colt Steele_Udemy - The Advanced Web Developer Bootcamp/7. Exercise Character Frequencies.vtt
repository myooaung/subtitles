00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.910
High there in this video I'd like to give a quick demonstration of the exercise for this section here

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.030
I've got a page with a form that accepts text input if I type a phrase into the input field and submit

3
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.720
the form.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.980
I can see a little chart that shows how many times each character in the phrase appears as you can see

5
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.480
from the elements tab.

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.150
This is all being done using age TNL and Development's simplicity.

7
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.250
This chart plots every possible character and is case sensitive.

8
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.180
If I enter a second phrase it will be graphed instead.

9
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.600
However letters that were also present in the previous phrase are styled a bit differently.

10
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.340
And as you can see my app is aware of how many characters are new to my second phrase if I enter a third

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.980
phrase the same thing happens.

12
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.710
The graph knows how many characters are in the second phrase and how many are new to the third.

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.730
Note that the first phrase no longer plays a role.

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.240
I'm just seeing how many characters are new when comparing the current phrase to the previous one.

15
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.900
I've also got a reset button which basically just clears the graph area.

16
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.940
A few hints for this assignment.

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.070
I'd start by getting the form working for the first submit.

18
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.770
You'll need to use the Enter selection to get this working for subsequent form submissions.

19
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.400
I'd review the general update pattern in the resources you'll find some starter code.

20
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.510
I've handled BHM in CFS so that you can focus only on D-3 But feel free to update the styling or the

21
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.680
HGF Now if you'd like.

22
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.440
Good luck.

23
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.730
I'll show you how I created this app in the next video.
