00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.570
OK so next we're learning our first flex box specific property.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.490
We already saw a display flex but that's kind of an existing property flex direction is flex box specific.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.760
So what it does is allows us to specify how the items of flex items are placed in the flex container

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.650
by defining the main axis in its direction.

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.300
So if we go back to this diagram what I'm able to do is change the direction of this main axis so I

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.340
could say instead of going from left to right I want our content and the main axis to go from right

7
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.560
to left or from top to bottom or from bottom to top meaning it would be a column.

8
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.640
So there's a couple of values that we can work with the default that we don't actually have to set ourselves

9
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.500
the default value is flex direction row.

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.780
And if I copy that over and I go to our demo code and I apply this to the container just to hit this

11
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.140
home again we're starting off only by talking about container properties.

12
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.790
Obviously the name container is not mandatory but we're talking about the parent that has display flex

13
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.620
inside.

14
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.600
Later on we'll see all the properties that apply to the individual flex items.

15
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.650
So again flex item row or flex direction row is the default commenting it or uncomforting it doesn't

16
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.380
make a difference.

17
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.470
It's the default.

18
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.930
But the next version flex direction ro dash reverse reverses the direction of the main axis instead

19
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.370
of starting from the left going to the right.

20
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.280
It now starts in the right and it goes to the left.

21
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.680
So it's still a row but it's a mirrored row.

22
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.950
So the first item starts here.

23
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.920
And the last item ends there.

24
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.810
So let me show you that.

25
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.760
You go rogue dash reverse and save.

26
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.210
And immediately we get this reversed row.

27
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.580
So the main axis goes from here to over here the cross axis is still the same but that doesn't matter

28
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.220
at this point.

29
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.220
We're only talking about the main axis because that's all that we can control all that we care about

30
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.490
with flex direction.

31
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.280
So as I mentioned there are other values we can set it to column instead of row.

32
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.550
And that will take the main axis and make it start from the top and go downwards making our content

33
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.930
into a column.

34
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.530
So just to show you if we started with this as the default This was our first one second and third by

35
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.130
changing direction to column it still first second and third.

36
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.810
But our access is top to bottom.

37
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:41.000
So let's try it instead of Rover reverse column and you can see they're all now in a column.

38
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.610
Yes.

39
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.590
This is basically the same thing we started with without flex box.

40
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.610
But as you'll see in a little bit the other properties we learn allow us to do many other things and

41
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.020
manipulate these different boxes so they don't always take up the entire container.

42
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.550
But as you can see just changing this from row to column makes a very big difference.

43
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.450
Ignore the size the width and all that.

44
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.060
Just focus on the order.

45
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:15.530
So if we go one to nine horizontally set it to column we go one to nine vertically.

46
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.730
And as you probably guessed there's also a column dash reverse that does something very similar except

47
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.580
our main axis is defined as going from top excuse me going from bottom to top.

48
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.710
So by doing column dush reverse We now have nine up top all the way down to 1 at the bottom.

49
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.300
So those four values you'll be using them all the time.

50
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.210
Row row reverse column column reverse.

51
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.710
To be honest I'm usually just using row and column I'm not reversing things all that often but row and

52
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.990
column definitely all the time.

53
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.420
In fact here's a very simple nav bar.

54
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.800
We'll be building in just a couple of videos from now.

55
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.560
And then what I want to show you is that we have things in a row at one point in a number.

56
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.230
But then I hit a break point and it changes to column and all we're doing there is changing flex direction

57
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.080
from row to column.

58
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.690
So we have that to look forward to.

59
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.830
We're almost to the point of making this math bar.

60
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.030
There's just one more property we're going to learn that's coming up next.
