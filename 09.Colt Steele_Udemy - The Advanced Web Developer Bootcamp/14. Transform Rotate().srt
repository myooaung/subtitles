1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,010
OK.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,980
So we're going to take a look at one more CSSA transform function.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,300
We started off by looking at translate which allowed us to move elements shift them across the page.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,180
Then we looked at scale which allows us to increase the size or shrink down elements.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,760
Now we're going to wrap things up with rotate and rotate allows us to rotate elements on the page.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,720
Those are not the only three Remember there are a bunch of other transform functions.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,830
Feel free to explore them.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,830
Play around with them.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,490
Some of them are kind of fun but they're kind of nice things.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,010
These three that I've brought out that I've highlighted are probably the most common at least in my

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,230
opinion are the most common in rotations in particular.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,700
You might be asking yourself when are you rotating thing have a page.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,010
It doesn't seem like something that's that important but a really common situation actually is when

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,790
you have loading icons when you have any sort of progress that's circular.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,180
I'll give you an example here.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,890
Here's something that will be building in just a couple of videos.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,520
Very very simple animated loader.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,310
Ignore the animation part.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,520
We're going to get to that in just a video or two how we actually make things.

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,840
Loop how we get them to continuously run.

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,340
But underlying that is a rotation using the exact same syntax that we're about to learn.

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,860
So there's a couple of elements here that are forever rotating.

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,210
So to do that the syntax is very very straightforward.

24
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:25,080
It's transformed just like we've seen the colon and then the function which is called rotate and then

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,510
rotate takes one item one parameter which is a number of degrees or an angle.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,330
So it doesn't have to be in degrees at the end of this video.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,640
I'll show some of the other units but frankly I've never seen anyone use anything other than degrees

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,530
even though you can.

29
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:49,040
So again we pass in a number along with DTG four degrees and if it's positive the rotation will be clockwise.

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,960
If it's a negative number it will be counterclockwise.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,360
But rather than just talk about it looking at this boring slide let's go to code Penn have a very simple

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,750
one set up just like the last couple of videos make this a bit bigger.

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,990
So I've got two paragraphs both say hello.

34
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,200
The only difference is that one of them is styled with or one of them has a class transformed which

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,810
I've given a different background color.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,900
Otherwise the same dimensions 50 by 50.

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,290
They have the same border the same text color.

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,650
So what we're going to do is play around with rotate on this transformed on down here.

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,630
So let's go ahead and do transform.

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,240
Rotate is the name of the function and then pass in a number of degrees.

41
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,950
Let's go with 45 degrees D.G. and there we go.

42
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,550
So you can see that it rotated clockwise 45 degrees this direction.

43
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,770
And also you can gather that it's rotating around the center point.

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,040
And that's because the transform origin by default is the middle it's the center of the element.

45
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,890
But before we go about changing the origin Let's try a couple of other numbers here.

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,290
So let's do 90 degrees.

47
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,400
You can see we get 90 degrees clockwise essentially to the right.

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,440
From the center point is basically think of a pin being stuck right here and we're rotating around that.

49
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:17,230
If we go up to 180 we get a mirror image and we can also do things with negative numbers.

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:24,640
So negative 20 degrees is going to be 20 degrees counterclockwise around that center origin and we can

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,720
also use decimals.

52
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,730
So we could do if you wanted to.

53
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,610
You won't notice a change here but 0.9.

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,650
Well actually that is noticeable.

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,280
You can see it's slightly skewed.

56
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,960
I mean comment that out there we go.

57
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,070
You can see that very slight shift that's happening.

58
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,020
So you can use decimals as well.

59
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,720
The other thing worth mentioning is that you can use numbers greater than 360 So 360 of course would

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,740
be a complete rotation and we wouldn't see anything.

61
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,260
But if you animate that when we get there that actually is useful if you rotate something a full 360

62
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,970
degrees and you tell it to take one second.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,910
You actually see the rotation happen.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,060
Right now it's instantaneous but we can do things like 540 degrees and you can see that it rotates it's

65
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,940
going around once and then continuing around a full 180 degrees.

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,850
OK.

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,500
So that's the very basics of rotate on its own.

68
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,190
Let's go back to something like 45 degrees.

69
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,330
But now I'm going to talk about transform origin in conjunction with it.

70
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,500
So again the default origin is the center point here but we can change that.

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,410
So we could tell it to be the top left if we wanted it to.

72
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,490
And it would essentially stick a pin in the top left and rotate around that rather than rotating around

73
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,180
the center.

74
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,730
So we'll try that left top.

75
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,500
There you go.

76
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:57,080
So this point remains where it was just to prove that commented out and then we unconference and you

77
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,460
can see it's rotating around that point.

78
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,710
So you can also do things like rotating around the right bottom if you want it to.

79
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,890
Now it's rotating around this point.

80
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:15,580
And we can change that to be 90 degrees instead there you go with transform Orjan.

81
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,770
We're not limited just to the keywords top left right and bottom.

82
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,450
We also have a whole bunch of other ways of using it so we can provide specific pixel measurements or

83
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,160
even centimeter measurements.

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,900
We can provide things like inherit initial onset.

85
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,500
Probably won't be doing that very much but most commonly we're doing things like either giving it a

86
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,910
pixel value or giving it top left or top right or two of these keywords these offset keywords.

87
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,040
You can also do percentages as well.

88
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,520
All right.

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,600
So if you have any questions about transfer margin you can take a look at the docs here.

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,360
They have a nice explanation with rotate.

91
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,180
So here they're doing a 30 degree rotation and then changing the origin to a bunch of different values

92
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:05,010
using things like IEMs using things like percentages and then measurements zero and zero.

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,360
So before we wrap up two other things I want to discuss.

94
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,530
One is if we try and do two transforms.

95
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,270
So let's also scale it down.

96
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,500
We're rotating it.

97
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,410
We're going to do a transform scale and let's do by half a 0.5.

98
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,960
Notice that it does scale down but our rotate goes away.

99
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,080
It was rotated 90 degrees to the right.

100
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,760
What's happening is that it's actually being overwritten by this transform.

101
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:39,730
It's kind of annoying that we have to do this the way around it is to provide a single transform like

102
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,460
this even though they look like they're on different lines.

103
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,390
Are part of the single or the same transform declaration the same property.

104
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,530
And now we have both being applied.

105
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,940
It's being rotated and it's being scaled.

106
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,910
OK.

107
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,000
So that's the very basics of that.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,950
The other thing I want to touch on is when we talk about angles.

109
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,480
So I said you don't have to use degrees even though that's by far the most common you could do things

110
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:13,130
like gradients radians if you can remember back to trigonometry or I guess calculus if you took that.

111
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,910
If not don't worry about it.

112
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,910
Nobody uses this for the most part of development but it is an option.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,450
And then this one turn I've seen maybe once or twice before.

114
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:31,960
It allows you to specify basically quarter turns half turn a full turn using the word turn rather than

115
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,780
degrees.

116
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:41,150
So for example 360 degrees is equivalent to one turn or 90 degrees is equal to point to five turns.

117
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,540
So if that's something that interests you you don't like working with degrees.

118
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,930
You definitely can do that.

119
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,260
So let me just show that briefly here.

120
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,730
Get rid of a transform Orjan also get rid of our scale.

121
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,500
So we have 90 degrees right now.

122
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,490
We could replace that instead of with degrees.

123
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:05,000
We could do a 0.25 turn it's kind of bizarre but it's an option.

124
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,480
OK.

125
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,520
So that wraps it up.

126
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,090
And that actually wraps up our section on transform on its own.

127
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,790
Now we're going to learn to do is take those transforms those translations the scaling and the rotations

128
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,480
and combine them with animations.

129
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,770
It's sort of Rymes and we're going to take them together to build more complex things and to animate

130
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,740
them to make them happen.

131
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,990
Over a period of time triggered by certain interactions by a hover or by a click or something.

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,110
So that's coming up next.
