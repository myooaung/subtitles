00:05.800 --> 00:08.860
All right so this is the Mac installation video.

00:08.860 --> 00:13.580
Skip this video if you're on a Windows machine or if you're running Linux.

00:13.930 --> 00:14.230
All right.

00:14.250 --> 00:20.350
So we've established now that we want to install Java 11:00 or actually in our case the JT K version

00:20.350 --> 00:21.330
eleven.

00:21.430 --> 00:25.500
So with a browser open we're going to go to Java dot Sun dot com

00:28.410 --> 00:38.390
and once that page loads come down here and click on Java s e Java a C by the way stands for Java standard

00:38.390 --> 00:42.260
edition which is what we're gonna be using in this course.

00:42.310 --> 00:48.410
So you can see that when I've done that it's come up with Java SC eleven LTE is LTE stands for long

00:48.410 --> 00:50.430
term support.

00:50.480 --> 00:55.320
So what we need to do then is come over here and click on download and update where it says Oracle J.D.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.580
K..

00:57.110 --> 01:03.770
Then I'm gonna scroll down here and click on accept license agreement and I'm going to come over here

01:03.770 --> 01:06.420
to the right of Mac OSX the TMG file.

01:06.810 --> 01:14.150
When I click on that and you can see that started the process of downloading the Java development kit

01:14.300 --> 01:16.810
from the Mac and once we get going.

01:16.810 --> 01:22.250
Going to be very similar to installing any Mac program and then go through once it's downloaded and

01:22.370 --> 01:25.970
we'll actually install it and that will be that.

01:26.060 --> 01:26.300
All right.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.340
I got to pause a video and we'll come back once it's downloaded.

01:30.460 --> 01:30.710
Okay.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.460
So I can see now the 80 k eleven for Mac has finished downloading.

01:35.480 --> 01:41.450
Come over here and I'm going to go to the forward or it's downloaded a double click to open the TMJ

01:41.450 --> 01:44.840
file and then we'll let it do its thing and actually install

01:48.050 --> 01:51.660
sure what I'll do is I'll close the browser.

01:51.660 --> 01:58.250
You don't need that anymore and I'll just close the final window in here.

01:58.290 --> 02:04.440
You can double click now the Java development kit the JD K 11 and we'll just go through the standard

02:04.440 --> 02:08.140
was it to install it on this computer so we'll click on install.

02:08.560 --> 02:16.800
I'm gonna enter my password per center or click on install software and you can see it's very quickly

02:17.250 --> 02:20.980
completed the installation of the GVK K eleven so let's see.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.390
Great.

02:21.390 --> 02:27.060
At this point now we've got the Java development kit for our Mac installed in the next video it's time

02:27.060 --> 02:29.060
to download installing tele J.

02:29.730 --> 02:34.860
And that's the program that we'll be using in the course that works with the JD K. that we've just installed

02:35.230 --> 02:39.490
and this new program that you write and execute Java programs.

02:39.630 --> 02:42.960
So I'll see you in the next video after I click on this option here.
