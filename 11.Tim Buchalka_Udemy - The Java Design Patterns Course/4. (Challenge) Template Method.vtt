Hello and welcome back.

00:06.710 --> 00:10.920
I have another challenge for you this one's on the Template Method OK.

00:10.920 --> 00:15.830
The requirements are going to be this application heck is gonna have to do with order processing flow.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.320
That's what I want you to write.

00:17.730 --> 00:21.960
And what this is gonna do is you're going to create an application that allows clients to order items

00:22.350 --> 00:29.310
and process them by paying either online or in the store and you're gonna use the template method to

00:29.310 --> 00:33.490
determine the payment the online or the in the store.

00:33.690 --> 00:39.580
The overall algorithm used the process in order is defined in the base class and used by the subclasses.

00:39.990 --> 00:45.490
But the way the individual operations are performed vary depending on the subclass so you're going to

00:45.490 --> 00:52.090
need to create an abstract class containing the algorithm skeleton the order process template the process

00:52.090 --> 00:57.170
order is the method that contains the process steps that's the template method it's going to need to

00:57.170 --> 01:00.950
do things like do select due payment and delivery.

01:00.950 --> 01:02.920
Those are going to be abstract methods.

01:03.320 --> 01:08.480
They're going to determine how the item is selected either add it to an online cart or pick from a shelf.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.640
They're going to determine how the item is paid for using a credit card.

01:11.690 --> 01:18.110
Pay Pal or cash if pick from a shelf they're also going to determine how the item is delivered either

01:18.110 --> 01:24.120
through postage or picked up at a counter other stops in the algorithm could include gift wrapping for

01:24.120 --> 01:24.840
example.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.160
But this is the template method and all you have to do with implement these methods is hard code some

01:29.160 --> 01:34.950
output indicating that the right method was invoked right but the Template Method again has a series

01:34.950 --> 01:36.480
of ordered steps.

01:36.510 --> 01:44.840
Do select due payment delivery and then probably gift wrapping you can create two subclasses that implement

01:45.350 --> 01:49.850
this after class or extend the steps that class net order in store order.

01:49.970 --> 01:54.040
These have the same order processing steps and that's why they're going to use the template method.

01:54.350 --> 01:59.330
They're going to implement the abstract math methods again default behavior just print out hey this

01:59.330 --> 02:05.430
method was invoked for net order or this method was invoked restore order the client will be the last

02:05.430 --> 02:10.890
up you need to do item creation is not necessary for implementation because we are demonstrating the

02:10.890 --> 02:16.090
use of the template method by processing the order so you can automatically assume that items have already

02:16.090 --> 02:22.410
been created added to some kind of shopping cart you just want to create some orders either an order

02:22.410 --> 02:29.350
or store order and then you want to process each order to demonstrate the Template Method pattern right.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.550
That's the goal of this assignment.

02:31.550 --> 02:37.120
So here is some example output we can just say the item was added to the online shopping cart.

02:37.130 --> 02:38.470
Again we're assuming items are there.

02:38.480 --> 02:48.420
So that would be maybe our first Template Method step and then we can say gift wrap preference get delivery

02:48.560 --> 02:54.980
address online payment through net banking card or paypal gift wrap successful ship the item through

02:54.980 --> 03:01.770
the post office deliver the address right and then the next one.

03:02.050 --> 03:07.300
And so that's the first Template Method and this will be going through it through the net through the

03:07.300 --> 03:09.990
net banking net payment.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.180
The next one will be customer chooses from the item from the shelf.

03:13.300 --> 03:19.390
So this would be the other concrete subclass they pay at the counter through peo us the gift wrap or

03:19.390 --> 03:22.140
successful right.

03:22.180 --> 03:26.480
And then the item is delivered to in delivery counter.

03:26.480 --> 03:26.660
Right.

03:26.710 --> 03:33.450
No I but to a delivery counter but you see the certain steps here in the first example the.

03:33.550 --> 03:37.280
It's an online and the second example it's customer off the shelf.

03:37.450 --> 03:42.990
So two separate preferences but again the steps are the same gift wrap preference.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.310
Get the delivery address.

03:44.320 --> 03:51.160
You have to do that for not banking and get the online payment through not baking and then wrap it and

03:51.160 --> 03:53.380
then ship it to the delivery address.

03:53.800 --> 03:59.020
Identify those common steps and go ahead and implement and try doing that some of you for you with the

03:59.020 --> 04:05.320
process order through the selection the payment and the delivery all right.

04:05.350 --> 04:07.550
So that's that's what I want you to do.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.080
This will test your understanding of the template method good luck if you have any questions asked me

04:11.080 --> 04:13.210
in the Q and A thank you.
