WEBVTT

00:05.440 --> 00:05.710
All right.

00:05.710 --> 00:12.070
So in this video it's time to download and install the IDC integrated development environment that we're

00:12.070 --> 00:13.820
gonna be using in this course.

00:13.870 --> 00:17.640
And just a reminder before we proceed that this video is for Windows.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.900
Check out the other videos in this section.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.360
If you're on a Mac or you're running Linux.

00:22.570 --> 00:29.020
All right so what we need to do is visit get brains dot com and other people who are responsible for

00:29.020 --> 00:34.250
the product call Intel each idea that we're gonna be using in this course.

00:34.250 --> 00:41.130
So once you get to that website I come up here to tools and you can go down and I've got to click on

00:41.160 --> 00:48.220
intelligent ideas when that screen loads I'm going to click on a download.

00:48.940 --> 00:53.480
I'm going to close down this little box here which is a cookies pop up you may have seen on other Web

00:53.480 --> 00:54.240
sites.

00:54.490 --> 00:56.880
Click on yes I agree to close it down.

00:57.020 --> 01:02.530
You've actually got two versions that you can download the Community Edition over here on the right

01:02.530 --> 01:07.790
hand side you can see it says that it's free and open source so you'll never need to pay for it.

01:07.810 --> 01:11.200
And that's the version that I'm going to download and install.

01:11.200 --> 01:18.780
And the one that I recommend to use for the course I'm gonna click on that even a moment to start.

01:18.790 --> 01:21.260
You can see it and then starting on the click on run.

01:21.350 --> 01:26.760
And while that's downloading I'm just gonna click on back and talk briefly about the differences you

01:26.760 --> 01:30.260
can see that the ultimate edition is a commercial license.

01:30.270 --> 01:32.550
So it's not open source and therefore not free.

01:33.210 --> 01:34.860
So you can grab that if you want.

01:34.920 --> 01:39.570
It's got a lot of extra tools and capabilities and it's aimed at professional developers.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.490
You do get a free trial.

01:41.520 --> 01:48.060
Brains give you a 30 day trial and if you want to extend a trial to 120 days check out the extend and

01:48.330 --> 01:52.910
whole time Holtzman edition lecture which is right at the end of this course.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.690
You can go there and get a code to extend it by another 90 days.

01:56.730 --> 01:59.250
That's only if you want to use the Ultimate Edition.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.960
But in our case we're going to be using the committee edition.

02:02.010 --> 02:06.840
You don't need to do any of that I'm going to close down the browser because we to go through the process

02:06.870 --> 02:14.740
now of installing intelligent ideas from the click on yes here and now we've got a standard wizard and

02:14.740 --> 02:17.010
I'm going to go through the steps to install and click on.

02:17.010 --> 02:23.100
Next I click on Next again accepting the default destination folder.

02:23.300 --> 02:27.880
Now when you get this first grade it's important to get this bit right in the last video.

02:28.030 --> 02:29.680
You saw me establish that for me.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.050
I was on a 64 bit operating system.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.500
So up here and I create desktop shortcut.

02:34.510 --> 02:36.780
I'm going to click on 64 bit launcher.

02:37.090 --> 02:41.450
If you were on a 32 bit operating system you would choose the 32 bit launcher.

02:41.530 --> 02:46.810
And in addition to that you'd also come down here and click on download and install Gyari excite six

02:46.810 --> 02:48.040
by jet planes.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.350
That's only if you're a 32 bit user.

02:50.350 --> 02:54.820
In my case I'm a 64 bit user which we established in the last few days.

02:54.820 --> 02:59.830
I'm just clicking on 64 bit launcher and not selecting that these create associations.

02:59.830 --> 03:05.200
I suggest you check all three of those and that just means that if you've got a file with any of those

03:05.200 --> 03:11.500
extensions which is basically some java code groovy which is another language and Colin you click any

03:11.500 --> 03:13.030
of those it will open up an intelligence.

03:13.390 --> 03:19.900
So I'm gonna click on Next click on install and it's going to go through the process of installing Intel

03:19.900 --> 03:27.430
each idea on this computer and just to note that if you did have a 32 bit operating system and he selected

03:27.430 --> 03:34.720
to download the Gyari you'll find that that will take a while and that will increase the time for completion

03:34.960 --> 03:36.700
of this installation process.

03:36.700 --> 03:43.080
But in my case again I was on a 64 bit machine and didn't need and didn't need to do that right so I

03:43.080 --> 03:46.270
got a pause and let us finish and will come back once it's complete.

03:46.510 --> 03:46.750
All right.

03:46.750 --> 03:50.020
So at this point now you can see that the installation has completed.

03:50.140 --> 03:57.600
I'm going to check the checkbox so that we run until it idea and click on finish and you can see that's

03:57.600 --> 03:58.290
actually popped up.

03:58.290 --> 04:04.560
They can't say that too well and that's because what I've done is I've actually upsized the windows

04:04.620 --> 04:08.820
so that they fit better we can see things a little bit more clearly but that hasn't worked too well

04:08.820 --> 04:10.590
for this particular dialogue.

04:10.860 --> 04:17.220
That's basically telling us is that there's an option for you to import Intel E.J. I.D. settings from

04:17.220 --> 04:18.940
a custom location.

04:18.940 --> 04:23.790
Now that would be if you had it in previous installation of intelligence idea and you wanted to restore

04:23.790 --> 04:25.020
all the various settings.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.910
But in my case this is a brand new installation on a brand new machine.

04:29.010 --> 04:32.870
So I'm going to select the option do not import settings and click Okay.

04:35.240 --> 04:41.760
Now depending on your location you may or may not get this option on screen now about git brains privacy

04:41.760 --> 04:42.930
policy.

04:42.930 --> 04:47.970
So I'm going to scroll down to the bottom here in any case I'm going to click on except if you get that

04:47.970 --> 04:49.720
just accept that.

04:49.920 --> 04:56.310
And in terms of data sharing you can change the behavior there and send usage statistics to jet brains.

04:56.310 --> 04:57.630
I'm going to click on don't send

05:00.490 --> 05:00.820
all right.

05:00.870 --> 05:06.860
So at this point now we've got the option of choosing the theme for intelligence noting that it's telling

05:06.860 --> 05:09.950
us down there that we can go into the settings and changes later.

05:09.950 --> 05:15.630
I'm going to select the white background which is good for video but you might want to select Dracula.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.470
But the choice is yours.

05:17.630 --> 05:24.050
And then I'm going to click on next and what intelligence allows you to do is install a variety of different

05:24.050 --> 05:25.130
tools.

05:25.280 --> 05:29.870
We don't need any of these tools at this point of course I'm just gonna click on Next particularly stole

05:29.870 --> 05:31.530
anything that if you wanted to.

05:31.550 --> 05:36.980
And likewise for the feature plugins we are going to be using any of those either some of the click

05:36.980 --> 05:39.080
on start using intelligence my idea of

05:43.530 --> 05:43.780
all right.

05:43.780 --> 05:49.850
So at this point no we've done the basic installation of intelligence idea what we need to do.

05:49.910 --> 05:55.570
So once only process is we need to associate the Java development kit that we've previously downloaded

05:55.570 --> 06:01.900
and installed with intelligence so that intelligence is able to access and use that Java development

06:01.900 --> 06:06.910
kit the way we're going to do that is going gonna click on configure going to click on project defaults

06:07.780 --> 06:14.530
then select project structure that brings up the screen here and if you installing intelligent idea

06:14.530 --> 06:17.220
for the first time you'll probably get something similar to me.

06:17.350 --> 06:23.860
Can not you can see on screen here with no SDK and just in case sometimes until it opens up down here

06:24.350 --> 06:27.930
and domestic cases make sure you click on project if you see that.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.850
So over here what that's saying is there's no SDK is T.K. means suffer development kit.

06:32.910 --> 06:36.610
It's not just telling us that we need to define and set one up to do that.

06:36.640 --> 06:45.360
I'm going to click on you to come over here and select J.D. K. Now in some cases Intel each idea will

06:45.450 --> 06:51.780
automatically find the version or the Java development kit that we installed in the previous video.

06:51.900 --> 06:54.180
In this case it hasn't found it for us.

06:54.180 --> 06:58.380
So what would they need to do is navigate to the folder where that was installed.

06:58.380 --> 07:02.060
I'm gonna come down here and click on the triangles there.

07:02.130 --> 07:09.350
Mary if you recall it was C column backslash program files then it was Java That's Kyle Evans.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.280
I was going to click on JT Cale over there.

07:11.900 --> 07:18.000
Now if you happen to have downloaded the 32 bit version of Java which was Java 8 you will most likely

07:18.000 --> 07:23.540
have a J R E which stands for Java runtime edition and a J.D. K. folder.

07:23.550 --> 07:28.900
In that scenario make sure you selected J.D. K. folder that you can see that I've got selected here.

07:29.610 --> 07:34.740
I'm going to click on okay and you can say that something happened up here and we've now got an option

07:35.160 --> 07:37.670
we've got nodes to k but we're now also got this option here.

07:37.680 --> 07:41.120
Java eleven so that will obviously be Java right.

07:41.130 --> 07:45.000
If that's the version you downloaded then the other thing you need to do is depending on the version

07:45.000 --> 07:48.960
you want to match the project language level to the version you download.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.810
So my case is set currently to 10.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.520
I'm going to change that to eleven that's for Java eleven.

07:55.680 --> 08:01.630
Then we need to click on accept here which will probably disappear in a future version of intelligent

08:01.640 --> 08:07.450
because this is because the Java developer kid is so new as of the time that I'm recording this video.

08:07.480 --> 08:12.950
Now obviously if you downloaded Java right you would select eight here which would match the version

08:13.020 --> 08:13.720
you've downloaded.

08:13.770 --> 08:16.870
But in my case I've selected 11 I'm going to click on okay.

08:18.740 --> 08:19.020
Okay.

08:19.060 --> 08:25.030
And at that point what we've done is we've now installed or configured the Java development kit to work

08:25.030 --> 08:25.820
with Intel A.J..

08:26.260 --> 08:30.380
It's just a few other settings we need to do now which are once only settings which just makes life

08:30.400 --> 08:36.310
a little bit easier for you when you're starting out with Java with intelligent idea and to get access

08:36.310 --> 08:43.090
to those we come back here you click on configure select settings and when that comes up we kind of

08:43.090 --> 08:51.440
go down to Ed and select General we're gonna open that up there and I'm going to select what how important

08:52.220 --> 08:57.810
I want I'm going to check is these two boxes here which is add an ambiguous imports on the fly as well

08:57.810 --> 09:02.970
as optimized inputs on the fly for kind of project and we'll be talking more in a future video as to

09:02.970 --> 09:05.920
what they mean for now just check those.

09:05.960 --> 09:12.360
The other thing you want to do is come down to a parent's to make sure that line numbers is checked

09:12.420 --> 09:14.410
which it is by default.

09:14.580 --> 09:16.260
But make sure that is checked.

09:16.260 --> 09:22.620
And the last two options we want to set are under here on a code folding and what we wanted to do a

09:22.620 --> 09:28.850
few things we want to actually take the checkbox off in ports so we're not kind of collapse imports

09:29.220 --> 09:36.000
on a uncheck the one line methods we want to uncheck closures but we want to uncheck generic constructor

09:36.110 --> 09:37.740
and method parameters.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.950
Now if you're new to Java that probably doesn't make a lot of sense.

09:39.960 --> 09:45.510
But essentially what we're doing here is we're setting ourselves up to not get the OK to make sure rather

09:45.900 --> 09:51.720
that the editor intelligent doesn't hide any code as you become more experienced as a developer.

09:51.720 --> 09:55.710
You'll want to hide portions of the code to focus on what you're working on but when we're starting

09:55.710 --> 09:57.530
out we want access and see everything.

09:57.540 --> 10:00.460
So this is the reasonable we've actually uncheck those options.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.210
So they're all the code will actually be shown right.

10:03.240 --> 10:09.230
So finally I want to click on Okay now saved all those settings at this point we're ready to start programming

10:09.950 --> 10:15.480
so successfully configured Intel each idea and we're now ready to move on to the next video.

10:15.720 --> 10:21.660
And just a reminder to get access to the next to that next video you can skip the next four videos because

10:21.660 --> 10:26.220
their installation videos for the Mac and Linux go to the video after that.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.230
That's got the title first steps.

10:28.230 --> 10:29.760
I'll see you in that video.
