Hello and welcome back.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.450
We have another challenge for you.

00:08.700 --> 00:14.150
This is gonna be the proxy challenge it's will test your understanding the proxy design pattern it's

00:14.210 --> 00:21.350
gonna be a very simple real life scenario which is actually the Internet from some some some place where

00:21.350 --> 00:23.730
you're not you don't have access to all the sites.

00:23.840 --> 00:28.200
So for example like a library when you go to a library and try to access the Internet they're going

00:28.200 --> 00:34.080
to restrict some access to some sites obviously sites that they don't think you shouldn't have access

00:34.080 --> 00:40.620
to in a library and a public place and so they'll typically use a proxy for that they'll use the proxy

00:40.620 --> 00:46.170
to restrict the access which is the main purpose of the proxy as well as increasing performance as you

00:46.170 --> 00:52.130
mentioned the proxy will first check the host you're connecting to if it is not part of a restricted

00:52.130 --> 00:54.770
site list then it connects to the real Internet.

00:54.770 --> 00:59.150
So the subject here will be the real Internet and the proxy will determine whether or not you can connect

00:59.150 --> 00:59.840
to the real Internet.

01:00.740 --> 01:05.230
So you need to create a subject class that contains a method to connect to the Internet.

01:05.330 --> 01:11.210
It will take a string representing the hostname it will throw an exception if the host name is restricted.

01:11.420 --> 01:16.070
You need to create the real subject class which does the actual work it actually connects to the Internet.

01:16.070 --> 01:20.450
Now we don't have any logic to connect to the internet so you can just hard code it sum up at the says

01:20.780 --> 01:21.680
connected to the Internet.

01:23.550 --> 01:28.470
You need to create the proxy class remember the proxy class is going to control the access so it's going

01:28.470 --> 01:33.580
to have a has a relationship with the real subject some reference to it.

01:33.730 --> 01:37.140
It's going to also contain a list of the restricted sites because it's going to need to search those

01:37.140 --> 01:40.140
restricted sites before it can allow access.

01:40.140 --> 01:44.120
So if the host you're trying to connect to is a banned site then it's going to throw an exception.

01:44.130 --> 01:45.530
Otherwise we'll connect to the Internet

01:48.440 --> 01:53.870
and then you need to create the client the client is going to use that proxy to try to connect to legitimate

01:53.870 --> 02:01.680
sites to very straightforward implementation example mentioned it's similar to the decorator except

02:01.680 --> 02:02.920
that it has different purposes right.

02:02.920 --> 02:08.030
It controls access to an object as opposed to adding additional fund functionality to an object.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.890
Some sample output for example.

02:11.890 --> 02:15.670
I'm trying to connect to a particularly site.

02:15.670 --> 02:16.960
You could say I'm connecting to it.

02:17.530 --> 02:22.090
Otherwise connect to something on the restricted site list will say access tonight.

02:22.090 --> 02:22.360
OK.

02:22.390 --> 02:23.680
So this is straightforward.

02:23.700 --> 02:27.730
I'll provide a solution on how to implement this in the next lecture.

02:27.730 --> 02:28.110
Thank you.
