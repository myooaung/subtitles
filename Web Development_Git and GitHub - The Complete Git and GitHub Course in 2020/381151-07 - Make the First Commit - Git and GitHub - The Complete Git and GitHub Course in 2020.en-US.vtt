00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
all right.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.220
So in the previous lecture,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.860
we created our very first repository.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.160
And now in this video,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.100
I'm going to show you the whole cycle.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.920
I mean,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.310
beginning from untracked files to making commits.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.400
So there are several faces which filed or project goes through In general,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.910
remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states tracked and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.420
untracked tracked files are falls,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.280
which were in the last snapshot.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.210
As for untracked files,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.270
they are any files that were not in your last snapshot if we consider our example.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.750
I mean,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.960
our little project,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.210
which we created in the previous lecture files index dot html and startled CSS are

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.800
untracked files because we didn't make any snapshot yet.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.540
In order to begin tracking a new file,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.590
we used the comment get at and then we should specify the name off the fight.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.680
Once we run this command than this file will be staged.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.340
So in general,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.990
when file ends up in the staging area,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.250
it means that it's ready to be committed in order to make commit,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.850
we should around the command,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.450
get commit desh em,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.250
which allows us to create a message with a little description.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.580
So when you commit the version off the file at the time you ran,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.350
get at is what will be stored in the historical snatched.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.830
All right,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.290
you were able to change a file that was,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.520
although detract and when you do that,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.590
that it will be modified.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.610
So it means that followed that was tracked has been modified in the working directory,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.380
but it's not yet staged.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.930
In other words,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.280
in history there is stored the version off the file,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.940
which we added it to the staging area.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.550
Firstly.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.790
So now if we want to make a snapshot with a modified version off the file that,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.870
then we have to stage it again using get at command,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.980
and after that the file should be ready to commit.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.890
All right,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.260
so this is a whole cycle on those of the main faces.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.090
Which file goes through Now it's time to go to our terminal and see all of the stuff in

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.630
practice.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.880
So now we are in our folder in which we have to untracked files.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.560
As you already know.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.280
The next step,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.360
which we have to do,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.150
is to add those two fathers to the staging area.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.310
Before that,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.440
I am going to insert some basic stuff into those two fouls.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.160
Let's just create a basic structure off HTML document.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.070
For that,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.750
we need to place exclamation mark and pressed up.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.580
Also,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.440
it's open style.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.770
Don't CSS file and just change background color for the body element.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.450
Let's make it threat.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.120
All right.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.750
Now it's time to add those fathers to the staging area for that.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.240
As I already have shown,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.730
we need to use the command,

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:07.670
get ad and we have to specify names off the files index of HTML and styled with CSS.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.130
So now those files are staged and if we check the status using git status,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.700
then you will find that files are no longer read.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.420
They have changed their color now their greed and also we see here the text no commits yet

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.350
and changes to be committed.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.590
So it means that those two fouls are ready to be committed.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.460
Also,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.230
we see here text which is saying that we can use command git RM dash dash cash in order to

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.280
on stage the first.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.500
So if you run this command for one off the files,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.950
let's say for index dot html and then check the status again.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.450
You will see that in Excel html is again untracked.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.190
So remember that when you want to get with off the file from the staging area,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.880
you need to use the command git RM dash dash cashed with the file name.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.630
Okay,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.720
let's add again indexed LH demo to the staging area around the command kids at in Excel

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.500
html.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.640
All right,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.690
so now it's time to make our first commit For that,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.690
we need get commit,

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.240
and then we have to create a message which will have a little description off our snapshot

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.240
.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.930
So we need to dash Cam and then inside quotes.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.120
We can write some text.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.140
In general,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.550
this tax should be short on descriptive.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.180
I'm going to write here initial comic.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:50.660
So once we press enter that we will get the message saying Please tell me who you are and

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.350
then down below,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.310
you see that we have to run some commence.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.260
Actually,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.870
it happened because we need some configuration.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.090
We have to specify the name off the user and the email get it requires this information

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.860
because it saves in history to whom belongs particular comment in other words,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.750
it records Which developer made this new options?

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.610
So we have to run kids kind of fig.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.090
That's dash global,

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:26.590
That user don't name if you want to specify your name with two or more words that you need

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.250
to enclose them within quotes.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.480
But if you're going to write just name with a single work,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.720
then you don't need quotes.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.770
All right,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.550
I'm going to write you some random name.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.970
Let's say,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.370
John,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.950
after that we have to configure email.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.890
So we need a similar command.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.770
By the way,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.980
if you want to use previous commence again,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.710
but then you don't need to type them over and over again.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.080
You just need to press the up arrow key and you will get the previous commenced.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.250
Let's change the name and write an email instead of it,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.400
and that he's a fearsome Tommy email.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.550
Let's say John at Gmail.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.950
Com,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.250
Of course,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.240
you can use your own email.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.170
It's up to you.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.780
All right,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.370
so now we can make a commit.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.140
But before that,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.830
let's make sure that all these configuration stuff is done correctly.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.130
I'm going to check the user name and the email for that.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.990
We have to run.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.740
Get config.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.640
That's dash global user dot name.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.990
As you see,

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.450
we got here named John on the same weaken due for email.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.210
So as you can see,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.110
everything is set up and finally were able to make the committee for that.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.830
We have to write,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.150
kids commit dash um,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.810
and then the message in issue commit So now.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.040
Eventually we made our first commit and in history there is recorded the current state of

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.650
the project.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.730
When we proceed and continue working on the project,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.900
then in the future,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.570
every time will be able to go back in time and use the state off the project.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.630
Actually,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.440
you will be able to see all of the stuff,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.370
throw the course,

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.770
and before we move on,

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.800
I want to talk a little about commits.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.780
You may think that once we make a snap shirt,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.840
then we start the copy off the files for the project.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.360
But that's not right.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.980
Every time you commit,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.490
get basically takes a picture off what your files look like at this specific moment,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.460
and it stores a reference to that snapshot.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.450
That's the huge advantage off using kids.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.590
All right,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.070
for now,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.970
I think it's enough.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.490
We have just learned about the faces off the cycle.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.180
I mean,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.720
what is staging area?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.000
Modifying the files?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.670
Also,

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.060
we made our first commit,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.450
and now it's time to move on to the next lecture.
