X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
all right.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.580
So in the last lecture,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.190
we pushed the changes from the local repository to get up as the collaborator.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.720
We did it without any problem.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.110
I mean,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.030
without any pull request or permission from the owner off the repository.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.400
As I said in a previous lecture In the real World,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.880
that situation is not quite convenient.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.630
If you are the owner of the project and you have some collaborators in your team,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.080
then you might need some control mechanism to check others work and avoid any unexpected

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.650
results.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.500
To be more precise,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.660
get up close the owners of the repositories to protect the branches by requiring the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.820
reviews before merging the branches.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.000
All right,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.650
let's go ahead and figure out where I'm talking about.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.790
I'm going to protect the master branch.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.940
In most cases in the real world,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.420
the master branch is deployable and nobody touched it for testing proposes,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.110
so it should be protected to protect the branch.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.170
We have to go to settings and then we have to click branch.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.470
Here we see a little section called Branch Protecting Rules.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.990
Only right inside of the heading,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.220
we confined the bottom called at rule.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.840
Let's go ahead and click the button.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.050
So we've got here and input fields in which we should indicate the name off the branch and

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.640
down below.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.240
We confined somewhere rule settings That's enter here,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.870
the name off the branch Master.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.590
After that,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.010
I'm going to take a year off the rule settings.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.470
So in this case,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.080
I want to use the first rule,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.150
which is require pull requests reviews before merging.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.880
So once we check this check box here,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.200
then all commits must be made to a non protected branch in this guy's the branch that is

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.290
not master and have to be submitted via a pull request with the required number off

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.520
approving reviews.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.190
In other words,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.650
people request can be accepted by the reviewer to merge the branches.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.760
As for the number off approving reviews,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.350
it should be selected from this drop down menu.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.520
In our case,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.190
we have just one collaborator.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.270
So as the number off approving reviews,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.850
I'm going to select one.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.750
Then finally click this green button here and create the rule.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.560
All right,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.420
so as a conceit now the rule applies to the master branch.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.960
Let's go back to the terminal and continue working.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.630
I want to remind you that currently I'm working from a different computer to imitate the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.820
process off collaboration properly.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.340
I'm going to add it.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.110
The index of html file.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:57.090
Let's create the paragraph with some Tommy text and then make a new committee with a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.830
message,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.640
added P.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.040
So now we need to push the change to get up.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.310
But we can't do it over the master branch because it's protected.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.550
If I run,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.800
get push origin Master,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.220
then we will get an error because,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.860
as we said,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.790
the massive branch is protected.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.480
So what should we do?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.040
We have to create a new branch,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.680
push it to the get up and then merge eight to the master branch.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.140
So let's go ahead and create a new branch for that.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.720
Let's run,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.240
get check out Dash B,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.500
followed by the name of the branch.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.730
Let's say test as remember these command close is to create a new branch and switch to it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.650
at the same time.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.250
Let's around the history.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.530
So here we have all the commits which have been made so far,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.040
I'm going to add a new committee on the test branch.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.320
Let's change the phone size of the paragraph,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:16.840
make it 30 pixels and then make a new committee you with the message.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.540
Increased phone size off peak.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.140
Finally,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.690
let's run the history as you see the test branches.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.970
One.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.080
Commit ahead off the massive brunch.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.750
All right,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.330
so now we can push the changes over that newly created branch on get up,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.630
run again,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.940
gets pushed origin and then indicate here the name of the branch test.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.010
So once this command is run,

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.880
if we go to the collaborators account,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.930
we will find here the pushed test branch in a slightly different color.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.550
So now we have to compare changes and create a put request.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.760
Let's go ahead and click this button here.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.230
Then I'm going to change here.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.980
The comments.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:21.550
That's until he added on Styled Pete and then click the button to create the pull request.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.010
So,

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.390
no,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.220
we've got here some warnings.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.860
The 1st 1 says that the review is required.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.300
As for the 2nd 1 it says that the merge is blocked,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.560
and also you can see that we're not able to merge the port request because the bottom is to

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.840
say,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.880
Let's go and check the owner's account.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.910
Reload the page as you see,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.870
we have here one full request.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.280
Let's go ahead and open it.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:55.180
You can find here the same warnings review is required and merging is blocked.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.780
But despite this,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.130
I can still Merced people request as the owner off the report story.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.050
All right,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.150
so what should we do?

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.120
First of all,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.890
we have to set the reviewer I mean the user which will review the changes and approve the

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.190
pull request here on the right hand side of the page,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:19.780
we say the reviewers section also here is a hint saying that at least one approving review

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:26.550
is required to merge these pull requests that comes from the rule settings which we have

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.450
just set up.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.640
Let's go ahead and set the reviewer for that.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.150
We have to click this icon here,

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.990
As you can see,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.630
get help suggests automatically to set the owner off the report as a reviewer.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.960
Let's select it.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.250
After that,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.830
we have to go to the files change top where we can find all the changes made by the

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.750
collaborator.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.220
So,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.420
after reviewing the changes,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:01.170
if the owner is happy with them that he or she should approve them at the top right corner

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.170
.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.880
Off the section,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.720
we can find a green button called review changes.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.010
If I click it,

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.140
then the input field will be displayed with some options.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.820
I mean,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.410
the options,

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.440
like comment approved on request changes in this guys,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.220
we have to select a proof also.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.660
Let's adhere some comments.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.450
Good job and click submit a review.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:31.340
So now the owner off the project has approved the changes made by the collaborator,

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.180
and we can simply merge the request.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:43.610
If we check the committee Serie we will find all the commits made by the collaborator,

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.310
followed by the merge.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.730
Commit the salmon confined.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.530
If we checked it.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.950
Collaborators account.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:57.050
All right,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.700
Some of that's the way how we can protect the branches and control collaborators.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.870
Work on Gibson.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.920
Okay,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.870
congratulations.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.550
We're done.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.270
And our course is over.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:14.340
I hope it was interesting you enjoyed it and learn lots of different things regarding get

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.010
and get up.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.030
Nowadays,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.810
every developer should know how to deal with the most popular and widely used version

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.860
control systems.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.010
After finishing this course,

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.080
you will have all the needed skills and knowledge about Kate and get up.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.190
I want to remind you that you have lifetime access on the course,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.390
so you can come back any time,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.820
recalled some important topics about get and get up and also fall.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.600
All the updates for this course.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.040
All right.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.800
Thanks for being with us.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.920
We should all the best.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.450
Bye bye.
