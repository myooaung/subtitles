00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
all right.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.530
So before we start to discuss and a specific topic regarding get the first question that

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.770
comes to mind and I have to answer is the following what is get?

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.520
So as the definition,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.550
we can say that it is a distributed version control system.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.140
Most of you who is not family with get.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.340
Yet those words are not quite clear.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.690
So let's first talk about what version control itself is version control.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.980
Or maybe sometimes you may hear source control is a system that records changes off your

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.010
file or entire project,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.550
and then you're able to recall any specific version off your project later.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.310
In other words,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.210
the version control system allows you to go back in time and get previous states off your

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.750
project.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.500
Also,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.550
you can compare changes over time.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.990
All right,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.990
let's use an example to make even clear what version control system is.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.710
And why should we use it?

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.300
Suppose that you're working on a project.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.700
I mean,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.290
you're building a website,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.230
you have done a couple of things,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.050
and you already have your first version off the website.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.880
Then suppose that you want to change something,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.270
and also you don't want to lose your first version off the project.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.870
So what can you do?

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.880
The first thing that comes to mind is to say the first version,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.250
Then make a copy off it and work on the second version.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.080
Then suppose you need to make another copy than another and someone finally,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.910
you might have lots of different versions of the project,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.430
and also your hard drive might be folk.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.160
You agree that it's not the perfect and efficient way when you work,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.960
especially on large projects.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.120
So in order to avoid such painful and insufficient way,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.570
the version control system was created.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.150
So it allows you to make snapshots off the current state off your project,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.900
which means that it saves all of those different versions off the project in just one

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.660
directory.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.040
Nowadays,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.500
there are a couple of different version control systems,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.070
but the most popular one,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.400
which is widely used today,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.640
is get those days went Web development is extremely fast growing industry in the world and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.340
have to be a good and professional work developer.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.960
Then you should definitely know how to work with it because you might be working on

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.690
different projects at the same time,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.360
and without a version control system,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.170
your working process might be hard and painful.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.510
Also,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.020
one of the advantages off using git is collaboration.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.560
It means that different developers can work on the same project for that.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.870
Today,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.540
we use mostly Get Hub,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.010
which is online service.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.430
You can host your project on Get up.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.500
It is a terrible place,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.930
and everyone can work on the project regarding get help.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.020
We'll discuss it later in the course At the beginning of this video,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.110
when we defined what it is,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.910
we said that it's a distributed version control system.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.950
In general,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.610
there are two types of version control systems centralized and distributed,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.260
or the central light centralized version Control systems have a single several that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.900
contains all the different versions of projects so that developers can collaborate.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.730
But actually,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.400
this type of version control has some down sites.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.780
If you do not have net for connection,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.560
then you won't be able to get access on versions.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.890
And also if for some reason server corrupts,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.960
then he will lose all your data.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.920
But in case of distributed version control systems,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.290
you say versions off your projects locally on different computers and also on sever.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.670
And each copy off project is a full backup off all of your data.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.080
So if something happens with server,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.530
then you still have the full backup off entire project locally.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.590
And also,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.190
you don't need to have not for connection in order to save versions off your project.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.610
All right,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.380
so that was a little introduction off version control systems and actually get for now,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.530
it might not be quite clear for you,

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.880
especially when you're not family with get,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.350
but it's not a problem.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.230
Step by step,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.350
you will get solid knowledge and experience in it.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.500
Okay?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.070
So bear with me and move on to the next lecture.
