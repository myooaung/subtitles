if you're right,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.240
any type of code that it's always good to use a version control system.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.950
This course will teach you about one of the most popular and widely used version control

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.850

We are the creators and designers of this course,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.650
and we represent code and create nowadays and you off.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.280
The professional developer or designer needs to know how to work with kit and get it allows

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.910

We will start from get basics where you can learn about how to install get We will go

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.830
through the basics of the terminal.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.630
We will create our first local repository and it will see how to say different versions of

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.730
the project as the snapshots using commits.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.830
Next,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.390
we will move on and learn about how to go back in time and check the previous states of the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.890
project,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.310
update them or even do it.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.730
Once we get some solid knowledge about kids,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.310
then we will start learning about the basics off Kita go through the topics,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.840
such as creating the repository on connecting the local repository to a remote one,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.480
making commits and much more.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.090
Next we will move on and see how to work with one of the greatest features of kit,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.480
which is branching.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.440
You will learn about how to deal with branches locally,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.000
and also after that we will refer to kind of conflict stuff.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.020
We will show you how to merge branches with different methods and also how to deal with

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.450
emerge.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.790
We'll go through those topics both and give our best.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.350
Next it should be fellow.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.350
By forking and contributing,

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.540
you learn about how to copy someone else.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.430
Remote repository on your have account how to call into your local computer on how to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.340
contribute to the original port.

Finally,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.870
we will discuss how to collaborate on Beautiful.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.680
We'll go through some really important topics,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.000
such as how to set up a collaboration team,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.050
how to define different rules for collaborators on much other stuff,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.760
so join us.
