00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
all right.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.130
So in the last lecture,

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.340
we talked about how to copy the remote repository tore account using a fork,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.440
and also we so how to clone it to our local computer.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.830
Now it's empty.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.140
Move on and consider how we can update the repository and then contribute to the original

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.450
one.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.650
Nowadays,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.150
there are tons of open source projects on get hub,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.870
which different developers are working on.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:31.210
They copied this report stories update then and then sample requests to the owners to apply

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.850
those changes in a place to the original project.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.610
On the other hand,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.230
the owners of the project received pull requests from developers.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.050
Consider the changes and if they are happy than they emerge,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.070
updates to the original repository.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.960
This process is called contributing,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.760
and that's the way how different libraries and frameworks are updating today.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.360
All right,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.220
so in this lecture we're going to go through this entire process currently and working on

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.980
the repository which we cloned in the last lecture.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.050
It's the exact copy off the original project which we have bean working so far.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.460
So now I'm going to make some changes to this project here.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.870
I have opened the clone project in Venus code.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.300
Let's go to the index dot html fell and create some new Ellen's.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.580
Let's say four moment and inside of it,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.650
I'm going to insert input and button with a text click you.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.130
Then let's go ahead and add these change to the staging area and make a new commit for that

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.280
I'm going to use again the shorter way we have to run command git commit Dash AM with a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.280
message created for around Let's around the history.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.850
So we have here a new committee.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.700
Let's go ahead and add one more commit.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.490
I'm going to add some stars to the newly created four moment Let's open style that sees a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.410
smile and he secure some styles.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:32.380
Let's define margin and parting for four months and then again make and you commit with a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.020
message style.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.060
Four months.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.350
All right,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.790
so that's it.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.960
We have updated the project and suppose that we want to contribute these changes to the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.260
original report start.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.050
So what should we do?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.070
First of all,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.780
we need to push these changes to our second get help account.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.250
I'm in the account where we forked the repository for that.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.110
We have to run.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.840
Get push Origin,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.730
Master,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.550
as they say,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.390
We've got here some error.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.420
Actually,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.230
that's the issue.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.490
Off.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.030
Get and get help credentials,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.440
which we have already set up previously.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.420
We need a permission to push the changes to the remote repository.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.230
To do that,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.310
we have to change the credentials from the control panel.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.610
So let's go ahead and open it that we have to go to user accounts,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.920
select manage windows credentials.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.460
Click here,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.550
get and get up.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.010
And then click addict.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.760
So now I'm going to change the user name on the passport.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.900
You have to use your user name and passport off the second account.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.060
So once we do that,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.700
then we'll be able to push the changes to the remote repository.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.860
So let's run once again gives push origin Master.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.880
Now,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.210
if we check our get have account and reload the page,

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.400
then we will find here the last two commits,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.700
which we have just made.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.410
All right,

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.050
fine.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.030
So now we can send those changes to the owner off the original repository.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.410
For that,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.590
we have to create a new pool request.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.900
We need to click this button here now,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.070
as you see get hubby's comparing to changes between two branches.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.220
In this case,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.710
those two branches are the massive branch off the original repository and the master branch

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.050
off our second report.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.920
In our case there no conflicts and branches can be automatically Merced so we can feel free

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.820
and create April request.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.970
Let's click this green button here.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.140
Now get help is asking for to make some comments and descriptions.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.570
In the real world,

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.010
when you try to contribute to some projects,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.290
you have to send some descriptive comments to make an easier and clearly emerging process

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.930
for the owners off the project.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.410
So let's put you some comments right,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.540
updated project and then down below.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.500
I'm going to ease it.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.640
Some descriptive text,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.450
Let's say,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:41.070
added a new form element in index of html file and styled it from the style.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.130
Don't CSS thought so.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.950
Now we are ready to create a pool request.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.250
Let's collect this green bottom,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.580
Hugh.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.750
Okay,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.950
so the pull request is created,

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.930
as you might notice,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.380
were not allowed to merge the branches from here because it's the job off the owner off the

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.890
project.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.760
Now let's go ahead and switch to the owner's account.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.950
I mean the accounts which owns the original project.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.310
If we reload the page,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.580
then we'll get Year One full request.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.740
Let's click it so you can find here the pull request,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.080
which we have just made from the second account.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.250
With all its comments and changes,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.320
we can review the commits made by the another user.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.610
Also weaken review all the changes which were made to the project.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.490
As you see,

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.250
there are two fouls changed in mix of HD Melons 1000 CSS.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.880
The code in green collar with plus size is the updated version off the file in both cases.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.310
So after checking the changes,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.840
if we are happy with them,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840
we can merge the branches.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.290
Actually,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.740
you can right back to the user some text,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.720
Let's say great job,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:13.030
and then you can merge the branches so the original project is updated.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.250
If we check the commit stop,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.350
we will find all the commits made by another user,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.820
followed by the committee about merging their branches.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.830
All right,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.990
so that's the way how we can contribute to some open source repository on.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.170
Get up Now I'm going to show you what happens if there is a merging conflict.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.750
Let's make some change from the second user.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.290
I'm going to do that straight from get up.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:53.150
Let's increase the size off the margin and make it 30 pieces also make a new committee

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.470
increased margin.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.570
Then suppose that before we make,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.650
they pull repressed.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:02.860
In the meantime,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.160
the owner of the project changed the sides off the margin as well.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.370
To imitate this process,

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:14.150
let's switch back to the owner's account and change the size of the margin.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.170
Let's make it 25 pieces and stand mate,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.670
and you commit changed margin.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:29.060
After that,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.810
let's create a pull request from the second account.

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.530
Click the button here.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.090
So as you see,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:44.200
we have a conflict because both users were trying to added the same line of the coat.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.280
So what can we do to you?

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.490
Firstly,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.620
we can create the pull request anyway,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.080
despite the conflict.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.300
Next,

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.920
we can either result the conflict from here or we can leave it as it is and let the owner

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.570
to do that.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.950
The owner off the project will get the pull request with conflict anyway,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:11.850
so if we switch back to the owner's account and check the pull request up.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.550
We will find their request with the conflict.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.510
Now we can resolve the conflict from here,

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.380
as it was in the previous case.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.050
Suppose that we prefer to increase the margin to 30 pixels,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.390
So let's make here the appropriate changes.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:34.940
Then mark as result.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.050
Commit march.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:43.660
Now get Hub won't sells about emerging,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:50.580
click this button and finally merge pull request.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.220
If we checked,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.290
it commits history.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.270
Then we'll find all the commits made on both accounts,

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.380
including the Merge commits.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.130
All right,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.700
some that said about contributing to the original open source repository.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.280
I hope it makes sense to you.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.210
Let's move on to the next election.
