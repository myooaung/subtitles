00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
Okay,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.260
so we created our very first repository in the previous lecture.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.040
But for now,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.610
as you can see,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.840
we don't have here any files or folders because we should add them from the local

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.460
repository.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.650
Here we see some instructions.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.920
Also on top of them,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.830
we have a link off are repulsive.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.650
So the first part off these instructions shows us all the steps starting from the get

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.430
initializing three pushing local repository to get help.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.280
Most of those commands your although the family with I mean those three commands give in it

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.280
,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.060
get at and get commit.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.970
We have been using them in previous lectures.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.780
The first command here shows us how to create the read me file with some comments.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.570
For now,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.840
let's don't pay much attention to it.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
As for the last two commence,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.040
there used to connect the local repository to get up and then to push the report to give

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.790
him So this instructions are supposed to be used when you don't have your local repository

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.140
yet.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.300
But in our case,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.910
we have already created.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.010
So we need to use the second part of this instructions.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.340
I mean,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.510
those to commence.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.560
So let's go back to your working environment where we have our local repository.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.730
Let's check the history of our commits wrong gets log,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.270
dash,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.200
Dash one line.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.430
So overall we have to come.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.040
It's inside off Origin Files folder.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.570
There is just one untracked files about dot html.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.950
I'm going to add it to the staging area and then make a new commit Let's run gets at.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.650
Then we need to specify the folder name Arjuna Files slash and found them about that HTML

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:59.990
that check the status and now make new commit with a message added about dot html five.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.550
And finally check the history Ron gets.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.860
Look,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.150
dash,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.870
dash one line.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.760
All right,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.630
so now we have three commits and it's time to push our local repository to get her.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.360
The first step that you have to go through is to connect our local report to give him and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.870
for that we have to run the following command when it gets remote and next we need to set

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.200
the name off the remote.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.550
It is actually optional,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.510
but commonly it is called origin.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.330
So I'm not going to change it.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.460
And after that we have to specify the link off our repository,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.650
which actually was generated by give him in general,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.900
get hub Gives us two types of links.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.880
The 1st 1 starts with https.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.000
As for the 2nd 1 it sells with as as H.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.910
In this case,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.790
we're going to use https.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.470
So let's copy dealing from here and paste it in our terminal.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.110
So once we run this command them,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.450
our local repository will be connected to get up,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.000
and the next step is to push it to give him for that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.820
We need to round the following comment,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.370
get push than the name of the remote origin.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.340
And finally,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.390
we have to indicate here the name off the branch for now we don't know much about Branch is

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.090
the only thing that we know is that currently we're working on the default master branch.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.120
So that's indicated here,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.450
as they say,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.710
we got here a little pop up which requires us to enter our get up credentials.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.890
Sella's quickly enter our user name and passport,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.250
and after that we just need to reload the page.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.560
All right,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.180
so here we have our reports story with all the files and folders which we had locally.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.890
Okay,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.650
so we have successfully pushed our local repository to give up.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.140
Next,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.400
I'm going to show you how to add commits from get up and how to pull data from get up to

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.750
the local repository,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.200
so that's more.
