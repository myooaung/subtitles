00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
So in the last lecture we created an account on G Top and now we're going to explore the

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.100
website.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.770
I mean,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.170
some of its basic parts,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.390
and then we will start creating our very first repository.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.690
Currently,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.850
we're on the welcome page of Get Hub.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.720
Here we see two different buttons,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.940
read the guide and start a project.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.720
And actually,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.000
before we create our first report story,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.640
I'm going to show you how the existing repositories look like you can either check out some

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.170
reports stories on the right hand side of the page,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.700
get help,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.670
shows us some random repose,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.930
or you can just search for them from here.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470
I'm going to search for Let's say,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.640
react so he would have some results regarding React.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.260
Let's go to the 1st 1 which is the actual repository Off reacts library.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.450
So now we're on the page off reacts repository and actually all other repose look in a

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.180
similar way.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.850
It would have different files and folders which react library can see self.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.850
If we click one of them,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.280
we will be able to see some coat.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.820
Here we can see the green button,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.050
which allows us to clone or download the entire source at the top of the sore spots,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.000
you see a couple of different tops.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.020
The 1st 1 is comments.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.770
Overall,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.630
we have more than 11,000 comments.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.570
If we click,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.460
it's then we will be able to explore all the commits which were made so far as can see each

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.540
commit has its own I d.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.330
Similar,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.500
which we're so in.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.780
Our province lectures next,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.250
he commits.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.310
We have branches,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.840
which for now you're not family with.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.710
Also,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.730
we have here releases off different versions of react that it is followed by the number of

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.680
contributors.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.180
Those are the people who actually work on developing this library.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.590
All right,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.260
let's move on and describe some other things here at the top of this page,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.330
you see that this repo is used by more than two million people.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.390
Next to it,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.550
we have watch,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.840
and if we drop down it,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.630
we should see a couple of options.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.830
If you click watching for example,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.830
then you will be able to get updates regarding this repository.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.930
Also,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.690
you can give a started and someone for now I think it's enough.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.340
Let's go ahead,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.070
check out our profile.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.850
You're able to customize your profile,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.240
you can add your bio.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.030
Then we have a couple of input fields for your company name for location and website.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.880
Also,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.270
you're able to change Avatar and set your profile image.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.390
All right,

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.030
Actually,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.700
you can go ahead and explore all those things on your own.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.920
You can play around and check out different pages in order to get family or with gate up

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.410
website.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.180
Let's go to the main page and start creating a new report story.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.070
For that,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.010
we have to click.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.590
Either they start a project bottle or you can click here the link on the left hand side off

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.180
the page.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.660
Create a re positive.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.370
As you see,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.850
we moved to a different page where you can create a report we see here are user name,

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.370
followed by the input field in which you should enter the name off the report.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.890
I'm going to call it the exact same name,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.940
which we use for our local or post story.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.510
I mean gets project.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.890
Then down below.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.810
We have another input field for description,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.350
which actually is optional.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.540
Let's interview a little description.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.530
Let's say this is my first keep top repository then down below.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.900
We have two different options,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.130
public and private.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.660
If it choose public,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.730
then anyone will be able to see your public reports story.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.830
But you will choose who can commit.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.530
As for deprived to report,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.640
you're able to choose who can see and commit to this report story.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.880
All right,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.470
that's the life public.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.370
Next,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.450
we can initialize this report with a read me file.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.370
Bye for now.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.870
I'm not going to do that down below,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.030
we are able to add get ignored and some license falls for now.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.430
We don't need any off them.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.440
Let's just click create a repository Now we ended up on another page,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.530
which is already similar to the page,

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.000
which we described recently.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.820
I made the top part off this page.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.800
Also here we have some instructions for creating a new report or adding an existing one.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.110
And regarding this instructions,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.620
let's talk about in the nice.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.030
