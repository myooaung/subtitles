00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
Okay,

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.600
so we made our very first commit on get Hub.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.990
But as remember from the province lecture when we checked the history of our local approach

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.620
story,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.140
newly created commit didn't end up there.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.180
So our local repose story is outdated and we have to pull the data from get up to it.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.750
In order to do that,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.470
we have to run the following command,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.950
get full origin and then master.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.250
Now,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.820
if we check again the history,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.550
then we'll get you the last commit from Kita.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.680
So once you make the commitment,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.130
get help.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.750
Then in order to update your local repository,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.500
you should use the gate full command.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.950
All right.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.120
When you work with get and get home,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.920
you should be frequently using git pool command with specifying the name off the remote.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.580
I'm in origin and the name off the Branch Master in order to avoid indicating those names

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.250
all the time.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.080
Get closest to set kind of shoulder way to pull data from the remote re poster.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.400
So for that,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.830
we have to run the command.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.330
Get branch dash dash,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:27.080
set fish upstream Invest too equal origin slash Master And then again,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.600
master.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.820
So the first master is a branch on our repository on kita up.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.050
I mean this branch right here,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.500
which is created by default once we create the repository on Geeta.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.480
As for the second master,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.210
it is a default branch on the local repository.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.030
So once we run this command and then make a new committee on get up.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.080
By the way,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.520
I'm going to show you how to create a new folder or file on Gator.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
You have to click create new file.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.140
Then if you need a new folder,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.190
you should said its name,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.280
followed by the forward slash and now we have to indicate the name of the file.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.450
Let's a scream.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.300
Doj Yes,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.720
After that,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.310
let's make commit added JavaScript file.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.140
Now,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.380
in order to pull that newly created commit to local repository,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.230
we have to use again get pull,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.770
commend.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.800
But now,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.700
without indicating any of the names like origin or master,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.640
we just need get pool.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.550
And if we check the history,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.210
then we will find here newly created,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.730
commit added Js file.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.770
All right,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.600
sound that sit in this lecture,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.270
we have learned about how to pull the data from get up to the local repository and also I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.320
showed you how to do that in kind of shorter.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.660
Wait
