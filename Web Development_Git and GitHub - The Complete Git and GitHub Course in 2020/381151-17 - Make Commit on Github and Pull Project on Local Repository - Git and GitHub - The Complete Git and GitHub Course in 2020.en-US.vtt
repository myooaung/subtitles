00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
all right,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.180
so in the Progress Lecture will learn about how to connect the local repository to get up

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.110
and also how to push it to get him.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.060
We pushed our existing local or post story.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.370
So here we have our files and folders at the top.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.920
Off those files will have a top commits and considered.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.400
Overall,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.450
we have three commits.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.370
If we click it,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.810
then we will see all three commits,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.390
which we have made so far.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.300
We see here the message of the commit,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.550
then on the right.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.950
Inside there is a proper I.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.760
D of committee,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.860
and also we see the author off the committee and the time when the committee was made.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.230
In our case,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.490
the author off committees trying get it is a different from the name off the user,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.260
which we used in the configuration.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.290
If you remember,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.140
we used some dummy name and the email,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.590
and that's why I get help,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.660
didn't recognize them by developing said this name as the altar off commits.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.170
So it's changing configuration the name and the email and used a valid ones.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.060
At first,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.820
let's check our current name and the email for that.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.660
We have to run git config,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.250
Dash,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.150
Dash Global,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
then use a dot name.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.560
So the name is said is John.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.230
Let's check the email as the email we have john at gmail dot com.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.970
All right,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.990
let's go ahead and change both of them.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.850
I'm going to set name as code and create Web.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.750
As for the email,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.860
let's setting US code and create Web at gmail dot com.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.370
So now,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.100
once we change the name and the email,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.490
it doesn't mean that the author,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.720
off previous commits will be changed accordingly.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.820
If we reload the page that still we will have the previous name,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.500
let's see what happens if we add a new commit,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.150
I'm going to interfere h one heading element with the tax Hi there.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.340
Then let's add this file to the staging area.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:16.110
And now I'm going to make a new commit with the commit message commute from New.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.140
Often after that,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.810
we should push our local repository to give help.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.750
And for that,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.350
as remember,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.570
we have to run the following command get push origin,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.860
which is the name of the remote,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.110
and then master,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.380
which is a name off the branch.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.370
Now if we reload the page,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.890
then who will get a new commit with a new author?

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.010
All right,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.250
now it's time to make and you commit.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.680
But now,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.770
from get up,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.730
I'm going to show you how to added files and how to create a new commit let's open index

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.950
dot html file.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.230
So,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.570
in order to added the style,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.320
we should creek here this icon,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.250
and after that we will be able to make some changes in the next that HTML file.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.460
I'm going to add here a paragraph.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.420
Unfortunately,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.480
we don't have any help from the enter.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.570
We should time everything manually.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.750
So once we added this,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.300
file them down below.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.300
We should make a commit the first impossibilities for the message of the commit.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.060
Let's answer to your added paragraph.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.590
As for the second you put field,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.610
it is for extended description,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.060
and actually it is optional.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.880
Anyway,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.170
let's institute something.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:45.450
Let's say we updated index dot html file from kita,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.010
and now we should click commit changes.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.670
So now we have created a new committee from get up successfully.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.510
As you see,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.080
there is a new commit with commit message at it paragraph.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.000
Also,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.930
if we click those three dots here than the description will be displayed.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.860
Okay,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.010
so we created new Commit from Geeta.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.330
But let's see what happens on the local er post story.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.640
If we try the history using gets,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.420
look dash,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.370
dash one line,

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.040
then we will get only the old commits.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.040
It means that our local repository is out stated,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.350
and it doesn't recognize the newly created commit from get up.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.770
So now it's time to pull the data from geek,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.060
um,

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.000
to the lock of repository.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.880
And for that,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.340
let's move on to the next lecture.
