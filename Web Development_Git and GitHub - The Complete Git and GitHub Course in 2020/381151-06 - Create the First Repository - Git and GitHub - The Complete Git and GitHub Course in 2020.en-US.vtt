X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
all right.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.400
So once we introduced to some basic terminal commands Finally,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.390
it's time to create our very first get repose story for the fall.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.200
It's open git,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.980
bash and navigate to the desktop using city tasked up,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to create a new folder for that,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.060
we need em que de ir.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.610
Let's call this folder.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.750
Get project.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.690
Now,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.970
I want to open this folder with V s code.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
We can either open it manually by right click like so,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.330
or we can use the terminal for that.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.550
We need command code and the name off the folder Get project.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.600
So as a conceit,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.350
our folder is open with BS code.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.370
By the way,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.670
if you are inside the folder and you want to open it with B is code,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.420
then you just need to type code space and dot All right,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.200
let's place editor and terminal side by side in order to make our working process more

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.950
convenient.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:13.350
Next,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.130
I'm going to create a new file.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.930
We can do that from the terminal,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.280
let's and through the folder right city,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:29.200
give project and create a new file using touch at indicate name off the file indexers.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.030
HTM Oh,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.440
Also,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.170
we are able to create a new file from the editor.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.250
We can either click the icon here,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.350
or we can create a new file using right click and then create file.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.770
Let's call this pile style CSS.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.670
All right,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.340
so our project consists of two different files,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.380
but at this point,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.270
it's not a git repository.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.370
As remember from previous lectures,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.780
the first thing that have to do in order to create git repository is get initialization.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.050
For that,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.610
we need to use our very first get command,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.140
get in it.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.880
So,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.640
as you can see,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.920
there is created a new folder with the name DOT skit,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.770
and also our files have changed their color in our editor.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.330
For now,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.150
they are green.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.930
If you don't see don't get folder envious code by default,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.800
then you should fix it from the settings,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.050
so you need to go to settings.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.990
Then you have to click cola braces,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.070
and then Jason file will be opened.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.150
From here,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.650
we can add the following code,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.710
which will allow you to display.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.730
Don't get folded,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.250
so let's go ahead and insert it in your settings file.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.120
If for some reason,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.880
folder still is not displayed.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.220
Then just restart.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.180
Your V is code,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.870
and it should be displayed.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.750
Okay,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.450
if we check our gift project from File Explorer than the newly created get folder will be

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.550
heating by default in order to make it visible,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.810
weaken,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.810
go to view,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.070
and then check hidden items.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.750
So now you can see that the folder is visible.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.360
All right,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.770
let's go back to V s code.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.560
If we drop down the gate folder,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.330
we will find here some other folders and files.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.270
This is the source of gate,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.890
but we're not going to go through them because we're not interested in them.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.350
We just need to learn about how to use skeet and how to work with it.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.670
All right,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.250
we said that after a good initialization,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.950
files have changed their color,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.250
but we didn't say why this happened.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.230
So now our files are untracked.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.570
Basically untracked means that get seized files that we didn't have in the previous

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.080
snapshot.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.100
For now,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.850
we don't have any snapshots because we didn't make commits yet.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.740
The only step that we went through Watts Gate initialization Also,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.180
you can see on the right side off file names,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.350
The letter you which actually means that those falls are untracked.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.210
Besides that,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.880
in order to prove that those falls are in trucked,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.190
we can use another git commands which actually will be used frequently throughout the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.580
course.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.100
And this command is get status.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.950
It gives us some useful information.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.770
It says that we are on the master branch.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.740
We don't have any comets yet and also it says that we have some untracked files index of

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.880
HTML and styled CSS.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.850
You can notice that at this point those thoughts have a red color.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.010
But once we go further,

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.270
they will change their color in some cases.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.840
All right,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.710
that's it about creating the first get repose story.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.280
Before we finish this lecture,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.800
I want to show you one more thing.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.650
We have already used some get commence.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.060
We will be using other get commences well throughout the course.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.480
And if you need to get some more information about get commence,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.000
you can use get help for that.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.750
You need to specify a command that you want to get information about.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:07.930
That's I get in it and then we need dash dash help In case of we knows a new top will be

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.190
opened in the browser.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.550
You can read this article,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.770
and if you're using Mark or Lennox than this,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.070
information will be opened inside the terminal.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.280
All right,

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.730
that's it.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.240
For now,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.790
we have seen how to create get reports story.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.440
We used some give commence,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.580
and now it's time to move on to the next lecture.
