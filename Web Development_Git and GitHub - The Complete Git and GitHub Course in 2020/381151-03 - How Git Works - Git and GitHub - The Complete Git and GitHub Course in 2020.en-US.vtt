00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
all right.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.450
So in the previous lecture,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.080
we had a brief overview about what kit and generally,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.010
what version control system is.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.910
And before we dive deeper into any particular topic regarding get,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.330
I'm going to talk a little about how get actually works in order to use.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.670
Get for your project.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.450
First of all,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.010
you have to initialize it.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.350
Let's say we have a folder called My Website,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.060
in which we store a couple of files index dot html style,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.670
don't CSS and also we have a folder for images.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.480
So after initialization off,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.970
get there will be created a folder named Dots Kit.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.070
Actually,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.010
how to initialize get You will see it in practice in the coming lectures.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.660
For now,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.690
I just want to show you the idea how the process is going and how it works.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.430
So once this folder is created than the entire directory where that folder is placed will

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.970
become a repository.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.540
Sometimes it's called just Repo.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.370
So the report story is a container for a project which you want to track with git.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.660
All right,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.690
so after that,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.380
we were able to track all changes of our project.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.350
It doesn't matter if we changed something inside those two files or inside images folder.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.180
All the changes will be recognized by get,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.350
by the way,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.430
as a quick note,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.730
I want to tell you that if get initialization happened inside Images folder,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.650
then changes outside of that folder would not be tracked because in that case,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.290
the repulse story is going to be images folder and not the entire project.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.460
Okay,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.560
let's consider again the previous example.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.000
Suppose that we added a new file to your project.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.450
Let's say script O.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.110
J S.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.670
And we want to set this version off our project in history.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.280
We can do that using commit,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.390
which actually closer to take a snapshot and said the current state off the project in

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.680
order to make it clearer.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.410
Let's consider some examples using a little diagram.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.550
Let's say this line represents history or sometimes it's called a timeline off the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.190
development of the project.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.420
So imagine that before we take any snapshots or commit something,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.270
we're at the starting point.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.410
After doing some work,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.470
suppose that we want to take a snapshot and save a current state of the project.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.280
For that,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.300
we have to make a commit after that Let's say we added some JavaScript to our project and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.370
made the website dynamic and created another commit.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.260
Now we have already saved two versions of our project that assumed that we added some back

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.010
and functionality to our project and took another snapshot.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.740
So overall,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.000
we created the history off the development of the project and any time in the future we're

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.350
able to go back in time and get an previous state off the project we want.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.650
Now.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.690
I showed just a couple of examples,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.590
but in practice,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.850
in the real world,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.010
you can make as many snap shins as you wish again how to make commits.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.570
You will see it in details.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.710
Incoming videos.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.120
One little thing that I want to mention before we finish this lecture is that this line is

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.450
called the branch.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.020
To be more precise.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.840
It is a master branch.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840
In general,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.130
you're able to work on different branches.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.580
But regarding that,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.030
let's discuss later on.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.470
All right,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.160
see you in the next video in which we're going to set up our kid working environment
