00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.390
so we have already made a couple of commits.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.530
And in the last lecture,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.260
we have learned about how to check the history of commits using Get luck.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140
Commence in this video,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.590
I'm going to show you a little bit different way off,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.460
making commits.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.770
Let's go ahead and create a new element inside an HTML document.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.970
Let's create a paragraph with some dummy Laura Me Ipsum text.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.350
Let's save it and check the current status.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.140
Rank its status.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.890
So we have modified the index dot html file.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.970
Let's go ahead and add it to the staging area.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.260
Right,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.450
Get at and the file name index of HTML.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.640
Let's check again status So the file is ready to be committed.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.520
And now I'm going to show you how we can do that in kind of different weight.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.890
We can run,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.100
just get commit.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.920
And once we press enter,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.030
then the new file will be opened in our text editor.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.370
So this file is opened envious code because we have chosen it as a default tax editor when

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.030
we have bean installing git.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.750
This file is called commit added message.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.210
Inside that file there a couple of comments and now here we can insert a message off the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.580
committee.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.040
So basically,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.050
we're doing the same thing as we do in case off Desh and Flak.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.630
But in this case,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.250
we use a text editor instead off the terminal.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.590
Besides that,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.450
you can notice in terminal a little hint saying waiting for your editor to close the file.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.350
So once we insert here the message,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.930
let's say added paragraph,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.450
then save and close the file.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.420
Then the committee will be automatically made.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.200
What you see,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.770
actually here in the terminal.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.050
If we check the history using get log de stash one line,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.320
then we will find that the new committee is added.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.020
All right,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.950
now I'm going to show you what happens if these code is not set as a default text editor.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.740
In order to unset it,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.130
we have two different ways.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.950
First,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.700
we can open a file called dot Get,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.350
come pick in our text Editor.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.150
This is a file which stores some configuration stuff.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.410
I'm going to open it and show you.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.280
Actually,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.370
you don't have to do that.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.030
You can just watch this part.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.930
So,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.350
in order to open the dot git config file,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.350
we have to run the following command.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.220
First,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.490
we have to indicate the name off the actor.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.810
In our case,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.090
it's code and then it should be followed by the name of the file.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.410
Before that,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.430
we have to type here till the sign it allows us to navigate to the folder off the user.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.570
Then we need slash and the name off the foul dot git config.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.620
All right,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.870
So,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.370
as you see,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.220
the foul is open Envious coat.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.000
At first,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.450
I'm going to mention that the location off this pile is not our project folder.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.800
It is placed inside the folder off the user because it is a global fall and it has access

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.450
on every get reports story.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.260
That's why we use Dash dash global flag with the get convict command.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.490
Okay,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.160
so we have here some stuff and down below,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.950
You see that the editor is set as coat and also we have a name and the email off the user,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.640
which actually we added during the configuration were I able to unset before editor from

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.920
here.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.050
And for that we just need to get rid off those two lines.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.510
But instead of deleting them manually,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.270
I'm going to use an easier and more professional way we can around the following command

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.860
gets config Dash dash,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.590
global dash,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.650
dash onset.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.780
And now we have to specify that we want to unset co editor.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.870
So once we press enter,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.860
then you will see that the two lines are automatically deleted from git config file.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.120
Now let's make a new commit for that.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.020
I'm going to modify one of the files.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.900
That's a script Js.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.300
Let's create a variable incited right cost a equals two 15.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.850
Actually,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.700
I'm making little changes just for demonstration.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.150
I'm not going to waste time on coding,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.220
but in general,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.460
in the real world,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.950
making commits on such little changes is not recommended.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.850
Okay,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.670
let's check the status So you see a script Js file is modified and now we have to add it to

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.820
the staging area.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.840
So let's run,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.550
Get at script out Js.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:06.980
Let's check again stages so the file is added on.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.550
It is ready to meet committed,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.430
so let's go ahead and run,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.390
get commit.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.130
Once we press enter,

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.940
then we will get a new screen in our terminal.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.170
Actually,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.180
this is a default get editor,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.180
which is called him here we have some commence and were able to insert your message for the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.470
committee for that.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.100
At first we have to click I,

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.250
which stands for insert,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.950
and then we will be able to type the text.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.450
Let's say created variable.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:45.540
So once we insert the message that in order to close this editor and go back to our

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.630
terminal screen,

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.430
we have to press escape,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.080
then shift column and in order to say the text,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.680
we have to type W.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.240
And finally,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.190
in order to quit,

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.610
we have to press cute.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.410
If we don't want to save,

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.190
then we can just type Q.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.800
And the editor will be close.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.330
So,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.760
as you see,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.590
we're back to our working screen and also commit is made in order to check that.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.350
Let's run,

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.540
get log,

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.010
dash,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:24.770
dash one line so you can see that the comet is made with a relevant message.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.960
All right,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.660
so that's it.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.810
What I wanted to show regarding making commits before I finish this lecture,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.560
I want to set back visual studio code as the default tax enter For that,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.130
we have to run the command git config,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.260
Dash Dash Global,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:50.370
then court DOT Editor then inside quotes.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.260
We have to write coat and we have to adhere the flag dash,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.590
dash,

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.150
Wait,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.220
because it will l o get to wait until the message is created and file is closed.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.320
All right,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.330
so after that,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.510
the U.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.620
S.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.880
Code will work at the default text editor.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.950
Let's take a little break here and move on to the next lecture.
