00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
All right,

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.780
So we have successfully installed get in the previous lecture,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.680
and now we're ready to create our first repository.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.380
But actually,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.240
before I do that,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.770
I decided to make a video regarding some basic terminal commence which actually are not

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.590
related specifically to get.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.070
So in this video,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.340
I'm going to show you how to navigate to different directories,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.070
how to create folders,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.830
files,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.030
how to remove them,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.890
and so on.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.490
If you already have some experience in working with the terminal them you can feel free and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.450
skip this video.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.730
All right,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.270
let's go ahead and open git bash by default.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.650
Our current directory is the folder off the user.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.290
In order to check it,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.660
we can use the command P W.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.070
D.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.570
So as you can see,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.270
it shows the current directory.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.760
Now I'm going to show you how to never guy two different folders for that we have to use

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.410
the command CD.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.890
Suppose that we want to get on desktop for that.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.880
We have to type here desktop.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.720
So now we are on desktop,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.220
and here we can create a new folder.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.890
For that,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.870
we have to use the command and k d.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.550
I R,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.470
and then we have to specify the name off the folder.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.570
Let's say my folder so is conceived.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.910
The folder is created on the desktop.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.760
Let's navigate to the folder,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.380
right city and the name of the folder.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.140
Actually,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.500
when you're using git Bash,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.790
you don't have to write the entire folder name.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.460
You can just type some starting characters,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.150
and if you press top,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.050
then it will automatically completely name off the folder.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.060
All right,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.810
in order to go up one directory.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.150
I mean,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.880
if you want to go back on desktop,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.350
you need to use again City than space and double dot.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.660
So now we are on the desktop again.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.950
We can go up two or more directories at the same time for that unit city,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.150
Then double dots slash and then again,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.170
double dots.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.600
So now we ended up in the user's folder.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.190
All right,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.950
let's go back into our folder for that.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.150
Let's type year passed off the folder.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.380
Now it's time to show you how to create files for that unity.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.850
Use a command called touch,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.060
and then we need to specify the name off the file.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.010
In this case,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.870
I'm going to create index dot html.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.280
So if we check out the folder,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.570
then you will find that we have here new HTML file.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.350
Actually,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.060
you can check out Director using the command ls which will show you all the including falls

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.950
off the directory.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.780
All right.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.270
Next,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.410
I'm going to show you how to rename the file.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.970
For that.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.860
We use the command M V.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.350
First of all,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.070
unity indicate here the older name off the file,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.180
which in our case,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.590
is index dot html and then we have to specify new name off file.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.350
Let's say about us that html.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.720
So if we check out directory using ls,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.970
then you will see that they filed has a new name.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.970
Okay,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.230
next thing that I want to show you is how we can copy the file.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.880
For that.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.480
I'm going to create a new folder inside my folder.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.300
For that,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.450
we need em que de ir.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.750
Let's call the folder new folder than inside it.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.800
I'm going to create a new file for that.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.750
We can either enter a new folder or weaken do that outside from the folder.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.080
In order to do that,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.940
we have to write touch the van,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.120
the name off the folder.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.380
New folder,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.680
slash and name off file would say style don't CSS.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.050
So if we check new folder using ls new folder,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.700
then we will find a newly created file.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.410
All right,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.050
Now,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.850
let's see how we can copy the file.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.450
For that,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.320
we have to use a command called CP.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.320
But before that,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.670
let's enter the folder,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.630
right CD,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.570
new folder,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.280
and then used the command CP.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.150
Then we have to indicate the name off the file style,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.080
don't CSS.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.160
And also,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.800
we have to specify where we want to cover the file in this case,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.220
Supposed that we want to copy it from new folder and pasted outside off the folder.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.730
So we need to type here double dots.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.760
Let's check the directory off my folder.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.350
Right city double adults.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.240
And then l s So you see that the file is copied.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.980
And if we checked the new folder,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.840
right?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.140
Ls new folder.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.480
Then you will find that the CSS file still exists inside new folder.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.650
All right.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.700
The last thing that I want to show you is how we can do let the folders and files in order

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.600
to delete the file.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.370
We have to use the command are,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.650
um And then we have to specify the name off the file style.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.540
Don't CSS.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.850
Let's check the directory.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.070
You can see that the file is deleted.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.770
As for the folders,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.370
in order to delete a folder,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:45.770
we need to use the command R M dash R f and then the name of the folder new folder.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.750
So if we check,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.190
then you will see that folder no longer exists.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.610
Let's dilate my folder as well.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.180
Go up.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.100
One directory,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.970
right CD,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.330
double dots and then run.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.930
Commend our M dash r f my folder.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.930
All right,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.480
that's it.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.730
What I wanted to show you.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.660
Those are the basic commence,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.630
which you need to know throughout this course,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.790
you will see some more Other commence as well once we proceed the course.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.560
But for now,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.850
I think it's quite enough.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:21.720
Okay,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.850
Before we move on,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.490
I want to show you one more thing.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.410
If you want to clearly window off the terminal,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.780
you can run the command clear,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.360
or you can use control health.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.450
All right,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.030
that's it.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.450
See you in the next video.
