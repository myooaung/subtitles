00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:02.420
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:02.760  -->  00:00:07.940
So this topic this section that we're going to talk about is one of my favorite things to teach.

3

00:00:08.040  -->  00:00:09.860
It's really really fun for me.

4

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:17.040
And I know I say that a few times in this course but this is by far the actual favorite topic of mine

5

00:00:18.120  -->  00:00:20.620
and it's really exciting to learn in my opinion.

6

00:00:20.640  -->  00:00:22.280
We're going to talk about A.P. guys.

7

00:00:22.530  -->  00:00:27.180
And the reason that it's exciting to learn is that it really opens up the possibilities for what you

8

00:00:27.180  -->  00:00:28.260
can build.

9

00:00:28.260  -->  00:00:34.950
You can make all sorts of amazing applications that use data from other applications or that rely on

10

00:00:34.950  -->  00:00:36.250
other applications.

11

00:00:36.360  -->  00:00:42.000
Basically you know you can stand on the shoulders of giants and and make some really awesome things

12

00:00:42.000  -->  00:00:45.910
for that having to do a ton of work and do everything yourself from scratch.

13

00:00:46.440  -->  00:00:49.380
So the subtitle is connecting with other apps.

14

00:00:49.800  -->  00:00:55.650
And that's really the gist of all of this is what if we want to display a map or I want to get latitude

15

00:00:55.650  -->  00:00:58.790
longitude data or I want to get weather data.

16

00:00:59.010  -->  00:01:04.020
You don't need to go put out weather sensors and connect them to the Internet and then get that data

17

00:01:04.020  -->  00:01:04.470
.

18

00:01:04.650  -->  00:01:10.110
Someone else has done that and made it all nice and easy for you to understand and interact with and

19

00:01:10.110  -->  00:01:12.950
then you just write code that uses that API.

20

00:01:13.470  -->  00:01:18.660
So without getting too far ahead of ourselves API stands for application programming interface although

21

00:01:18.930  -->  00:01:22.020
it's actually application program interface.

22

00:01:22.080  -->  00:01:24.150
Some people say programming it doesn't matter.

23

00:01:24.150  -->  00:01:29.940
But the idea is that it's an interface for programmers for code or computers to talk to one another

24

00:01:29.950  -->  00:01:30.290
.

25

00:01:30.690  -->  00:01:33.800
So I can write code like this code it's very small.

26

00:01:33.810  -->  00:01:37.730
But this code right here is interacting with Facebook.

27

00:01:37.770  -->  00:01:41.970
So Facebook has an API that allows me to get data from Facebook.

28

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:47.760
So we have it you know human interface when I go on Facebook myself and hopefully don't spend too much

29

00:01:47.760  -->  00:01:54.270
time there but when I do that I'm looking at the human interface the HTML usually that I see it's rendered

30

00:01:54.270  -->  00:01:59.810
to me nice wig out photos and colors and text and fonts and all that stuff.

31

00:02:00.000  -->  00:02:05.940
When I want to make an app though that uses Facebook data so popular example would be something like

32

00:02:05.940  -->  00:02:10.860
Tinder if you're not familiar with Tinder you're probably lying.

33

00:02:10.860  -->  00:02:18.090
But if you're actually not familiar with Tinder Dating ish application that you go on sign up with your

34

00:02:18.090  -->  00:02:24.000
Facebook account and it shows you people's photos you can kind of say yes or no swipe left or right

35

00:02:24.010  -->  00:02:24.090
.

36

00:02:24.180  -->  00:02:30.780
But most importantly to what I'm talking about here is that it shows you if you have any likes in common

37

00:02:30.780  -->  00:02:31.050
with them.

38

00:02:31.050  -->  00:02:37.770
So if you have any favorite movies that you've added to to both of your Facebook profiles or books or

39

00:02:38.910  -->  00:02:43.980
music as well and a few other things and it also will tell you how many friends you have in common based

40

00:02:43.980  -->  00:02:45.030
off of Facebook.

41

00:02:45.240  -->  00:02:51.030
So that data is not just coming from the regular Facebook website like if I went on Facebook I could

42

00:02:51.030  -->  00:02:57.060
find that out if I matched someone I could go on their Facebook page if it's public at least and I could

43

00:02:57.240  -->  00:02:58.610
manually compare.

44

00:02:58.740  -->  00:03:00.370
Do we like the same movies.

45

00:03:00.600  -->  00:03:04.810
But of course that's not happening behind the scenes intender source code.

46

00:03:05.000  -->  00:03:10.330
There's code that's connecting to Facebook's API and saying Hey these two people.

47

00:03:10.740  -->  00:03:17.250
Well it's probably more like hey this person Nicole has matched with let's get their data and save it

48

00:03:17.250  -->  00:03:21.360
to our database and then let's take cold's data that we already have in our database and compare them

49

00:03:21.370  -->  00:03:21.470
.

50

00:03:21.570  -->  00:03:27.820
But the idea is we're talking or tender is talking to Facebook and that's one example.

51

00:03:27.930  -->  00:03:30.670
But API eyes are literally everywhere nowadays.

52

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:33.500
Pretty much every application you use.

53

00:03:34.440  -->  00:03:42.840
So the term API is actually a broader term that refers to any type of code any interface that is made

54

00:03:42.840  -->  00:03:44.940
for other code to communicate with.

55

00:03:44.940  -->  00:03:52.500
So if we go on Wikipedia actually the definition the textbook definition I guess is in computer programming

56

00:03:52.500  -->  00:03:54.460
an application programming interface.

57

00:03:54.480  -->  00:03:55.680
So they use programming.

58

00:03:55.710  -->  00:04:00.590
That program is a set of routines protocols and tools for building software and applications.

59

00:04:00.600  -->  00:04:09.210
So that's very broad and that is basically saying it's any set of tools code routines that you can use

60

00:04:09.270  -->  00:04:10.550
in an application.

61

00:04:10.770  -->  00:04:14.540
So it could be a database API.

62

00:04:14.550  -->  00:04:16.510
So that has nothing to do with the Internet.

63

00:04:16.590  -->  00:04:19.920
It's just how you connect to a database locally on your computer.

64

00:04:19.920  -->  00:04:24.620
It could be a video card API or a hard drive a hard disk drive API.

65

00:04:24.870  -->  00:04:31.320
So those are kind of other non web based examples or when I was learning Java in high school I used

66

00:04:31.320  -->  00:04:39.600
an API to to incorporate the graphical elements buttons and windows and stuff into my applications.

67

00:04:39.720  -->  00:04:45.670
Really ugly Mario clone that I made and like solitaire I used an API for that.

68

00:04:45.720  -->  00:04:48.510
So that is a different kind of context.

69

00:04:48.570  -->  00:04:54.570
Typically what people mean when they refer to an API today is a web API which has its own section here

70

00:04:55.170  -->  00:04:57.630
but that is a subset of API in general.

71

00:04:57.630  -->  00:05:05.460
So API is in general any code whether it's a library a package or module a web API some sort of interface

72

00:05:05.460  -->  00:05:10.670
to work with image analysis on a computer or a database.

73

00:05:10.890  -->  00:05:14.220
They're all over the place so many different things that they do.

74

00:05:14.280  -->  00:05:19.450
You can use them in your own code web API is are more specialized.

75

00:05:19.510  -->  00:05:25.930
They have to do with web interfaces to other code or to other applications.

76

00:05:26.170  -->  00:05:33.100
So for instance the Facebook API we talked about the way that an application gets that data is through

77

00:05:33.220  -->  00:05:34.690
the Web through the Internet.

78

00:05:34.750  -->  00:05:37.440
I am requesting that data from Facebook.

79

00:05:37.660  -->  00:05:45.400
So just like when I request a web page lets say Reddit dot com slash slash Ah wench's cute photos or

80

00:05:45.460  -->  00:05:52.140
cute images of dogs and cats usually with the occasional reptile lover slash weirdo.

81

00:05:52.330  -->  00:05:54.070
No offense to anyone who has reptiles.

82

00:05:54.070  -->  00:05:56.640
I just can't can't get behind that.

83

00:05:56.710  -->  00:06:02.620
So when I request this hit enter and I'm seeing the human version the interface for me and for all of

84

00:06:02.620  -->  00:06:03.280
us.

85

00:06:03.580  -->  00:06:06.880
But there's also an interface for code to interact with.

86

00:06:06.880  -->  00:06:13.940
There's a web API where we request it and rather than seeing this our computer sees this.

87

00:06:14.080  -->  00:06:18.700
So I'll talk about what this is something called Jaison and just one video from now.

88

00:06:18.850  -->  00:06:24.550
But it's basically another format of data that is better and easier for computers to use.

89

00:06:24.550  -->  00:06:31.060
It doesn't have any of the fluff that we have here because if I'm writing an app let's say want to pit

90

00:06:31.060  -->  00:06:36.580
dogs versus cats and I want to count the number of posts every day that mentioned dogs.

91

00:06:36.590  -->  00:06:40.660
The number of posts every day that mentioned cats and have a chart so you can visit my web site and

92

00:06:40.660  -->  00:06:45.450
there's a live chart that's updating what I would need to do is get that from Reddit.

93

00:06:45.450  -->  00:06:51.850
I would need to ask Reddit you know give me the data today or every hour that update it give me the

94

00:06:51.850  -->  00:06:53.710
current front page of our site.

95

00:06:53.730  -->  00:06:54.170
Ah.

96

00:06:54.340  -->  00:06:56.060
And then I would go through the data.

97

00:06:56.200  -->  00:07:02.710
This data here and calculate you know search for dog search for cat and tally it up and update my graph

98

00:07:02.710  -->  00:07:03.640
every hour.

99

00:07:03.670  -->  00:07:05.860
So that's a simple example.

100

00:07:05.920  -->  00:07:09.160
You can do much more complex things of course.

101

00:07:09.160  -->  00:07:12.210
So here are some other examples of API is Twitter.

102

00:07:12.340  -->  00:07:18.680
You can do things like give me all the tweets that mention ice cream or you know unlike CNN they are

103

00:07:18.940  -->  00:07:24.010
always like live tweets coming in that mentions certain hashtags or certain news events.

104

00:07:24.130  -->  00:07:32.020
Facebook as we talked about so many things you can get from Facebook's API profile pictures likes and

105

00:07:32.080  -->  00:07:38.290
you probably see it all the time in applications where you see that kind of warning or question that

106

00:07:38.290  -->  00:07:43.200
pops up from Facebook it's like this application wants to use your data.

107

00:07:43.290  -->  00:07:45.130
Do you accept it or not or do you.

108

00:07:45.130  -->  00:07:45.880
Permitted or not.

109

00:07:45.880  -->  00:07:47.170
And you can kind of change things.

110

00:07:47.170  -->  00:07:51.920
Who can see what and what data it can access whether API.

111

00:07:51.920  -->  00:07:55.970
So there's lots of weather API is out there that do different things.

112

00:07:56.120  -->  00:08:02.820
Reddit API can we just saw very briefly Google Places what gas stations are near someone.

113

00:08:02.950  -->  00:08:06.000
Google Maps of course to get a map going.

114

00:08:06.100  -->  00:08:11.940
The Yelp API can do things like give me 10 restaurants in the zip code nine for one one.

115

00:08:13.150  -->  00:08:14.500
Lots and lots things you can do.

116

00:08:14.500  -->  00:08:21.220
And then of course by combining them together you can do even cooler things which is actually this site

117

00:08:21.700  -->  00:08:28.100
I teach dot com if this then that is a way to connect API.

118

00:08:28.690  -->  00:08:31.660
So there are 309 services.

119

00:08:31.930  -->  00:08:39.160
And basically this is kind of confusing I guess but it's a way to have a visual interface to connect

120

00:08:39.160  -->  00:08:40.930
API to do things for you.

121

00:08:41.320  -->  00:08:47.440
So I picked up photography on the side and there's so many photography sites if you want to do the whole

122

00:08:47.440  -->  00:08:57.400
social media thing and there's flicker and Instagram Facebook 500 pixels Dropbox and I want and iCloud

123

00:08:57.400  -->  00:09:02.380
and let's say I want all of those and any time I post a photo to Instagram I want it to post to all

124

00:09:02.380  -->  00:09:03.930
of those other places.

125

00:09:04.030  -->  00:09:07.240
You can do that using if this then that.

126

00:09:07.240  -->  00:09:09.760
So these are all the services that they allow.

127

00:09:09.760  -->  00:09:14.170
They worked with so Facebook's API Twitter's API get hubs.

128

00:09:14.350  -->  00:09:17.020
There are some I think there is something called the Internet of Things.

129

00:09:17.050  -->  00:09:24.010
So API is that will exist for physical objects like a thermostat where you can control the temperature

130

00:09:24.010  -->  00:09:32.320
through an API or a video camera security camera where you can use code to turn it on and off or rotate

131

00:09:32.320  -->  00:09:37.740
it or a light bulb that you can change the hue the color of dynamically using code.

132

00:09:37.750  -->  00:09:44.290
So you know in college I had friends who would take light bulbs that were smart electronic ones connected

133

00:09:44.290  -->  00:09:49.960
to the Internet plug them into their dorm and then it would automatically take whatever music was playing

134

00:09:49.960  -->  00:09:50.110
.

135

00:09:50.110  -->  00:09:54.310
They wrote some code that would then kind of turn the lights on and off and change the color to make

136

00:09:54.310  -->  00:09:58.440
a little visualizer for the music.

137

00:09:58.570  -->  00:10:00.740
So there's tons of things on here.

138

00:10:00.790  -->  00:10:03.210
This is just a side thing that's cool for you to check out.

139

00:10:03.220  -->  00:10:08.470
If this than that if you're not familiar with it you can look at browse recipes.

140

00:10:08.470  -->  00:10:13.930
So these are some of the popular things people will do like.

141

00:10:14.110  -->  00:10:20.410
Remind yourself to put on sunscreen when the heat index is high so it will automatically connect to

142

00:10:20.410  -->  00:10:26.060
an API that figures out what the U.V. index is and then it will write some code.

143

00:10:26.200  -->  00:10:27.000
You know whatever.

144

00:10:27.010  -->  00:10:31.750
I don't know what the Ubi index how that works what the scale is but whenever it reaches a certain number

145

00:10:32.110  -->  00:10:40.510
then it will send you an alert receive notification to turn off I find save battery power when you leave

146

00:10:40.510  -->  00:10:43.920
a specific location so you can do all sorts things connect.

147

00:10:43.930  -->  00:10:46.600
You know if this can do that.

148

00:10:46.660  -->  00:10:46.960
All right.

149

00:10:46.960  -->  00:10:48.680
So that all relies on API.

150

00:10:48.880  -->  00:10:55.620
And they support 300 plus AP guys but there are way more API is out there and a great place to see that

151

00:10:56.320  -->  00:11:02.770
is a tool or a site called programmable web and it's a API directory is how they build themselves.

152

00:11:02.770  -->  00:11:05.350
They have 15000 API.

153

00:11:05.530  -->  00:11:06.810
There are more out there.

154

00:11:06.820  -->  00:11:08.360
This is a great place to start.

155

00:11:08.590  -->  00:11:18.220
So if I know I want to use transportation data lets say I want to make an app that will tell you when

156

00:11:18.220  -->  00:11:25.540
the next train is in San Francisco using your current location or will tell you with the latest train

157

00:11:25.540  -->  00:11:29.890
you can take to still make it to work before your first meeting is something like that I would need

158

00:11:29.890  -->  00:11:35.950
an API to figure out when the trains are so I could cook click on transportation here I could do a search

159

00:11:36.250  -->  00:11:45.010
and there's all these different API cers at Yahoo traffic there's a bus Lufthansa for airlines or Indian

160

00:11:45.010  -->  00:11:46.000
Railways.

161

00:11:46.060  -->  00:11:49.940
So this is kind of all over the place you could narrow it down of course.

162

00:11:50.360  -->  00:11:57.280
Or you could look for weather if needed weather data and there's all these API eyes you can click on

163

00:11:57.280  -->  00:12:00.700
one like let's go.

164

00:12:00.830  -->  00:12:07.760
That was interesting climbing weather provides weather data for climbing sites and then I can see you

165

00:12:07.830  -->  00:12:10.120
Oreille for their home page.

166

00:12:10.150  -->  00:12:12.580
Sometimes for sample code.

167

00:12:12.580  -->  00:12:14.650
Not always.

168

00:12:14.650  -->  00:12:16.130
In this case there isn't.

169

00:12:16.160  -->  00:12:23.560
I can see the sites they support the climbing sites and then I can also see an endpoint that will show

170

00:12:23.560  -->  00:12:24.210
you.

171

00:12:24.310  -->  00:12:29.550
Basically this is the site where you can go learn about how the API works.

172

00:12:29.560  -->  00:12:34.420
So we're going to see this in just a moment with the API as we incorporate but this will tell you the

173

00:12:34.420  -->  00:12:39.400
documentation what the data looks like that you'll get back where you're supposed to make a request

174

00:12:39.400  -->  00:12:42.010
to to find certain data.

175

00:12:42.280  -->  00:12:44.040
So that's all I want to show though.

176

00:12:44.180  -->  00:12:49.600
Mainly programmable Web site directory for lots of API is some amazing things on here.

177

00:12:49.840  -->  00:12:58.480
Some sort of obscure things API is to detect nudity and images and then more common things like you

178

00:12:58.480  -->  00:13:07.010
know restaurants and bars and location guides National Park data linked in data maps Facebook you know

179

00:13:07.240  -->  00:13:09.140
lots and lots of things on here.

180

00:13:09.310  -->  00:13:10.830
So great resource.

181

00:13:10.930  -->  00:13:13.500
Also fun just to browse some things they have on here.

182

00:13:13.510  -->  00:13:17.360
If you ever you know a lot of times I would give students a project.

183

00:13:17.710  -->  00:13:22.060
And some people would know immediately they want to use a certain API and then some people weren't inspired

184

00:13:22.060  -->  00:13:23.090
and they needed help.

185

00:13:23.140  -->  00:13:28.280
They wanted inspiration and they just go browse until they find an API that excites them.

186

00:13:28.570  -->  00:13:30.250
Often on programs what Web.

187

00:13:30.640  -->  00:13:30.980
OK.

188

00:13:31.000  -->  00:13:38.000
So one last thing here that I just think is cool is that Tesla Tesla cars and motor cars the electric

189

00:13:37.990  -->  00:13:40.630
car maker has an API.

190

00:13:40.630  -->  00:13:45.850
I think it's unofficial that they don't support it because essentially But there's an API that you can

191

00:13:45.860  -->  00:13:53.620
use to interact with their cars so you can view the documentation here of things you can do.

192

00:13:53.620  -->  00:13:59.960
You can query a car for how charged it is what percentage of the battery is charged how much.

193

00:13:59.980  -->  00:14:01.520
Estimated range.

194

00:14:01.720  -->  00:14:03.420
And this is what you get back.

195

00:14:03.460  -->  00:14:09.820
So when you make a request to this you are l and you have to put in your vehicle ID and I don't have

196

00:14:09.820  -->  00:14:11.090
a test I won't do that.

197

00:14:11.200  -->  00:14:16.510
But if you did you could put it in there and plug it in the red and it would give you this information

198

00:14:16.540  -->  00:14:16.940
.

199

00:14:17.140  -->  00:14:22.750
But you can also do things like ask for the current climate settings temperature inside temperature

200

00:14:22.750  -->  00:14:30.180
outside and then you can do really fun things like wake the car up or open the charging port on the

201

00:14:30.190  -->  00:14:31.600
side.

202

00:14:31.810  -->  00:14:38.900
Start the charging stop charging flash the lights honk the horn so you can write code that will and

203

00:14:38.940  -->  00:14:43.960
there's videos of people who do this they'll have when their alarm goes off in the morning.

204

00:14:43.960  -->  00:14:49.350
Code will automatically check the weather outside and then appropriately set the Tesla.

205

00:14:49.410  -->  00:14:54.460
Well turn the Tesla on first set it to temperature inside to an appropriate temperature depending on

206

00:14:54.520  -->  00:15:00.600
how hot or cold just outside then it will honk the horn and start some music that will you know wakeup

207

00:15:00.620  -->  00:15:01.650
music or something.

208

00:15:01.750  -->  00:15:06.100
And there's videos of this online and you can do that because of the API.

209

00:15:06.350  -->  00:15:12.010
So that's an example of you know the Internet of Things where there is a physical object a thing that

210

00:15:12.010  -->  00:15:14.590
is being controlled through an API.

211

00:15:15.220  -->  00:15:16.020
OK.

212

00:15:16.480  -->  00:15:18.030
So we covered a lot there.

213

00:15:18.220  -->  00:15:26.560
Some of API application programming interface ways for you to write code that interacts with other code

214

00:15:26.650  -->  00:15:28.270
other pieces of data.

215

00:15:28.270  -->  00:15:35.260
Application services typically web API is what most people refer to which our API set are structured

216

00:15:35.260  -->  00:15:41.890
in a way that you interact with them through the web usually through HTP requests.
