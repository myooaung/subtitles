00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:05,790
Either Welcome to the Web Developer boot camp I want to take a moment just early on in this course to

2

00:00:05,790  -->  00:00:09,180
talk about what makes this program so special.

3

00:00:09,180  -->  00:00:12,620
Why is it the only course you'll ever need to learn web development.

4

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:14,470
And I feel really strongly about that.

5

00:00:14,580  -->  00:00:18,920
This course is everything you need from start to finish regardless of your experience.

6

00:00:18,930  -->  00:00:20,460
There's something here for everyone.

7

00:00:20,520  -->  00:00:25,410
I'll take you from the very beginning up to complex and advanced topics.

8

00:00:25,410  -->  00:00:31,080
So this is the only course online right now that's taught by a professional bootcamp instructor.

9

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:33,150
I teach people to program professionally.

10

00:00:33,270  -->  00:00:34,200
It's what I do.

11

00:00:34,200  -->  00:00:38,910
I take people from all skill levels all backgrounds and I help them change your lives and become web

12

00:00:38,910  -->  00:00:39,800
developers.

13

00:00:39,870  -->  00:00:42,740
And I've been doing that a few years now at two different programs.

14

00:00:43,050  -->  00:00:48,300
But the reason that I bring this up is that I'm not someone who thought it would be fun to try teaching

15

00:00:48,300  -->  00:00:49,700
on the side online.

16

00:00:49,710  -->  00:00:53,060
This is something that I do everyday and I'm extremely passionate about.

17

00:00:53,340  -->  00:00:58,120
And more importantly than my passion for it is the fact that I get results.

18

00:00:58,210  -->  00:01:05,400
So most recently 94 percent of all my students my most recent bootcamp program go on to get web developer

19

00:01:05,400  -->  00:01:07,950
jobs after they graduate my course.

20

00:01:07,950  -->  00:01:12,650
This isn't a program where we require you to have a computer science degree to even apply.

21

00:01:12,660  -->  00:01:16,980
These are people from every background every situation you can think of people who are fresh out of

22

00:01:16,980  -->  00:01:24,420
high school who are declining to go to college and instead taking my class nurses retirees single parents

23

00:01:24,480  -->  00:01:26,980
going back to work who want to learn a new skill.

24

00:01:27,030  -->  00:01:33,550
Bank tellers waitresses artists actors people from all over the world and all different levels of education

25

00:01:33,560  -->  00:01:33,790
.

26

00:01:34,200  -->  00:01:38,060
And these are not people who are experts in web development to begin with.

27

00:01:38,070  -->  00:01:40,590
Most of my students are complete beginners.

28

00:01:40,590  -->  00:01:44,230
They've read a blog post they've tried to teach themselves a little bit.

29

00:01:44,370  -->  00:01:49,500
Maybe they try an online program like code cademy or something and they enjoy it but they don't go any

30

00:01:49,500  -->  00:01:50,340
further.

31

00:01:50,340  -->  00:01:55,590
And after finishing my course 94 percent of them go on to get full time developer jobs.

32

00:01:55,830  -->  00:02:01,590
So I feel very strongly that bootcamps are a great option for some people but unfortunately they're

33

00:02:01,590  -->  00:02:02,670
not for everyone.

34

00:02:02,670  -->  00:02:03,930
For a few reasons.

35

00:02:04,020  -->  00:02:07,440
One the most obvious is the fact that they cost a lot of money.

36

00:02:07,440  -->  00:02:13,230
My most recent course cost $21000 to enroll and it's a lot of money and most people can't afford that

37

00:02:13,230  -->  00:02:13,470
.

38

00:02:13,470  -->  00:02:18,450
And on top of that most people can't afford the time to take three or six months off where you can't

39

00:02:18,450  -->  00:02:19,250
work.

40

00:02:19,350  -->  00:02:23,080
You have to figure out rent and food and taking care of your family if you need to.

41

00:02:23,100  -->  00:02:24,800
It's really hard to do that.

42

00:02:24,810  -->  00:02:26,010
So in creating this course.

43

00:02:26,160  -->  00:02:30,800
My goal was to make an online equivalent of these in person bootcamps.

44

00:02:30,810  -->  00:02:35,560
Not only is the course much more affordable but it also is much more flexible.

45

00:02:35,580  -->  00:02:39,130
Some people might only be able to put in an hour to a weekend.

46

00:02:39,330  -->  00:02:43,020
Other people might blow through it every day all day.

47

00:02:43,020  -->  00:02:45,140
Not doing anything else except taking the course.

48

00:02:45,150  -->  00:02:49,650
But the goal is that it's for everyone out there and it's not just that it's more flexible and more

49

00:02:49,650  -->  00:02:50,380
affordable.

50

00:02:50,610  -->  00:02:54,330
But I really spent a lot of time redesigning everything from scratch.

51

00:02:54,330  -->  00:02:59,520
So brand new curriculum stuff this is stuff I've been teaching for years and I redesigned every lesson

52

00:02:59,550  -->  00:03:05,100
every lecture every assignment came up with brand new ideas and brand new ways of teaching these topics

53

00:03:05,310  -->  00:03:07,770
which is the kind of work that I really enjoy doing.

54

00:03:08,070  -->  00:03:11,680
So I haven't the video where I talk about all the technologies we teach.

55

00:03:11,700  -->  00:03:14,010
There's so many different tools and topics that we cover.

56

00:03:14,010  -->  00:03:15,730
It really requires its own video.

57

00:03:15,990  -->  00:03:20,730
But the main point I want to make here is that everything that I teach in this course is up to date

58

00:03:20,730  -->  00:03:21,130
.

59

00:03:21,240  -->  00:03:22,110
It's relevant.

60

00:03:22,140  -->  00:03:23,700
It's used in industry.

61

00:03:23,760  -->  00:03:24,830
It's not dying.

62

00:03:24,840  -->  00:03:25,960
It's not in decline.

63

00:03:26,010  -->  00:03:29,310
But these are things that are very popular and very exciting.

64

00:03:29,320  -->  00:03:34,110
There's things that people want to learn right now and there are the same technologies that a lot of

65

00:03:34,110  -->  00:03:35,980
the boot camp programs are teaching.

66

00:03:36,360  -->  00:03:43,050
So I have no ph on here as a note and I wrote that there because I've noticed that so many online courses

67

00:03:43,050  -->  00:03:48,150
right now teach Ph.D. and if you don't know what PH is all you need to know is that it's a language

68

00:03:48,440  -->  00:03:51,210
a back end language that used to be very popular.

69

00:03:51,360  -->  00:03:55,190
And the fact is it still is relatively popular but it's in decline.

70

00:03:55,350  -->  00:03:57,800
It's not something that grows year to year anymore.

71

00:03:57,810  -->  00:04:02,490
It's not something that industry and startups and big tech companies are really looking for at this

72

00:04:02,490  -->  00:04:06,160
point but there are so many courses online that teach it.

73

00:04:06,180  -->  00:04:12,450
And in my opinion that's because HP is pretty easy to teach in an online setting the set up getting

74

00:04:12,450  -->  00:04:17,400
everyone installed making sure that the tools work for everyone are really easy to do.

75

00:04:17,760  -->  00:04:20,990
And that's not the case with a lot of the more exciting and newer technologies.

76

00:04:21,110  -->  00:04:26,160
And I had a lot of reservations about not teaching something like ph P because in my in-person classes

77

00:04:26,430  -->  00:04:31,080
it's much easier to help someone get their computer set up and get their system set up to teach something

78

00:04:31,230  -->  00:04:33,160
like node or express.

79

00:04:33,450  -->  00:04:39,490
Fortunately I found some technologies online that really make it easy it's even easier than teaching

80

00:04:39,500  -->  00:04:40,240
ph.

81

00:04:40,460  -->  00:04:44,310
There's some great tools that we use that will get you set up with everything you need in a matter of

82

00:04:44,310  -->  00:04:44,990
seconds.

83

00:04:45,120  -->  00:04:46,620
So that's not a worry any more.

84

00:04:46,740  -->  00:04:51,960
And we can focus on teaching the most exciting the most relevant things that are being used right now

85

00:04:51,960  -->  00:04:52,910
in industry.

86

00:04:52,920  -->  00:04:54,930
So Ph.D. is not one of those.

87

00:04:55,200  -->  00:05:01,200
Rather the main focus of this course is on Node J.S. and really the main focus is on Javascript.

88

00:05:01,200  -->  00:05:05,910
But I just want to throw it out there that this is the only full stack develop recourse that takes you

89

00:05:05,910  -->  00:05:07,100
from start to finish.

90

00:05:07,260  -->  00:05:08,990
That covers no J.S. Yes.

91

00:05:09,060  -->  00:05:14,670
So there are plenty of standalone node course is out there that either presume you have previous experience

92

00:05:15,180  -->  00:05:20,250
or they only see each node and nothing else but this course again is from start to finish.

93

00:05:20,310  -->  00:05:25,120
Everything you need to know node is just one facet of this gigantic curriculum.

94

00:05:25,120  -->  00:05:27,330
It's a huge web of topics that we cover.

95

00:05:27,570  -->  00:05:32,970
And the reason that I mention this right now is that node is by far the fastest growing the most exciting

96

00:05:32,970  -->  00:05:34,880
technology out there right now.

97

00:05:34,980  -->  00:05:37,260
It's the opposite of something like HP.

98

00:05:37,350  -->  00:05:41,840
I do want to make it really clear though that I'm not saying HP is something you shouldn't learn and

99

00:05:41,880  -->  00:05:47,940
not saying no J is a miracle technology that solves all of your problems but in my experience is someone

100

00:05:47,940  -->  00:05:52,350
who has taught hundreds of people how to program helped hundreds of people change their careers.

101

00:05:52,410  -->  00:05:57,720
Node is one of the best paths to success and that's why I'm teaching it and I expand a lot more on why

102

00:05:57,720  -->  00:06:03,690
we teach Noad why we don't teach something like ph P or Python or Ruby that there are valid technologies

103

00:06:03,690  -->  00:06:08,940
that have worked just fine and that I've actually talked before too but I've settled on nood and javascript

104

00:06:09,210  -->  00:06:11,750
as the best way to teach someone to program.

105

00:06:12,240  -->  00:06:16,980
And the last really big point that I want to make is that this class is constantly changing with new

106

00:06:16,980  -->  00:06:23,070
material new content projects new assignments exercises that are always being added.

107

00:06:23,070  -->  00:06:28,110
Think of it as a subscription to the best content out there for learning how to be a web developer.

108

00:06:28,230  -->  00:06:32,910
So this isn't just a one time thing that as soon as you take the course and you finish it you're done

109

00:06:32,930  -->  00:06:33,090
.

110

00:06:33,240  -->  00:06:34,430
That's not how it works.

111

00:06:34,440  -->  00:06:37,780
You'll get emails every week every month with new content.

112

00:06:37,800  -->  00:06:41,440
I just added a new project or bootstrap for just came out.

113

00:06:41,460  -->  00:06:45,960
So I've added a bootstrapped form module on top of our bootstrap 3 module and this is something that's

114

00:06:45,960  -->  00:06:46,950
pretty unique.

115

00:06:46,950  -->  00:06:50,940
A lot of the course out there do get updates but they're not very frequent.

116

00:06:51,150  -->  00:06:52,650
It might be once a quarter.

117

00:06:52,740  -->  00:06:53,830
Here's a new unit.

118

00:06:54,000  -->  00:06:57,360
But this course is different in that it's constantly updating with new material.

119

00:06:57,390  -->  00:07:00,230
And it just keeps getting better and better as time goes on.

120

00:07:00,240  -->  00:07:05,580
And lastly if you like dogs there's a very cute dog named resti that I feature pretty heavily in this

121

00:07:05,580  -->  00:07:06,420
course.

122

00:07:06,420  -->  00:07:08,870
If you don't like dogs just turn the video off right now.

123

00:07:08,970  -->  00:07:11,110
Don't worry we have plenty of cat photos too.

124

00:07:11,150  -->  00:07:13,700
But if you like dogs fear intrigued by this image.

125

00:07:13,780  -->  00:07:15,380
You like those giant ears.

126

00:07:15,530  -->  00:07:17,060
And this is the course for you.

127

00:07:17,370  -->  00:07:23,160
So to wrap everything up I just want to go back to the second slide here where it says this is the only

128

00:07:23,160  -->  00:07:25,720
course you will ever need to learn my development.

129

00:07:25,770  -->  00:07:28,130
I stand by that statement 100 percent.

130

00:07:28,170  -->  00:07:33,150
If you want to learn to be a web developer whether it's because you think it will be fun you want it

131

00:07:33,150  -->  00:07:34,050
as a hobby.

132

00:07:34,050  -->  00:07:35,300
You want to try and get a job.

133

00:07:35,430  -->  00:07:36,790
You want to start your own company.

134

00:07:36,960  -->  00:07:41,690
You want to create your own web site for a friend or your own company that you already have.

135

00:07:41,700  -->  00:07:43,260
This is the course for you.

136

00:07:43,380  -->  00:07:47,900
It takes you from start to finish from a complete beginner up to a web developer.
