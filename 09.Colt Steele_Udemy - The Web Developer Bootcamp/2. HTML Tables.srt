1

00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:04,430
So the next element I want to talk about is the HCM l table.

2

00:00:04,770  -->  00:00:12,110
So the table is how we create charts or tables like this one here on the Indian page for table.

3

00:00:12,480  -->  00:00:15,760
There's a table here you can see of a chart.

4

00:00:16,620  -->  00:00:22,190
There's another table here for colors and then here's a few examples of the types of things that we're

5

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:23,090
going to work on.

6

00:00:23,340  -->  00:00:25,300
So these are tables in nature.

7

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:26,560
They're pretty simple.

8

00:00:26,560  -->  00:00:31,470
Obviously they're not the most beautiful things without styling but they are very useful to display

9

00:00:31,470  -->  00:00:34,800
information in a tabular format.

10

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:37,580
I'm going to go ahead and comment.

11

00:00:37,860  -->  00:00:47,870
A lot of this file out remember in sublime command slash and I'm going to put in a new table element

12

00:00:49,980  -->  00:00:54,420
and inside of every table and this is where it gets a little tricky because there's a few different

13

00:00:54,420  -->  00:00:55,550
ways of doing this.

14

00:00:55,560  -->  00:01:03,810
The first we're going to show you is we write a t r element which stands for table row and then inside

15

00:01:03,810  -->  00:01:08,590
of each table row you put a t d element.

16

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:14,040
So I'm going to just write this out just to show you a pic first then we're going to come back and discuss

17

00:01:14,040  -->  00:01:14,490
it.

18

00:01:14,490  -->  00:01:20,550
So tiddy and we're just going to put some random text here so let's go back to colors red and orange

19

00:01:20,880  -->  00:01:23,670
and let's leave it at that.

20

00:01:23,700  -->  00:01:27,150
I refresh my page and I have a beautiful table.

21

00:01:27,150  -->  00:01:32,320
However I don't have any border on this table so it's hard to see what's happening.

22

00:01:32,460  -->  00:01:34,340
You would do this using CSSA.

23

00:01:34,350  -->  00:01:41,040
Ordinarily this is not a really great idea the way that I did it here with a border attribute.

24

00:01:41,160  -->  00:01:43,760
This is sort of the old way of doing it.

25

00:01:43,830  -->  00:01:51,150
This is how you could do it back in time for basically before things became more oriented around doing

26

00:01:51,180  -->  00:01:54,780
all your styling in your C Ss so you could still do it.

27

00:01:54,780  -->  00:01:56,960
I'm just going to add here just to show you what's happening.

28

00:01:57,120  -->  00:02:04,360
So what I've done is made a table that is one row and it has two elements to TDL instead of a row.

29

00:02:04,770  -->  00:02:09,210
So I can make another row and I'm going to make green

30

00:02:11,970  -->  00:02:12,600
and yellow

31

00:02:16,260  -->  00:02:20,070
and take a moment to just think about what this should look like when I refresh.

32

00:02:20,070  -->  00:02:25,070
We all have two rows now red and orange and yellow and green.

33

00:02:25,890  -->  00:02:32,990
So again we've got table we've got t r for each row and then a T D for each cell.

34

00:02:33,900  -->  00:02:35,300
So that's great.

35

00:02:35,310  -->  00:02:41,010
The next thing though that I want to show is how we could create a heading on the table so let's let's

36

00:02:41,010  -->  00:02:45,090
change our data a bit and let's make this table about people.

37

00:02:45,090  -->  00:02:55,920
So we'll have something like name and age and then below that we'll have you know name is or maybe this

38

00:02:55,920  -->  00:02:59,950
is dogs that rusty My dog has to watch it.

39

00:02:59,970  -->  00:03:04,130
My other dog who is 13 and so on.

40

00:03:04,260  -->  00:03:11,250
So to do this we want name and age to be part of a table kind of the bolded heading of the table.

41

00:03:11,250  -->  00:03:12,770
And so there's another element.

42

00:03:13,080  -->  00:03:20,380
We'll make another row and rather than Tweedy's we're going to use a tag called Th.

43

00:03:20,940  -->  00:03:23,820
So th's for a table head or table header.

44

00:03:24,370  -->  00:03:36,750
And we're going to have a name and age and then our first row will go ahead and fill out Rusty and his

45

00:03:36,750  -->  00:03:46,970
age is to then our next row will be Wyatt and his age 13.

46

00:03:47,610  -->  00:03:49,220
It's good for a dog.

47

00:03:49,590  -->  00:03:51,320
So I refresh the page.

48

00:03:51,540  -->  00:03:56,170
Oh well you can see my beautiful diagram this comment that out.

49

00:03:56,910  -->  00:03:58,240
And now here's my table.

50

00:03:58,470  -->  00:04:04,440
So I've got my th's in one row and then if I had another row with two elements and then another row

51

00:04:04,530  -->  00:04:06,070
with two elements.

52

00:04:06,150  -->  00:04:08,540
So one other thing we can discuss here.

53

00:04:08,850  -->  00:04:13,150
There is a slightly more complicated way to make the exact same table.

54

00:04:13,620  -->  00:04:19,590
And it's really more complicated it's just another tag or two that gives our table more meaning.

55

00:04:19,590  -->  00:04:25,900
So right now our heading information is two headers are just part of a regular TR.

56

00:04:26,100  -->  00:04:31,370
So there's no distinction between this TR And this TR They're both just table rows.

57

00:04:31,680  -->  00:04:38,040
Well initially of all five again the emphasis is on making each team out and having markup that is somewhat

58

00:04:38,040  -->  00:04:38,620
meaningful.

59

00:04:38,640  -->  00:04:43,860
So that if some other code is looking at this site and someone who is using a screen reader screen reader

60

00:04:43,860  -->  00:04:49,440
code can see my aged him HMO and read it and it will know the heading in it will know what the body

61

00:04:49,440  -->  00:04:55,350
of the table that might behave slightly differently than if it just reads all the roads out loud.

62

00:04:55,350  -->  00:05:04,830
So what we do there are two elements that we can add and there's a T head and a t body and these will

63

00:05:04,830  -->  00:05:08,670
not make a difference at all in the appearance.

64

00:05:08,860  -->  00:05:16,800
But I can do is just move the heading stuff everything that corresponds to this top part into a T head

65

00:05:16,820  -->  00:05:17,550
.

66

00:05:18,810  -->  00:05:24,270
And then what I'll do is move the actual body of the table all the content

67

00:05:27,060  -->  00:05:31,610
into the body so it looks identical nothing should change.

68

00:05:31,770  -->  00:05:36,930
And let's just do one other quick to change here so let's add another column so this will be name age

69

00:05:37,260  -->  00:05:38,870
and breed.

70

00:05:39,690  -->  00:05:46,320
So resti is a mutt and why it is a golden.

71

00:05:46,950  -->  00:05:47,610
There we go.

72

00:05:47,760  -->  00:05:50,340
So that's the basis of tables.

73

00:05:50,340  -->  00:05:52,470
Again they're not usually that ugly.

74

00:05:52,470  -->  00:05:57,450
We usually use C S S and so this is just a normal table without any styling.

75

00:05:57,450  -->  00:06:01,380
And then we'll go and see assess and change the fonts and add a border and background colors and all

76

00:06:01,380  -->  00:06:01,880
of that.

77

00:06:02,130  -->  00:06:02,930
Okay great.
