1

00:00:00,200  -->  00:00:02,240
All right onto the search route.

2

00:00:02,250  -->  00:00:10,050
So again we want to be able to have around slash search or let's just make it the home page slash and

3

00:00:10,260  -->  00:00:16,990
we'll have a form we fill the form out it submit to this route which will then make a request to be

4

00:00:17,010  -->  00:00:25,040
API except that request will have a variable here coming from the form and then everything else will

5

00:00:25,050  -->  00:00:27,780
work the same we'll be able to leave this route alone.

6

00:00:28,230  -->  00:00:30,300
So let's add that in apt get

7

00:00:32,940  -->  00:00:33,630
slash

8

00:00:37,860  -->  00:00:44,160
just like that and we'll just start by rendering a form which we'll call search.

9

00:00:45,270  -->  00:00:52,890
So next up let's make that touch views slash search.

10

00:00:52,910  -->  00:00:53,200
E.J..

11

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:53,610
Yes

12

00:00:56,990  -->  00:01:00,930
and I had a typo Tudge views slash search.

13

00:01:00,950  -->  00:01:01,230
E.J..

14

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:03,280
Yes.

15

00:01:03,390  -->  00:01:07,850
Take a look at it at an H1.

16

00:01:08,010  -->  00:01:09,940
Search for a movie.

17

00:01:09,960  -->  00:01:12,910
And like I mentioned we're keeping it very very barebones here.

18

00:01:12,930  -->  00:01:14,310
No styling.

19

00:01:14,310  -->  00:01:19,150
Let's just make sure we see this when we run the server.

20

00:01:19,200  -->  00:01:23,400
I go to the route route I see search for a movie.

21

00:01:23,400  -->  00:01:24,070
Excellent.

22

00:01:24,300  -->  00:01:25,350
So let's build a form

23

00:01:29,070  -->  00:01:47,160
form and let's add in just a single input type equals text placeholder equals search term and we'll

24

00:01:47,160  -->  00:01:54,320
add in another input type equals submit like that.

25

00:01:54,330  -->  00:01:55,960
So where will this form go.

26

00:01:56,220  -->  00:02:03,780
Well we want it to submit to our results wrap and results throughout will then take care of handling

27

00:02:03,780  -->  00:02:06,370
the API call and then rendering a template.

28

00:02:07,110  -->  00:02:19,770
So that's just going to be action slash results and method is just gets so that almost all of it if

29

00:02:19,770  -->  00:02:29,100
we take a look refresh the page we have a really hideous form I can add something in here but nothing

30

00:02:29,100  -->  00:02:30,320
is being done with this.

31

00:02:30,330  -->  00:02:38,700
So even if I search for Harry Potter and hit submit I saw get Iowa but it is submitting the form correctly

32

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:39,030
.

33

00:02:39,030  -->  00:02:46,270
It's hitting this route slash results and that's getting in Iowa movies and rendering the results template

34

00:02:46,300  -->  00:02:46,680
.

35

00:02:47,280  -->  00:02:53,870
So we now need to take the data from this form and plug it into the API call.

36

00:02:53,880  -->  00:03:00,470
So the first thing we need to do is add in our name attribute so we can call this whatever we want.

37

00:03:00,480  -->  00:03:03,180
Let's just call it queery.

38

00:03:03,630  -->  00:03:05,670
No actually that's a little confusing.

39

00:03:05,670  -->  00:03:08,020
So let's instead just name it search.

40

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:14,580
So remember when this request is made when we submit the form it's going to look just like this.

41

00:03:14,580  -->  00:03:16,880
I'll show you in just a second.

42

00:03:17,130  -->  00:03:18,850
Restart the server.

43

00:03:19,110  -->  00:03:22,760
So our data whatever we put here is going to be stored and search.

44

00:03:23,100  -->  00:03:31,050
So if we go back refresh and try something like What's another state we can do.

45

00:03:31,410  -->  00:03:32,890
Let's do Wyoming.

46

00:03:33,420  -->  00:03:38,420
Submit can see up here we have search equals Wyoming.

47

00:03:38,730  -->  00:03:41,220
Our key value pair in the query string.

48

00:03:41,310  -->  00:03:44,130
So that's all we need to do for the form.

49

00:03:44,160  -->  00:03:53,460
Then inside of our app in this route we need to access the data from that query string and insert it

50

00:03:53,460  -->  00:03:54,810
right here.

51

00:03:55,740  -->  00:03:57,630
So let's start simple.

52

00:03:57,630  -->  00:03:59,360
How do we get data from the query string.

53

00:03:59,490  -->  00:04:09,630
Well it's a request dot query dot the name of the or the key of that piece of information which is search

54

00:04:11,430  -->  00:04:14,210
which is what we named it save it to a variable.

55

00:04:14,430  -->  00:04:16,780
Let's just print it out to start.

56

00:04:17,490  -->  00:04:20,550
I always like to start nice and simple.

57

00:04:20,550  -->  00:04:22,030
So I go back here.

58

00:04:22,230  -->  00:04:28,530
Let's do it Montana now and you can see we get Montana printed there.

59

00:04:28,530  -->  00:04:35,700
So now it's just a matter of saving that to a variable.

60

00:04:35,700  -->  00:04:44,350
So we'll call it we'll just call it queery equals wreck that queried search.

61

00:04:44,820  -->  00:04:53,550
Then what we could do is just do plus queries right there and that will just add our search query there

62

00:04:53,640  -->  00:05:02,760
an easier way or a cleaner way in my opinion at least is to make a u r l variable and concatenate them

63

00:05:02,760  -->  00:05:10,530
like this so that we have a shorter request that we make here we just request you are out.

64

00:05:10,620  -->  00:05:17,790
So we're getting the query rector queried about search so whatever the user typed into the form or grabbing

65

00:05:17,790  -->  00:05:23,850
that Montana in this case saving that to this variable then reconstructing you know you are all that's

66

00:05:23,880  -->  00:05:27,230
going to look like HTP colon slash slash OAM deviate here.

67

00:05:27,270  -->  00:05:33,670
Dot com slash question mark s equals whatever the user typed into that form.

68

00:05:34,440  -->  00:05:36,190
And then we're using that you are.

69

00:05:36,600  -->  00:05:37,590
And that's it.

70

00:05:37,590  -->  00:05:52,350
So let's give it a shot go to our form and search for Florida and what you know we get 10 Florida results

71

00:05:52,340  -->  00:05:52,990
.

72

00:05:53,270  -->  00:05:58,440
Try it again this time let's do another state.

73

00:05:58,530  -->  00:06:03,110
Alabama.

74

00:06:03,120  -->  00:06:04,010
Awesome.

75

00:06:04,530  -->  00:06:09,960
So next thing that we could do is just added a few minor improvements.

76

00:06:09,970  -->  00:06:17,160
Anything is an improvement I guess but the main thing I'm thinking about not the UI but I'm thinking

77

00:06:17,160  -->  00:06:19,920
about just showing you using more data.

78

00:06:19,980  -->  00:06:26,030
So we're not using year we don't need type let's just use the year.

79

00:06:26,190  -->  00:06:34,420
So let's just do the movie title Dasch the year that should be simple enough and we'll just like Look

80

00:06:34,610  -->  00:06:45,030
look like movie year just like that will save us as you can see here we get the year.

81

00:06:45,570  -->  00:06:54,150
And let's also add in let's bold the movie title or italicize the year either one.

82

00:06:55,050  -->  00:06:57,670
Let's make this a little cleaner here.

83

00:06:58,220  -->  00:07:03,270
I think that technically we should add in UL

84

00:07:07,530  -->  00:07:09,420
and all that.

85

00:07:09,960  -->  00:07:11,050
OK.

86

00:07:11,430  -->  00:07:15,240
And we're doing the title and we'll make the title

87

00:07:18,020  -->  00:07:21,020
let's too strong

88

00:07:26,970  -->  00:07:33,040
and we can also indent this to make it a little easier to see what's happening.

89

00:07:34,320  -->  00:07:36,280
All right.

90

00:07:36,810  -->  00:07:40,540
So let's just take a look.

91

00:07:40,590  -->  00:07:41,040
There we go.

92

00:07:41,040  -->  00:07:46,630
We get our bolded Sweet Home Alabama crazy now and then the year that's not bold.

93

00:07:47,070  -->  00:07:47,800
All right.

94

00:07:47,880  -->  00:07:50,610
So one last thing really minor.

95

00:07:50,610  -->  00:07:53,410
But let's just add a back button.

96

00:07:53,700  -->  00:08:03,690
So an a tag which you want ref to be equal to slash just do search again.

97

00:08:04,230  -->  00:08:05,870
I like that.

98

00:08:06,420  -->  00:08:08,140
And now we can search again.

99

00:08:08,640  -->  00:08:08,930
OK.

100

00:08:08,940  -->  00:08:10,230
One more.

101

00:08:10,260  -->  00:08:12,150
What's said as another state we could use.

102

00:08:12,180  -->  00:08:14,080
Oh let's try New York.

103

00:08:14,100  -->  00:08:23,730
So we have a space and when we submit it noticed that automatically has a plus sign added their new

104

00:08:23,730  -->  00:08:24,100
plus.

105

00:08:24,100  -->  00:08:26,910
York and that's what is being made of the.

106

00:08:26,920  -->  00:08:29,610
Or that's what the request is being made with.

107

00:08:29,700  -->  00:08:31,220
So that's it for now.

108

00:08:31,590  -->  00:08:35,850
So just to reiterate the key takeaways just a regular route.

109

00:08:36,060  -->  00:08:38,070
We're just sticking the request inside of it.

110

00:08:38,070  -->  00:08:42,310
When that request is done then we're rendering a template.

111

00:08:42,870  -->  00:08:48,330
The other thing that's important is on underparts because when you turn that string into a javascript

112

00:08:48,330  -->  00:08:53,060
object that we can use and then the last thing was we're creating a dynamic.

113

00:08:53,130  -->  00:08:56,250
So it's not always California or Iowa or whatever.

114

00:08:56,250  -->  00:09:01,610
We're now adding in the queries from the user coming from the query string from the form.

115

00:09:01,680  -->  00:09:02,030
Our
