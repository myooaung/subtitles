00:00:00.550  -->  00:00:06.360
This video we're going to use boolean logic and some conditionals to build a simple number guessing

2

00:00:06.360  -->  00:00:06.760
game.

3

00:00:06.900  -->  00:00:08.360
So this is how it works.

4

00:00:08.460  -->  00:00:15.580
When I load the page it asks me to guess the number and behind the scenes there is a number.

5

00:00:15.630  -->  00:00:20.570
In this case it's set as 7 a number that I need to pick to get it right.

6

00:00:20.670  -->  00:00:27.800
So if I guess something like 9 which is too high it tells me to high try again.

7

00:00:28.380  -->  00:00:33.930
So if I refresh and this time I guess two tells me that's too low.

8

00:00:33.930  -->  00:00:35.130
Try again.

9

00:00:35.820  -->  00:00:43.590
And finally if I get it correctly with 7 it tells me you guessed it.

10

00:00:43.710  -->  00:00:51.850
So to build this maybe go ahead and open up supply and make a new file game.

11

00:00:51.910  -->  00:00:57.200
H Tim L I didn't my e-mail here.

12

00:00:59.190  -->  00:01:06.750
And then I'm going to add a script tag and set it equal to B game.

13

00:01:06.890  -->  00:01:09.380
Yes which doesn't exist yet.

14

00:01:09.390  -->  00:01:12.170
Now I'll add that file.

15

00:01:12.930  -->  00:01:18.720
Game dot japes and in there I'm just going to put alert.

16

00:01:18.970  -->  00:01:19.970
Hello.

17

00:01:20.430  -->  00:01:25.000
Just as always I want to make sure things are connected OK.

18

00:01:25.150  -->  00:01:28.650
So now I'm going to open this up.

19

00:01:28.800  -->  00:01:29.340
All right.

20

00:01:29.400  -->  00:01:36.100
Everything looks good so the first thing that we want to do is figure out our logic.

21

00:01:36.360  -->  00:01:39.440
So I'm going to write some comments that are going to guide us throughout this.

22

00:01:39.500  -->  00:01:51.000
So the first thing we want to do is create a secret number and then ask user for guess and then check

23

00:01:51.210  -->  00:01:51.570
.

24

00:01:54.630  -->  00:02:00.350
So to start let's create the secret number which we'll just start with a variable that is hardcoded

25

00:02:00.410  -->  00:02:00.510
.

26

00:02:00.510  -->  00:02:02.460
So it's always the same.

27

00:02:02.520  -->  00:02:09.580
Our secret number equals and let's this time do four.

28

00:02:10.500  -->  00:02:12.930
Then we're going to ask the user for their guess.

29

00:02:12.960  -->  00:02:15.840
So far I guess he calls prompt

30

00:02:20.820  -->  00:02:28.360
let's say guess a number and that's all we need to do their save.

31

00:02:29.520  -->  00:02:33.610
And then as our first step let's just alert.

32

00:02:33.830  -->  00:02:34.170
Guess

33

00:02:37.750  -->  00:02:40.210
so let's go back refresh.

34

00:02:40.490  -->  00:02:45.420
Guess a number 104 and then it tells me 104.

35

00:02:45.450  -->  00:02:46.460
All right.

36

00:02:46.890  -->  00:02:50.830
So the first thing that we want to do is just check if they guessed correctly.

37

00:02:51.090  -->  00:02:52.810
So that conditional.

38

00:02:53.010  -->  00:02:53.400
That's right.

39

00:02:53.400  -->  00:02:56.860
This is check if guess is right.

40

00:02:57.330  -->  00:03:10.500
That conditional is just if guess chirpily calls secret number and if that's the case let's do an alert

41

00:03:10.500  -->  00:03:11.340
.

42

00:03:11.430  -->  00:03:15.500
You got it right and safe.

43

00:03:16.170  -->  00:03:18.920
So there is one small problem but I want to show it.

44

00:03:18.930  -->  00:03:21.930
Failing first so I'm going to run this.

45

00:03:21.930  -->  00:03:23.820
Remember our secret number is four.

46

00:03:23.850  -->  00:03:32.920
So if I refresh and I type four I should see you got it right but I'm not and here's why.

47

00:03:33.120  -->  00:03:35.850
Open up the javascript Council to illustrate this.

48

00:03:35.880  -->  00:03:38.610
When I do prompt when I ask for a number.

49

00:03:38.640  -->  00:03:40.220
So let's do this line here.

50

00:03:40.310  -->  00:03:45.610
Var gas equals prompt.

51

00:03:46.880  -->  00:03:47.450
Yes

52

00:03:50.280  -->  00:03:55.620
when I typed the number four in here it's not actually stored as a number.

53

00:03:55.650  -->  00:03:59.910
So if I look at what guess is you can see it's a string.

54

00:04:00.180  -->  00:04:07.890
And if I wanted to prove that it was a string I could use javascript's type of which tells me type of

55

00:04:07.890  -->  00:04:09.440
guess is string.

56

00:04:09.450  -->  00:04:09.980
OK.

57

00:04:10.110  -->  00:04:18.030
So More importantly though I'm trying to compare it to secret number which remember is a number.

58

00:04:18.120  -->  00:04:24.480
So if I move this back here and I pasted in we have secret number which is the number four.

59

00:04:24.600  -->  00:04:28.520
And then we have Guess which is the string for.

60

00:04:28.530  -->  00:04:33.920
So as we saw in the Boolean logic video those do not triple equals one another.

61

00:04:34.260  -->  00:04:41.780
So what we could do is use double calls so I could say guess double equals.

62

00:04:41.940  -->  00:04:43.380
Secret number.

63

00:04:43.710  -->  00:04:49.770
But there's another way that I prefer because we still get to keep triple equals and the way that we

64

00:04:49.770  -->  00:04:58.810
do that is using a bit of new code and it looks like this number capital and guess.

65

00:04:58.830  -->  00:05:04.830
So we pass something in and what that will do is actually take the string of gas and turn it into a

66

00:05:04.830  -->  00:05:05.850
number.

67

00:05:06.120  -->  00:05:08.680
So we get the number four there.

68

00:05:08.730  -->  00:05:17.650
So then what we can do is triple equals like that where we would take guess the string.

69

00:05:17.730  -->  00:05:19.130
Turn it into a number.

70

00:05:19.380  -->  00:05:22.120
Then check if it equals the secret number.

71

00:05:22.140  -->  00:05:23.560
So that's what we're going to do.

72

00:05:23.910  -->  00:05:34.050
Going to go back over here and just check if the number version I guess is equal to the secret number

73

00:05:34.240  -->  00:05:35.280
we're going to print out.

74

00:05:35.350  -->  00:05:36.330
You got it right.

75

00:05:36.610  -->  00:05:42.650
So let's refresh let's guess four and it tells us you've got it right.

76

00:05:42.670  -->  00:05:43.690
Awesome.

77

00:05:43.750  -->  00:05:50.450
So if we get it wrong though nothing happens yet so let's add a message that says you got it wrong.

78

00:05:51.270  -->  00:05:53.470
So we'll have an otherwise.

79

00:05:54.430  -->  00:05:55.750
You got it wrong.

80

00:05:56.170  -->  00:05:57.780
And to do that we just want our.

81

00:05:57.790  -->  00:06:08.860
Else statement else and we'll just do a alert wrong like that.

82

00:06:08.860  -->  00:06:12.010
Now let's try that refresh Let's type in two.

83

00:06:12.480  -->  00:06:14.210
And we see wrong.

84

00:06:14.820  -->  00:06:21.290
So if you remember earlier on the solution that I had would tell you if you too high or too low.

85

00:06:21.570  -->  00:06:26.350
So rather than just saying wrong we actually don't want to do that.

86

00:06:26.500  -->  00:06:30.350
We want to say otherwise check if higher

87

00:06:32.820  -->  00:06:36.600
otherwise check if lower.

88

00:06:37.480  -->  00:06:38.710
So something like this.

89

00:06:38.800  -->  00:06:43.630
So to check if guess is higher.

90

00:06:43.620  -->  00:06:44.330
We're going to write in.

91

00:06:44.320  -->  00:06:45.380
Else if.

92

00:06:45.670  -->  00:06:50.390
Else if we need to convert it to a number again.

93

00:06:51.120  -->  00:06:57.150
Number guess is greater than secret number.

94

00:06:57.150  -->  00:07:00.620
We'll do an alert too.

95

00:07:00.820  -->  00:07:05.680
Hi guess again.

96

00:07:07.200  -->  00:07:08.250
There we go.

97

00:07:08.740  -->  00:07:14.250
And just to check that I refresh and I enter something in too high like nine.

98

00:07:14.560  -->  00:07:16.790
It tells me to high Guess again.

99

00:07:17.100  -->  00:07:21.490
But if for entrance thing to low like to nothing happens.

100

00:07:21.490  -->  00:07:27.490
So then we need to build in the final catch all which is if it's not equal to the secret number and

101

00:07:27.500  -->  00:07:30.950
if it's not higher then what about if it's lower.

102

00:07:31.260  -->  00:07:35.820
So what we could do is add another else if and I'll just copy this one.

103

00:07:36.270  -->  00:07:43.750
We could do LCF number I guess is less than secret number and we could say to low guess again.

104

00:07:44.130  -->  00:07:47.720
But there's an easier way which is just to use else.

105

00:07:47.940  -->  00:07:53.340
And that's because if the number is not equal and it's not greater then than it has to be less then

106

00:07:53.350  -->  00:07:53.730
.

107

00:07:53.940  -->  00:07:57.970
So I can just reduce all of this to else.

108

00:07:57.970  -->  00:08:02.410
And then we alert to low guess again let's save.

109

00:08:02.470  -->  00:08:04.330
Open it up.

110

00:08:04.320  -->  00:08:10.660
So let's try something too low like to tells me to low guess again.

111

00:08:10.810  -->  00:08:16.850
Let's try something too high like 98 to high Guess again and just try something just right.

112

00:08:16.900  -->  00:08:18.000
The number four.

113

00:08:18.370  -->  00:08:20.020
You got it right.

114

00:08:20.010  -->  00:08:20.760
Excellent.

115

00:08:21.120  -->  00:08:24.510
So there's one small small improvement we could make.

116

00:08:24.550  -->  00:08:28.470
You'll notice here that this code is being duplicated.

117

00:08:28.480  -->  00:08:33.540
We're returning guess the string into a number rather than doing that twice.

118

00:08:33.580  -->  00:08:40.730
What we could do is just get it out of the way up top one time right here where I could say Vargus is

119

00:08:40.810  -->  00:08:48.460
equal to the number of whatever the user types in to just get it out of the way all in one line and

120

00:08:48.460  -->  00:08:55.930
then we can just leave this as guess because guess is now a number rather than a string.

121

00:08:56.590  -->  00:09:02.890
And if we try that it works exactly the same.

122

00:09:02.880  -->  00:09:05.650
And if you prefer we could make this a little clearer.

123

00:09:05.640  -->  00:09:09.370
Some people might argue that doing this on one line is unnecessary.

124

00:09:09.550  -->  00:09:19.770
So what we could do instead is something like this Var gas let's call it string guess equals prompt

125

00:09:20.870  -->  00:09:21.630
.

126

00:09:22.120  -->  00:09:28.900
A number and then we would say Var gas equals number of string guess.

127

00:09:29.110  -->  00:09:31.200
So it's more explicit to do it this way.

128

00:09:31.410  -->  00:09:35.370
So we get the string guess as just from prompted this string.

129

00:09:35.430  -->  00:09:39.930
Then we turn it into a number and save it to a variable called guess.

130

00:09:40.650  -->  00:09:44.030
And then we're using that variable called guess.

131

00:09:45.070  -->  00:09:55.030
So just double check it still works too high to low just right.

132

00:09:55.840  -->  00:09:56.130
OK.

133

00:09:56.130  -->  00:10:01.540
So in future versions we're going to make this guessing game actually repeat and give you another turn

134

00:10:01.840  -->  00:10:03.580
where you don't have to refresh the page.

135

00:10:03.580  -->  00:10:05.430
It will just continue to ask you.

136

00:10:05.500  -->  00:10:08.590
Guess again too high Guess again too high I guess again.

137

00:10:08.740  -->  00:10:10.740
And then eventually hopefully get it right.
