00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:05.350
So in this video we're going to talk about three additional ways of getting user input.

2

00:00:05.370  -->  00:00:10.830
The first one the radio button is actually just another type of input tag that we've seen.

3

00:00:11.010  -->  00:00:12.740
It's similar to a checkbox.

4

00:00:12.780  -->  00:00:16.170
The next one the select tag is how we get dropdown menus.

5

00:00:16.230  -->  00:00:20.550
And finally we're going to talk about the text area which is how we can create text inputs that are

6

00:00:20.550  -->  00:00:22.290
multiple lines long.

7

00:00:23.130  -->  00:00:26.900
So I'm going to start Of course with those standard HMO boilerplate.

8

00:00:26.970  -->  00:00:33.570
Go ahead and add in title save that and let's go ahead and add a radio button.

9

00:00:33.750  -->  00:00:37.830
So it's just input type because radio.

10

00:00:37.830  -->  00:00:43.410
And I'm going to duplicate it and I'm going to give the other one type because checkbox just so you

11

00:00:43.410  -->  00:00:46.570
can see them side by side.

12

00:00:46.650  -->  00:00:48.900
So this is a radio button right here.

13

00:00:49.650  -->  00:00:51.850
I can not turned off once I've selected it.

14

00:00:51.870  -->  00:00:55.350
This is a checkbox which I can toggle on and off.

15

00:00:55.470  -->  00:01:03.390
So the difference really is that a checkbox allows a user to select it or unselected to have let's say

16

00:01:03.390  -->  00:01:07.310
there's five different choices of things that a user can check.

17

00:01:07.320  -->  00:01:09.890
Let's say we're asking users to select their.

18

00:01:10.080  -->  00:01:12.800
This is a job site and we want them to select their skills.

19

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:18.990
We want them to be able to say javascript and see as an HMO or maybe only javascript and they're just

20

00:01:18.990  -->  00:01:21.960
a bunch of checkboxes that they check on and off our radio button.

21

00:01:21.960  -->  00:01:26.280
However it's used usually when a user has one choice.

22

00:01:26.280  -->  00:01:33.840
So an example typically on Web sites should be something like gender where it asks you to check male

23

00:01:33.840  -->  00:01:36.210
or female or other.

24

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:38.920
And you only have one choice.

25

00:01:39.000  -->  00:01:41.360
You can not you know not select.

26

00:01:41.430  -->  00:01:49.410
You have to pick one of the elements so to do that let's say for example we're going to have a form

27

00:01:49.500  -->  00:01:52.110
where users pick if they prefer cats or dogs

28

00:01:55.830  -->  00:01:58.090
and there's no option to pick both.

29

00:01:58.110  -->  00:02:03.470
Unfortunately in this world it is black or white either prefer cats we prefer dogs.

30

00:02:04.080  -->  00:02:07.430
So to do that we're going to have two radio buttons.

31

00:02:07.650  -->  00:02:15.600
And if that's all we do to start I can pick one and I can also pick the other.

32

00:02:15.600  -->  00:02:16.650
Not quite what we want.

33

00:02:16.650  -->  00:02:18.780
I want to only be able to pick one.

34

00:02:19.080  -->  00:02:24.550
So the first thing I want to do is get a form going and I'm going to move my inputs into that form.

35

00:02:25.170  -->  00:02:29.490
And for now we're just going to leave it so that it's just a get request and it just the default action

36

00:02:29.490  -->  00:02:31.290
which is just to refresh the page.

37

00:02:31.650  -->  00:02:40.080
The next thing that we're going to do is add a few labels so I'm going to go ahead and use the four

38

00:02:40.080  -->  00:02:45.360
syntax so this will be for dogs.

39

00:02:48.030  -->  00:02:51.570
And then we have to give our input and I.D. dogs.

40

00:02:51.650  -->  00:02:53.870
But those have to match then.

41

00:02:53.880  -->  00:02:55.690
Same thing here.

42

00:02:55.980  -->  00:03:06.120
Another label tag for cats and then Id cats.

43

00:03:06.210  -->  00:03:08.360
So if you're fresh now we have two choices.

44

00:03:08.430  -->  00:03:10.160
But I can still pick both.

45

00:03:10.500  -->  00:03:17.580
So what we need to do is tell him how these two radio buttons are for the same choice so you can pick

46

00:03:17.580  -->  00:03:20.550
one or the other but they are one decision.

47

00:03:20.550  -->  00:03:27.090
So to do that we need to use the name attribute which remember that the name is giving an individual

48

00:03:27.090  -->  00:03:34.620
input a name but m l can refer to it by and it's also the way that it is stored or sent in the HGP request

49

00:03:34.620  -->  00:03:36.000
that names are important.

50

00:03:36.270  -->  00:03:37.580
So let's give it a name here.

51

00:03:37.620  -->  00:03:46.370
The first one name will be let's go with let's just call it pet choice.

52

00:03:47.610  -->  00:03:51.890
And then on input here we're also going to give it the exact same name.

53

00:03:52.200  -->  00:03:59.760
And the reason we do that you'll see in just a second is that by giving them the same name it then connects

54

00:03:59.760  -->  00:04:02.260
them so that we now can only pick one.

55

00:04:02.340  -->  00:04:03.510
So if we refresh.

56

00:04:03.650  -->  00:04:08.510
I can click dogs or cats but not both.

57

00:04:10.050  -->  00:04:11.500
And one more thing I'll show you.

58

00:04:11.520  -->  00:04:14.400
Let's add a button to the end of the form.

59

00:04:15.630  -->  00:04:21.360
And what we've seen so far is actually input type equals submit at the bottom of a form but I'm showing

60

00:04:21.360  -->  00:04:26.760
you a button just to show to you that if the button is the last thing in a form it will actually submit

61

00:04:26.760  -->  00:04:27.800
the form.

62

00:04:27.870  -->  00:04:33.960
So there's a few options of inputs to actually submit the form at the end button at the end or input

63

00:04:33.960  -->  00:04:35.490
type you will submit.

64

00:04:35.490  -->  00:04:38.250
So now let's pick dogs of course.

65

00:04:38.250  -->  00:04:40.270
The only natural choice there.

66

00:04:40.380  -->  00:04:47.520
Remember the name is pet choice so we should see something up here in the query string just like with

67

00:04:47.520  -->  00:04:48.710
any other inputs.

68

00:04:48.750  -->  00:04:57.420
When I click go we see pet choices equal to and then O N or on which is not really what we expected

69

00:04:57.420  -->  00:04:58.020
.

70

00:04:58.110  -->  00:05:04.710
So we're missing one thing which is we need to also say what the value of this decision is.

71

00:05:04.710  -->  00:05:09.210
So when you go ahead and add the value tag inside that value attribute.

72

00:05:09.360  -->  00:05:22.610
And let's just say this value will just be dog and this one will be cats and let's be good all caps

73

00:05:22.610  -->  00:05:28.010
just so that you can see what's coming from where.

74

00:05:28.220  -->  00:05:28.690
OK.

75

00:05:28.790  -->  00:05:36.430
So it says if the user clicks on dogs under the name pet choice store the value dogs in all caps if

76

00:05:36.440  -->  00:05:42.910
the user submits and clicks cats under the value or the name pet choice store the value cats in all

77

00:05:42.920  -->  00:05:43.690
caps.

78

00:05:44.000  -->  00:05:50.170
So just to show that to you let's click on dogs go and we get pet choice equals dogs.

79

00:05:50.360  -->  00:05:53.630
If we do cats we get pet choice because cats.

80

00:05:53.690  -->  00:05:58.790
So the next element we're going to talk about is the select tag and with a select tag what to do is

81

00:05:58.790  -->  00:06:01.260
create nice dropdown menus.

82

00:06:01.730  -->  00:06:03.300
So the tag name is called.

83

00:06:03.350  -->  00:06:04.510
It's just select.

84

00:06:04.690  -->  00:06:06.470
It's an opening and closing tag.

85

00:06:06.860  -->  00:06:10.860
And if I just do that and then it just slide and I refresh my page.

86

00:06:10.920  -->  00:06:13.040
I actually already get a dropdown menu.

87

00:06:13.060  -->  00:06:14.890
It's just totally empty.

88

00:06:14.930  -->  00:06:18.660
So along with the select tag we use the option tag.

89

00:06:18.940  -->  00:06:25.150
So inside of there for every possible option that we want to use or to pick we add an option tag.

90

00:06:25.430  -->  00:06:29.140
So let's do a dropdown that led to the user pick their favorite color

91

00:06:37.610  -->  00:06:39.510
and let's do a few options here.

92

00:06:39.590  -->  00:06:46.810
Red orange and yellow.

93

00:06:48.680  -->  00:06:53.780
So as you can see we already get a nice drop down here with our choices.

94

00:06:54.270  -->  00:06:58.330
And if I hit go let's select orange and I hit go.

95

00:06:58.940  -->  00:07:05.740
You'll see we don't actually get anything up here and there you are l like we do if we select dogs do

96

00:07:05.770  -->  00:07:08.070
yellow this time and they hit go.

97

00:07:08.210  -->  00:07:13.940
I still only get pet choice and that's because we do not have a name that we provide.

98

00:07:14.060  -->  00:07:20.030
So on our select We need to give it a name and let's just call it fav and let's just go with color and

99

00:07:20.020  -->  00:07:21.360
leave it at that.

100

00:07:22.270  -->  00:07:29.170
And I refresh my page let's click cats let's click on yellow and watch up here as I hit go.

101

00:07:29.360  -->  00:07:33.810
I now get pet choices cat and color is yellow.

102

00:07:34.460  -->  00:07:42.890
So what you'll see is that depending on the option that I have selected in this case yellow maps the

103

00:07:42.880  -->  00:07:51.230
browser takes whatever that the text is inside of that option and it just sends that as a value under

104

00:07:51.230  -->  00:07:54.150
the name color.

105

00:07:54.170  -->  00:08:02.450
So we don't always want the value that is sent along in the request to be identical to whatever is displayed

106

00:08:02.450  -->  00:08:05.260
to the user in the dropdown.

107

00:08:05.260  -->  00:08:13.190
So an example of that might be something like if we wanted the user to pick a mood so let's say What's

108

00:08:13.190  -->  00:08:21.510
your current mood and we want to have a happy face here.

109

00:08:23.120  -->  00:08:29.860
A most emotionless face I guess and a sad face.

110

00:08:31.780  -->  00:08:37.810
And we end up with this nice drop down here with our emoticons but let's say that when a user selects

111

00:08:37.930  -->  00:08:41.930
happy we don't want all of this to be sent.

112

00:08:42.200  -->  00:08:48.570
Instead we want the word happy to be sent or the word said to be sent to do that.

113

00:08:48.670  -->  00:08:52.570
We use the value tag sorry the value attribute.

114

00:08:52.750  -->  00:08:54.990
So we will say value equals.

115

00:08:55.000  -->  00:09:04.720
And let's just say Happy equals neutral and value equals set.

116

00:09:04.730  -->  00:09:10.220
Now if I refresh correct dogs let's go outside and I click go.

117

00:09:10.660  -->  00:09:14.890
You can see I get pet choice is dogs and color is equal to said.

118

00:09:15.010  -->  00:09:20.690
And of course that's because we kept the name as color you would want to change that to be mood just

119

00:09:20.680  -->  00:09:24.030
so that our markup is meaningful and actually makes sense.

120

00:09:24.230  -->  00:09:29.050
So cats are soooo happy and yet mood is equal to happy.

121

00:09:29.060  -->  00:09:29.300
OK.

122

00:09:29.330  -->  00:09:33.140
So that's all we need to cover with selects.

123

00:09:33.250  -->  00:09:37.250
One other thing is the textarea tag and textarea.

124

00:09:37.430  -->  00:09:44.330
I'll put it up on Indian is a nice way to create inputs that are more than one line.

125

00:09:44.380  -->  00:09:50.480
So we've seen text inputs like this input type equals text

126

00:09:53.380  -->  00:09:55.250
and they are single lines.

127

00:09:55.250  -->  00:10:01.360
But what if we wanted to ask a user for a bio or to copy and paste a resume or something that is not

128

00:10:01.370  -->  00:10:05.540
going to work very well and this really slim short input.

129

00:10:05.620  -->  00:10:09.390
So textarea It's actually another tag just like select.

130

00:10:09.430  -->  00:10:12.490
So it's not an input with a type.

131

00:10:12.530  -->  00:10:15.560
It's actually a separate type of form control.

132

00:10:15.880  -->  00:10:19.690
And the way that it works there's two important parts.

133

00:10:19.690  -->  00:10:27.690
The first is we create a text area tag and that on its own it's going to give us this text area.

134

00:10:28.420  -->  00:10:35.860
But what we can also do is specify exactly how big that text area is using these two attributes rows

135

00:10:36.320  -->  00:10:37.720
and columns.

136

00:10:37.970  -->  00:10:40.040
So I'll show you that here.

137

00:10:40.150  -->  00:10:47.890
Let's start with 10 rows and 50 columns and you can see that my textarea expanded in both directions

138

00:10:47.890  -->  00:10:48.080
.

139

00:10:48.230  -->  00:10:49.270
But it definitely got wider.

140

00:10:49.280  -->  00:10:55.370
So let's say I now want 100 rows and you can see it gets a lot longer.

141

00:10:55.370  -->  00:10:59.920
So basically we can specify how many rows and how many columns to change the dimensions of our text

142

00:10:59.920  -->  00:11:01.060
area.

143

00:11:01.850  -->  00:11:07.870
One other thing about it is just like with these other elements let's go back to a smaller one to 10

144

00:11:07.880  -->  00:11:08.540
by 10.

145

00:11:08.650  -->  00:11:14.570
Just like with these other elements if I wanted to send this data in the request let's get rid of this

146

00:11:14.580  -->  00:11:15.460
input.

147

00:11:15.670  -->  00:11:22.970
I would need to give it a name name is equal to and let's just say paragraph

148

00:11:28.100  -->  00:11:30.170
fill this paragraph with some text.

149

00:11:30.190  -->  00:11:33.800
I clicked go and you can see or expand this.

150

00:11:33.930  -->  00:11:36.880
I get paragraph equals whatever text I have in here

151

00:11:39.790  -->  00:11:40.590
every go
