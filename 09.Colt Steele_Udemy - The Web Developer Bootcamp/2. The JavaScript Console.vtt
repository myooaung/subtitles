00:00:00.570  -->  00:00:05.320
So this is going to be a pretty quick video about the chrome javascript developer Cantal.

2

00:00:05.370  -->  00:00:10.560
So before we actually dive into writing javascript code in the syntax we're going to start by figuring

3

00:00:10.560  -->  00:00:12.370
out where we write the code.

4

00:00:12.600  -->  00:00:17.910
And so in chrome one of the places we can do that is a javascript developer con..

5

00:00:18.360  -->  00:00:24.420
So as we mentioned a few times Chrome has great developer tools some of which we've already seen like

6

00:00:24.420  -->  00:00:26.340
the H Tim L and C Ss.

7

00:00:26.340  -->  00:00:30.200
Inspector you can click the magnifying glass.

8

00:00:30.200  -->  00:00:31.160
Click an element.

9

00:00:31.680  -->  00:00:38.420
View the HGA now we can edit things needed him team and we can edit and view the success.

10

00:00:38.430  -->  00:00:39.980
So we've seen that before.

11

00:00:40.170  -->  00:00:50.820
To get here we can right click and inspect element or we can also go to View developer developer tools

12

00:00:50.830  -->  00:00:50.920
.

13

00:00:51.090  -->  00:00:54.420
And there's a shortcut here that you see command option.

14

00:00:55.410  -->  00:01:01.460
So that's to get to the elements tab but you'll notice there's another tab over here which says con.

15

00:01:01.470  -->  00:01:01.650
.

16

00:01:01.830  -->  00:01:05.070
So this is the javascript developer con..

17

00:01:05.190  -->  00:01:11.490
So in a nutshell this is a place where we can go and write javascript in our browser so developers don't

18

00:01:11.490  -->  00:01:18.470
write full javascript applications in this console here just like developers don't write an entire style

19

00:01:18.470  -->  00:01:21.770
sheet in the browser using this VSS inspector.

20

00:01:21.870  -->  00:01:28.470
What you use it for is interacting with C assess or understanding how something works or testing something

21

00:01:28.470  -->  00:01:31.860
out and then you go make the changes in your CSSA file.

22

00:01:32.160  -->  00:01:34.980
So down the line we'll do the same thing with a javascript.

23

00:01:35.040  -->  00:01:39.990
We'll use the console to play around with games to test things out but then we'll actually implement

24

00:01:40.530  -->  00:01:45.960
a full javascript file that persists and that we save to our to our machine rather than just in the

25

00:01:45.960  -->  00:01:47.070
browser.

26

00:01:47.070  -->  00:01:51.930
So we are going to start out by writing our javascript inside of the chrome console and that won't last

27

00:01:51.930  -->  00:01:52.710
very long.

28

00:01:52.770  -->  00:01:57.870
It's just going to be a quick easy way for us to get up and going without having to focus on setting

29

00:01:57.870  -->  00:02:01.300
up a project setting up our files and linking them together correctly.

30

00:02:01.320  -->  00:02:04.350
We'll just open up her browser and type in javascript here.

31

00:02:04.650  -->  00:02:09.330
So to illustrate how the javascript console works I have some pre-written code that I'm going to paste

32

00:02:09.330  -->  00:02:12.280
in and execute before I do that though.

33

00:02:12.390  -->  00:02:16.990
I just want to point out that the focus here is not on the syntax so don't panic.

34

00:02:17.070  -->  00:02:21.330
We're going to spend lots of time going over how this code works in future videos.

35

00:02:21.570  -->  00:02:22.530
What is the focus here.

36

00:02:22.530  -->  00:02:23.820
Is the process.

37

00:02:23.820  -->  00:02:26.570
So all I want you to understand I can put some code here.

38

00:02:26.910  -->  00:02:32.130
It doesn't matter what the code actually does it just put some code there and then I can hit enter and

39

00:02:32.130  -->  00:02:33.330
it will be executed.

40

00:02:33.540  -->  00:02:36.320
So this code happens to do a simple animation.

41

00:02:36.340  -->  00:02:40.850
It adds five pixels to the width of the image every 100 milliseconds.

42

00:02:41.190  -->  00:02:42.760
So hasn't done anything yet.

43

00:02:42.800  -->  00:02:45.680
As soon as I hit enter though it starts running.

44

00:02:46.230  -->  00:02:48.550
Likewise I can type other code.

45

00:02:48.660  -->  00:02:54.130
So here's a very simple program just going to pop up a little message for me.

46

00:02:54.540  -->  00:02:57.190
Hello everyone.

47

00:02:57.770  -->  00:03:02.930
And I hit enter and that pop up is executed and that code runs.

48

00:03:03.480  -->  00:03:06.250
So that's all I want to show about the javascript console.

49

00:03:06.270  -->  00:03:15.840
You can pop it up on any page using command option J or by going to view developer javascript console

50

00:03:16.230  -->  00:03:20.960
or by opening up the elements inspector and clicking on cons..

51

00:03:20.970  -->  00:03:22.500
So we're going to spend a lot of time here.
