00:00:00.410  -->  00:00:05.190
This video I'm going to pick up where we left off and keep talking about those three Jay queery events

2

00:00:05.190  -->  00:00:05.580
.

3

00:00:05.580  -->  00:00:10.620
So the next one that I want to introduce is called Keep press so key press is one of the ways in Jay

4

00:00:10.620  -->  00:00:17.730
Cory that we can add a key press listener to elements so I'll show you on the docks here if we go down

5

00:00:17.730  -->  00:00:24.180
to the event section and we look at key down and key press and key up these are three different events

6

00:00:24.480  -->  00:00:30.900
that are triggered when a user type something on the keyboard and the differences are a little bit nuanced

7

00:00:30.910  -->  00:00:31.020
.

8

00:00:31.140  -->  00:00:37.950
So key down is fired any time that we press a key and it's fired right after we press it down and then

9

00:00:37.950  -->  00:00:43.180
key up is fired when we release the key and then key press is a little bit different.

10

00:00:43.230  -->  00:00:48.720
Some people will tell you that key press is fired when you press a key down and then release it so that

11

00:00:48.720  -->  00:00:51.390
it represents the entire key press up and down.

12

00:00:51.390  -->  00:00:52.890
And that is not true.

13

00:00:52.890  -->  00:00:55.790
It actually fires in between down and keep up.

14

00:00:55.800  -->  00:00:57.450
Usually not always.

15

00:00:57.450  -->  00:00:59.520
So we have a great stack overflow post.

16

00:00:59.670  -->  00:01:01.580
So I recommend that you read.

17

00:01:02.160  -->  00:01:08.400
I want to point out this little piece here so key down and key up provide a code indicating which key

18

00:01:08.400  -->  00:01:12.370
is pressed while key press indicates which character was entered.

19

00:01:12.810  -->  00:01:19.050
So a good example of this is that if I have a text input and someone types shift and then a and they're

20

00:01:19.050  -->  00:01:26.400
trying to make an uppercase a key down and key up will fire on the shift key and on the lower case a

21

00:01:27.200  -->  00:01:33.840
VS key press will fire on an uppercase a so it actually gives me the character not just that the key

22

00:01:33.840  -->  00:01:38.520
is that were pressed and in what order but the actual end result character when we use a modifier key

23

00:01:38.790  -->  00:01:42.860
like shift at the end of the day the three different events are very similar.

24

00:01:42.930  -->  00:01:48.000
And most of the time you can get away with using any of them and I'm going to Shoki press just because

25

00:01:48.000  -->  00:01:54.730
it's the most common so key press works just like Click where we select something with dollar sign.

26

00:01:54.750  -->  00:01:57.600
So here's an example which selects something with dollar sign.

27

00:01:57.600  -->  00:02:03.480
And then we change on key press and we pass in a callback function and that callback function will be

28

00:02:03.480  -->  00:02:10.100
called any time a key press event is triggered on the selected element or collection of elements.

29

00:02:10.110  -->  00:02:17.520
So I'm going to demonstrate that now I'll go back to my HMO and let's add in an input type equals text

30

00:02:18.690  -->  00:02:19.750
just like that.

31

00:02:20.250  -->  00:02:23.660
And we'll leave it at that and refresh our page.

32

00:02:24.340  -->  00:02:26.090
OK so now we have an input here.

33

00:02:26.550  -->  00:02:31.900
And let's get some code that will just cancel that log any time a key is pressed in here.

34

00:02:32.190  -->  00:02:39.800
So open up the console and we need to first select the input so we can just do inputs like that.

35

00:02:40.380  -->  00:02:42.800
And that's not very specific in this case.

36

00:02:42.810  -->  00:02:44.790
There's only one input so that's fine.

37

00:02:44.910  -->  00:02:51.480
But if we had checkboxes and if we had color inputs and radio buttons we would want to specify only

38

00:02:51.480  -->  00:02:54.740
where type is equal to text.

39

00:02:55.290  -->  00:02:57.370
But for now input is fine.

40

00:02:57.390  -->  00:03:03.280
Make sure we get it right that selects it then we add that key press just like that.

41

00:03:03.660  -->  00:03:11.480
And then inside of here we add a callback function which will be called any time a key is pressed.

42

00:03:11.490  -->  00:03:21.220
So in this case let's just have it cancel the log you've pressed a key and hit enter.

43

00:03:21.840  -->  00:03:24.470
And now if I go over here and I type a key.

44

00:03:24.510  -->  00:03:26.530
So I'm hitting the letter P right now.

45

00:03:26.910  -->  00:03:33.060
You can see I get you press to key and if I type another key All it does is show me a number here.

46

00:03:33.060  -->  00:03:34.770
That's just how Chrome does it.

47

00:03:34.770  -->  00:03:38.480
But I'm getting a different concept log as I type for every character.

48

00:03:38.820  -->  00:03:44.040
So that's how we could cancel that log to character something that we often want to do is run some code

49

00:03:44.190  -->  00:03:46.630
depending on which character was pressed.

50

00:03:46.650  -->  00:03:52.470
We'll be making a to do list app with Jay Querrey where you can type in new to do like Walk the dog

51

00:03:52.890  -->  00:03:58.890
and hit enter and that will then take that text in here and make a new to do and then clear the input

52

00:03:59.100  -->  00:04:01.520
so you don't have to click a button like submit.

53

00:04:01.560  -->  00:04:02.900
You just hit the enter key.

54

00:04:03.180  -->  00:04:09.110
So what we want to do is listen for a key press but only do something if the user hits enter.

55

00:04:09.270  -->  00:04:12.760
In order to do that we actually need to change our code a little bit here.

56

00:04:12.840  -->  00:04:18.640
So I'm going to just copy this and I'll refresh the page and paste this back in.

57

00:04:18.660  -->  00:04:23.430
So we're still listening for key press but we're going to work with the event object.

58

00:04:23.440  -->  00:04:29.580
I'm going to add an argument here I'll call it event and this object will just contain all of the information

59

00:04:29.910  -->  00:04:31.890
about the key press event.

60

00:04:31.890  -->  00:04:37.260
So I'm just going to cancel that log event so you can see that and I hit enter.

61

00:04:37.260  -->  00:04:43.710
And now if I type you can see that I'm constantly logging in event every time and this event tells me

62

00:04:43.710  -->  00:04:45.200
that type is key press.

63

00:04:45.210  -->  00:04:49.250
It gives me a time stamp gives me a few other things.

64

00:04:49.350  -->  00:04:53.360
One of the important parts is this char code 106.

65

00:04:53.490  -->  00:04:56.910
Also there's key code 1 or 6 and there's.

66

00:04:56.910  -->  00:05:00.340
Which are right here and they all point to one or six.

67

00:05:00.360  -->  00:05:02.870
There are some slight differences which I won't go into.

68

00:05:03.090  -->  00:05:07.650
We're going to just stick with which which is the one that the J Querrey docs use officially as well

69

00:05:07.680  -->  00:05:07.840
.

70

00:05:07.980  -->  00:05:11.860
So what this refers to is the code of the key that was pressed.

71

00:05:11.910  -->  00:05:18.540
So every key has its own code and it can show you here the javascript character codes.

72

00:05:18.760  -->  00:05:21.900
There's a page here that will interactively show you.

73

00:05:21.900  -->  00:05:27.480
So if I type I want to know what the letter see the corresponding code is.

74

00:05:27.480  -->  00:05:33.910
At 67 if I want to check what enter is I need to hit the enter key which I'll do now.

75

00:05:34.180  -->  00:05:36.570
And it tells me key code there at the end.

76

00:05:36.870  -->  00:05:40.800
So that's one of the only ones that I know by heart because we do this a lot where we want something

77

00:05:40.800  -->  00:05:42.860
to happen when you hit the enter key.

78

00:05:43.200  -->  00:05:43.440
OK.

79

00:05:43.440  -->  00:05:45.390
So let's remember that key code 13.

80

00:05:45.660  -->  00:05:52.020
Go back to our code here and all we want to do is write an IF statement instead of our listener that

81

00:05:52.020  -->  00:05:54.740
says if the user hit enter.

82

00:05:54.750  -->  00:06:10.200
So if a event which is equal to 13 that means that the user hit enter and we'll just alert you hit enter

83

00:06:11.310  -->  00:06:18.250
just like that and get rid of this for now because of that log.

84

00:06:18.870  -->  00:06:23.160
So a user types any sort of key press instead of this input.

85

00:06:23.400  -->  00:06:29.160
Then we have this event object that we now added to our callback which was already it was being passed

86

00:06:29.160  -->  00:06:29.490
in.

87

00:06:29.520  -->  00:06:32.880
Even if we left this out but we weren't capturing it in a variable.

88

00:06:33.030  -->  00:06:36.160
So now we're capturing it in a variable called event.

89

00:06:36.210  -->  00:06:39.870
You'll also see this called E sometimes but that can be called anything.

90

00:06:39.870  -->  00:06:41.580
Remember it's totally up to you.

91

00:06:41.700  -->  00:06:48.150
And then we're checking if the which property is 13 which is the enter key character code.

92

00:06:48.150  -->  00:06:49.360
Hit enter.

93

00:06:50.040  -->  00:06:55.830
And now let's go over to this and we'll type some non enter keys and we don't get those alerts.

94

00:06:55.860  -->  00:07:01.130
We do get the consul out logs because we set up the original listener up here.

95

00:07:01.980  -->  00:07:05.740
But now I'm I delete all that and I'll type some things and then I'll hit enter.

96

00:07:06.240  -->  00:07:08.160
And now I get you hit enter.

97

00:07:08.190  -->  00:07:11.960
So every time I type enter so I'll do it right now.

98

00:07:12.300  -->  00:07:13.900
It tells me you hit enter.

99

00:07:14.190  -->  00:07:14.670
All right.

100

00:07:14.760  -->  00:07:19.140
So that's all I want to show about key press will be using this to make or to do list in just a few

101

00:07:19.140  -->  00:07:20.390
videos from now.

102

00:07:20.760  -->  00:07:24.150
And we'll also be checking if event out which is 13
