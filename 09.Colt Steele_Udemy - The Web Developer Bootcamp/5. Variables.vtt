00:00:00.560  -->  00:00:05.600
In this video we're going to focus on Javascript variables and their syntax.

2

00:00:05.940  -->  00:00:10.290
So variables are a concept that exists in every programming language out there.

3

00:00:10.290  -->  00:00:12.810
And the basic concept is always the same.

4

00:00:12.900  -->  00:00:19.530
A variable is a container that has a name on it and inside of that container we store some bit of data

5

00:00:19.550  -->  00:00:20.070
.

6

00:00:20.610  -->  00:00:23.010
So we saw the basic primitive types.

7

00:00:23.010  -->  00:00:28.920
Things like strings and numbers and booleans and variables are just a place a container a jar where

8

00:00:28.920  -->  00:00:32.410
we can put one of those in and give it a name that we refer to later.

9

00:00:32.580  -->  00:00:38.460
And then of course the name variable means that the data that we store in that jar in the container

10

00:00:38.550  -->  00:00:41.280
can change you can vary.

11

00:00:41.280  -->  00:00:42.970
So variables are really important.

12

00:00:43.020  -->  00:00:45.810
They let us store some data and recall it later.

13

00:00:45.900  -->  00:00:53.160
So we could have a variable called Current logged in user if we had a website with user log in and it

14

00:00:53.160  -->  00:00:56.780
would just know the user name of the person who was logged in.

15

00:00:57.030  -->  00:00:58.910
And it could vary and it would change.

16

00:00:58.950  -->  00:01:05.820
And then as soon as someone logs out it's then set to be empty or false or something we could have another

17

00:01:05.820  -->  00:01:13.230
variable for our tic tac toe game called Current turn and it would switch between player 1 and player

18

00:01:13.230  -->  00:01:20.010
to player 1 and Player 2 and that variable is in charge of knowing or keeping track of which player

19

00:01:20.010  -->  00:01:22.800
is supposed to be going at any given point.

20

00:01:22.890  -->  00:01:26.520
So the syntax for variables in javascript is very simple.

21

00:01:26.520  -->  00:01:28.290
It looks like this.

22

00:01:28.290  -->  00:01:33.600
The VAR keyword V-A are space a variable name.

23

00:01:33.600  -->  00:01:40.170
This is up to us whatever we want the name to be called the label for that container equal sign and

24

00:01:40.170  -->  00:01:44.460
then a value and then a semi-colon.

25

00:01:44.460  -->  00:01:47.600
We will talk a lot more about when you need semi colons.

26

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:53.370
For now everything we do will be able to get away with a semi-colon or not having some a colon.

27

00:01:53.640  -->  00:01:57.260
When we talk about style and convention we'll talk about that.

28

00:01:57.390  -->  00:01:59.960
But for now put a semi-colon at the end.

29

00:02:00.870  -->  00:02:03.810
So here's three examples of variables.

30

00:02:03.900  -->  00:02:06.410
The first one far name.

31

00:02:06.480  -->  00:02:14.120
So I'm calling this container name and I'm setting it equal to the string Rusty the next one.

32

00:02:14.310  -->  00:02:20.430
I'm creating a variable called secret number and I'm setting it equal to the number 73 and the last

33

00:02:20.430  -->  00:02:26.260
one and making a variable is adorable and setting it equal to be true the boolean value.

34

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:28.100
So let me show you how this works.

35

00:02:28.110  -->  00:02:30.030
I'm going to go ahead and open up my Consul here

36

00:02:32.730  -->  00:02:36.480
and I'm going to go ahead and make a first variable.

37

00:02:36.480  -->  00:02:45.810
So my variable will be called name and I'm going to set an equal to my wonderful dog Rusty's name and

38

00:02:45.810  -->  00:02:53.070
I'll hit enter and what I've done now is say javascript I need you to make some space and I need you

39

00:02:53.070  -->  00:02:56.420
to give that space a name called name.

40

00:02:56.430  -->  00:02:59.110
It's a little confusing instead of equal to resti.

41

00:02:59.130  -->  00:03:03.420
So now whenever I ask for a name I just type the word name.

42

00:03:03.420  -->  00:03:08.480
It's going to give me Rustie or whatever is stored in name.

43

00:03:08.580  -->  00:03:11.890
So the next thing is that I can change the value that's in there.

44

00:03:12.240  -->  00:03:14.950
So to do that I just reassign it.

45

00:03:15.060  -->  00:03:24.610
I just say name equal sign and I'll change it to be Tator that is terrible nickname I give him.

46

00:03:24.620  -->  00:03:29.780
And now if I ask for name again it's now Tator.

47

00:03:29.820  -->  00:03:31.610
So that's the important part of variables.

48

00:03:31.620  -->  00:03:32.700
They can change.

49

00:03:32.700  -->  00:03:34.140
They are variable.

50

00:03:34.710  -->  00:03:40.750
So in this example I'm recalling the value of name and then concatenating it with Hello there.

51

00:03:40.860  -->  00:03:42.430
So I'll just show you that.

52

00:03:42.570  -->  00:03:50.090
Let's make another variable this time called friend with our friends equals Sally.

53

00:03:50.820  -->  00:03:54.930
And then all I do is say friend let's do a hello there.

54

00:03:55.350  -->  00:03:57.180
Hello there.

55

00:03:57.720  -->  00:04:03.750
Plus friend and I made sure to add a space here so that when we add them together we have a nice space

56

00:04:03.750  -->  00:04:07.520
in our sentence and we get hello there Sally.

57

00:04:08.100  -->  00:04:15.330
And then if I change that and I now say friend is equal to no one.

58

00:04:15.440  -->  00:04:17.180
It's very sad.

59

00:04:18.360  -->  00:04:24.740
And I write the same line Hello there plus friend I now get hello there no one.

60

00:04:25.860  -->  00:04:29.260
So also just show to you we can store numbers in there as well.

61

00:04:29.350  -->  00:04:31.210
Can or any of the basic data types.

62

00:04:31.410  -->  00:04:37.110
So I'll make a number called Far numb equals.

63

00:04:37.320  -->  00:04:41.610
Let's go with forty three.

64

00:04:41.610  -->  00:04:47.870
And now whenever I refer to Nom I get 43 and I can do math with that so I can do something like no.

65

00:04:48.100  -->  00:05:00.540
Plus one hundred and I get 143 or I can do numb my mide two and I get one.

66

00:05:00.540  -->  00:05:05.040
Another important concept about variables and Javascript is that I can change their value but I can

67

00:05:05.040  -->  00:05:06.990
also change their type.

68

00:05:06.990  -->  00:05:14.910
So let's say that I want to change the value of knowm to the string 50.

69

00:05:15.360  -->  00:05:18.470
I can do that very easily like this numb equals.

70

00:05:19.050  -->  00:05:27.450
And I could either write that number 50 in there or the string the word version of 50 and it's OK that

71

00:05:27.480  -->  00:05:28.410
it's a string.

72

00:05:28.410  -->  00:05:31.170
It used to be a number before hand but I now change it to a string.

73

00:05:31.170  -->  00:05:35.200
Javascript doesn't care as a side note in some languages.

74

00:05:35.280  -->  00:05:37.290
That is a problem and you can't do that.

75

00:05:37.290  -->  00:05:42.660
Javascript has something called dynamic typing which means that it can change from one type to another

76

00:05:42.750  -->  00:05:43.870
without problem.

77

00:05:44.220  -->  00:05:48.630
So the last thing about variables that I want to touch on is that there's a convention for how we name

78

00:05:48.630  -->  00:05:49.230
them.

79

00:05:49.770  -->  00:05:56.540
And if you notice here they all follow camel case and that means that the first letter is always lowercase

80

00:05:56.540  -->  00:05:56.820
.

81

00:05:57.090  -->  00:06:02.490
And then if we have another word we uppercase the first letter of the new word.

82

00:06:02.760  -->  00:06:12.450
So camel case looks like this camel case and snake case which is another case you may hear uses underscores

83

00:06:12.810  -->  00:06:21.930
between words and there's one more often called Khabab case or Dasch case which is you use a dash between

84

00:06:21.930  -->  00:06:22.590
words.

85

00:06:22.770  -->  00:06:25.140
So javascript variables should be camel cased
