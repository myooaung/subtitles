00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:06,390
Hi welcome to Unit 11 which is all about javascript arrays so arrays are going to be our first data

2

00:00:06,390  -->  00:00:12,900
structure and data structures are just ways of storing data ways of holding information using javascript

3

00:00:12,910  -->  00:00:13,130
.

4

00:00:13,350  -->  00:00:19,470
So we've seen variables so far which will let us hold one piece of information like a name a phone number

5

00:00:19,800  -->  00:00:20,970
a number.

6

00:00:20,970  -->  00:00:24,360
But what if we wanted to have all of the names of all of our friends.

7

00:00:24,390  -->  00:00:28,260
Hopefully it's not just one but we have multiple friends and we want to be able to store all of them

8

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:29,010
together.

9

00:00:29,080  -->  00:00:30,990
A variable is not really going to work for that.

10

00:00:31,170  -->  00:00:34,940
So the array is one of javascript's answers to that problem.

11

00:00:34,950  -->  00:00:39,870
So arrays are really really useful in all sorts of real world and practical situations.

12

00:00:40,170  -->  00:00:46,140
So a site like Facebook or Yelp they're going to have arrays all over the place any time that you imagine

13

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:47,780
or you think of a list of data.

14

00:00:47,790  -->  00:00:49,940
So there's groups of data that are related.

15

00:00:49,960  -->  00:00:56,250
So let's take an example of it make a Facebook post and that Facebook post hopefully if it's a popular

16

00:00:56,250  -->  00:01:01,870
one let's say I'm getting married or I made a funny joke one time or someone close to me died and I

17

00:01:01,860  -->  00:01:03,300
get a bunch of sympathy comments.

18

00:01:03,300  -->  00:01:06,730
Whatever it is if I get a bunch of comments there's a list there.

19

00:01:06,930  -->  00:01:11,150
And Facebook stores them together it keeps track of them together using an array.

20

00:01:11,190  -->  00:01:15,120
We're going to use arrays to do things like keep track of that to do that you have in your To Do list

21

00:01:15,480  -->  00:01:20,520
or to keep track of the comments on a particular post or to keep track of the photos that correspond

22

00:01:20,520  -->  00:01:21,800
to a particular user.

23

00:01:21,840  -->  00:01:23,070
So they're really really useful.

24

00:01:23,070  -->  00:01:27,450
It's not just some construct something that you're learning early on but it's really something that

25

00:01:27,450  -->  00:01:31,560
we'll use throughout the rest of the course and I say that a lot and it's because everything I'm showing

26

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:34,310
you is the stuff that you need for the rest of the course.

27

00:01:34,320  -->  00:01:35,830
So not just saying that a promise.

28

00:01:35,990  -->  00:01:39,460
OK let's get started with the race so we have three main objectives again.

29

00:01:39,690  -->  00:01:44,280
The first one is that I want you to be able to define race not explain what they are not that kind of

30

00:01:44,280  -->  00:01:44,680
define.

31

00:01:44,700  -->  00:01:50,420
But actually you use code to define an array and then remove and add elements from that array.

32

00:01:50,430  -->  00:01:56,490
The second objective is that you should be able to use builtin Array methods to add and remove and manipulate

33

00:01:56,490  -->  00:01:57,200
the array.

34

00:01:57,480  -->  00:02:01,260
So there are things like push and pop shift and an shift that we'll talk about.

35

00:02:01,260  -->  00:02:04,950
These are all built in methods that you should be able to use by the end of the unit.

36

00:02:05,400  -->  00:02:10,050
And then the last thing that we'll do is we'll build a simple project to do list application using a

37

00:02:10,050  -->  00:02:10,580
race.

38

00:02:10,640  -->  00:02:14,830
So will use functions we use arrays will these variables conditional logic.

39

00:02:14,880  -->  00:02:20,250
It's not going to be a fully functional crazy to do list with a visual interface just yet we will be

40

00:02:20,250  -->  00:02:23,000
working towards a really nice looking visual to do list.

41

00:02:23,000  -->  00:02:25,020
It's responsive and it looks really nice.

42

00:02:25,110  -->  00:02:27,750
For now this is going to be based in the javascript console.

43

00:02:27,870  -->  00:02:29,640
So I do want to set your expectations.

44

00:02:29,670  -->  00:02:34,320
We will be revisiting the To-Do list though and it will still use the race and functions and variables

45

00:02:34,320  -->  00:02:35,650
and everything else.

46

00:02:35,670  -->  00:02:36,960
All right so let's go ahead and get started.
