1

00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:00,610
OK.

2

00:00:00,690  -->  00:00:01,960
So let's get started here.

3

00:00:02,040  -->  00:00:07,390
And this video will focus on getting Paperchase set up and doing some simple simple animations.

4

00:00:07,440  -->  00:00:09,110
So no audio just yet.

5

00:00:09,120  -->  00:00:12,400
First thing I'll point out I'm in a new directory I created.

6

00:00:12,720  -->  00:00:14,930
I added that sounds directory in here.

7

00:00:14,940  -->  00:00:19,500
So make sure that you don't have to do it necessarily for this video because you won't be playing the

8

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:19,970
sounds.

9

00:00:19,980  -->  00:00:25,950
But if you want to follow along make a directory make sure you drag or copy that sounds folder into

10

00:00:25,950  -->  00:00:26,820
it.

11

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:33,960
The next thing you need to do is make our file so I'll make a file save it into the correct directory

12

00:00:34,740  -->  00:00:38,650
and I'll just call it circles each time.

13

00:00:39,810  -->  00:00:46,490
Well I in our h tim L. skeleton of course just like that and we'll leave it at that for now.

14

00:00:46,800  -->  00:00:51,110
So let's just open it up shouldn't really see anything.

15

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:53,710
Now let's go to paper genius.

16

00:00:54,000  -->  00:00:55,370
Again I really love this one.

17

00:00:55,560  -->  00:01:00,530
But we're going to move away from this and we're going to go to download to start.

18

00:01:01,350  -->  00:01:06,390
And the first thing we'll do is just download the most recent version which I've actually already done

19

00:01:06,390  -->  00:01:07,140
.

20

00:01:07,260  -->  00:01:10,810
So when you're done with that it will look like this.

21

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:15,050
And the first thing we can do is just take a look in the examples directory.

22

00:01:15,090  -->  00:01:19,600
Let's take a look at animated animated star.

23

00:01:19,860  -->  00:01:23,880
Pretty fun to play around with this makes me dizzy so I'm going to shut that off.

24

00:01:23,880  -->  00:01:26,280
But you can take a look at some of the other ones as well.

25

00:01:26,280  -->  00:01:28,300
Candy crash.

26

00:01:29,310  -->  00:01:32,010
So there's some cool animation you can do.

27

00:01:32,130  -->  00:01:35,590
There's a little physics involved here.

28

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:38,120
What else do we have.

29

00:01:38,130  -->  00:01:45,110
This cool line animation and a whole bunch of other ones are you.

30

00:01:45,110  -->  00:01:49,290
I really like this one this kind of parallax effect as you move your mouse.

31

00:01:49,830  -->  00:01:50,150
OK.

32

00:01:50,190  -->  00:01:52,400
So you can spend hours doing this.

33

00:01:52,410  -->  00:01:55,450
There's lots of great examples you can open any of them up if you want.

34

00:01:55,470  -->  00:01:56,980
Take a look at how it works.

35

00:01:57,060  -->  00:02:04,500
So let's look at that space one first thing that you'll see that we're including paper J.S..

36

00:02:04,590  -->  00:02:08,060
We need that file of course the library just like we need for Jay Querrey.

37

00:02:08,460  -->  00:02:14,670
But there's something that you haven't seen before which is that we have a script type equals text slash

38

00:02:14,730  -->  00:02:16,070
paper script.

39

00:02:16,260  -->  00:02:22,620
So there's a particular type of file or a script that we can write called paper script that is a domain

40

00:02:22,620  -->  00:02:29,240
specific language which is basically it's a language that is made specifically for paperchase.

41

00:02:29,250  -->  00:02:33,350
So it's not something that will work unless we have Paperchase included.

42

00:02:33,570  -->  00:02:37,960
And then you also see this canvas attribute canvas equals canvas.

43

00:02:37,980  -->  00:02:42,370
So this is kind of weird what a canvas is it's an aged hymnal element.

44

00:02:42,540  -->  00:02:45,550
So it's actually where everything that we do.

45

00:02:45,600  -->  00:02:47,590
I'll show you inspect this right now.

46

00:02:47,730  -->  00:02:50,280
This is the working version or the final version.

47

00:02:50,380  -->  00:02:54,070
If I take a look first to show you how it works.

48

00:02:54,070  -->  00:02:59,450
Again if I take a look and I inspect this black background it's not the body.

49

00:02:59,700  -->  00:03:06,900
It's something called canvas and canvas is an HMO element that basically acts as a place to do animations

50

00:03:06,930  -->  00:03:08,040
and graphics.

51

00:03:08,280  -->  00:03:15,990
So if I go to DN a look for canvas can see that added an aged smell five to each smoke cannabis element

52

00:03:16,020  -->  00:03:19,010
can be used to draw graphics to be a scripting in Javascript.

53

00:03:19,290  -->  00:03:20,300
So that's really all it is.

54

00:03:20,310  -->  00:03:26,000
It's an element in canvas that on its own without javascript it really doesn't do a thing.

55

00:03:26,280  -->  00:03:33,030
But then we go and add javascript's to say things like make it rectangle here make it green make a 3-D

56

00:03:33,030  -->  00:03:37,140
shape here do this animation and we do that all with Javascript.

57

00:03:37,140  -->  00:03:40,830
So paper J.S. uses a canvas element.

58

00:03:40,920  -->  00:03:45,000
It's the stage it's where it adds in all the animations in all the graphics.

59

00:03:45,000  -->  00:03:49,140
So we need to have a canvas on our page as you can see for this space example.

60

00:03:49,560  -->  00:03:56,370
If I go to the very bottom the only thing in the body is this right here a canvas and it has ID equal

61

00:03:56,370  -->  00:03:59,760
to canvas and also the background set to black.

62

00:03:59,850  -->  00:04:04,500
So Id equal the canvas corresponds to this line right here.

63

00:04:04,500  -->  00:04:06,300
Canvas equals canvas.

64

00:04:06,300  -->  00:04:14,220
So we're just telling this paper script file or this paper script script what ID to look for which in

65

00:04:14,220  -->  00:04:16,460
the example that just named but canvas.

66

00:04:16,800  -->  00:04:18,890
So we're going to do something very similar to this.

67

00:04:18,930  -->  00:04:22,820
But before we get there we need to make sure we include paper yes.

68

00:04:23,220  -->  00:04:26,250
So when you go to the download.

69

00:04:26,250  -->  00:04:32,190
And rather than opening examples we're going to look indexed and then we can pick either paper full

70

00:04:32,190  -->  00:04:35,870
or paper full of men and understand the full one here.

71

00:04:35,910  -->  00:04:45,450
So I'm going to copy that over into our directory so paper Dasch full but us then in our own app we

72

00:04:45,450  -->  00:04:47,410
need to make sure to include that.

73

00:04:47,670  -->  00:04:55,200
So Source equals paper Dasch full japes just like that and save.

74

00:04:55,620  -->  00:04:59,760
And then what we'll do is just refresh the page in Chrome.

75

00:05:00,120  -->  00:05:01,630
Make sure we don't get an error.

76

00:05:01,740  -->  00:05:02,390
Great.

77

00:05:02,430  -->  00:05:04,590
So it found the file just fine.

78

00:05:04,590  -->  00:05:11,580
Now let's go to paper genius's docs and look at tutorials so I actually didn't do this early on.

79

00:05:12,120  -->  00:05:15,490
But I do want to read the description of what paper JSA is.

80

00:05:15,780  -->  00:05:21,290
So it's an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the age to my five canvas

81

00:05:21,290  -->  00:05:21,960
.

82

00:05:22,080  -->  00:05:28,200
It offers a clean scene graph slash document object model and a lot of powerful functionality to create

83

00:05:28,230  -->  00:05:33,540
and work with vector graphics and Bezier curves all neatly wrapped up in a well-designed consistent

84

00:05:33,540  -->  00:05:35,950
and clean programming interface.

85

00:05:36,000  -->  00:05:37,540
So kind of a mouthful.

86

00:05:37,560  -->  00:05:42,120
Basically it's a kick ass drawing library animation library graphics library.

87

00:05:42,120  -->  00:05:43,560
That's really pretty popular.

88

00:05:43,560  -->  00:05:50,250
There are a few of them out there so it's not it's not like a query where it's pretty much the one DOM

89

00:05:50,250  -->  00:05:52,270
manipulation library.

90

00:05:52,290  -->  00:05:54,030
The one event handling library.

91

00:05:54,030  -->  00:05:59,400
There are a lot of animation in graphics things out there but paper is is I'm pretty confident saying

92

00:05:59,400  -->  00:06:00,790
it's the most popular.

93

00:06:01,110  -->  00:06:06,660
OK so let's go back to tutorials and take a look at getting started.

94

00:06:06,660  -->  00:06:09,000
I think yes getting started working with paper.

95

00:06:09,020  -->  00:06:09,900
Yes.

96

00:06:10,470  -->  00:06:14,280
And we'll scroll down and take a look at their example here.

97

00:06:14,820  -->  00:06:17,380
So what we could do is copy this entire thing in.

98

00:06:17,400  -->  00:06:21,290
But I want to do it one piece at a time so that you see how it works.

99

00:06:21,540  -->  00:06:29,270
So let's start by copying this canvas just copy the whole line and we'll put it in our body.

100

00:06:29,970  -->  00:06:36,180
So canvas I.D. equals my canvas and if I refresh the page we won't see anything at all.

101

00:06:36,270  -->  00:06:44,100
If we expected we would see there is a canvas there but if we go back let's copy this script text or

102

00:06:44,100  -->  00:06:48,260
type because text size paper script canvas is my canvas.

103

00:06:48,260  -->  00:06:52,850
And let's put that in here and paste.

104

00:06:53,130  -->  00:06:59,150
So if we look at what's happening here there's some nice comments says that it creates a paper G-S path

105

00:06:59,170  -->  00:07:00,000
to draw a line.

106

00:07:00,120  -->  00:07:04,400
So we make a path and you're going to see a lot of syntax here that you've never seen.

107

00:07:04,410  -->  00:07:05,730
And again that's the point.

108

00:07:05,940  -->  00:07:09,740
The point is that I'm forcing you to see some new things to read the docs.

109

00:07:09,800  -->  00:07:16,470
It can desensitize you to this feeling of I don't know what I'm doing I've never seen this code before

110

00:07:16,480  -->  00:07:17,890
I don't know how it works.

111

00:07:17,940  -->  00:07:19,370
That's kind of the point of the library.

112

00:07:19,380  -->  00:07:23,310
You don't have to know how it works especially for something like animations.

113

00:07:23,310  -->  00:07:26,120
Just be glad that someone else is taking care of it for you.

114

00:07:26,130  -->  00:07:28,700
I definitely am it saved my life a lot of times.

115

00:07:28,920  -->  00:07:33,070
So we create a new path here save it to a variable.

116

00:07:33,070  -->  00:07:40,800
We change the stroke color to be black and then we create a point for the start at 100 comma 100 and

117

00:07:40,800  -->  00:07:50,960
then we move our path to that start and then we draw a line to start plus 100 X and negative 50 y.

118

00:07:51,210  -->  00:07:57,780
So I'll show you exactly what that does but it draws a line starting from 100 100 and then it moves

119

00:07:57,780  -->  00:08:04,800
that line or it connects out first point to 300 comma 50.

120

00:08:04,800  -->  00:08:09,260
So if we take a look make sure everything is working if we are fresh.

121

00:08:10,260  -->  00:08:12,160
We end up with a line.

122

00:08:13,170  -->  00:08:16,730
So the best thing to do when you have something new like this is play around.

123

00:08:17,040  -->  00:08:18,480
So try changing this.

124

00:08:18,630  -->  00:08:25,980
So it's red and start is now 0 100.

125

00:08:25,980  -->  00:08:33,250
There we go we just moved our line or let's change this to be something more drastic like 500.

126

00:08:33,510  -->  00:08:36,070
So you can play around with this all day long.

127

00:08:36,420  -->  00:08:43,140
But what I want to really point out is that we're creating a paper script script not text so it's javascript

128

00:08:43,140  -->  00:08:50,340
paper script and we're setting this canvas attribute canvas equals my canvas which is the name or the

129

00:08:50,340  -->  00:08:51,580
ID that we assigned it.

130

00:08:51,660  -->  00:08:58,110
So these have to match and the whole point of that is just to tell this paper script file where to draw

131

00:08:58,110  -->  00:08:58,530
things.

132

00:08:58,560  -->  00:09:00,040
What canvas to use.

133

00:09:00,300  -->  00:09:02,360
So we can play around quite a bit more.

134

00:09:02,460  -->  00:09:09,990
And I would highly recommend that you stop the video and take a look at the tutorials try some other

135

00:09:09,990  -->  00:09:10,890
things.

136

00:09:11,100  -->  00:09:17,720
So I'll just point you towards path's predefined shapes which is what we'll be using.

137

00:09:17,820  -->  00:09:21,280
We're going to be making circles with our application here.

138

00:09:21,690  -->  00:09:24,270
So this is what we'll need to do.

139

00:09:24,690  -->  00:09:30,510
Let's just copy this code right here so Pat new path dot circle and then you have to give it a point

140

00:09:30,630  -->  00:09:31,820
to make a circle.

141

00:09:32,160  -->  00:09:34,240
And then the radius it looks like.

142

00:09:34,320  -->  00:09:43,770
So you can see there's an explanation so it needs a center point x 100 y 70 and a radius of 50 and then

143

00:09:43,770  -->  00:09:44,690
a fill color.

144

00:09:45,000  -->  00:09:51,120
So let's take a look just copy this to the bottom of our code and see what happens.

145

00:09:51,720  -->  00:09:56,160
Which is kind of what you do a lot with J S and similar libraries.

146

00:09:56,340  -->  00:09:57,340
You just experiment.

147

00:09:57,480  -->  00:10:01,520
So let's change radius to be 10.

148

00:10:01,530  -->  00:10:02,880
There you go.

149

00:10:03,540  -->  00:10:09,000
So we could also try doing another circle by just copying this down to another line.

150

00:10:09,150  -->  00:10:15,610
Let's call it var circle 2 equals new path dot.

151

00:10:15,840  -->  00:10:18,340
And let's make this one really large and purple.

152

00:10:18,630  -->  00:10:22,250
So new point and let's put it at 50.

153

00:10:22,250  -->  00:10:25,740
Come a 50 and it's going to be huge.

154

00:10:25,740  -->  00:10:34,730
So it give it a radius of 300 and then circle to fill color equals purple.

155

00:10:34,830  -->  00:10:38,180
Just like that refresh.

156

00:10:38,670  -->  00:10:43,650
And you can see we end up with that gigantic circle that you actually can't tell how big it is because

157

00:10:43,710  -->  00:10:46,740
our canvas hasn't taken up the entire width of our screen.

158

00:10:46,950  -->  00:10:52,860
So let's do that next because we do want that we want our canvas to take up the entire width.

159

00:10:52,860  -->  00:11:00,660
So I'll go and make a new style sheet so I added link tag here a Tref equals circle's dot SS which doesn't

160

00:11:00,660  -->  00:11:01,790
exist.

161

00:11:02,430  -->  00:11:10,870
And then let's save a file called Circle Stut see assess and what we'll do is add in canvas with 100

162

00:11:10,900  -->  00:11:12,210
percent.

163

00:11:12,840  -->  00:11:17,930
And let's also give it a background of black.

164

00:11:17,930  -->  00:11:21,880
And if we are fresh you can see we're close but we have a few things.

165

00:11:21,870  -->  00:11:25,210
The first of which is that our body doesn't actually go all the way down.

166

00:11:25,230  -->  00:11:28,860
So our canvas takes up when 100 percent of the width.

167

00:11:28,980  -->  00:11:31,830
But even if we give it 100 percent height right now

168

00:11:35,490  -->  00:11:38,840
it's not going to actually change the way that we want it to.

169

00:11:38,850  -->  00:11:41,570
Then we also have this margin that we want to get rid of.

170

00:11:42,000  -->  00:11:46,390
So rather than spend too much time going over that I'll just show you what we need to do.

171

00:11:46,770  -->  00:11:54,500
Well just set height to be 100 percent and margin to be zero.

172

00:11:54,810  -->  00:11:58,490
And if I refresh the page now it takes up the full screen.

173

00:11:58,860  -->  00:12:05,160
So if you want to go more into detail and understand exactly why we did that inspect the body before

174

00:12:05,190  -->  00:12:10,440
we add this code in and then uncommented inspect the body again and you'll see what happens.

175

00:12:10,560  -->  00:12:15,570
Basically we're just making sure that the body takes up the entire width and height and there's no margin

176

00:12:15,630  -->  00:12:20,020
which means that our canvas will then expand to take up that entire space as well.

177

00:12:20,250  -->  00:12:20,910
OK.

178

00:12:20,910  -->  00:12:24,680
So we created a canvas now that's really the last thing I'll do in this video.

179

00:12:24,690  -->  00:12:30,420
I just wanted to introduce you to how paperwork's we have paper script scripts.

180

00:12:30,420  -->  00:12:35,140
We give it a canvas and then we put some code in here that you've never seen before.

181

00:12:35,190  -->  00:12:40,770
A lot of this I've never seen before until I made this video or until I made this project for this video

182

00:12:40,770  -->  00:12:41,030
.

183

00:12:41,100  -->  00:12:42,380
I've definitely seen it before.

184

00:12:42,390  -->  00:12:43,820
This exact video.

185

00:12:43,830  -->  00:12:46,580
But the point is that it's new.

186

00:12:46,650  -->  00:12:48,130
And that's why we're doing this.

187

00:12:48,150  -->  00:12:54,200
It's a really important skill to be able to take code redox and basically copy it in and change it.

188

00:12:54,330  -->  00:12:54,980
Great.

189

00:12:54,990  -->  00:12:59,940
So in the next video I will be giving you a quick optional exercise so if you just want to get to the

190

00:12:59,940  -->  00:13:05,980
project and skip the educational learning experience whatever you wanna call it.

191

00:13:06,000  -->  00:13:11,170
But if you only get to kind of the payoff go ahead skip the next video.

192

00:13:11,190  -->  00:13:13,040
I would recommend that you do it though.

193

00:13:13,050  -->  00:13:17,070
We're not going to make the most impressive thing but I'm going to have you do an exercise with some

194

00:13:17,070  -->  00:13:17,860
circles.

195

00:13:17,940  -->  00:13:18,500
Very exciting.

196

00:13:18,510  -->  00:13:18,960
I know.

197

00:13:19,200  -->  00:13:19,480
OK.

198

00:13:19,500  -->  00:13:20,360
I'll see you then.
