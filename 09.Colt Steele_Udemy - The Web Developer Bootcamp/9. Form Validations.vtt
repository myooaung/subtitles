00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:07.410
So in this video we're going to focus on aged him a five form validations so validations referred to

2

00:00:07.680  -->  00:00:15.120
the ability to enforce rules and structure on different parts of a form so we can say that you cannot

3

00:00:15.120  -->  00:00:21.240
leave your email blank or your password must be greater than 10 characters or your email must follow

4

00:00:21.240  -->  00:00:23.020
a valid email syntax.

5

00:00:23.610  -->  00:00:27.450
So these validations are something that we're going to keep learning a lot about.

6

00:00:27.630  -->  00:00:31.890
We will do validations for javascript will do validations on the backend.

7

00:00:32.220  -->  00:00:36.840
Today we're just going to learn about the simple validations we can do with just plain aged him out

8

00:00:36.850  -->  00:00:37.030
.

9

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:39.180
So these are not going to be insanely complicated.

10

00:00:39.180  -->  00:00:41.180
We can't do anything really custom.

11

00:00:41.300  -->  00:00:48.510
So we might want down the line to do a custom validation to make sure that somebody's phone number follows

12

00:00:48.510  -->  00:00:51.780
the exact correct format or we have an area code.

13

00:00:51.780  -->  00:00:58.590
Dash 3 numbers dash for numbers we can't really do that with just h t m l But what we can do is two

14

00:00:58.590  -->  00:00:59.160
different things.

15

00:00:59.160  -->  00:01:04.120
We can check to make sure that something is not empty it's required.

16

00:01:04.440  -->  00:01:05.700
So I'll show you how to do that.

17

00:01:05.720  -->  00:01:15.480
Start to go back to our form that we left off with and but just make sure that user name is not empty

18

00:01:15.480  -->  00:01:16.060
.

19

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:21.370
So all we have to do is go to input and add the required attribute.

20

00:01:21.510  -->  00:01:23.790
And this is a slightly different attribute.

21

00:01:23.970  -->  00:01:28.070
We don't have to say required because true or anything you can do that.

22

00:01:28.230  -->  00:01:33.160
All we do is say required and just by adding it there it's called a boolean attribute.

23

00:01:33.270  -->  00:01:35.760
The fact that it's even present means that it's true.

24

00:01:35.910  -->  00:01:37.550
It is required.

25

00:01:38.760  -->  00:01:40.750
So this makes a pretty immediate impact.

26

00:01:40.890  -->  00:01:46.920
If I try and submit this form right now Crome is actually going to tell me please fill out this field

27

00:01:46.920  -->  00:01:47.670
.

28

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:51.210
One side note this actually won't work in every single browser.

29

00:01:51.330  -->  00:01:54.490
It's actually up to the browser right now to implement this.

30

00:01:54.540  -->  00:01:56.320
But in Chrome this will work.

31

00:01:56.400  -->  00:02:00.250
So it prevents the form troops from submitting the pages not refresh.

32

00:02:00.660  -->  00:02:07.470
But if I do fill this in the page now refreshes takes me to Wikipedia.

33

00:02:07.530  -->  00:02:11.640
Likewise we can add required to our password field.

34

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:13.270
It works the exact same way.

35

00:02:13.440  -->  00:02:18.850
Flyleaf leave both blank first is going to yell at me for user name then we'll yell at me for password

36

00:02:18.840  -->  00:02:19.450
.

37

00:02:19.860  -->  00:02:25.950
Then it will submit the form so that one type of validation which is what we would call a presence validation

38

00:02:26.070  -->  00:02:29.730
and make sure that something is there is required.

39

00:02:29.790  -->  00:02:36.360
The other type of validation that we can do is based around data type or the format of data.

40

00:02:36.900  -->  00:02:44.190
So the simplest one is to make sure that an email actually looks like an e-mail that it actually has

41

00:02:44.400  -->  00:02:51.630
the correct format where we have something at something dot com or dot some domain.

42

00:02:52.050  -->  00:02:59.010
So to do that it's actually really simple all that we need to do so let's change this to be an email

43

00:02:59.220  -->  00:03:00.160
rather than user name

44

00:03:03.180  -->  00:03:08.870
type equals email and just by changing type it be email and I'll change my placeholder just so it's

45

00:03:08.880  -->  00:03:12.030
clearer what's happening.

46

00:03:12.030  -->  00:03:17.040
I refresh this first thing this going to happen when I submit to you know tell me please fill it out

47

00:03:17.060  -->  00:03:17.360
.

48

00:03:17.640  -->  00:03:18.780
So then let's fill it out.

49

00:03:18.900  -->  00:03:20.110
Hello.

50

00:03:20.880  -->  00:03:25.200
Now it's going to tell me please include an at sign in the e-mail address.

51

00:03:25.410  -->  00:03:30.540
Hello is missing and outside so I can add my ADD sign then it's still going to tell me please enter

52

00:03:30.540  -->  00:03:33.380
a part following that.

53

00:03:34.650  -->  00:03:39.050
And let's just do gmail dot com.

54

00:03:39.150  -->  00:03:42.680
OK so now that one passes then we stole the password.

55

00:03:42.690  -->  00:03:45.180
Now I click submit and then it finally submit
