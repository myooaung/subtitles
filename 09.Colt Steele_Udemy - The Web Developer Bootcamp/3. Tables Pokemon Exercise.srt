1

00:00:00,820  -->  00:00:01,270
OK.

2

00:00:01,320  -->  00:00:03,640
So it's time for another exercise here.

3

00:00:03,750  -->  00:00:05,600
This time we're doing something slightly different.

4

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:10,260
I'm going to give you a bunch of data for Pokemon.

5

00:00:10,470  -->  00:00:15,840
Actually the three starting pokemon for the original Pokemon games does not matter if you have no idea

6

00:00:15,840  -->  00:00:17,050
what I'm talking about.

7

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:20,460
If you absolutely hate Pokemon doesn't matter I'm giving you the data.

8

00:00:20,520  -->  00:00:25,780
Basically we're going to take this data and you're going to turn it into a table like this.

9

00:00:25,830  -->  00:00:27,230
So this table is a chart.

10

00:00:27,240  -->  00:00:34,220
It has an image for each Pokemon and name a type and what each Pokemon evolves into.

11

00:00:34,410  -->  00:00:37,530
So for instance Bulbasaur looks like this.

12

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:45,240
He says she is a grass slash poison Pokemon and bubble saur evolves into Ivey's or and this is a link

13

00:00:45,540  -->  00:00:49,400
to the Ivy store poker decks or Pokemon Wiki Web site.

14

00:00:49,710  -->  00:00:54,660
So again if you have no idea what those words mean at all that's fine because you have all the data

15

00:00:54,680  -->  00:00:54,870
.

16

00:00:55,050  -->  00:00:59,580
So this is more about taking the data that I'm giving you and translating it into a table.

17

00:00:59,580  -->  00:01:06,790
So again the data we have a name we've got an image you are l we've got type and then evolves to is

18

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:11,160
both a name and a you well remember to make a link.

19

00:01:11,280  -->  00:01:15,480
You need some text to show up but you also need the whole row that you're linking to.

20

00:01:15,480  -->  00:01:15,690
All right.

21

00:01:15,690  -->  00:01:17,360
So go ahead give us a shot.
