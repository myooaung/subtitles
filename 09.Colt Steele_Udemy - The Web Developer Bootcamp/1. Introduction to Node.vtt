00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:01.450
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.650  -->  00:00:06.550
So as I promised in the last video we're now done with just pure command line basics.

3

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:11.240
We're going to continue to use all of the commands we talked about in pretty much every video.

4

00:00:11.520  -->  00:00:14.070
But they're not going to be the focus of the videos going forward.

5

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:19.590
They're just now another tool for us to use as we learn new technologies the new technology that we're

6

00:00:19.590  -->  00:00:20.320
going to learn about.

7

00:00:20.340  -->  00:00:22.120
And this video is no.

8

00:00:22.140  -->  00:00:22.740
Yes.

9

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:27.420
And before we get there I'm just going to make a new directory to put some files in.

10

00:00:27.470  -->  00:00:36.780
So I'm going to make directory intro to node just like that and then CD into intro to node just for

11

00:00:36.780  -->  00:00:43.880
more practice and I'll add a file objectives dot empty and this file won't actually do anything all

12

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:48.630
that will use it for is a place for me to put some objectives so that we can guide what we're going

13

00:00:48.630  -->  00:00:50.420
to talk about in this lecture.

14

00:00:50.430  -->  00:00:55.630
So this is intro to node and there are just two main points I want to talk about.

15

00:00:55.770  -->  00:00:58.550
The first one is what is node.

16

00:00:59.010  -->  00:01:02.770
The second one is Why are we learning it.

17

00:01:03.720  -->  00:01:07.900
And then the very last point is it doesn't matter.

18

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:10.040
So I'll come back to that at the end.

19

00:01:10.070  -->  00:01:13.140
So let's begin and talk about what node is.

20

00:01:13.170  -->  00:01:18.750
So you might have heard of node before and that's because right now it's the trendiest hottest thing

21

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:21.070
in web development for whatever that's worth.

22

00:01:21.120  -->  00:01:23.520
We're going to talk more about why we're actually learning it.

23

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:27.720
I assure you that it's not just because it's trendy but that is one reason that you may have heard of

24

00:01:27.720  -->  00:01:34.050
it before it's all over the place on blogs and books and all sorts of conferences node is all the rage

25

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:34.730
.

26

00:01:34.770  -->  00:01:36.470
So what is node.

27

00:01:36.780  -->  00:01:39.860
I have the official know O.J.'s home page here.

28

00:01:39.860  -->  00:01:41.270
Node JS. dot org.

29

00:01:41.520  -->  00:01:49.700
And according to this page no J S is a javascript runtime built on Chromes V8 javascript engine no JSE

30

00:01:49.710  -->  00:01:56.610
uses an event driven non-blocking IO model that makes it lightweight and efficient no JSF package ecosystem

31

00:01:56.730  -->  00:02:01.060
NPM is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

32

00:02:01.650  -->  00:02:05.500
So let me try and explain it in a simpler easier to understand way.

33

00:02:05.910  -->  00:02:10.460
Up until a few years ago all the javascript that you wrote had to run in the browser.

34

00:02:10.500  -->  00:02:15.870
It was the only place for you to execute javascript code and that meant that all javascript that you

35

00:02:15.870  -->  00:02:18.150
wrote was only front end code.

36

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:22.330
You couldn't do anything server side because the only place that it could run is the browser.

37

00:02:22.590  -->  00:02:24.770
So that's what we've been doing up until this point.

38

00:02:24.810  -->  00:02:31.260
Writing our javascript in js files linking them through a script tag to an Tim L file an opening that

39

00:02:31.260  -->  00:02:35.780
in the browser but that all changed a few years ago when no genius came along.

40

00:02:36.000  -->  00:02:40.980
So all that note is is a way for us to write javascript code on the server side.

41

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:47.400
So remember this diagram from the intro to back end lecture where I showed a generic stack where this

42

00:02:47.400  -->  00:02:54.150
line right here denotes the boundary between the back and or server side and the front end or client

43

00:02:54.150  -->  00:02:56.130
side before node came along.

44

00:02:56.130  -->  00:03:01.350
All the javascript we wrote was happening up here on the front it just like all of the JavaScript we've

45

00:03:01.380  -->  00:03:02.330
written so far.

46

00:03:02.610  -->  00:03:09.870
And then on the back end there were languages like Python or DHP or Ruby or Java but javascript was

47

00:03:09.870  -->  00:03:10.850
not an option.

48

00:03:11.010  -->  00:03:12.900
But no it changed all of that.

49

00:03:12.900  -->  00:03:17.820
Now we can write javascript code right here on the server side interact with our database to start a

50

00:03:17.820  -->  00:03:24.090
server to create new files and all sorts of server side logic and we can write javascript on the front

51

00:03:24.090  -->  00:03:24.570
end.

52

00:03:24.840  -->  00:03:28.170
So what that means is that we can now write javascript everywhere.

53

00:03:28.440  -->  00:03:29.670
Sort of wrap that up.

54

00:03:29.730  -->  00:03:35.850
I don't want you to get too hung up on the terminology of a javascript runtime built on Chromes V8 javascript

55

00:03:35.850  -->  00:03:36.780
engine.

56

00:03:36.910  -->  00:03:43.310
All that you need to take away for now is that node is how we run javascript on the server side.

57

00:03:43.860  -->  00:03:45.110
So that was the first point.

58

00:03:45.360  -->  00:03:50.990
What is node the next and probably more important point is why are we even learning it.

59

00:03:51.630  -->  00:03:57.630
So as I mentioned earlier node is definitely the hippest the trendiest it technology for people to be

60

00:03:57.630  -->  00:03:58.640
learning right now.

61

00:03:58.860  -->  00:04:04.440
But I'll say this right now that is the smallest reason why we're learning it so it's not something

62

00:04:04.440  -->  00:04:05.730
that we can ignore.

63

00:04:05.820  -->  00:04:10.260
But it is definitely the least important of the reasons that I'm going to mention.

64

00:04:10.530  -->  00:04:12.480
So add that here.

65

00:04:13.170  -->  00:04:14.530
It's popular.

66

00:04:14.700  -->  00:04:15.970
We can't deny that.

67

00:04:15.990  -->  00:04:20.730
I'll show you some stats and charts that reveal some interesting trends about how Noad compares to other

68

00:04:20.730  -->  00:04:24.080
similar technologies in the last few years.

69

00:04:24.120  -->  00:04:27.690
So what does it mean for a technology to be popular.

70

00:04:27.690  -->  00:04:32.670
The first thing that I'll mention is that node is definitely popular amongst existing developers.

71

00:04:32.730  -->  00:04:38.670
Almost everyone that I know who is an engineer or a senior engineer has picked up node on the side as

72

00:04:38.670  -->  00:04:41.880
something that they're interested in something that they want to learn about.

73

00:04:41.910  -->  00:04:46.890
They'll build side projects and act together things late at night which is always a great sign when

74

00:04:46.890  -->  00:04:49.550
there's a lot of excitement and buzz about our technology.

75

00:04:49.590  -->  00:04:53.370
But again I don't think that's a great motivation for you a beginner to learn.

76

00:04:53.370  -->  00:05:00.260
Note what this chart shows is just the rank of the ten most popular languages on get hub.

77

00:05:00.270  -->  00:05:07.050
Over the last seven years and you can see that in 2012 javascript overtook Ruby as the most popular

78

00:05:07.050  -->  00:05:08.920
language on all of get help.

79

00:05:09.390  -->  00:05:12.740
The last two pages I want to highlight I think are the most important here.

80

00:05:12.800  -->  00:05:17.990
They're from that web site stack share that I demonstrated earlier the last two pages I want to show

81

00:05:18.120  -->  00:05:22.540
are from that website Stex share that I introduced in the intro to back in video.

82

00:05:22.680  -->  00:05:30.030
And I have a search open for DHP which will pull into its own window and I have one for no yes as well

83

00:05:30.360  -->  00:05:33.240
and I want to just take a look at these key terms.

84

00:05:33.240  -->  00:05:38.640
Why people like HP and why people like No J us and there are good reasons on both sides.

85

00:05:38.850  -->  00:05:42.940
I don't want you to get the impression that I'm trashing peech or anything but I just do want to show

86

00:05:42.940  -->  00:05:48.960
a contrast in some of the reasons people like them so APHC some of the more popular reasons are large

87

00:05:48.960  -->  00:05:51.620
community which is definitely an important aspect.

88

00:05:51.630  -->  00:05:54.880
We also have that over here great community for Node 2.

89

00:05:54.900  -->  00:06:01.350
I want to highlight though our good old Web and Web Foundation as well as the best glue on the web.

90

00:06:01.350  -->  00:06:06.180
These are different ways of saying that ph V has been around for a long time and it's sort of the grandfather

91

00:06:06.180  -->  00:06:07.890
of web development if you will.

92

00:06:07.890  -->  00:06:12.510
Now let's take a closer look at some of the reasons people like Noad and some of the ones all highlight

93

00:06:12.960  -->  00:06:18.090
are great libraries which is really important and we're going to use some of those libraries.

94

00:06:18.450  -->  00:06:23.340
Javascript's that's the most voted or second most voted one and that's really really important.

95

00:06:23.460  -->  00:06:24.210
It's in javascript.

96

00:06:24.210  -->  00:06:25.770
People love javascript.

97

00:06:25.770  -->  00:06:27.900
We'll be able to write javascript on the server side.

98

00:06:27.900  -->  00:06:30.450
We don't have to learn another language.

99

00:06:30.480  -->  00:06:35.010
The other aspect is high performance and that's one of the reasons it's getting so much attention from

100

00:06:35.010  -->  00:06:37.320
companies and startups all over the world.

101

00:06:37.470  -->  00:06:41.980
What makes something higher performing or more performance is for another lecture entirely.

102

00:06:42.120  -->  00:06:46.860
But the fact that so many people have mentioned they like it for being high performance is a great indicator

103

00:06:47.100  -->  00:06:49.020
of the fact that it's high performance.

104

00:06:49.020  -->  00:06:53.910
So I spent the last few minutes trying to prove to you that note is popular it's trendy there's new

105

00:06:53.910  -->  00:06:56.780
jobs in it and it's only getting more and more popular.

106

00:06:56.970  -->  00:07:01.810
But I did start out by saying that that's not a reason really why we should be learning it.

107

00:07:02.070  -->  00:07:07.890
It's the smallest reason but the most important reason that we're learning it is that it's in javascript

108

00:07:08.640  -->  00:07:11.060
and that's important because we already know javascript.

109

00:07:11.130  -->  00:07:14.310
So we don't have to start from square one pick up another language.

110

00:07:14.430  -->  00:07:21.780
Learn how variables work in THP or in Ruby or in Python and how loops work and how arrays work and objects

111

00:07:21.790  -->  00:07:26.290
and oh wait some of these languages don't have objects and things just change so much.

112

00:07:26.550  -->  00:07:29.260
It can be very confusing for someone who's just starting out.

113

00:07:29.260  -->  00:07:30.520
Do you have to switch gears.

114

00:07:30.640  -->  00:07:35.490
One hundred percent and abandon javascript for you know the next half of the course until we bring it

115

00:07:35.490  -->  00:07:39.270
back at the end rather than doing that by using node.

116

00:07:39.360  -->  00:07:44.130
We're able to write javascript on the server side with the same exact syntax that we know and love.

117

00:07:44.190  -->  00:07:48.070
And I've been working with for the last half of this course.

118

00:07:48.270  -->  00:07:53.970
One of the phrases I would repeat to my students all the time is that you guys are not here to learn

119

00:07:53.970  -->  00:07:56.070
technologies you're not here to learn languages.

120

00:07:56.310  -->  00:08:02.370
You're here to learn web development and web development changes so fast you might go from a job where

121

00:08:02.370  -->  00:08:07.920
you're writing Ruby and using rails and then a year later you go somewhere else and you're asked to

122

00:08:07.920  -->  00:08:10.570
learn node and you're writing express or sales.

123

00:08:10.580  -->  00:08:11.030
Yes.

124

00:08:11.100  -->  00:08:16.590
And then a year later you're picking a python and flask and things can change all the time.

125

00:08:16.590  -->  00:08:20.020
So to summarize I'd say that it does matter in the short term.

126

00:08:20.160  -->  00:08:24.120
It is something that I mean I thought about this for a very long time.

127

00:08:24.180  -->  00:08:30.120
You know I'm fortunate I've taught things in C and in Java in Noad and Javascript in Ruby and Rails

128

00:08:30.120  -->  00:08:31.110
and Python.

129

00:08:31.260  -->  00:08:34.090
So it wasn't a matter of what I was comfortable teaching.

130

00:08:34.170  -->  00:08:38.060
I was able to pick what I felt would be best delivered through this video course.

131

00:08:38.100  -->  00:08:43.410
What would be the best first server side language for someone who has never done any server side programming

132

00:08:43.680  -->  00:08:46.610
and who is just starting out by using a video course.

133

00:08:46.710  -->  00:08:48.280
And I ended up setting a node.

134

00:08:48.330  -->  00:08:53.350
So it does matter in the short term but if you do continue with this it really doesn't matter.

135

00:08:53.370  -->  00:08:54.680
So I'll append this.

136

00:08:54.700  -->  00:08:56.330
It doesn't matter.

137

00:08:56.460  -->  00:09:01.350
Long term and that's true it really doesn't.

138

00:09:01.350  -->  00:09:03.200
This is just your first introduction.

139

00:09:03.360  -->  00:09:04.530
So it seemed significant.

140

00:09:04.530  -->  00:09:09.780
And it was certainly an important and significant choice for me to make and I thought a lot about it

141

00:09:10.080  -->  00:09:15.480
but for you once you learn node once you learn server side programming it won't be difficult to transition

142

00:09:15.480  -->  00:09:17.870
to something like Ruby or to Python.

143

00:09:18.210  -->  00:09:22.950
Hopefully this video got you at least a little bit excited about learning node and about making web

144

00:09:22.950  -->  00:09:23.480
apps.

145

00:09:23.670  -->  00:09:28.100
Because in the next video we're going to see our first taste of writing code using node
