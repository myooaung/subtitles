00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:03.460
The next thing we'll tackle is the background on the body.

2

00:00:03.660  -->  00:00:08.430
And this actually isn't a background image though if we found one that looked like this that would work

3

00:00:08.430  -->  00:00:09.270
just fine.

4

00:00:09.420  -->  00:00:13.590
But but it's actually a gradient that CSX is adding for me.

5

00:00:13.650  -->  00:00:19.430
So in essence we can write linear gradients and rather than writing them on our own from scratch I'm

6

00:00:19.470  -->  00:00:25.290
going to show you a great resource that has some nice pre-done color gradients that we can work with

7

00:00:25.560  -->  00:00:27.470
that we can update and edit on our own.

8

00:00:27.750  -->  00:00:29.850
So it's called gradients dot com.

9

00:00:30.030  -->  00:00:35.580
And then it has a bunch of different gradients we can use arrow keys to see some of them.

10

00:00:36.180  -->  00:00:39.860
So I just went through until I found one that I liked.

11

00:00:40.050  -->  00:00:46.080
So let's say I wanted to use this all that we need to do is click on get CSSA code or hit the enter

12

00:00:46.080  -->  00:00:52.120
key and then copy this code to a clipboard and then we'll select the body.

13

00:00:52.360  -->  00:00:56.960
So body and paste that in.

14

00:00:57.540  -->  00:01:02.610
So it's really just one line but there are all the different browser prefixes.

15

00:01:02.880  -->  00:01:09.130
So for Internet Explorer for Firefox for Chrome for opera all these different prefixes.

16

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:09.990
But what it does.

17

00:01:10.020  -->  00:01:16.170
We're setting the background to linear gradient and we're picking two colors and different percentages

18

00:01:16.170  -->  00:01:18.740
of those colors and also the angle.

19

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:24.390
So let me show you what it looks like now if we refresh ours.

20

00:01:24.390  -->  00:01:26.190
We have this nice gradient.

21

00:01:26.580  -->  00:01:28.420
So we can keep playing around there.

22

00:01:28.620  -->  00:01:31.890
You can check out a few more and feel free to use your own.

23

00:01:31.980  -->  00:01:35.860
The one that I decided on is called Bora-Bora right here.

24

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:42.840
So we'll just copy that copy to clipboard and replace this code.

25

00:01:42.840  -->  00:01:49.410
All of this here with that new gradient which again is just another linear gradient that someone else

26

00:01:49.410  -->  00:01:52.870
wrote two colors different percentages of each.

27

00:01:53.150  -->  00:01:54.450
And we'll save.

28

00:01:54.780  -->  00:01:56.250
And go check it out now.

29

00:01:56.520  -->  00:01:57.830
And there we go.

30

00:01:57.840  -->  00:01:59.190
So we're getting closer.

31

00:01:59.430  -->  00:02:02.860
The next big thing that we need to work on are the icons.

32

00:02:03.060  -->  00:02:05.530
So we have a plus icon appear.

33

00:02:05.640  -->  00:02:10.130
And what this does is it shows and hides the form and then we have the trash can.

34

00:02:10.130  -->  00:02:16.100
I can see that we also need to include those icons are part of a library called font.

35

00:02:16.110  -->  00:02:16.780
Awesome.

36

00:02:17.050  -->  00:02:22.650
So go to font awesome and just google for the Web site is Fonte awesome.

37

00:02:22.660  -->  00:02:24.030
I get her I.

38

00:02:24.930  -->  00:02:29.660
And all that it is is a collection of a bunch of icons.

39

00:02:29.970  -->  00:02:36.780
So let me show you if we look under icons there's a huge list of all the different icons we can use

40

00:02:38.260  -->  00:02:39.720
so you can see there.

41

00:02:40.380  -->  00:02:48.030
So we need to include this library inside of our application so we can either go to download it right

42

00:02:48.030  -->  00:02:52.740
there and click on download or we could also do a font.

43

00:02:52.740  -->  00:02:57.370
Awesome CDN and just use one of these CDN as well.

44

00:02:57.450  -->  00:02:58.710
Either one would work.

45

00:02:59.100  -->  00:03:06.030
So for variety sake since they already downloaded Jay query I will use the CD and here copy that link

46

00:03:06.030  -->  00:03:06.800
.

47

00:03:07.470  -->  00:03:15.780
Then I'll go to my index page Timo and I need to add a link tag because it is CSSA file so it's not

48

00:03:15.780  -->  00:03:23.100
actually a javascript file or a font but it's a C Ss file and I'll save and what that does is it actually

49

00:03:23.100  -->  00:03:29.540
gives me a bunch of classes that are pre-built and pre-made that I can then add to elements so I'll

50

00:03:29.550  -->  00:03:30.940
show you a few examples.

51

00:03:31.230  -->  00:03:40.740
If you wanted to use say the battery empty or battery threequarters all we need to know is that the

52

00:03:40.740  -->  00:03:47.760
class is called f a dash battery dash 3 dash courters So we need to add one just copy the code here

53

00:03:49.140  -->  00:03:51.350
somewhere into our application.

54

00:03:51.510  -->  00:03:53.400
Let's put it in the H-1.

55

00:03:53.400  -->  00:03:58.980
It's an eye tag which stands for icon and we give it a class and we don't have to put anything in here

56

00:03:58.980  -->  00:03:59.060
.

57

00:03:59.070  -->  00:04:02.560
We leave that empty and this stands Rifan awesome.

58

00:04:02.700  -->  00:04:10.890
And then this is the name of the icon and will save refresh and we now have that battery icon rather

59

00:04:10.890  -->  00:04:13.500
than the three quarter battery icon.

60

00:04:13.500  -->  00:04:20.700
We want the plus sign and the garbage can so we'll go over here and inside the H-1 will keep the icon

61

00:04:21.480  -->  00:04:28.070
and keep the f a class but we want F.A. dash plus and feel free to use your own icon.

62

00:04:28.110  -->  00:04:33.420
If you go on to find awesome and you find another one that you like because we could also use one of

63

00:04:33.420  -->  00:04:40.050
the like a pencil looking icon or a pencil and paper and if I were fresh and now have the plus sign

64

00:04:40.800  -->  00:04:48.330
which went into style and move over to the right and all we need to do for that is select it first so

65

00:04:48.330  -->  00:04:49.990
we'll select dog.

66

00:04:50.280  -->  00:05:00.000
F a dash plus and will floated right just like that and refresh and it's now over on the right site

67

00:05:00.000  -->  00:05:00.950
.

68

00:05:00.960  -->  00:05:06.250
Now let's tackle the garbage cans and we're not going to deal with the animation just yet.

69

00:05:06.300  -->  00:05:09.810
We're just going to get the garbage can to show up at all instead of an X.

70

00:05:10.260  -->  00:05:17.640
So let's go back and on our spand we're actually going to get rid of the X's and inside the span we're

71

00:05:17.640  -->  00:05:27.030
going to add another e-tag and the e-TAG is going to have a class of FAA and the name of the garbage

72

00:05:27.030  -->  00:05:38.430
can icon is FAA Dasch trash let's copy that over to the other span's and this is only for the existing

73

00:05:38.920  -->  00:05:44.520
to use when the page loads but we get three garbage cans for the new ones.

74

00:05:44.730  -->  00:05:46.280
We're still dealing with the ex.

75

00:05:46.530  -->  00:05:50.310
So then we want to go over here to our Javascript.

76

00:05:50.310  -->  00:05:54.990
And when we pen new one we don't want to append a span with X.

77

00:05:55.290  -->  00:06:00.930
You want to append an icon and we need to make sure our quotes don't interfere.

78

00:06:00.930  -->  00:06:08.290
So if we use single quotes there and save and now we should have a trash can icon inside of the span

79

00:06:08.300  -->  00:06:08.690
.

80

00:06:08.870  -->  00:06:10.830
So let's add a few new ones.

81

00:06:10.830  -->  00:06:11.650
There we go.

82

00:06:12.030  -->  00:06:15.320
And I can still click because they're still inside of a span.

83

00:06:15.450  -->  00:06:18.680
So it's an icon element instead of a span.

84

00:06:19.530  -->  00:06:22.440
So I click event still work.

85

00:06:22.470  -->  00:06:28.380
Now let's work on this simple animation and this is all done with C assess the spans here are actually

86

00:06:28.380  -->  00:06:30.210
hidden when the page loads.

87

00:06:30.210  -->  00:06:31.630
They have a wealth of zero.

88

00:06:31.860  -->  00:06:38.760
And then when I hover we're actually increasing the width to 40 pixels and then we're making it animated

89

00:06:39.030  -->  00:06:40.950
using the transition property.

90

00:06:41.430  -->  00:06:44.070
So let's go attempt some of that.

91

00:06:44.400  -->  00:06:53.850
Open up our CSSA file and the first thing we'll do is style spans so span and we're going to give them

92

00:06:54.510  -->  00:07:06.270
a background color that red color which is e 7 4 C 3 C and will refresh.

93

00:07:06.460  -->  00:07:10.820
And now we have that red background around it.

94

00:07:10.830  -->  00:07:19.470
Next thing we'll do is give them a height of 40 pixels which doesn't seem to do much yet but once we

95

00:07:19.470  -->  00:07:22.680
add in a few more properties you'll notice a difference.

96

00:07:23.250  -->  00:07:29.140
Let's add a margin to the right of 20 pixels and go back.

97

00:07:29.200  -->  00:07:34.420
Now that gives us the space that we wanted here.

98

00:07:35.550  -->  00:07:38.760
Next let's give them text align Center

99

00:07:41.970  -->  00:07:45.700
which is just a very slight difference on the spans here.

100

00:07:45.990  -->  00:07:55.110
The icons inside an important one is to make the icon too white so color white.

101

00:07:55.110  -->  00:07:55.970
All right.

102

00:07:56.220  -->  00:08:01.730
So I'm going to show you how to get them to look like this first without the animation so that they're

103

00:08:01.740  -->  00:08:02.640
always there.

104

00:08:02.930  -->  00:08:06.830
And then we'll get them to animate so that they're hidden until we hover.

105

00:08:06.870  -->  00:08:12.190
So we're getting close but we need these to take up more space vertically and horizontally.

106

00:08:12.390  -->  00:08:20.360
So I'm going to add in a with a 40 pixels that eventually we're going to set to zero and to set display

107

00:08:20.510  -->  00:08:21.990
two in line Block.

108

00:08:22.440  -->  00:08:23.950
And I refresh now.

109

00:08:24.870  -->  00:08:26.790
And that looks just right.

110

00:08:26.790  -->  00:08:29.460
So the next thing is to do the animation.

111

00:08:29.760  -->  00:08:33.630
And the way that that works we're actually going to set the width to be zero.

112

00:08:33.780  -->  00:08:40.410
So all of these spans have with a zero until I hover over an ally and then we increase that with to

113

00:08:40.410  -->  00:08:42.420
be 40 on that span.

114

00:08:42.870  -->  00:08:44.580
So let's do that now.

115

00:08:45.020  -->  00:08:53.370
I'm going to set with zero and then when we hover over an ally and not just the span but when we hover

116

00:08:53.370  -->  00:08:54.810
over an ally

117

00:08:57.930  -->  00:09:02.480
we want to select the span that's inside of an ally that's being hovered over.

118

00:09:02.790  -->  00:09:08.020
Then we're going to set with to be 40 pixels just like that.

119

00:09:08.070  -->  00:09:11.310
And let's go back to our own version and refresh.

120

00:09:11.670  -->  00:09:13.920
You can see that the spans are now gone.

121

00:09:14.310  -->  00:09:19.330
And when I hover over and fly the span appears and the button works.

122

00:09:19.800  -->  00:09:25.470
So the next feature is getting it to animate so that it doesn't just appear instantly and to do that

123

00:09:25.800  -->  00:09:27.860
we'll just use the transition property.

124

00:09:28.170  -->  00:09:38.340
So on the span we're going to add transition zero point two seconds and we'll make it linear which just

125

00:09:38.340  -->  00:09:43.680
refers to the easing which means that it will move at a constant speed.

126

00:09:43.680  -->  00:09:44.520
And there we go.

127

00:09:44.520  -->  00:09:46.680
We have our nice animation.

128

00:09:47.250  -->  00:09:54.420
There is one small item that does bother me here which is that the icon still shows even when the span

129

00:09:54.420  -->  00:09:56.110
is zero pixels wide.

130

00:09:56.340  -->  00:09:59.970
So it's really hard to see but watch the icon here.

131

00:09:59.970  -->  00:10:03.230
It's still there even when I'm not hovering over it.

132

00:10:03.240  -->  00:10:11.040
So what we'll do is just set the opacity on the span to be zero and then set it to be one when we hover

133

00:10:11.040  -->  00:10:11.210
.

134

00:10:11.370  -->  00:10:17.580
So opacity zero and then opacity 1.0 when we hover.

135

00:10:18.420  -->  00:10:19.840
And that should take care of it.

136

00:10:19.860  -->  00:10:22.370
So now we can't see the icons.

137

00:10:22.500  -->  00:10:28.680
There it is and then it disappears and it fades out as well because the transition property is affecting

138

00:10:28.950  -->  00:10:29.790
everything.

139

00:10:30.120  -->  00:10:34.740
So let's make it 2.2 seconds and I'll show you.

140

00:10:35.640  -->  00:10:40.810
Notice how it fades in and then fades out.

141

00:10:40.890  -->  00:10:42.560
So that's a very slow version.

142

00:10:43.200  -->  00:10:46.830
And we'll just do 0.2.

143

00:10:47.070  -->  00:10:53.250
There is one small annoying thing that we have left which is if you look really closely here or increase

144

00:10:53.250  -->  00:10:59.530
the size there is a small gap between the input and then this list the UL.

145

00:11:00.060  -->  00:11:03.810
But the gap goes away when I focus there now flush.

146

00:11:04.200  -->  00:11:07.220
And then when I am not focused it comes back.

147

00:11:07.500  -->  00:11:13.450
So to fix that we're going to add a small border that's invisible actually it's going to have a color

148

00:11:13.530  -->  00:11:23.340
just a small border of R.G. be 0 0 0 0 0 0 which we'll just take up the same space as our border does

149

00:11:23.340  -->  00:11:24.690
when we're focused.

150

00:11:25.080  -->  00:11:34.560
So we'll go back and like the input which we have here and give it a border of three pixel solid R-Ga.

151

00:11:35.150  -->  00:11:38.640
zero zero zero zero.

152

00:11:39.210  -->  00:11:41.770
So that will end up giving us an invisible border.

153

00:11:41.880  -->  00:11:47.420
But notice here I'll refresh right now that little gap goes away.

154

00:11:47.850  -->  00:11:53.580
So now not only is the border flush when we have it focused but there's also a border that it helps

155

00:11:53.580  -->  00:11:56.000
us make it flush that we don't actually see
