00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:01.110
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.350  -->  00:00:05.400
In this video we'll be recapping what we've learned in the past couple of videos.

3

00:00:05.550  -->  00:00:10.530
We learned that object oriented programming is a model based on objects which are constructed from some

4

00:00:10.530  -->  00:00:17.130
kind of blueprint in languages that had built in support for O.P. we call these blueprints classes and

5

00:00:17.130  -->  00:00:23.190
the objects created from them instances since we do not have built in class support in javascript.

6

00:00:23.190  -->  00:00:29.130
We mimic the functionality of classes by using functions to create objects through the use of constructor

7

00:00:29.130  -->  00:00:31.220
functions and the new keyword.

8

00:00:31.380  -->  00:00:36.540
We also saw that the new keyword does four things creates an object out of thin air.

9

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:43.420
It sets the value of the keyword this to be that object created in the previous step it adds or return

10

00:00:43.440  -->  00:00:45.490
this to the constructor function.

11

00:00:45.660  -->  00:00:51.720
And finally it sets a property on the object which we can access called Dunder Prato.

12

00:00:51.930  -->  00:00:55.230
We'll talk much more about that in the next video.

13

00:00:55.270  -->  00:01:02.040
Finally we can refactor duplication if multiple constructor functions share properties by invoking another

14

00:01:02.040  -->  00:01:08.310
constructor function and using call or apply to set the value of the keyword this to be the correct

15

00:01:08.400  -->  00:01:12.960
object created from the constructor function in the next video.

16

00:01:12.990  -->  00:01:18.320
We'll examine a property on functions called prototype and dive even deeper into what the new keyword

17

00:01:18.330  -->  00:01:19.170
does.

18

00:01:19.230  -->  00:01:19.990
See.
