00:00:00.780  -->  00:00:05.100
So in this video we're going to learn about a few more HDMI elements that are pretty common.

2

00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:11.970
So we've seen how to write comments we've seen head and body doc type in HCM owl as well as H-1.

3

00:00:11.970  -->  00:00:15.710
Now we're going to learn about a bunch more things that can go in the body.

4

00:00:15.840  -->  00:00:20.100
So in the slides there's a little cheat sheet here of some of the things that we're going to cover so

5

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:22.170
we'll be referring back to this in a little bit.

6

00:00:22.350  -->  00:00:26.430
But before then I want to show you the MT-NW element reference.

7

00:00:26.430  -->  00:00:28.170
So this link is in the description.

8

00:00:28.170  -->  00:00:29.730
It's also in the slides.

9

00:00:29.730  -->  00:00:36.480
You could also just get there by googling M.D. n element reference and it's basically a web page that

10

00:00:36.480  -->  00:00:39.140
lists all the elements in HMO.

11

00:00:39.210  -->  00:00:45.270
So some people are surprised at how many there are other people other students that I've heard are surprised

12

00:00:45.570  -->  00:00:48.260
at how few there are there is around.

13

00:00:48.330  -->  00:00:49.360
And this is just a guess.

14

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:53.500
I haven't counted but around a hundred or so this page has all of them.

15

00:00:53.520  -->  00:00:59.410
You can read about every single one so you know we could search for body and we could read about body

16

00:00:59.420  -->  00:01:01.100
of which we've already done.

17

00:01:01.340  -->  00:01:03.970
What I want to show you though is that there are a ton here.

18

00:01:04.110  -->  00:01:07.880
There are probably 10 to 15 that you will use all the time.

19

00:01:07.950  -->  00:01:13.230
I'd say if you do about half of these in the last few months none of these really what I'm trying to

20

00:01:13.230  -->  00:01:16.890
say is there's a lot of things here don't feel like you need to know all of this.

21

00:01:16.890  -->  00:01:21.010
This is one of those times where I'm going to tell you it's not about memorization.

22

00:01:21.300  -->  00:01:25.140
Let's go back to our H-1 and let's do a little bit of reading about once.

23

00:01:25.350  -->  00:01:32.280
So I'm just going to search on here for each one quick on the corresponding link and basically an H1

24

00:01:32.520  -->  00:01:36.640
down to an age six are the six levels of document headings.

25

00:01:36.780  -->  00:01:41.970
So in each one is going to be the most important heading on your page it's the largest heading down

26

00:01:41.970  -->  00:01:46.450
to an age 6 which is still a heading but it's the least important heading.

27

00:01:47.130  -->  00:01:53.340
So you can see there's an example here H1 H2 which three all the way down to age six.

28

00:01:53.340  -->  00:01:55.640
This is the resulting age to a male.

29

00:01:56.400  -->  00:02:00.850
So here's another example here where we've got some H1 and some other tags.

30

00:02:00.960  -->  00:02:04.110
And we end up with this heading element.

31

00:02:05.370  -->  00:02:07.860
Well go ahead and make a few more h ones.

32

00:02:07.890  -->  00:02:10.570
Sorry a few more Hedding elements will do in H-2.

33

00:02:10.800  -->  00:02:11.790
We won't do all of them

34

00:02:16.330  -->  00:02:21.460
and we'll do one more.

35

00:02:23.820  -->  00:02:27.150
And let's change this to be an age three.

36

00:02:27.300  -->  00:02:28.510
Let's do actually in age six.

37

00:02:28.510  -->  00:02:32.960
You can see how small they get and let's save it.

38

00:02:32.960  -->  00:02:39.870
Go ahead and open up our page again and you can see that we have a large Hedding slightly smaller heading

39

00:02:39.880  -->  00:02:40.090
.

40

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:43.190
And this absolute smallest heading that we can go.

41

00:02:43.230  -->  00:02:49.380
So one other thing about H-1 and other headings is that they are something called the block level elements

42

00:02:49.380  -->  00:02:49.530
.

43

00:02:49.530  -->  00:02:53.800
So what that means is each one gets its own line.

44

00:02:54.870  -->  00:03:01.140
So even if I put them on the same line and I refresh the page every one of them gets a separate line

45

00:03:01.140  -->  00:03:04.450
and pushes everything after it to a new line.

46

00:03:04.470  -->  00:03:05.920
So this is important.

47

00:03:06.030  -->  00:03:10.350
This will come up because there are going to be other elements that do not behave this way and those

48

00:03:10.350  -->  00:03:12.010
are called inline elements.

49

00:03:12.200  -->  00:03:14.010
OK so you undo that.

50

00:03:14.040  -->  00:03:15.930
Make sure we have this spaced correctly.

51

00:03:15.930  -->  00:03:18.960
Let's go ahead and add some text here.

52

00:03:19.500  -->  00:03:26.480
So I'm going to let's say that this is just a little bios I'm going to put some text here.

53

00:03:26.700  -->  00:03:29.140
This is some text.

54

00:03:29.160  -->  00:03:30.230
Blah blah blah.

55

00:03:30.390  -->  00:03:34.470
And this I just want to be regular text.

56

00:03:34.470  -->  00:03:41.090
I don't want it to be big or highlighted or anything so I could just write text like this.

57

00:03:41.400  -->  00:03:45.060
Can I add a bunch more here.

58

00:03:46.800  -->  00:03:47.990
And I refresh my page.

59

00:03:48.050  -->  00:03:54.270
I get this giant thing of text on one line but let's say that I realize I actually want a line break

60

00:03:54.270  -->  00:03:54.930
right here.

61

00:03:54.930  -->  00:04:00.450
These are two paragraphs of nonsense to do that I can use the paragraph tag.

62

00:04:00.810  -->  00:04:03.720
So if you went back here and we search for the tag

63

00:04:09.300  -->  00:04:16.170
you'll see that the tag is just used to represent a paragraph of text and paragraphs are block level

64

00:04:16.200  -->  00:04:17.040
elements.

65

00:04:17.040  -->  00:04:20.860
So that means that they also go on their own line.

66

00:04:21.030  -->  00:04:22.620
So let's add a paragraph in here.

67

00:04:22.650  -->  00:04:28.080
So I want to split here and here sorry here.

68

00:04:28.080  -->  00:04:31.770
So I just wrap this in a paragraph tag like so

69

00:04:35.160  -->  00:04:39.030
and then I'll add another paragraph tag in front of this

70

00:04:42.750  -->  00:04:50.470
and afterwards there we go make sure we save it and we refresh.

71

00:04:50.790  -->  00:04:54.740
And now we have two paragraphs that are on separate lines.

72

00:04:55.140  -->  00:04:56.510
So let me go and get syntax.

73

00:04:56.520  -->  00:04:57.780
Let's just do Lorem Ipsum

74

00:05:00.930  -->  00:05:08.160
go to a generator and let's just pull a bunch of text here and copy this over so you can see may have

75

00:05:08.160  -->  00:05:13.140
something longer like that.

76

00:05:13.140  -->  00:05:17.640
It's actually a paragraph so it's not just one line but it's a paragraph and it has spacing after it

77

00:05:17.850  -->  00:05:20.200
before the next paragraph.

78

00:05:20.220  -->  00:05:25.710
So now that I have my paragraph here let's suppose that I wanted to make some text stand out I want

79

00:05:25.710  -->  00:05:32.420
to italicize the title of a book or I want to bold a key word for instance.

80

00:05:32.460  -->  00:05:36.190
So there are ways of doing that with each team I'll I'll show you one here.

81

00:05:36.360  -->  00:05:40.050
Let's say I want to make simply dummy text bolded.

82

00:05:40.260  -->  00:05:51.090
So to do that I could write a B tag around it and as I mentioned earlier this is actually not the best

83

00:05:51.090  -->  00:05:52.570
way of doing this anymore.

84

00:05:52.580  -->  00:05:56.040
We're going to show it to you here briefly just so you can see it.

85

00:05:56.040  -->  00:06:00.600
So I refresh the page and you can see simply dummy text is bold.

86

00:06:00.870  -->  00:06:05.270
And more importantly or equally importantly it doesn't take up a new line.

87

00:06:05.340  -->  00:06:06.800
It's still in line.

88

00:06:07.050  -->  00:06:11.640
So there is something called a block level element which we talked about these take up their own block

89

00:06:11.640  -->  00:06:12.100
level.

90

00:06:12.120  -->  00:06:18.900
This paragraph does this takes up its own block and there are inline elements that just slip in and

91

00:06:18.900  -->  00:06:22.140
won't actually force something down to a new line.

92

00:06:22.800  -->  00:06:26.840
So if we go back I did say it's not really the best way of doing it anymore.

93

00:06:26.940  -->  00:06:30.780
We're going to talk about that in a feature video about semantic markup basically.

94

00:06:30.790  -->  00:06:35.010
And each time at 5 your email now needs to be meaningful.

95

00:06:35.010  -->  00:06:40.160
So by simply saying something is bold it doesn't really say anything about the text.

96

00:06:40.170  -->  00:06:42.700
So rather there are a few options.

97

00:06:42.720  -->  00:06:48.900
The most common one is to use strong and so strong has a little pull a little bit more meaning it will

98

00:06:48.900  -->  00:06:50.420
do exactly the same thing.

99

00:06:50.430  -->  00:06:57.030
You will not notice a difference here but the idea is that by saying this is strong rather than bold

100

00:06:57.360  -->  00:06:59.470
that means something a little bit more.

101

00:06:59.610  -->  00:07:03.760
So you'll see in the future video really what this semantic markup is all about.

102

00:07:03.780  -->  00:07:05.540
What a shame all 5 is trying to do.

103

00:07:05.580  -->  00:07:08.940
But for now just know those are two ways of making something unfold.

104

00:07:08.950  -->  00:07:12.050
Likewise there are few ways if I talus using some text.

105

00:07:12.090  -->  00:07:17.010
So if I want to italicised Lorem Ipsum I could do the I tag

106

00:07:19.980  -->  00:07:27.240
you can see I have I tell Assayas form ipsum there but the better way of doing it is using the E-M tag

107

00:07:27.390  -->  00:07:32.170
which is for emphasis and it looks exactly the same.

108

00:07:32.340  -->  00:07:37.970
And the idea again is that emphasis means something more rather than just saying I.

109

00:07:38.220  -->  00:07:41.230
So we want to separate and this is what my five did.

110

00:07:41.310  -->  00:07:44.650
We want to separate our styling from our structure.

111

00:07:44.910  -->  00:07:49.920
So by saying something should be italicized or bolded that's actually the styling of it.

112

00:07:50.310  -->  00:07:56.130
But by saying something is stronger or something is emphasized that's not how it's styled or how it

113

00:07:56.130  -->  00:07:57.180
looks.

114

00:07:57.300  -->  00:08:00.830
That is more about the structure of it and what it means.

115

00:08:00.960  -->  00:08:05.150
So in summary we've got H-1 386.

116

00:08:05.310  -->  00:08:07.200
These are block level elements.

117

00:08:07.320  -->  00:08:09.920
We've got paragraph's which are also block level.

118

00:08:09.930  -->  00:08:15.790
They take up their own line and then we've got strong and E-M or emphasis.

119

00:08:16.080  -->  00:08:20.470
And these are inline elements that let us build our italicize things.

120

00:08:20.760  -->  00:08:25.050
But really what they do is call something out for being strong or being emphasized.

121

00:08:25.080  -->  00:08:28.680
And our browser just decides to make it italicised or make it bold
