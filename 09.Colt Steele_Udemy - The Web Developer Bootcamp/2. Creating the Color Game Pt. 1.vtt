00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:00.390
All right.

2

00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:01.190
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01.350  -->  00:00:06.450
In the next few videos we're going to focus on building a substantial application something that has

4

00:00:06.450  -->  00:00:12.570
a lot of moving pieces longer h t m l more CSSA a lot of styling and most importantly a lot of dominant

5

00:00:12.570  -->  00:00:18.260
population and event handly what we're going to build is an R.G. be colored guessing game.

6

00:00:18.510  -->  00:00:23.820
So it's not only a great demonstration of how all these pieces fit together but it's also a really nice

7

00:00:23.820  -->  00:00:24.980
tool for you to have.

8

00:00:24.990  -->  00:00:30.510
And for you to practice R.G. be colors because the RGV color system is a little bit unintuitive at first

9

00:00:30.510  -->  00:00:30.790
.

10

00:00:30.810  -->  00:00:35.300
It's very different than most color systems that people are used to working with.

11

00:00:35.310  -->  00:00:36.860
So let me show you how it works.

12

00:00:36.870  -->  00:00:40.330
We load up the page and we get six random colors here.

13

00:00:40.530  -->  00:00:41.750
These are always different.

14

00:00:41.850  -->  00:00:47.150
And one of those colors is listed up here the name of the color in our GP.

15

00:00:47.250  -->  00:00:50.330
And our job is to pick which one.

16

00:00:50.340  -->  00:00:57.390
Remember that there are three channels red green and blue and each one ranges from 0 to 255 and all

17

00:00:57.390  -->  00:01:01.020
that we need are those three colors to make every single color that we could ever want.

18

00:01:01.170  -->  00:01:07.940
Black white yellow orange purple all of those are actually made by combining red green and blue.

19

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:09.410
So if we take a look.

20

00:01:09.570  -->  00:01:13.850
I have Wikipedia open we can see how additive color mixing works in this diagram.

21

00:01:13.920  -->  00:01:21.330
So we have red green and blue and to make yellow we actually combine red and green which is maybe a

22

00:01:21.330  -->  00:01:24.650
little different than what you're expected to make magenta.

23

00:01:25.170  -->  00:01:26.730
It's blue and red.

24

00:01:26.940  -->  00:01:31.340
And to make Cyan is light blue color it's green and blue.

25

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:34.810
And then lastly to make white we combine all three.

26

00:01:34.810  -->  00:01:38.170
So here's another diagram done here that makes it a little easier.

27

00:01:38.190  -->  00:01:44.850
We have red green and blue and then magenta yellow cyan and white and then no color is black.

28

00:01:45.000  -->  00:01:49.640
So if we go back we can use that to try and figure out what color this is.

29

00:01:49.920  -->  00:01:54.860
So if we take a look we have a bunch of red almost all red.

30

00:01:55.140  -->  00:02:00.660
Up to 255 so almost There are a lot of green and very little blue.

31

00:02:00.840  -->  00:02:06.960
So a lot of red in a lot of green if you remember from this chart red and green makes yellow.

32

00:02:07.260  -->  00:02:11.670
So if we had 255 red 255 green it would look like this.

33

00:02:11.970  -->  00:02:16.290
But we have less than 255 so it's not going to be as bright.

34

00:02:16.320  -->  00:02:17.440
So let's go back.

35

00:02:17.700  -->  00:02:22.860
Hopefully you can tell which one is the correct answer based off of the diagram we just looked at but

36

00:02:22.860  -->  00:02:25.790
I'm going to guess something wrong first to show you what happens.

37

00:02:25.800  -->  00:02:27.450
So this one is definitely wrong.

38

00:02:27.450  -->  00:02:29.970
This is all red and very little green.

39

00:02:30.360  -->  00:02:33.900
I click and it goes away and it tells me try again.

40

00:02:33.900  -->  00:02:36.750
So let's keep guessing some wrong ones like that one.

41

00:02:36.750  -->  00:02:37.690
This one's wrong.

42

00:02:37.860  -->  00:02:38.770
This one's wrong.

43

00:02:38.990  -->  00:02:39.270
OK.

44

00:02:39.270  -->  00:02:41.000
Knowledge's guess the correct one.

45

00:02:41.130  -->  00:02:43.140
Red and green it's going to be very yellow.

46

00:02:43.320  -->  00:02:44.370
So this is correct.

47

00:02:44.520  -->  00:02:48.120
I'll click and notice that all six squares come back.

48

00:02:48.150  -->  00:02:53.080
They all change to the correct color and our background appear changes to be the correct color as well

49

00:02:53.090  -->  00:02:53.520
.

50

00:02:53.760  -->  00:02:59.070
And to get a message that says correct and if I want I can click on play again and that will generate

51

00:02:59.070  -->  00:03:00.000
new colors.

52

00:03:00.210  -->  00:03:05.680
My screen goes back to blue up here and I get six new squares and a new random color here.

53

00:03:06.270  -->  00:03:08.870
And then what I can also do is change the difficulty.

54

00:03:08.910  -->  00:03:12.690
So if I want easier I only have three colors to pick from.

55

00:03:12.810  -->  00:03:18.990
This can get a little bit challenging when we have all refresh a few times like here we have two shades

56

00:03:18.990  -->  00:03:20.510
of blue that are very similar.

57

00:03:20.520  -->  00:03:25.080
Now after you play this game for a while you should be able to determine which one is correct based

58

00:03:25.080  -->  00:03:27.980
off of these three pink shades or these two blue shades.

59

00:03:28.020  -->  00:03:29.220
And that's really the point here.

60

00:03:29.340  -->  00:03:32.520
But to start out you might just want two colors to pick from.

61

00:03:32.520  -->  00:03:33.420
So here's another one.

62

00:03:33.510  -->  00:03:35.290
Let's do it a little bit of red.

63

00:03:35.310  -->  00:03:36.470
Almost no red.

64

00:03:36.690  -->  00:03:37.800
A little bit of green.

65

00:03:37.830  -->  00:03:38.560
Not very much.

66

00:03:38.670  -->  00:03:42.890
And a lot of blue of course it's going to give us very pure blue.

67

00:03:43.380  -->  00:03:44.690
Let's go back to hard mode.

68

00:03:44.700  -->  00:03:50.760
One other point that I'll show here is that it's a responsive site so I can resize it and my squares

69

00:03:50.760  -->  00:03:52.830
move to the middle.

70

00:03:52.830  -->  00:03:54.870
Watch this little naff bar here.

71

00:03:54.870  -->  00:03:59.060
The space between them on the sides will increase and decrease.

72

00:03:59.130  -->  00:04:03.290
And if I have a message so let's click on one of these That's wrong.

73

00:04:03.780  -->  00:04:04.880
I get try again.

74

00:04:05.100  -->  00:04:08.140
Notice how these move closer together.

75

00:04:08.820  -->  00:04:11.950
And then I can move them apart and we get some more spacing in there.

76

00:04:12.270  -->  00:04:16.970
So to wrap up before we actually start creating it I just want to summarize a few things.

77

00:04:17.220  -->  00:04:22.260
It's going to be a pretty large app to be a lot of javascript about a hundred ish lines quite a bit

78

00:04:22.260  -->  00:04:25.130
of success as well and some aged him too.

79

00:04:25.200  -->  00:04:29.580
We're going to start kind of bare bones very little styling and we're just going to get the functionality

80

00:04:29.580  -->  00:04:33.030
going and then we'll go and add some styling on top of it.

81

00:04:33.030  -->  00:04:34.160
The other thing.

82

00:04:34.530  -->  00:04:40.110
And then once we finish it hopefully you can use this quite often to brush up on your R.G. skills even

83

00:04:40.110  -->  00:04:45.820
just making this for the course has helped me quite a bit to brush up on some of my RGV skills.

84

00:04:45.870  -->  00:04:49.280
I've noticed that I tend to rely too much on RGV colored pickers.

85

00:04:49.410  -->  00:04:54.680
So this is great for me as well to get some practice and to remind myself how RGV works.

86

00:04:55.080  -->  00:04:56.970
So the next video we're going to start writing some code
