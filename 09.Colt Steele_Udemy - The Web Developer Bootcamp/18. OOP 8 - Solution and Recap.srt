00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:01,240
So how did you do.

2

00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:03,770
Here's a solution for the previous problem.

3

00:00:03,900  -->  00:00:09,270
I'm placing all of the properties that I do not want shared for each object inside of the constructor

4

00:00:09,270  -->  00:00:15,930
function and moving all of my functions that I want each object to have inside the vehicle prototype

5

00:00:15,920  -->  00:00:16,830
.

6

00:00:16,860  -->  00:00:20,450
If you didn't get this one watch the previous couple of videos and try it again.

7

00:00:20,460  -->  00:00:22,200
This stuff takes practice.

8

00:00:22,440  -->  00:00:23,490
To summarize.

9

00:00:23,490  -->  00:00:29,190
We saw that every time the new keyword is used a dunder Prato property is added to the object created

10

00:00:29,220  -->  00:00:31,740
from the constructor function.

11

00:00:31,870  -->  00:00:37,380
The Dondre produce property links the object created from the constructor function to the prototype

12

00:00:37,380  -->  00:00:39,960
property on the constructor function.

13

00:00:39,960  -->  00:00:45,720
This link allows objects created from the constructor function to access methods and properties on the

14

00:00:45,720  -->  00:00:47,520
prototype object.

15

00:00:47,730  -->  00:00:53,310
The prototype property also contains a property called constructor which points back to the constructor

16

00:00:53,310  -->  00:00:54,390
function.

17

00:00:54,390  -->  00:01:00,240
Finally we should always strive to place properties and methods that we want to share among all of our

18

00:01:00,240  -->  00:01:03,600
objects created from a constructor in the prototype.

19

00:01:03,720  -->  00:01:09,750
As these properties and methods only need to be defined once and not redefined for every single object

20

00:01:09,750  -->  00:01:11,580
.

21

00:01:11,580  -->  00:01:14,560
Thanks again for watching the series on object oriented programming.

22

00:01:14,850  -->  00:01:18,010
As always if you have any questions be sure to let us know.
