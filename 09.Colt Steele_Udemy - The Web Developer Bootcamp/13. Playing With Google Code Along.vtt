1

00:00:01.470  -->  00:00:02.790
OK welcome back.

2

00:00:02.790  -->  00:00:05.340
So this video is going to be a little bit different.

3

00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:09.750
We're not going introduce any new ways of manipulating the dom but we're going to take what we've learned

4

00:00:09.780  -->  00:00:11.410
and do a little bit of a code along.

5

00:00:11.640  -->  00:00:13.860
So we're going to play with Google's home page.

6

00:00:13.950  -->  00:00:18.990
So I recommend that you open up Google either do this together with me or you do this on your own after

7

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:20.080
you watch the video.

8

00:00:20.340  -->  00:00:23.780
And we're going to just do some fun things like change the logo.

9

00:00:23.940  -->  00:00:28.530
We'll do a picture of a kitten this time just to be fair to all those cat lovers will change all the

10

00:00:28.530  -->  00:00:32.220
links so that they go to being dot com or something like that.

11

00:00:32.250  -->  00:00:37.410
The one point that I do want to emphasize in this lesson is that we can use a loop to manipulate multiple

12

00:00:37.410  -->  00:00:42.810
elements so we don't always have to select one thing and change its color or select one image and change

13

00:00:42.810  -->  00:00:43.710
its source.

14

00:00:43.770  -->  00:00:49.440
We can select all the images and then loop through that list and for each one change its source.

15

00:00:49.470  -->  00:00:51.080
So I'm going to show you how I would do that here.

16

00:00:51.300  -->  00:00:52.790
So we'll start simple.

17

00:00:53.100  -->  00:00:55.050
Let's start by selecting this logo.

18

00:00:55.380  -->  00:01:00.480
And a quick side note if you are on Google on a day where they have a Google Doodle instead of this

19

00:01:00.480  -->  00:01:01.730
regular logo.

20

00:01:01.860  -->  00:01:03.640
It might not be an image here.

21

00:01:03.780  -->  00:01:06.850
Sometimes they have fancy animations or interactive games.

22

00:01:06.930  -->  00:01:10.390
And in that case they might be something like a canvas element.

23

00:01:10.470  -->  00:01:14.980
So if you do encounter that when you inspect That's all right you can just watch this part.

24

00:01:15.010  -->  00:01:19.650
We've already seen how to change image sources but I just want to show that you can do it on anybody's

25

00:01:19.690  -->  00:01:22.100
website so select it.

26

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:26.680
It's an image and it has an ID so that makes it easy.

27

00:01:26.850  -->  00:01:28.290
HP logo.

28

00:01:28.410  -->  00:01:34.100
So let's select that let's call it our logo equals document that query selector

29

00:01:37.320  -->  00:01:38.660
HP logo.

30

00:01:38.880  -->  00:01:42.090
And of course we could have used element by ID as well.

31

00:01:42.390  -->  00:01:46.210
So we end up with Logo equal to that.

32

00:01:46.320  -->  00:01:47.890
So we've now selected that.

33

00:01:48.030  -->  00:01:51.540
And if we want to change the image we gonna change the source.

34

00:01:51.540  -->  00:01:55.530
We need to use set attribute and I have just the image here.

35

00:01:56.190  -->  00:01:57.650
Nice kitten.

36

00:01:57.660  -->  00:01:59.070
So I'm going to take this Kidan you are.

37

00:01:59.060  -->  00:02:04.540
I'll copy that and I'm going to update the source of this logo to do that.

38

00:02:04.650  -->  00:02:10.210
Do logo dot set attribute instead of fear.

39

00:02:10.380  -->  00:02:12.630
We're going to just write source.

40

00:02:12.810  -->  00:02:20.420
And the second argument is the new source and I hit enter and I get my nice little cat Roquette appear

41

00:02:20.410  -->  00:02:21.160
.

42

00:02:21.210  -->  00:02:22.760
You might get a message like this.

43

00:02:22.860  -->  00:02:24.720
Depending on the image you use.

44

00:02:24.900  -->  00:02:26.770
So I'll briefly explain what this is.

45

00:02:26.910  -->  00:02:33.300
It's just mentioning that we are on a page loaded with TTP as you can see that appear and the image

46

00:02:33.300  -->  00:02:36.470
that I set the source to B is H TTP.

47

00:02:36.570  -->  00:02:40.700
And to make it short HTP is more secure than HGP.

48

00:02:40.710  -->  00:02:46.400
So it's complaining that it should be all HTP Yes we shouldn't be using something less secure.

49

00:02:46.410  -->  00:02:49.560
That's a really simple version but it still lets us do it.

50

00:02:49.560  -->  00:02:53.630
It's not a huge problem for what we're just trying to do here just playing around with Google.

51

00:02:53.670  -->  00:02:58.020
It is something though that you would want to consider if you doing something like this in your own

52

00:02:58.020  -->  00:03:00.990
application and it would be a problem then.

53

00:03:01.020  -->  00:03:03.070
So back to the content here.

54

00:03:03.280  -->  00:03:09.330
Found to change the width and height of this cat so that it takes up the same amount of space that the

55

00:03:09.570  -->  00:03:11.230
original Google logo did.

56

00:03:11.460  -->  00:03:19.800
I can see actually that the height was 92 originally and with was two hundred and seventy two.

57

00:03:20.280  -->  00:03:22.130
And so that's what's happening here.

58

00:03:22.170  -->  00:03:31.510
You can see if I want to change this I can do something like this logo dot style dot with and takes

59

00:03:31.530  -->  00:03:36.300
a string and just change that to be 500 pixels.

60

00:03:36.810  -->  00:03:39.720
You can see it stretches out and I can do the same thing.

61

00:03:39.750  -->  00:03:41.530
Change it to be a thousand pixels.

62

00:03:41.970  -->  00:03:45.750
Get a nice stretch kitty and we can change the width.

63

00:03:45.870  -->  00:03:51.900
I mean the height and let's make that 500 or poor cat.

64

00:03:51.900  -->  00:03:55.410
It's just getting stretched all over the place.

65

00:03:55.590  -->  00:03:59.550
So let's go ahead and reset the height to something a little bit more appropriate.

66

00:03:59.730  -->  00:04:06.690
Let's go for the height to be about 100 pixels and the width

67

00:04:09.960  -->  00:04:13.070
to be about 200.

68

00:04:13.080  -->  00:04:16.590
All right so that will work for us for now just for some more practice.

69

00:04:16.590  -->  00:04:26.040
Let's also give it a border around that image so logo that style border equals and we will do a two

70

00:04:26.040  -->  00:04:34.130
pixel solid purple border and there is our wonderful partner around that image.

71

00:04:34.410  -->  00:04:39.690
OK so now let's move on to what I introduced at the beginning of the video which is selecting a bunch

72

00:04:39.690  -->  00:04:45.750
of elements at once and using a loop to manipulate them rather than having to do it individually.

73

00:04:45.750  -->  00:04:48.980
So what we're going to do is select all of the anchor tags on the page.

74

00:04:48.990  -->  00:04:50.740
There's a lot of links on this page.

75

00:04:50.820  -->  00:04:56.600
We're going to take each one and change the ref attribute to go to some other web site rather than wherever

76

00:04:56.610  -->  00:04:57.290
they go.

77

00:04:57.510  -->  00:05:02.830
So to start we need to select all the anchor tags so we have a bunch of ways of doing that.

78

00:05:02.880  -->  00:05:07.170
I'm going to call it links are links and we will do document.

79

00:05:07.170  -->  00:05:15.540
We could do a query letter all but I'm going to do get elements by tag name anchor tag and if we look

80

00:05:15.540  -->  00:05:23.470
at links you can see we get quite a few on this page so we're going to loop through this.

81

00:05:23.550  -->  00:05:35.070
We can't just do links dot set attribute that doesn't exist tells us link starts at attribute it's not

82

00:05:35.070  -->  00:05:35.750
a function.

83

00:05:35.880  -->  00:05:40.860
And that's because said attribute only exists on individual elements and links.

84

00:05:40.860  -->  00:05:42.640
Is this collection of nodes.

85

00:05:42.750  -->  00:05:47.960
So I need to loop through it just like I would loop through any other array like object.

86

00:05:48.330  -->  00:05:51.590
So I can't use for each because it's not a real array.

87

00:05:51.660  -->  00:05:54.880
So I need to use a for loop or technically I could use a while loop.

88

00:05:54.900  -->  00:05:56.310
Most people would use a for loop.

89

00:05:56.490  -->  00:06:05.640
So for are equals zero is less than links that length and will add 1

90

00:06:08.700  -->  00:06:14.160
and then inside the loop we're going to access each individual link links Hi.

91

00:06:14.340  -->  00:06:18.040
And let's start by just printing out its text content.

92

00:06:18.060  -->  00:06:22.850
So links that text content and we'll cancel that log that.

93

00:06:24.090  -->  00:06:28.710
So this is a common pattern looping through a bunch of elements and doing something maybe not printing

94

00:06:28.710  -->  00:06:35.140
it out in the console but displaying it somehow or changing something about it changing its color.

95

00:06:35.420  -->  00:06:40.050
So we hit enter and you can see this is the text content of all of the links on the page.

96

00:06:40.200  -->  00:06:46.320
So we get you know things like photos and translate Google plus drive play YouTube all those links are

97

00:06:46.320  -->  00:06:50.460
somewhere on this page which makes sense seeing that it's Google's home page.

98

00:06:50.520  -->  00:06:56.460
So rather than just print things out in a hit the up arrow and go back to this loop and let's actually

99

00:06:56.460  -->  00:07:02.190
start by changing the style so that we can see the lengths easier let's make them a different color

100

00:07:02.610  -->  00:07:05.570
and let's make them have a border around them.

101

00:07:05.910  -->  00:07:14.520
So I'm going to get rid of my console that log and I'm going to do lynx I style and we'll change the

102

00:07:15.150  -->  00:07:19.990
background to start and let's make that a pink.

103

00:07:20.800  -->  00:07:25.050
And if we hit enter you can see I'll close the console.

104

00:07:25.080  -->  00:07:27.790
All the links on the page are now Pink.

105

00:07:27.810  -->  00:07:29.120
I have a background that's pink.

106

00:07:29.280  -->  00:07:31.680
So this thing right here is a link.

107

00:07:31.750  -->  00:07:34.490
All of these naff are items in the sign in button.

108

00:07:34.830  -->  00:07:35.890
It's also a link.

109

00:07:36.270  -->  00:07:37.910
So let's do one more thing.

110

00:07:38.010  -->  00:07:39.140
Let's loop through again.

111

00:07:39.210  -->  00:07:43.870
Hit the up arrow and let's do a few things so let's do style.

112

00:07:43.910  -->  00:07:52.060
Border equals one pixel and let's do dasht purple.

113

00:07:52.410  -->  00:08:04.980
And on the next line links I style and let's change the color to be orange.

114

00:08:05.520  -->  00:08:07.880
So those two hit enter.

115

00:08:07.890  -->  00:08:14.820
And you can see we get these really beautiful links on our page pink background tiny purple border not

116

00:08:14.820  -->  00:08:16.010
just a regular border.

117

00:08:16.110  -->  00:08:18.090
It's dasht very fancy.

118

00:08:18.180  -->  00:08:20.610
And we get some orange text in there as well.

119

00:08:21.240  -->  00:08:26.730
But if we click them you can see that the traps haven't yet changed and that makes sense because we

120

00:08:26.730  -->  00:08:27.640
haven't changed them.

121

00:08:27.750  -->  00:08:31.230
So I want to change them all to go to WDW.

122

00:08:31.270  -->  00:08:36.590
Being dot com needs to go to the con. And I already have my links selected.

123

00:08:36.630  -->  00:08:41.620
This huge collection and I already have that loop written so I'm going to reuse it.

124

00:08:42.540  -->  00:08:45.680
And just to reiterate this is something that will do a lot.

125

00:08:45.690  -->  00:08:51.070
So get comfortable if you can writing these four loops where we can't use a for each.

126

00:08:51.090  -->  00:08:52.610
So we have to use a for loop.

127

00:08:52.680  -->  00:08:53.770
We do this all the time.

128

00:08:53.790  -->  00:08:59.050
And from here on out until we get to Jey query we're going to be writing this type of line a lot.

129

00:08:59.310  -->  00:09:02.080
So we're going to links I.

130

00:09:02.430  -->  00:09:08.580
And we're going to start but just printing out where every light goes so cancel that log.

131

00:09:10.050  -->  00:09:16.060
And we're going to cancel that log get attribute of atra.

132

00:09:18.240  -->  00:09:19.770
Just like that.

133

00:09:20.400  -->  00:09:25.740
And we don't technically need to invent that but just so it's easier for you to see.

134

00:09:26.250  -->  00:09:33.990
And we're missing our constant log closing print to see here and now we get a list of all the links

135

00:09:37.320  -->  00:09:40.290
and it's interesting you can see that some of them.

136

00:09:40.380  -->  00:09:45.090
This one is the link to this thing javascript forward zero or no.

137

00:09:45.150  -->  00:09:53.280
So some of them are just empty they don't have an 8 Tref some of them go to separate web sites or some

138

00:09:53.280  -->  00:10:01.710
of them are relative paths like this here and some of them are absolute like this one right here.

139

00:10:01.770  -->  00:10:02.310
OK.

140

00:10:02.490  -->  00:10:04.730
So let's change them now.

141

00:10:04.890  -->  00:10:11.230
Compton-Rock blog links I got set attribute and we don't need to constantly log it set attribute.

142

00:10:11.430  -->  00:10:17.400
And let's change them to be what we want HGF we want to change HPF to be W.W..

143

00:10:17.430  -->  00:10:25.930
That's do HTP colon slash slash BW dot Bing dot com just like that.

144

00:10:26.340  -->  00:10:27.930
And we hit enter.

145

00:10:27.930  -->  00:10:29.570
It doesn't look like anything changed.

146

00:10:29.880  -->  00:10:32.650
If we type links and we just look at what we have.

147

00:10:32.820  -->  00:10:40.110
Every single one now goes to being dot com and we can also inspect one and we can see in the element

148

00:10:40.110  -->  00:10:42.480
inspector It goes to being dot com.

149

00:10:42.780  -->  00:10:45.870
And the last thing we do to test it is to click one.

150

00:10:45.990  -->  00:10:52.860
So let's quick the sign in button or let's quit Gmail and you can see it opens up being for me.

151

00:10:53.580  -->  00:10:59.730
So to sum up we selected a bunch of things a collection of links and then we loop through that collection

152

00:10:59.790  -->  00:11:05.580
with a for loop and then inside that for loop we can do something to each individual element which will

153

00:11:05.580  -->  00:11:07.470
then be repeated to all of them.

154

00:11:07.500  -->  00:11:14.310
So I changed the background color the border the font color we changed the ref and we only had to write
