00:00:00.160  -->  00:00:05.290
In this video I want to take a moment to introduce a really really important concept called associations

2

00:00:05.790  -->  00:00:11.130
so associations will allow us to have multiple pieces of data multiple collections in our database that

3

00:00:11.130  -->  00:00:12.570
are related to one another.

4

00:00:12.840  -->  00:00:16.200
And this is hugely important to making more complex web apps.

5

00:00:16.200  -->  00:00:20.800
Right now we have Yelp camp and your camp has campgrounds in it.

6

00:00:21.090  -->  00:00:22.860
But then we're going to add in users.

7

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:27.840
Want to be able to have users who then are associated with campgrounds and then campgrounds will have

8

00:00:27.840  -->  00:00:33.210
comments and we want to have those campgrounds associated with a list of comments or if we take an example

9

00:00:33.210  -->  00:00:35.750
like Facebook on Facebook you sign up.

10

00:00:35.790  -->  00:00:43.140
So there's an entity a model called user and then there's another entity called post and then somewhere

11

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:50.690
there's photos but there's also albums and there's comments and there's tags and likes.

12

00:00:50.730  -->  00:00:55.050
There are way more models that I'm not mentioning but all of these are interconnected.

13

00:00:55.290  -->  00:00:58.950
So a user is related to a post when I create a post.

14

00:00:58.980  -->  00:01:01.260
That post is not just an arbitrary post.

15

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:03.100
It's related to me.

16

00:01:03.120  -->  00:01:08.050
Same thing with the photos that I upload and the albums that those photos belong to.

17

00:01:08.070  -->  00:01:13.860
So a photo can be associated with an album and an album can be associated with a user.

18

00:01:14.010  -->  00:01:15.330
And we have comments.

19

00:01:15.330  -->  00:01:18.540
A comment can be on a photo the comment can be on a post.

20

00:01:18.640  -->  00:01:24.450
I think a comment can also be on an album of photos than we have tags so photos can have tags but you

21

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:26.120
can also tag people and comments.

22

00:01:26.160  -->  00:01:28.820
You can tag people in posts we have likes.

23

00:01:28.950  -->  00:01:29.960
You can like comment.

24

00:01:29.970  -->  00:01:32.680
You can like an album you can like a photo you can like a post.

25

00:01:32.680  -->  00:01:37.800
There is so many different things going on but the core concept is that data is related.

26

00:01:37.920  -->  00:01:43.680
The term associations just refers to this idea of having associated data and the other important point

27

00:01:43.830  -->  00:01:48.750
is that there are different types of associations there are associations that are known as one to one

28

00:01:49.440  -->  00:01:53.360
one to many and many to many relationships.

29

00:01:53.490  -->  00:01:58.740
So start by talking about one to one relationships and one to one are the simplest relationships.

30

00:01:58.830  -->  00:02:06.000
So we have one of an entity that's related to one another entity so we could say that one book has one

31

00:02:06.000  -->  00:02:11.640
publisher or an employee has one title where it gets more exciting as we start talking about one to

32

00:02:11.640  -->  00:02:16.000
many relationships and one to many relationship one entity.

33

00:02:16.020  -->  00:02:18.270
It's related to many of another entity.

34

00:02:18.420  -->  00:02:24.540
We can take the example of Facebook one user can have multiple photos that they have uploaded the photos

35

00:02:24.540  -->  00:02:28.710
belong to that user but those photos belong to one user.

36

00:02:28.710  -->  00:02:35.550
A photo can not have multiple uploads so it's a one to many relationship unlike a many to many relationship

37

00:02:35.850  -->  00:02:38.250
where the association goes both ways.

38

00:02:38.260  -->  00:02:43.440
The classic example of a many to many relationship is students and courses.

39

00:02:43.440  -->  00:02:49.950
So in college a student can sign up for multiple courses and each course has multiple students enrolled

40

00:02:49.950  -->  00:02:50.280
.

41

00:02:50.340  -->  00:02:53.310
So its this two way many to many relationship.

42

00:02:53.400  -->  00:02:55.680
Another one would be books and authors.

43

00:02:55.980  -->  00:03:03.150
So an author can write can have many books and each book can also have many authors.

44

00:03:03.150  -->  00:03:08.400
It might be more common for there to only be one author but it's definitely possible and not uncommon

45

00:03:08.400  -->  00:03:09.710
to have multiple authors.

46

00:03:09.870  -->  00:03:14.850
So those are the three basic types of relationships and the type that will encounter the most is one

47

00:03:14.850  -->  00:03:15.710
too many.

48

00:03:15.780  -->  00:03:23.250
So we'll have comments and campgrounds and one campground has many comments but one comment only belongs

49

00:03:23.250  -->  00:03:26.640
to one campground in the next two videos.

50

00:03:26.670  -->  00:03:31.470
I'm going to introduce how we can write associations how we can connect different models using mongoose

51

00:03:31.760  -->  00:03:34.040
and I'm going to show two different ways of doing that.

52

00:03:34.050  -->  00:03:40.680
The first is using what's known as embedding data and the second one it's known as referencing data

53

00:03:40.690  -->  00:03:41.270
.

54

00:03:41.970  -->  00:03:44.520
So I'm going to do these in two separate installments.

55

00:03:44.520  -->  00:03:48.120
And coming up next I'm going to show you how we can embed data to Associated
