1

00:00:00,230  -->  00:00:03,290
Know all we really need to focus on are the colors.

2

00:00:03,300  -->  00:00:05,160
Let's start with a jumbotron.

3

00:00:05,460  -->  00:00:11,070
So everything inside the JumboTron is just a different shade of blue and that shade of blue I have in

4

00:00:11,070  -->  00:00:23,370
this document here to see 3 5 0 will go to our style sheet and we can just select the jumbotron and

5

00:00:23,370  -->  00:00:31,860
give it a color and everything inside of it all up that color just like that are fresh and you can see

6

00:00:32,250  -->  00:00:37,880
everything is changed to be blue including the cliff A-Kon the glyph icon is just treated as text.

7

00:00:37,980  -->  00:00:43,010
It's actually a font so you can change the color of it using the color property.

8

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:45,950
Now let's tackle the nav bar which is a little trickier.

9

00:00:46,110  -->  00:00:47,730
The background color isn't bad.

10

00:00:47,740  -->  00:00:53,280
All we need to do is select nav bar Inv. or we could do.

11

00:00:53,340  -->  00:00:59,730
Now if we are on after our fix stop but I'll do nav bar inverse and then give it a background color

12

00:01:01,650  -->  00:01:08,210
of that blue background and paste that in and refresh.

13

00:01:08,210  -->  00:01:09,830
And you can see it changes to be blue.

14

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:15,900
But to change the color here I want them to be white rather than that gray that they are.

15

00:01:15,900  -->  00:01:21,720
If I just style all ink or tags which is what these are for just style anchor tags to be white it won't

16

00:01:21,720  -->  00:01:22,800
quite work.

17

00:01:22,800  -->  00:01:23,980
So I'll show you what I mean.

18

00:01:24,030  -->  00:01:28,070
Anchor tag color white.

19

00:01:28,150  -->  00:01:29,630
Go back.

20

00:01:29,910  -->  00:01:35,430
It doesn't take effect and this is a great use for the inspector if we inspect it.

21

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:36,880
Take a look what's happening.

22

00:01:37,260  -->  00:01:43,080
So we can see that our color white is crossed off and the color is being assigned right here.

23

00:01:43,410  -->  00:01:49,350
This line color is this gray and if we uncheck it they go back to being the white that we want them

24

00:01:49,350  -->  00:01:50,050
to be.

25

00:01:50,490  -->  00:01:53,280
And that's because this is a more specific selector.

26

00:01:53,460  -->  00:01:56,290
If you can think back to that lesson I did on specificity.

27

00:01:56,520  -->  00:02:03,180
This is calculated to have a higher number or a higher specificity index than what we had here which

28

00:02:03,180  -->  00:02:06,530
is just for little anchor tag versus this up here.

29

00:02:06,630  -->  00:02:08,190
It's multiple classes.

30

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:12,330
Remember each one of those is ten times more specific than just an anchor tag.

31

00:02:12,900  -->  00:02:18,480
So what we want to do is write a selector that will be just as specific and we can just steal this one

32

00:02:18,480  -->  00:02:19,540
right here.

33

00:02:20,280  -->  00:02:25,910
So we'll go in to here and paste that in and then change color to be white.

34

00:02:25,950  -->  00:02:29,560
So we'll just override the exact same schlechter that bootstrap had.

35

00:02:29,610  -->  00:02:35,790
And it's important that our styles occur after bootstrap so that we can override it and if we are fresh

36

00:02:36,000  -->  00:02:37,370
We now get white links.

37

00:02:37,650  -->  00:02:41,050
Lastly we'll do the same thing to the nav bar brand.

38

00:02:41,670  -->  00:02:45,490
So as you can see that's inside of nav bar dash brand.

39

00:02:45,960  -->  00:02:57,360
If we select that Daut now for our brand and we give that a color of white and save and go back it still

40

00:02:57,360  -->  00:02:59,800
doesn't work and we have the same problem.

41

00:02:59,820  -->  00:03:06,120
So if we inspect it you'll see that it's crossed off our styles down here where we're turning white

42

00:03:06,450  -->  00:03:11,700
has been crossed off and rather is colors being changed by this line.

43

00:03:11,700  -->  00:03:17,770
Now if Bar brand inside of nav bar Inv. so we can also just steal that and overwrite that.

44

00:03:17,970  -->  00:03:21,500
So we just need that nav bar inv..

45

00:03:21,930  -->  00:03:23,220
Now for our brand.

46

00:03:23,280  -->  00:03:28,500
So basically we're writing styles that are going to clash head to head in a battle of the styles between

47

00:03:28,500  -->  00:03:32,580
bootstrap and our styles and they're identical in the selectors.

48

00:03:32,700  -->  00:03:36,280
So because ours comes second they're going to come out on top.

49

00:03:36,300  -->  00:03:41,100
They're going to win go back refresh and never go.

50

00:03:41,100  -->  00:03:42,530
We have most of the styles done.

51

00:03:42,630  -->  00:03:48,000
There's one really minor thing that you probably won't notice on the screen cast the color of gray on

52

00:03:48,000  -->  00:03:51,600
the JumboTron is ever so slightly different.

53

00:03:52,740  -->  00:04:00,120
So I have that color here I'll just copy it and then go to RC SS and we'll just change the background

54

00:04:00,600  -->  00:04:05,510
of the Jumbotron to be that gray colored and pay close attention as refresh.

55

00:04:05,520  -->  00:04:07,000
Hopefully you can see it change.

56

00:04:07,110  -->  00:04:08,200
It just changed.

57

00:04:08,200  -->  00:04:10,990
It's a slightly bluer looking gray.

58

00:04:11,040  -->  00:04:12,500
So let's test everything out.

59

00:04:12,720  -->  00:04:16,080
Let's resize our NAV bar work.

60

00:04:16,170  -->  00:04:18,720
The Javascript works just fine.

61

00:04:18,720  -->  00:04:19,740
There we go.

62

00:04:19,830  -->  00:04:21,400
Everything looks good.

63

00:04:21,420  -->  00:04:24,870
The last thing I'll show you is how we can use a different icon here.

64

00:04:25,140  -->  00:04:30,510
The one that I'm using is from a library called fun awesome fun awesome is a simple library that includes

65

00:04:30,570  -->  00:04:31,860
a lot of different icons.

66

00:04:31,860  -->  00:04:37,520
Way more than the built in Bootstrap with icons so you can get to it at Funt awesome.

67

00:04:37,610  -->  00:04:38,390
Don't get her.

68

00:04:38,430  -->  00:04:40,890
I know I'm on the home page here.

69

00:04:41,280  -->  00:04:47,220
And if we click on icons there are over 580 different icons you can see them all here.

70

00:04:47,550  -->  00:04:52,470
And one of the nice features that you can search through them which you can't really do on Pucelle very

71

00:04:52,470  -->  00:04:53,580
easily.

72

00:04:53,670  -->  00:05:01,870
So we can search for photo and we get camera and the camera retro which is what I used.

73

00:05:02,100  -->  00:05:05,180
But before we can use any of them we need to install it.

74

00:05:05,400  -->  00:05:07,750
So if you go to getting started.

75

00:05:07,800  -->  00:05:14,160
They have a nice CDN that you can just copy and just put that inside of your application.

76

00:05:14,160  -->  00:05:18,650
So we'll do that up top pay sudden.

77

00:05:19,140  -->  00:05:24,190
And now we can use fun awesome icons and it's really really easy.

78

00:05:24,330  -->  00:05:31,320
Actually if you click on any icon that you like that say I want to use the peace sign I can click on

79

00:05:31,320  -->  00:05:35,100
it and they give you the little bit of code that you can copy.

80

00:05:35,100  -->  00:05:38,300
So it's an icon with class equal to f a for fun.

81

00:05:38,310  -->  00:05:38,660
Awesome.

82

00:05:38,670  -->  00:05:42,010
And then F.A. dash the name of the icon.

83

00:05:42,990  -->  00:05:51,240
Let's just replace the camera icon with this so it will have a big peace sign will save and refresh

84

00:05:51,250  -->  00:05:51,870
.

85

00:05:52,380  -->  00:05:53,640
And we have a peace sign.

86

00:05:53,850  -->  00:05:55,820
So fun awesome is pretty awesome.

87

00:05:55,830  -->  00:05:57,110
It's really popular.

88

00:05:57,120  -->  00:06:01,970
Lots of great icons as you can see pretty much any icon you would ever need.

89

00:06:01,980  -->  00:06:03,620
They have a bunch of the standard ones.

90

00:06:03,690  -->  00:06:04,940
Pause play button.

91

00:06:04,950  -->  00:06:09,400
Forward backwards different icons for technology and different Internet icons.

92

00:06:09,480  -->  00:06:12,260
But they also have some more fun ones like peace signs.

93

00:06:12,320  -->  00:06:16,090
And I think they also have a Spock hand Yep there we go.

94

00:06:16,380  -->  00:06:19,460
So you can use any of these just like you use any other font.

95

00:06:19,500  -->  00:06:23,970
So if you want to change the color you just change the color property if you want to change the size

96

00:06:23,980  -->  00:06:24,130
.

97

00:06:24,360  -->  00:06:26,510
You actually change font size.

98

00:06:26,880  -->  00:06:35,730
So I'm going to use that retro camera search for that again which is camera dash retro so I need to

99

00:06:35,730  -->  00:06:44,880
do a dash camera dash retro and save refresh and we get that retro camera.

100

00:06:44,880  -->  00:06:46,710
All right so we're finished with the gallery.

101

00:06:46,710  -->  00:06:52,370
Aside from actually changing the image you are else which I'll do as soon as I finish this wrap up.

102

00:06:52,380  -->  00:06:56,310
You probably don't want to watch anyways but in case you do I'll include it at the end.

103

00:06:56,310  -->  00:07:02,340
So we have enough Bartra up here made a small change which was we use now far inverse which is how we

104

00:07:02,340  -->  00:07:04,110
got the black and white nav bar.

105

00:07:04,230  -->  00:07:07,650
But then we actually changed colors anyway so it didn't really matter.

106

00:07:07,650  -->  00:07:12,380
And then we also used nav bar fixed top which is how it stays up at the top.

107

00:07:12,480  -->  00:07:16,100
We use a grid system down here and then we use a jumbotron.

108

00:07:16,100  -->  00:07:20,960
I introduced glyph a concept built in Bootstrap icons which are relatively limited.

109

00:07:21,000  -->  00:07:26,160
There are most of the things that you would use but occasionally they won't have something or sometimes

110

00:07:26,160  -->  00:07:29,000
you just prefer the way that the fun awesome icons look fun.

111

00:07:29,010  -->  00:07:33,630
Awesome is definitely more popular than the food show with pecans and the other new thing I showed you

112

00:07:33,630  -->  00:07:38,550
was the thumbnail class which you can just put around an image and it will constrain that image into

113

00:07:38,550  -->  00:07:41,700
a grid and add this nice little border here.

114

00:07:41,700  -->  00:07:46,080
And then lastly we talked about specificity and how we had to battle the bootstrap styles if we wanted

115

00:07:46,080  -->  00:07:48,520
to change the color the background color.

116

00:07:48,620  -->  00:07:54,180
Want to change the background color of Nav. or the font color for links and also the color of the Nev.

117

00:07:54,210  -->  00:07:55,450
brand right here.

118

00:07:55,620  -->  00:07:57,410
OK so that's it in the next video.

119

00:07:57,420  -->  00:08:00,230
I'm going to show you how we can make a landing page with bootstrap.

120

00:08:00,300  -->  00:08:05,160
And as I promised I'm now going to go copy and paste those image links to make nine different images

121

00:08:05,160  -->  00:08:05,590
here.

122

00:08:05,760  -->  00:08:09,160
So if that's something you want to see hang around for the next minute or two.

123

00:08:09,660  -->  00:08:13,380
OK.

124

00:08:15,510  -->  00:08:23,790
So I'll just split screen this and I'll copy some of these over this first one and I'm just going to

125

00:08:23,790  -->  00:08:28,760
replace this one here and then I'll do the next one.

126

00:08:29,140  -->  00:08:29,580
Old Place.

127

00:08:29,580  -->  00:08:31,360
This one here.

128

00:08:32,610  -->  00:08:37,110
And then the next one I'm sure this is riveting

129

00:08:39,710  -->  00:08:47,350
and I'll keep going on down the line just like that.

130

00:08:47,350  -->  00:08:48,660
All right we're past halfway.

131

00:08:48,660  -->  00:08:49,650
We're getting close

132

00:08:59,220  -->  00:09:10,470
and the last one I think we did it let's say make sure everything looks good or fresh and we have nine

133

00:09:10,470  -->  00:09:11,440
different images.

134

00:09:11,700  -->  00:09:12,360
Awesome.

135

00:09:12,660  -->  00:09:12,960
All right.

136

00:09:12,960  -->  00:09:14,120
So now I'm done done.

137

00:09:14,190  -->  00:09:16,020
Hopefully enjoyed making that image gallery.

138

00:09:16,050  -->  00:09:17,060
I'll see you in the next video.
