00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:05.120
In this video we're going to create this photographer's portfolio site from scratch.

2

00:00:05.310  -->  00:00:10.830
And usually I would ask you to attempt to do this on your own and then give you a solution video following

3

00:00:10.830  -->  00:00:11.550
this.

4

00:00:11.640  -->  00:00:14.050
However this time it's a deliberate code along.

5

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:19.590
So I'd like you to attempt to code along and if you prefer you can watch it once through and then code

6

00:00:19.590  -->  00:00:20.650
along the next time.

7

00:00:20.850  -->  00:00:26.220
But the goal here is that we're going to do it together and there are two other things that we want

8

00:00:26.220  -->  00:00:26.940
to get out of this.

9

00:00:26.940  -->  00:00:33.270
The first one is there's a new property I'm going to show called float and the second thing is I just

10

00:00:33.270  -->  00:00:37.190
want you to get a little experience building something that you can be somewhat proud of.

11

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:41.970
That looks a little bit better than some of the simple things that are just really bright awful colors

12

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:43.160
that we've done so far.

13

00:00:43.170  -->  00:00:47.210
So this is a really minimal photo blog that we're going to do.

14

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:49.160
So let's get started.

15

00:00:49.230  -->  00:00:50.610
Open up sublime.

16

00:00:50.880  -->  00:00:54.330
I have a single file called Photo grid that HMO.

17

00:00:54.960  -->  00:01:00.480
I'm going to first show you the image or else that we're working with.

18

00:01:00.480  -->  00:01:07.410
So these are images nine images three images each from three different photographers that I found on

19

00:01:07.410  -->  00:01:08.390
Flickr.

20

00:01:08.700  -->  00:01:10.920
All the photos are licensed under Creative Commons.

21

00:01:10.920  -->  00:01:13.030
You can the license here.

22

00:01:13.050  -->  00:01:19.800
So before we do anything with these image you URLs I'm actually going to get rid of them and I'm going

23

00:01:19.800  -->  00:01:27.180
to add in my aged skeleton ad-Din in photo blog and I'm going to do a quick demonstration so you don't

24

00:01:27.180  -->  00:01:34.360
have to code along with this part when I add to divs one that says hello and one that says goodbye and

25

00:01:34.410  -->  00:01:42.150
I'm going to save them and then I'm going to add my stylesheet in which I'm calling photos of the SS

26

00:01:43.350  -->  00:01:46.750
and then over here I'm going to style my divs.

27

00:01:46.770  -->  00:01:53.890
So I'm actually going to give them an I.D. just call it one.

28

00:01:54.270  -->  00:02:06.810
And again this is just to demonstrate something and then to an over here I'm going to select one and

29

00:02:06.900  -->  00:02:10.020
two and all I'm going to do is just give them a different background color

30

00:02:14.040  -->  00:02:25.980
red and then background color purple and then I'm going to give both of them all divs and a width of

31

00:02:25.980  -->  00:02:27.630
100 pixels.

32

00:02:27.630  -->  00:02:32.430
So when I do this I open it up in the browser.

33

00:02:33.540  -->  00:02:36.970
We have two divs one after another.

34

00:02:36.990  -->  00:02:39.020
Remember that they if we inspect.

35

00:02:39.480  -->  00:02:44.280
They are basically set up so that they take their own line their block level element.

36

00:02:44.280  -->  00:02:50.400
So if I don't want that to happen which is what we're going to do for the image grid we want our images

37

00:02:50.400  -->  00:02:54.490
to form a grid or multiple are on the same line.

38

00:02:54.540  -->  00:02:59.850
And if so if I want to do that with divs I need to use a property called float or that's one way that

39

00:02:59.850  -->  00:03:01.690
I can accomplish it.

40

00:03:01.740  -->  00:03:06.780
So here all I do is safe float left and what that will do.

41

00:03:06.780  -->  00:03:11.390
It will take the elements all divs out of the normal flow of the document.

42

00:03:11.580  -->  00:03:14.730
So there are stacks currently on each on separate lines.

43

00:03:15.000  -->  00:03:22.200
And what will happen is that they will float to the left to think of it as gravity going away almost

44

00:03:22.200  -->  00:03:23.090
in our document.

45

00:03:23.280  -->  00:03:26.380
And so this div is going to float up and push to the left.

46

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:27.580
Against this one.

47

00:03:27.990  -->  00:03:32.200
So if I were fresh here you can see that they're now on the same line.

48

00:03:32.280  -->  00:03:38.190
So we're going to use this principle when we're using images so that we can get images to basically

49

00:03:38.550  -->  00:03:41.840
go up against one another and form a grid.

50

00:03:41.970  -->  00:03:48.600
So I'm going to get rid of all this now and get rid of the device that we have and I'm going to add

51

00:03:48.600  -->  00:03:49.910
in our image like this.

52

00:03:50.280  -->  00:03:55.770
So I'm going to make this full screen and just paste in these image links that are in that file included

53

00:03:55.770  -->  00:03:57.040
with this video.

54

00:03:57.810  -->  00:04:04.920
And rather than making nine image tags like this where I make an image tag and then copy you around

55

00:04:05.190  -->  00:04:08.230
and paste it in nine times which should be very slow.

56

00:04:08.490  -->  00:04:15.660
I'm going to use a little bit of sublime magic here where I'm using command click to select the beginning

57

00:04:15.660  -->  00:04:22.530
of every line and then I'm just going to type image source equals and then move to the end of the line

58

00:04:22.530  -->  00:04:22.730
.

59

00:04:22.800  -->  00:04:28.650
So I used a command right arrow command left arrow takes it to the beginning command right goes to the

60

00:04:28.710  -->  00:04:35.380
end and then I'm going to finish with the quote and then the closing bracket.

61

00:04:35.400  -->  00:04:40.550
So that was a really easy and quick way to enclose all those you are Elves as image tags.

62

00:04:40.920  -->  00:04:46.340
So if I save this and they go to the browser you'll see when I refresh.

63

00:04:46.530  -->  00:04:47.960
We now have nine images.

64

00:04:48.090  -->  00:04:49.680
Of course are not integrated.

65

00:04:49.890  -->  00:04:53.890
They're taking up a lot of space.

66

00:04:54.060  -->  00:05:01.230
So what we're going to do now is go to our style sheet and select all images.

67

00:05:01.230  -->  00:05:05.520
And the first thing that we probably want to do here is just give them away.

68

00:05:06.090  -->  00:05:13.280
So let's give them a with like 100 pixels to start and this is going to be way too small.

69

00:05:13.710  -->  00:05:21.540
But I want you to see what happens and refresh and you'll notice that all these images now are in a

70

00:05:21.540  -->  00:05:26.360
line together but that there's some spacing between them that we didn't specify.

71

00:05:26.430  -->  00:05:29.780
We never set margin or padding or anything.

72

00:05:29.790  -->  00:05:34.590
So what's happening is that there's actually some white space that's being added and it's a little bit

73

00:05:34.590  -->  00:05:36.040
of a quirky thing in a steam owl.

74

00:05:36.050  -->  00:05:41.850
But when we have images without anything else there's a white space or just a single space that's added

75

00:05:41.850  -->  00:05:42.870
between these.

76

00:05:43.140  -->  00:05:49.710
So if we want to get rid of that we can use float and remember that float will take things out of the

77

00:05:49.710  -->  00:05:51.540
flow of the document.

78

00:05:51.570  -->  00:05:58.170
So if I refresh Now you can see that are images are butting up against one another and there's basically

79

00:05:58.170  -->  00:05:59.800
no space at all between them.

80

00:06:00.150  -->  00:06:04.120
And then we can go back and add that space in our self.

81

00:06:04.170  -->  00:06:07.020
So we obviously don't want them to take up this little space.

82

00:06:07.020  -->  00:06:13.700
We do want three going across and we want some margin between them but we want to control that.

83

00:06:14.160  -->  00:06:20.610
So by floating them we got rid of the white space that the browser added for us so that we can now go

84

00:06:20.610  -->  00:06:27.320
in at our own custom spacing using the margin property rather than actual whitespace.

85

00:06:28.920  -->  00:06:33.670
So now we're going to change the width and let's start with 30 percent.

86

00:06:33.720  -->  00:06:39.180
So remember that the percent Israel is relative to the parent elements of the body.

87

00:06:39.180  -->  00:06:41.910
So each one will take up 30 percent of the body.

88

00:06:41.910  -->  00:06:46.800
And the reason I'm starting with 30 is just to make sure they all fit on one line or that three fit

89

00:06:46.800  -->  00:06:46.830
.

90

00:06:46.830  -->  00:06:52.120
In my mind and you'll see that we get three of them going across no space between.

91

00:06:52.260  -->  00:06:58.370
And then we have our 10 percent over here because this is only 90 percent that we're taking up.

92

00:06:58.470  -->  00:07:06.390
So we're going to use that other percentage to actually split up the margin and add some spacing between

93

00:07:06.390  -->  00:07:06.790
them.

94

00:07:07.020  -->  00:07:09.460
So already we have a three by three grid.

95

00:07:09.650  -->  00:07:12.550
What we want to do next is make it look like this.

96

00:07:12.750  -->  00:07:15.000
Or we have even spacing between them.

97

00:07:15.180  -->  00:07:17.870
So we actually have to do a little bit of math.

98

00:07:18.060  -->  00:07:18.860
So I've already done it.

99

00:07:18.870  -->  00:07:26.210
But basically if we calculate this there's a margin here one there's a margin here too.

100

00:07:26.570  -->  00:07:28.430
There's a margin here three.

101

00:07:28.600  -->  00:07:32.400
And then on this one for that on this one five.

102

00:07:32.670  -->  00:07:34.910
And on this one or six.

103

00:07:34.920  -->  00:07:45.570
So we have 10 percent and we need to divide that by 6 and 10 divided by six is one point six six.

104

00:07:45.570  -->  00:07:52.810
So what we're going to do is just say margin one point six six percent.

105

00:07:52.950  -->  00:07:58.440
So if we go back to the browser and check out the result and refresh you'll see that we get three evenly

106

00:07:58.440  -->  00:08:01.900
spaced images with spacing between them.

107

00:08:01.950  -->  00:08:04.850
So the math just hit that one more time.

108

00:08:05.070  -->  00:08:06.570
Each one of these is 10 percent.

109

00:08:06.570  -->  00:08:07.980
So they give just 30 percent.

110

00:08:08.160  -->  00:08:12.370
And each one has a margin of 1.6 percent on either side.

111

00:08:12.390  -->  00:08:19.700
So we take both sides left and right one point six times two plus 30 percent and we get thirty three

112

00:08:19.690  -->  00:08:22.920
point three percent for each one of these.

113

00:08:22.920  -->  00:08:29.330
So that's one third exactly or almost exactly we are rounding but that's the best we can do here.

114

00:08:29.530  -->  00:08:30.800
So thirty three point three percent.

115

00:08:30.810  -->  00:08:35.200
Each one of these we can inspect just to verify that.

116

00:08:35.670  -->  00:08:36.670
There we go.

117

00:08:36.690  -->  00:08:39.360
You can see it take up exactly one third
