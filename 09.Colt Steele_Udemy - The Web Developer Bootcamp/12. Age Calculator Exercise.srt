00:00:00,960  -->  00:00:04,820
OK so I have one more exercise here and this one is optional.

2

00:00:05,100  -->  00:00:11,730
It's only if you want some extra practice with numbers and strings and doing some simple math and prompts

3

00:00:11,730  -->  00:00:14,670
and cancel that log the way that it's going to work.

4

00:00:14,670  -->  00:00:19,860
It's a age calculator that asks you for your age in years.

5

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:26,500
So like 50 and then you enter 50 in and it will tell you roughly how many days you've been alive.

6

00:00:26,670  -->  00:00:28,190
So it's very simple logic.

7

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:33,590
It doesn't actually account for what day you were born on and what month it is or report year it is

8

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:40,860
now all that it does is take the number that you give it like 50 and multiply it by three hundred and

9

00:00:40,860  -->  00:00:41,860
sixty five.

10

00:00:42,150  -->  00:00:47,210
And if you want to get fancy there's a simple way to include leap years that also in the solution.

11

00:00:47,400  -->  00:00:50,040
So here's a quick demo of how it works.

12

00:00:50,100  -->  00:00:54,170
I'll refresh the page and it starts by asking me for an age.

13

00:00:54,300  -->  00:00:57,730
So enter 5 and then it tells me five years.

14

00:00:57,740  -->  00:01:02,330
It's roughly one thousand eight hundred twenty six point to five days.

15

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:04,380
And that's it.

16

00:01:04,380  -->  00:01:07,850
So go ahead and give this one a shot and then I'll be back with the solution.

17

00:01:07,860  -->  00:01:08,860
And just a few seconds
