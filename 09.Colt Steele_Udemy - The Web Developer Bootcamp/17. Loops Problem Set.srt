00:00:00,090  -->  00:00:04,920
For your for loops problem said I'm going to have you do the exact same problems that you did for the

2

00:00:04,990  -->  00:00:07,800
wildlife's except you're going to rewrite them with four loops.

3

00:00:07,830  -->  00:00:12,000
And the reason I'm having you do this is not because I'm having a hard time thinking of other things

4

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:15,590
to write with loops but it's important that you can translate between the two.

5

00:00:15,630  -->  00:00:20,190
We're going to use both of them throughout this course and in a lot of cases you can use one or the

6

00:00:20,190  -->  00:00:20,650
other.

7

00:00:20,850  -->  00:00:22,690
So I want you to be able to translate.

8

00:00:22,800  -->  00:00:25,750
So for this exercise it's the same exact problems.

9

00:00:25,830  -->  00:00:28,330
Just use a for loop.

10

00:00:28,410  -->  00:00:33,810
So just to jog your memory on the actual problems so you should have four different sections in your

11

00:00:33,810  -->  00:00:39,370
output separated by a consul dot log and the four sections correspond to the four problems.

12

00:00:39,390  -->  00:00:46,020
So the first one print all the numbers between negative 10 and positive 19 the next one print all the

13

00:00:46,020  -->  00:00:54,990
even numbers between 10 and 40 and then all the odd numbers between 300 and 333 and then all the numbers

14

00:00:54,990  -->  00:01:01,350
that are divisible both by 5 and three between the number five and 50 which we see down here.

15

00:01:01,940  -->  00:01:02,400
OK.

16

00:01:02,520  -->  00:01:05,830
So go ahead and give this a shot and what do the solution in the next video.
