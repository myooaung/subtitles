1

00:00:00,220  -->  00:00:02,490
OK so there's three more methods I want to talk about.

2

00:00:02,520  -->  00:00:04,160
And they all are very similar.

3

00:00:04,170  -->  00:00:06,480
They have to do with classes.

4

00:00:06,600  -->  00:00:14,160
So if you think back to the class list property and the DOT Add Remove and toggle methods that go along

5

00:00:14,160  -->  00:00:15,510
with class list.

6

00:00:15,510  -->  00:00:19,650
These are the J.A.G. analogs So this will be a quick question.

7

00:00:19,720  -->  00:00:21,600
Just going to demonstrate those really quickly.

8

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:28,500
So I'm going to go to my HMO and the first thing I'm going to do is define the style tag and I'm just

9

00:00:28,500  -->  00:00:32,500
going to do it in line for the second time and I'm going to add a few classes.

10

00:00:32,700  -->  00:00:34,350
So the first one will add in.

11

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:39,520
Well just call it Dot correct and it will make something turn green.

12

00:00:39,540  -->  00:00:47,700
So we'll just do colored green and we'll add another one dot wrong and that will make color red and

13

00:00:47,730  -->  00:00:51,170
background pink.

14

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:59,820
And then lastly will do dot done which will be like for a To Do list and we'll do color is gray and

15

00:01:00,360  -->  00:01:05,160
text decoration is line through.

16

00:01:05,700  -->  00:01:11,670
OK so now we have three classes and then we're going to use J query to add and remove those classes

17

00:01:11,690  -->  00:01:12,260
.

18

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:14,300
So I'll take a look at the docs.

19

00:01:14,320  -->  00:01:15,300
Just one of them.

20

00:01:15,300  -->  00:01:18,640
Let's take a look at add class.

21

00:01:20,070  -->  00:01:26,850
You can see that it adds the specified class or classes to each element in the set of matched elements

22

00:01:26,850  -->  00:01:27,360
.

23

00:01:27,360  -->  00:01:31,470
So this will add two classes to all paragraphs.

24

00:01:31,680  -->  00:01:38,040
My class and your class to all paragraphs which makes it really useful if we want to assign a class

25

00:01:38,040  -->  00:01:39,770
to a bunch of elements at once.

26

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:41,640
So let's go back here.

27

00:01:41,730  -->  00:01:47,360
So let's begin by making this H-1 have the correct class which just turned to green.

28

00:01:47,490  -->  00:01:52,020
So we select H-1 make sure we have it.

29

00:01:52,110  -->  00:01:56,030
Does it add class.

30

00:01:56,040  -->  00:01:57,030
Correct.

31

00:01:57,180  -->  00:01:58,980
Just like that.

32

00:01:59,430  -->  00:02:00,520
And it turns green.

33

00:02:00,540  -->  00:02:05,400
And if we inspect it you can see that it has class equals correct.

34

00:02:05,940  -->  00:02:10,770
And then we can do remove class to do the same thing but in reverse.

35

00:02:10,770  -->  00:02:12,960
So H-1 remove.

36

00:02:12,960  -->  00:02:13,790
Class.

37

00:02:14,040  -->  00:02:15,180
Correct.

38

00:02:15,330  -->  00:02:21,620
We'll remove the class correct from that element and now it no longer has that class.

39

00:02:22,290  -->  00:02:24,480
So we can also do that to a collection.

40

00:02:24,480  -->  00:02:28,290
So we will select all allies.

41

00:02:28,770  -->  00:02:32,330
We get three of them and then we'll add the class.

42

00:02:32,640  -->  00:02:35,960
Wrong just like that.

43

00:02:36,210  -->  00:02:41,390
And all of them now have that class where they have a pink background and text color is red.

44

00:02:41,400  -->  00:02:43,300
You can see it added them to three.

45

00:02:43,650  -->  00:02:49,080
So once again I know I'm a broken record here but if we did this without j Querrey we would have to

46

00:02:49,080  -->  00:02:54,810
select all three of these manually with a query selector all possibly and then we would loop through

47

00:02:54,810  -->  00:02:59,840
with the for loop and for each one we would do class classless add wrong.

48

00:03:00,240  -->  00:03:01,690
So we don't have to do any of that.

49

00:03:01,860  -->  00:03:05,610
This has an implicit loop that takes care of it all for us.

50

00:03:06,180  -->  00:03:13,990
So let's now remove that class wrong from all of them and let's add the class.

51

00:03:14,060  -->  00:03:14,690
Correct.

52

00:03:14,700  -->  00:03:16,540
All of them just like that.

53

00:03:16,560  -->  00:03:18,450
And now they all turn green.

54

00:03:18,450  -->  00:03:19,800
Perfect.

55

00:03:19,830  -->  00:03:24,530
So the last one that I'll demonstrate is toggle class which works just like.

56

00:03:24,540  -->  00:03:31,410
Class list toggle does where it takes a argument a class name and it will either apply that class or

57

00:03:31,410  -->  00:03:34,320
add it to the Elman or set of elements.

58

00:03:34,320  -->  00:03:39,150
If they don't have it yet and if they do have that class it will remove it.

59

00:03:39,150  -->  00:03:40,870
So let's try that now.

60

00:03:41,520  -->  00:03:47,990
Let's go and do a toggle so all allies toggle.

61

00:03:48,120  -->  00:03:49,550
Class.

62

00:03:49,620  -->  00:03:50,300
Correct.

63

00:03:50,340  -->  00:03:52,200
And they already have that class.

64

00:03:52,320  -->  00:03:53,470
So that will remove it.

65

00:03:53,520  -->  00:03:57,870
And if we run it again that will add it and remove it and add it and remove it.

66

00:03:57,870  -->  00:04:02,820
So let's try something a little bit different and only do it for the first ally.

67

00:04:02,820  -->  00:04:07,840
So Elijah it first which is just like the last that I showed you.

68

00:04:08,160  -->  00:04:13,630
And we'll toggle the class done.

69

00:04:14,190  -->  00:04:19,110
And so only the first one is great out and has that strikethrough effect.

70

00:04:19,110  -->  00:04:30,090
Now if I select all of them allies that toggle class done and I hit enter you can see that it toggles

71

00:04:30,120  -->  00:04:31,520
each one individually.

72

00:04:31,710  -->  00:04:33,290
So this one had the class done.

73

00:04:33,300  -->  00:04:36,310
So it was removed and these two didn't have the class.

74

00:04:36,390  -->  00:04:39,060
So it automatically added declasse.

75

00:04:39,540  -->  00:04:40,920
That's all I wanted to demonstrate.

76

00:04:40,920  -->  00:04:46,920
We have I'd class remove class and toggle class and they worked very similarly to how they did with

77

00:04:46,920  -->  00:04:48,310
class list with vanilla.

78

00:04:48,360  -->  00:04:49,040
Yes.

79

00:04:49,170  -->  00:04:54,570
The big difference like everything in J query is that we can act on a collection of elements without

80

00:04:54,570  -->  00:04:56,310
actually having to write the loop.

81

00:04:56,760  -->  00:04:57,380
OK.
