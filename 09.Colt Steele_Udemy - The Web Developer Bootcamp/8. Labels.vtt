00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:06.510
Okay so next up we're going to focus on labels and each HDMI forms so labels are exactly what they sound

2

00:00:06.510  -->  00:00:10.590
like they let us add captions to individual elements in our form.

3

00:00:10.590  -->  00:00:16.500
And the reason that we use them rather than just a paragraph or some plain text is that labels are really

4

00:00:16.500  -->  00:00:19.360
important for making our site accessible.

5

00:00:19.410  -->  00:00:24.500
So if someone is visually impaired or blind and they're accessing our forum trying to sign up their

6

00:00:24.500  -->  00:00:30.570
screen reader software that they're using is going to look for label tags and it's going to use those

7

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:34.980
labels to know what each part of the form corresponds to.

8

00:00:34.980  -->  00:00:36.960
So it's really important.

9

00:00:36.960  -->  00:00:41.970
It's also a nice way just to add a little caption as you can see here explaining what each part of the

10

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:43.530
form is used for.

11

00:00:43.530  -->  00:00:48.750
So there's two syntaxes we're going to cover the very first one looks like this.

12

00:00:48.750  -->  00:00:49.620
Create a label tag

13

00:00:52.740  -->  00:00:55.770
and then we actually put the input inside that label tag.

14

00:00:56.160  -->  00:00:59.820
So you might say something like your name

15

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:10.120
and then we're just going to take this username and put and put it inside and rather than do this it's

16

00:01:10.140  -->  00:01:17.100
a little bit better make things spaced out a little bit so that we see the true relationship between

17

00:01:17.100  -->  00:01:17.640
things.

18

00:01:17.860  -->  00:01:25.220
So we'll put password colon and then the password and put.

19

00:01:27.630  -->  00:01:28.410
And there we go.

20

00:01:28.410  -->  00:01:32.050
That's all we should need to do refresh the page.

21

00:01:32.160  -->  00:01:36.720
We now have two labels that correspond to our two inputs.

22

00:01:38.190  -->  00:01:44.110
So there is an alternate syntax rather than having your inputs nested inside of a label.

23

00:01:44.130  -->  00:01:49.340
We actually can do them completely separate and we connect them in a slightly different way.

24

00:01:49.380  -->  00:01:55.920
You can see here we have a label and it has a four attribute set equal to user name.

25

00:01:56.190  -->  00:01:59.510
And then we have an input with an ID equal to username.

26

00:01:59.730  -->  00:02:07.290
So as long as these two match screenwriter's and other accessibility software will know that this label

27

00:02:07.470  -->  00:02:12.950
that is for user name is corresponding to this input with ID username.

28

00:02:12.960  -->  00:02:19.590
So just to show you that I'm going to go ahead and just duplicate this commented out just so we have

29

00:02:19.590  -->  00:02:20.640
it.

30

00:02:20.640  -->  00:02:25.080
And then what I'm going to do is move the input tags so that they're separate from the labels.

31

00:02:25.110  -->  00:02:29.730
They're no longer contained inside of that label tag.

32

00:02:29.730  -->  00:02:34.330
So they're no longer nested inside of one another.

33

00:02:37.110  -->  00:02:38.020
OK.

34

00:02:38.550  -->  00:02:46.470
And the next thing is connecting them because right now although it will look the exact same for software

35

00:02:46.830  -->  00:02:51.560
for people who are visually impaired these are not the exact same because they're not actually connected

36

00:02:51.570  -->  00:02:56.990
there is no line connecting this label to this input.

37

00:02:57.000  -->  00:03:02.380
So in order to do that we use the four attribute let's say for user name.

38

00:03:03.240  -->  00:03:13.870
And then over here we need to say ID is user name and we'll do the same thing label for password.

39

00:03:14.370  -->  00:03:17.830
And just to be clear the name does not matter.

40

00:03:17.850  -->  00:03:20.760
We do want to make sure that it's nice and meaningful.

41

00:03:20.760  -->  00:03:25.260
It's not just jibberish but it does not matter as long as it matches the ID

42

00:03:30.330  -->  00:03:32.790
and refresh it looks exactly the same.

43

00:03:32.790  -->  00:03:35.670
But you can just trust our data is now connected.

44

00:03:35.670  -->  00:03:37.200
We have a label for every input
