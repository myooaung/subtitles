1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:05,190
It's time again for another quick exercise this time you'll get some practice with the basic command

2

00:00:05,190  -->  00:00:11,620
line commands like touch and CD and Ls and the other ones that we've talked about in the last few videos

3

00:00:11,630  -->  00:00:11,950
.

4

00:00:12,420  -->  00:00:17,040
As always I'll do a quick intro to the assignment and then you should post the video and do this one

5

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:17,790
on your own.

6

00:00:18,120  -->  00:00:21,250
So here's the assignment using only the command line.

7

00:00:21,360  -->  00:00:28,710
So no right clicking no file new file only the command line make a new folder called animals and then

8

00:00:28,710  -->  00:00:32,310
inside of the animals folder add two more directories.

9

00:00:32,520  -->  00:00:35,450
Awesome animals and sketchy animals.

10

00:00:35,730  -->  00:00:41,540
And then inside of the awesome animals directory I want you to add three different files Kappy Barakat

11

00:00:41,650  -->  00:00:46,890
J.S. arctic fox does Tim owl and tree frog TXI.

12

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:54,090
And then instead of the sketchy animals folder add to other files brown recluse that all very sketchy

13

00:00:54,090  -->  00:00:56,030
spider and bullet and Dot.

14

00:00:56,060  -->  00:00:57,080
Yes.

15

00:00:57,300  -->  00:01:04,740
Next inside of the sketchy animals directory create a new directory called snakes inside of that snakes

16

00:01:04,740  -->  00:01:10,880
directory create two files COBRA to see assess and articulate it Python.

17

00:01:12,150  -->  00:01:15,450
Then you decide that bullet ants are actually not sketchy.

18

00:01:15,540  -->  00:01:18,310
They're totally misunderstood and you want to clear their name.

19

00:01:18,510  -->  00:01:25,950
So you're going to remove the bullet and Dot G-S file and then the very last thing is that unfortunately

20

00:01:25,950  -->  00:01:31,200
all animal life goes extinct and you have to delete the entire animal's directory and everything inside

21

00:01:31,200  -->  00:01:32,880
of it.

22

00:01:32,910  -->  00:01:36,270
So just to reiterate this is all with only the command line.

23

00:01:36,480  -->  00:01:40,400
So you shouldn't use your mouse at all just typing commands right here.

24

00:01:40,530  -->  00:01:42,530
You should be able to do all of this.

25

00:01:42,870  -->  00:01:47,790
And then there's a bonus at the end which is to see if you can do the whole thing without ever using

26

00:01:47,790  -->  00:01:49,530
the cd command.

27

00:01:49,530  -->  00:01:51,390
All right so it's a video.

28

00:01:51,390  -->  00:01:53,460
Definitely give this one a shot in your own.

29

00:01:53,520  -->  00:01:56,500
It's really really important that you get comfortable with the command line.

30

00:01:56,520  -->  00:01:57,830
As soon as possible.

31

00:01:58,080  -->  00:02:03,610
And then when you're ready unposed video and I'll be here with a quick solution already.

32

00:02:03,660  -->  00:02:06,270
Let's go ahead and go over the solution.

33

00:02:06,270  -->  00:02:12,600
So the first thing is that we need to make a new folder named animals and I didn't specify where you

34

00:02:12,600  -->  00:02:15,090
needed to do this so it doesn't actually matter.

35

00:02:15,120  -->  00:02:21,210
I'm going to do it right where I am inside of Intro to command line to make a new folder named animals

36

00:02:21,210  -->  00:02:21,260
.

37

00:02:21,270  -->  00:02:26,730
It's M-K KTAR animals and then Rigaud type.

38

00:02:26,730  -->  00:02:30,110
LS You can see animals instead of animals.

39

00:02:30,180  -->  00:02:34,820
Add to directory's awesome animals and sketchy animals.

40

00:02:35,650  -->  00:02:38,090
So CD instead of animals.

41

00:02:39,000  -->  00:02:40,380
And then we'll add a directory.

42

00:02:40,410  -->  00:02:49,200
So M-K DA are awesome animals and Cadia are sketchy animals.

43

00:02:49,770  -->  00:02:56,010
For the record we could have combined those onto one line and just said M-K DA are awesome animals space

44

00:02:56,100  -->  00:03:00,840
sketchy animals and that would make two for us instead of awesome animals.

45

00:03:00,870  -->  00:03:02,110
Add three files.

46

00:03:02,220  -->  00:03:05,970
Let's go inside of Manimal so CD awesome.

47

00:03:05,970  -->  00:03:06,740
There we go.

48

00:03:07,050  -->  00:03:12,220
And butts touch Kappy Bara dot.

49

00:03:12,360  -->  00:03:25,580
I always wanted to touch one of those touch and arctic fox that HMO and touch tree frog Dot T S T.

50

00:03:26,310  -->  00:03:32,070
And again just like with make directory we could have combined those into one line by saying touch carefully

51

00:03:32,070  -->  00:03:38,290
Barcott J.S. space arctic fox space tree frog and that would create three files.

52

00:03:38,310  -->  00:03:39,390
Let's just double check.

53

00:03:39,400  -->  00:03:40,570
Type ls.

54

00:03:40,620  -->  00:03:42,680
There are three files recreated.

55

00:03:42,990  -->  00:03:49,340
Now we need to go inside of the sketchy animals and add brown recluse that aged him l and bullet anti-Jesus

56

00:03:49,580  -->  00:03:50,580
so well back out.

57

00:03:50,680  -->  00:03:52,560
The dot dot.

58

00:03:52,710  -->  00:03:59,790
Now we're inside of animals and we're gonna go instead of sketchy animals and it's totally empty so

59

00:03:59,790  -->  00:04:09,110
we're going to touch two files brown recluse that HMO and bullet ant.

60

00:04:09,210  -->  00:04:13,410
Yes and I'm going to do them this time on the same line.

61

00:04:13,620  -->  00:04:21,120
So just touch brown recluse that H.T. male space pull it and touch us if we type LS he can see both

62

00:04:21,120  -->  00:04:23,400
of them were created for us.

63

00:04:23,400  -->  00:04:31,200
Now the next part is inside of sketchy animals create a snake's directory so that M KTAR make directory

64

00:04:31,830  -->  00:04:32,400
snakes

65

00:04:35,430  -->  00:04:39,230
and then instead of the snakes directory create the following files.

66

00:04:39,240  -->  00:04:43,760
Cobra does the SS and reticulated python p y.

67

00:04:43,870  -->  00:04:50,730
So we'll go into the snake's directory just like that and will make co-productions us so touch.

68

00:04:50,730  -->  00:04:52,840
Cobra does S. S. S..

69

00:04:52,920  -->  00:05:04,740
Hope I never have to touch COBRA and reticulated python P Y which is python Yes it's a very funny joke

70

00:05:05,430  -->  00:05:08,940
and we'll hit Enter now we type.

71

00:05:09,120  -->  00:05:09,630
There we go.

72

00:05:09,620  -->  00:05:11,280
We have our two files created.

73

00:05:11,270  -->  00:05:14,670
We touched both COBRA and a python.

74

00:05:14,670  -->  00:05:18,860
Then we have a change of heart and decide that bullet ants are no longer sketchy.

75

00:05:18,930  -->  00:05:20,950
So we want to delete that file.

76

00:05:21,020  -->  00:05:25,020
So I'm going to back out of the snake's directory.

77

00:05:25,110  -->  00:05:31,190
Now I'm inside of the sketchy animal directory and I'm going to delete brown recluse that aged him l

78

00:05:31,310  -->  00:05:37,580
with R M R M and then use tab completion brown recluse said time I'll hit enter.

79

00:05:37,920  -->  00:05:44,760
It's now gone then will CD back and then unfortunately all animal life has gone extinct.

80

00:05:44,940  -->  00:05:48,630
And now we need to delete the entire animal directory.

81

00:05:48,620  -->  00:05:52,810
So I'm going to back out so that now I see the animals directory.

82

00:05:52,810  -->  00:05:53,460
I'm inside of.

83

00:05:53,450  -->  00:06:04,350
INTRO TO command line and to delete that I need to use r.m dash R.F. animals and there we go type ls

84

00:06:04,700  -->  00:06:07,750
and animals is completely gone.

85

00:06:07,800  -->  00:06:13,710
Now let's quickly discuss the bonus which was to do all of the commands without ever changing directories

86

00:06:13,880  -->  00:06:16,140
so never using the CD command.

87

00:06:16,190  -->  00:06:21,200
It's actually not difficult to do it the same exact commands but we have to reference different paths

88

00:06:21,230  -->  00:06:21,450
.

89

00:06:21,690  -->  00:06:24,930
So let me show you what I mean to make a new directory called animals.

90

00:06:24,930  -->  00:06:32,000
That's exactly the same to make directory animals but rather than seeing into animals to make awesome

91

00:06:32,000  -->  00:06:40,950
animals and sketchy animals we can do a make directory animals slash awesome animals just like that

92

00:06:41,570  -->  00:06:50,490
and make directory animals slash sketchy animals.

93

00:06:50,490  -->  00:06:55,000
Now if I just type LS here all we see is animals but I could type.

94

00:06:55,000  -->  00:06:56,970
LS animals.

95

00:06:57,000  -->  00:07:03,660
And now we see awesome animals and sketchy animals so inside of awesome animals we're going to add these

96

00:07:03,650  -->  00:07:05,560
three phials coffee bar.

97

00:07:05,670  -->  00:07:07,360
Arctic fox and tree frog.

98

00:07:07,640  -->  00:07:17,010
So without leaving this directory we're going to do a touch animals slash awesome animals.

99

00:07:17,250  -->  00:07:24,960
We can use tab completion slash Caffre Bara dot J us and then do the same thing animals slash awesome

100

00:07:24,960  -->  00:07:26,220
animals.

101

00:07:26,510  -->  00:07:29,440
Except this time Arctic fox.

102

00:07:29,890  -->  00:07:31,030
H m l.

103

00:07:31,310  -->  00:07:34,140
And then one more time and I'm hitting the up arrow here.

104

00:07:34,130  -->  00:07:39,360
Just like in the javascript Council we can hit the up arrow to retrieve the most recent commands and

105

00:07:39,360  -->  00:07:43,230
we can keep hitting it to cycle through everything in our history.

106

00:07:43,390  -->  00:07:51,270
So using that just to save some time and we're going to create a tree frog that TXI me again if I just

107

00:07:51,260  -->  00:07:52,260
type ls.

108

00:07:52,400  -->  00:07:53,580
All I see is animals.

109

00:07:53,610  -->  00:07:55,590
So if I do ls animals

110

00:07:58,130  -->  00:08:03,180
animals slash awesome animals I now have those three files.

111

00:08:03,180  -->  00:08:07,800
Next up is instead of sketchy animals and brown recluse and bullet ants.

112

00:08:07,940  -->  00:08:19,440
So will do touch animals slash sketchy animals slash brown recluse dot T.M. and the same thing except

113

00:08:20,220  -->  00:08:24,050
for a bullet ant that genius.

114

00:08:25,010  -->  00:08:32,940
And then to verify that we can do an ls animals slash sketchy animals and we see both the files there

115

00:08:33,170  -->  00:08:36,120
without ever leaving our insured to command line directory.

116

00:08:36,140  -->  00:08:38,080
We're still right here.

117

00:08:38,630  -->  00:08:38,950
All right.

118

00:08:38,970  -->  00:08:40,660
Now onto my least favorite part.

119

00:08:40,800  -->  00:08:42,970
We have to create the snake's directory.

120

00:08:42,970  -->  00:08:50,540
There so sketchy they need their own directory here so we're going to make directory animals slash sketchy

121

00:08:50,550  -->  00:08:59,300
animals slash snakes and that will make us a directory and you can see that here instead of sketchy

122

00:08:59,310  -->  00:09:02,950
animals we now have a sneaky directory.

123

00:09:02,970  -->  00:09:09,090
Now instead of that snake's directory we need to make Cobra does s.c.s and reticulated python Python

124

00:09:09,100  -->  00:09:09,330
.

125

00:09:09,600  -->  00:09:20,240
So we're going to do a touch animals slash Sketchley animals slash snakes slash Cobra C Ss and the same

126

00:09:20,250  -->  00:09:28,820
thing except reticulated python I don't think it could have picked a longer animal name there.

127

00:09:28,830  -->  00:09:37,170
Now we can verify that with an us animals sketchy animals snakes and we get those two files.

128

00:09:37,230  -->  00:09:41,490
Next up we're going to delete the bullet and Jacque's file.

129

00:09:41,490  -->  00:09:44,960
So we still use r.m but we have do the full path.

130

00:09:45,060  -->  00:09:52,000
So animals slash sketchy animals slash bullet and thought genius.

131

00:09:52,430  -->  00:10:02,480
Now if I do ls animals slash Sketchley animals you can see that it's gone now.

132

00:10:02,510  -->  00:10:05,950
The easy part is to delete the entire animal's directory.

133

00:10:06,240  -->  00:10:07,860
You don't have to do anything fancy.

134

00:10:07,860  -->  00:10:17,160
All we need to do is r.m dash R.F. animals and we've now wiped out all animal life on this planet.

135

00:10:17,370  -->  00:10:18,830
You monster.

136

00:10:18,990  -->  00:10:20,820
All right so that's it for the exercise.

137

00:10:21,060  -->  00:10:26,480
Hopefully that was some good practice for you if at any point you struggled to recall or to use any

138

00:10:26,490  -->  00:10:28,350
of the commands that we talked about.

139

00:10:28,350  -->  00:10:30,220
I highly highly recommend that case.

140

00:10:30,240  -->  00:10:34,760
I cannot recommend it enough that you take some time away from this video.

141

00:10:34,760  -->  00:10:37,020
Don't move on just yet and practice.
