00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:01.440
OK we'll come back.

2

00:00:01.470  -->  00:00:03.590
So we have one less method that I want to talk about.

3

00:00:03.740  -->  00:00:09.160
As I mentioned in the introduction video to J Korea events the on method is what we'll be using.

4

00:00:09.200  -->  00:00:13.980
Ninety nine percent of the time it's by far the most used Jay queery event method.

5

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:14.490
OK.

6

00:00:14.490  -->  00:00:18.580
So let's talk about how it works on is very similar to the vanilla.

7

00:00:18.620  -->  00:00:20.790
Yes an event listener.

8

00:00:20.790  -->  00:00:22.270
Obviously it's a lot shorter.

9

00:00:22.290  -->  00:00:28.200
It's just two characters but it behaves in a similar way where we give it the name of the event that

10

00:00:28.200  -->  00:00:29.590
we want to listen for it.

11

00:00:29.760  -->  00:00:37.650
So unlike click or key press which only will fire on one type of an event click or a keypress on allows

12

00:00:37.650  -->  00:00:45.780
us to specify if we're doing a click like we're doing here submit on click or if we're doing a double

13

00:00:45.780  -->  00:00:53.730
click like I have here button on double click or a drag start or a key press so it can take the place

14

00:00:53.730  -->  00:00:58.760
of all of the things you've already seen with click and key press and all the other methods here.

15

00:00:58.870  -->  00:01:06.670
There's a ton of them like scroll and submit and toggle key press creeky up key down.

16

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:10.410
All of that can be done with just the on method.

17

00:01:10.410  -->  00:01:15.480
It works pretty much the same way though where we need to select something with dollar sign first.

18

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:17.450
So I'll show you an example here.

19

00:01:17.730  -->  00:01:23.490
We select something in this case all the teachers inside of the body inside of something with the idea

20

00:01:23.490  -->  00:01:28.500
of data table and then we run it on and then the type of the event.

21

00:01:28.500  -->  00:01:33.740
So this is new compared to click and key press which only take a callback function.

22

00:01:33.840  -->  00:01:36.560
We have to specify what event we're listening for.

23

00:01:36.750  -->  00:01:40.810
So click in this case and then comma the callback function.

24

00:01:40.830  -->  00:01:42.550
We want to be run.

25

00:01:42.660  -->  00:01:45.930
So let's try this out to refresh my page.

26

00:01:45.930  -->  00:01:47.100
My AJ quarried demo.

27

00:01:47.130  -->  00:01:51.390
So we have no click listeners so no clicks we have no keypresses.

28

00:01:51.390  -->  00:01:53.350
Nothing happens on our buttons either.

29

00:01:53.760  -->  00:01:57.600
Let's go and try and add some quick listeners first.

30

00:01:57.630  -->  00:02:00.660
Let's change the color of the H-1 when we click on it.

31

00:02:00.720  -->  00:02:10.230
So we need to select each one and then we're going to do on the first argument is the event type which

32

00:02:10.230  -->  00:02:13.570
is quick and then our callback function.

33

00:02:13.950  -->  00:02:20.640
And inside the callback function if we wanted to change the color of the H-1 we could do something like

34

00:02:20.640  -->  00:02:30.750
this where we just say H-1 gutsiest us Color Purple and see if you can think of why this might be a

35

00:02:30.750  -->  00:02:31.260
problem.

36

00:02:31.320  -->  00:02:38.880
So I'll hit enter and it works just fine it turns purple but I'm going to copy this code and refresh

37

00:02:38.880  -->  00:02:44.700
the page and I'm going to add in another H-1 three of them and save.

38

00:02:44.790  -->  00:02:46.340
Now we have three H-1.

39

00:02:46.770  -->  00:02:55.160
And if I run this code again says any H-1 when we click on it change all h ones to be purple.

40

00:02:55.200  -->  00:02:57.060
So I'll try that.

41

00:02:57.090  -->  00:03:02.910
They all change to purple which maybe is a feature that we want but most of the time we want to affect

42

00:03:03.060  -->  00:03:04.670
the one item that we click on.

43

00:03:04.950  -->  00:03:13.830
So to do that all refresh we need to use the keyword this and remember it needs to be the J query wrapper

44

00:03:13.980  -->  00:03:14.790
for this.

45

00:03:14.790  -->  00:03:21.600
So dollar sign parentheses this and that refers to the one H-1 or the one thing that was clicked on

46

00:03:21.620  -->  00:03:22.160
.

47

00:03:22.180  -->  00:03:28.400
And now if I hit enter and I try clicking only the correct H-1 changes to purple.

48

00:03:29.040  -->  00:03:31.770
OK so that's how we can use on to do a click.

49

00:03:31.770  -->  00:03:34.150
Now let's see how to use it for a key press.

50

00:03:34.290  -->  00:03:35.760
So we'll select our input

51

00:03:38.610  -->  00:03:50.070
like that dot on and then we'll add key press and the second argument is the callback function and we'll

52

00:03:50.070  -->  00:03:51.740
just do a simple conses log.

53

00:03:51.870  -->  00:03:59.170
So cancel the log key pressed just like that and we'll hit enter.

54

00:03:59.200  -->  00:04:06.540
Now if I go type a key in here I get he pressed every time I type a key.

55

00:04:06.540  -->  00:04:09.740
Let's try one more type of event here I'll refresh.

56

00:04:10.080  -->  00:04:12.190
Let's do something when we hover over a button.

57

00:04:12.390  -->  00:04:15.770
We'll change the font to be bolded when I hover.

58

00:04:15.840  -->  00:04:21.670
So we need to first select all the buttons just like that and then add our on.

59

00:04:21.880  -->  00:04:24.730
And the event that we'll use is called Mouse enter.

60

00:04:24.930  -->  00:04:25.860
Just like that.

61

00:04:26.280  -->  00:04:31.280
And we'll start with just cancelled out logging when the mouse enters.

62

00:04:31.290  -->  00:04:38.240
So we'll do a built log mouse enter like that.

63

00:04:38.610  -->  00:04:44.090
And now if I hover over I get a mouse enter just like that.

64

00:04:44.340  -->  00:04:46.420
And it's only when we first enter the element.

65

00:04:46.680  -->  00:04:50.300
So it doesn't keep triggering over and over until I leave and come back.

66

00:04:50.750  -->  00:04:51.060
OK.

67

00:04:51.060  -->  00:04:55.450
So when we do mouse enter we're not going to want to constantly log.

68

00:04:55.470  -->  00:05:02.880
We're going to want to select the J very wrapper for this and do the SS too bold something we need to

69

00:05:02.880  -->  00:05:04.140
change the font weight.

70

00:05:04.350  -->  00:05:13.020
So fun ways and we'll make that fold just like that and hit enter.

71

00:05:13.020  -->  00:05:18.310
Now if I hover it's hard to see what it changes to be bold.

72

00:05:18.390  -->  00:05:21.200
Of course it stays bold it never changes back.

73

00:05:21.390  -->  00:05:29.670
So we could add that feature by doing the same thing with button on mouse leave which is another event

74

00:05:30.150  -->  00:05:32.040
and then rather than changing it to font weight.

75

00:05:32.040  -->  00:05:32.670
Bold.

76

00:05:32.670  -->  00:05:36.800
We can change it back to normal just like that.

77

00:05:36.810  -->  00:05:40.420
Now if I leave it goes back to normal.

78

00:05:40.830  -->  00:05:43.530
And if I enter as bold I leave it's normal.

79

00:05:43.950  -->  00:05:50.610
So this is how we could do something with javascript to do a sort of like hover selection effect.

80

00:05:50.670  -->  00:05:57.000
However with CSSA now we can easily do that without any javascript at all with the hover pseudo selector

81

00:05:57.000  -->  00:05:57.490
.

82

00:05:57.490  -->  00:06:00.510
And I just wanted to demonstrate that there are other events out there.

83

00:06:00.720  -->  00:06:06.060
So all the events that we could use with an event listener we can use with on which makes it really

84

00:06:06.060  -->  00:06:06.890
really useful.

85

00:06:06.990  -->  00:06:09.500
As I mentioned we'll be using it all the time.

86

00:06:09.840  -->  00:06:14.690
So there is one last point I'd like to make about on and as an example I'm going to use.

87

00:06:14.690  -->  00:06:16.440
Click and on.

88

00:06:16.440  -->  00:06:19.510
Click and talk about how they are slightly different.

89

00:06:19.800  -->  00:06:22.230
So they they both will generally work for you.

90

00:06:22.230  -->  00:06:28.290
They'll add a quick listener but there is a small difference which is that click will only add click

91

00:06:28.290  -->  00:06:31.590
listeners for elements that are on the page at that time.

92

00:06:32.040  -->  00:06:37.790
And the on click will add listeners for all future elements or potential future elements.

93

00:06:37.980  -->  00:06:40.430
So this will make sense when you make the to do list.

94

00:06:40.530  -->  00:06:47.010
But basically we need to use dot on click rather than click because we're going to have to do's that

95

00:06:47.010  -->  00:06:52.060
are added to the page that aren't there when the page loads a user types into a form and hits enter

96

00:06:52.070  -->  00:06:52.190
.

97

00:06:52.260  -->  00:06:57.090
And that will make a new to do and we want those new to do to have their own click listeners.

98

00:06:57.090  -->  00:07:01.930
So we need to use on again that will make more sense when we actually started to do list.
