00:00:00,750  -->  00:00:06,120
Welcome back in this lesson I'm going to show you one of the most important and widely used components

2

00:00:06,120  -->  00:00:12,290
in all of Bootstrap which is the NFR so you can see actually on get Boucek dotcom.

3

00:00:12,450  -->  00:00:15,980
They use enough bar component right here.

4

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:21,900
We're also going to use one on our Yelp camp application and as I resized the nav bar.

5

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:28,980
Notice how responsive it is and then also notice as soon as I hit TAB what size and mobile size we get

6

00:00:28,980  -->  00:00:30,700
this nice hamburger.

7

00:00:30,720  -->  00:00:33,020
So we'll be working towards all of that in this lesson.

8

00:00:33,180  -->  00:00:34,890
But we're going to start simpler.

9

00:00:34,890  -->  00:00:42,480
First thing we need to do is go to components and go to nav bar and before we go much further I have

10

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:46,290
created a new file just because we'll be writing quite a bit of code.

11

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:48,150
The old one was getting cluttered.

12

00:00:48,150  -->  00:00:50,620
I'm calling it naff Bar H T M L.

13

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:56,030
Inside all they have is the link to bootstrap not change the title here.

14

00:00:56,630  -->  00:01:00,980
I'll just call it bootstrap Nav bars.

15

00:01:01,350  -->  00:01:02,910
Just like that.

16

00:01:02,910  -->  00:01:07,580
Now let's go to the docs and take a look at the default nav bar.

17

00:01:08,220  -->  00:01:13,460
So this example here showcases all of the important features where we can have a brand link.

18

00:01:13,560  -->  00:01:15,800
We can have other links we can have dropped on menus.

19

00:01:15,930  -->  00:01:20,940
We can have a nav bar form and a button we can have things that are on the right side things that are

20

00:01:20,940  -->  00:01:22,010
on the left side.

21

00:01:22,020  -->  00:01:23,720
This really showcases everything.

22

00:01:23,790  -->  00:01:30,330
It's the kitchen sink of bootstrap naff bars and consequently the markup is a little bit long.

23

00:01:30,390  -->  00:01:33,530
We will be working with all of these pieces by the end of this video.

24

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:37,790
But I want to start simpler and I'll start by showing you the simplest way to make a number.

25

00:01:38,040  -->  00:01:46,470
So we need to make a nav element and that NAV element needs to have two classes we want nav bar and

26

00:01:46,470  -->  00:01:51,550
nav bar and we can start with Dasch default will save.

27

00:01:51,550  -->  00:01:54,920
And now let's go look at the file in the browser and refresh.

28

00:01:55,200  -->  00:02:00,690
You can see I hope it comes across and screencast there's enough bar very faint bar going across the

29

00:02:00,690  -->  00:02:04,860
top so that's that that's how we actually initialize NF bar.

30

00:02:04,860  -->  00:02:06,980
Now let's fill it with some content.

31

00:02:07,050  -->  00:02:11,640
The first thing we'll take a look at is how we can add in this brand here.

32

00:02:11,790  -->  00:02:13,180
Basically your company name.

33

00:02:13,230  -->  00:02:14,320
In most cases.

34

00:02:14,900  -->  00:02:20,830
And that's using a nav bar header and then inside the NFR header we use a nav bar brand.

35

00:02:20,850  -->  00:02:32,160
So let's start by adding that div class equals nav bar dash header and then inside of there we're going

36

00:02:32,160  -->  00:02:35,910
to add in nav bar brand which is an anchor tag.

37

00:02:35,910  -->  00:02:39,440
Usually when you click on that company name it takes you back to the home page.

38

00:02:39,660  -->  00:02:44,760
So we'll do that here anchor tag and we'll start with a traffic equal to the Thorpes so it doesn't take

39

00:02:44,760  -->  00:02:45,840
us anywhere.

40

00:02:45,870  -->  00:02:52,890
Class will equal nav bar dash brand and we'll just make up a company name.

41

00:02:52,890  -->  00:02:57,170
Let's see if I got a coffee cup around me so let's go with coffee.

42

00:02:57,270  -->  00:03:02,210
But to actually make it a true startup we need to change the spelling a little bit.

43

00:03:02,400  -->  00:03:03,180
OK Alex.

44

00:03:03,180  -->  00:03:03,990
Good enough for me.

45

00:03:04,020  -->  00:03:05,350
Coffee with a K.

46

00:03:05,760  -->  00:03:07,420
Let's go take a look.

47

00:03:07,590  -->  00:03:11,830
Refresh and we now have our NAV bar brand which is a link.

48

00:03:11,940  -->  00:03:12,880
I click on it.

49

00:03:13,010  -->  00:03:17,250
It doesn't take me anywhere right now but eventually our applications will have it so that when you

50

00:03:17,250  -->  00:03:20,940
click the company name it takes you back to the home page next.

51

00:03:20,940  -->  00:03:24,480
Let's see if we can add in some other links like contact about.

52

00:03:24,510  -->  00:03:25,660
Sign up for register.

53

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:27,490
All those common links in the bar.

54

00:03:27,660  -->  00:03:31,190
Let's start by adding in about page link right here.

55

00:03:31,500  -->  00:03:37,620
So we'll go back and then outside of the nav bar header we're going to make another div in this div

56

00:03:37,620  -->  00:03:41,600
will collect all of the content at least on the left side of our NAV bar.

57

00:03:41,760  -->  00:03:46,410
So we have the header and then we'll have some content and then if we want something on the right side

58

00:03:46,500  -->  00:03:48,960
we'll have another div that has another class.

59

00:03:48,960  -->  00:03:50,010
So the class here.

60

00:03:50,070  -->  00:03:56,730
Actually two we want nav and nav bar dash nav.

61

00:03:56,850  -->  00:04:00,170
Don't ask me about the naming their nav bar dash nav.

62

00:04:00,210  -->  00:04:05,040
It's one of the big criticisms of bootstrap is that it's a little bit ugly and it's not very meaningful

63

00:04:05,040  -->  00:04:05,940
sometimes.

64

00:04:06,030  -->  00:04:12,030
And there's actually a CSSA framework that was created in response to the semantic meaninglessness of

65

00:04:12,030  -->  00:04:14,630
bootstrap if you will called semantic UI.

66

00:04:14,910  -->  00:04:16,660
And that's one that I really enjoy as well.

67

00:04:16,710  -->  00:04:18,070
And I debated teaching.

68

00:04:18,420  -->  00:04:22,190
But in the end it's just not as widely used there aren't as great tutorials yet.

69

00:04:22,200  -->  00:04:23,550
So back to our diff here.

70

00:04:23,590  -->  00:04:27,600
Class nav bar nav and the class nav both of those.

71

00:04:27,690  -->  00:04:34,710
And then for each item that we want on this NFR we need to add an ally and then inside the Y if we want

72

00:04:34,710  -->  00:04:36,850
to link we've just had an anchor tag.

73

00:04:37,050  -->  00:04:38,810
So this one will just go nowhere.

74

00:04:38,850  -->  00:04:42,280
Once again and this will be to the About page.

75

00:04:42,500  -->  00:04:53,550
And if I go back and refresh we now have a link to about let's add one more to contact save go back

76

00:04:53,560  -->  00:04:54,120
.

77

00:04:54,570  -->  00:04:58,950
Now we have two links now let's go ahead and add something to the right side of the page.

78

00:04:59,160  -->  00:05:05,340
Let's add two links one for register or sign up and another for log in on the right side of the bar

79

00:05:06,840  -->  00:05:07,630
to do that.

80

00:05:07,690  -->  00:05:13,370
We need a nother container here and actually instead of using divs it's more conventional to use an

81

00:05:13,630  -->  00:05:19,150
you will it will work the exact same way but you want to have allies instead of a well even though they'll

82

00:05:19,140  -->  00:05:23,570
work just fine with a div makes a little more sense to be instead of a UL.

83

00:05:23,620  -->  00:05:32,010
So we're going to add another UL and this one is going to be Nav. nav bar dash nav and then nav bar

84

00:05:32,100  -->  00:05:32,700
dash.

85

00:05:32,760  -->  00:05:33,570
Right.

86

00:05:33,660  -->  00:05:38,280
And we need to make sure we spell that correctly otherwise that class won't take effect.

87

00:05:38,280  -->  00:05:42,960
So what this will do is make us a new group of content for the right side of that nav bar.

88

00:05:43,120  -->  00:05:44,540
And now we just need to fill it.

89

00:05:44,550  -->  00:05:47,750
So I'll add two links both in edgewise.

90

00:05:47,820  -->  00:05:55,510
The first one will go nowhere and it will say sign up and then we'll have another one that just says

91

00:05:55,770  -->  00:05:56,550
log in.

92

00:05:56,940  -->  00:05:58,080
Let's take a look.

93

00:05:58,290  -->  00:06:01,630
Refresh the page and you can see we have content on the right.

94

00:06:01,650  -->  00:06:07,710
However it's right up against the edge and to fix that we can add in a container to enough bar just

95

00:06:07,710  -->  00:06:12,220
like we use the container earlier to add some spacing to our main content.

96

00:06:12,220  -->  00:06:14,190
We could add one instead of a nav bar.

97

00:06:14,400  -->  00:06:17,730
So I put everything in the neph bar instead of a container.

98

00:06:17,740  -->  00:06:20,800
So class equals container.

99

00:06:21,060  -->  00:06:22,430
Just move this down.

100

00:06:22,560  -->  00:06:26,180
Make sure everything is indented properly.

101

00:06:26,190  -->  00:06:27,770
There we go.

102

00:06:27,780  -->  00:06:30,930
Let's test it out.

103

00:06:30,930  -->  00:06:31,430
Nice.

104

00:06:31,440  -->  00:06:33,910
So now everything is centered nice and correctly.

105

00:06:34,140  -->  00:06:41,940
I will show you if I did add the container outside the nav and they put the entire nav bar inside.

106

00:06:42,880  -->  00:06:43,650
Well see what happens.

107

00:06:43,660  -->  00:06:49,950
Now if I were fresh enough bars I actually cut off and only goes part of the way across the street.

108

00:06:50,460  -->  00:06:53,460
So container will do that to whatever we put inside of it.

109

00:06:53,670  -->  00:06:59,640
And in this case we want the container inside of the nav bar so that it's not constricting the actual

110

00:06:59,640  -->  00:07:03,820
naff part self but it is restricting the content inside of it.

111

00:07:04,440  -->  00:07:04,950
OK.

112

00:07:05,060  -->  00:07:11,250
So container we have our Hetter we have the stuff on the left and we have some content on the right

113

00:07:11,990  -->  00:07:13,060
so you can see here.

114

00:07:13,290  -->  00:07:20,050
Now what step it up a little bit and go and take this basic nav bar or the default nav bar that they

115

00:07:20,040  -->  00:07:28,850
have in the docs and let's copy this entire thing and I'll just put it right below are now far make

116

00:07:28,900  -->  00:07:29,670
some space.

117

00:07:29,670  -->  00:07:33,010
A lot of comment to make it clearer.

118

00:07:33,250  -->  00:07:35,510
Default nav bar.

119

00:07:36,060  -->  00:07:40,280
And let's take a look at it refresh.

120

00:07:40,560  -->  00:07:44,580
So it's this nav bar here and there's a few things I want to highlight.

121

00:07:44,580  -->  00:07:48,690
One is that we have dropped on menus but they don't actually work.

122

00:07:48,900  -->  00:07:53,300
And also as we resize the window we get the hamburger menu here.

123

00:07:53,550  -->  00:07:54,740
Those links go away.

124

00:07:54,750  -->  00:07:58,630
The form goes away and to reveal them we need to click here.

125

00:07:58,830  -->  00:08:00,480
But that doesn't work either.

126

00:08:00,960  -->  00:08:05,890
So let's begin by getting it to work and then we'll talk about all these different pieces and what they

127

00:08:05,880  -->  00:08:07,570
do to make it work.

128

00:08:07,590  -->  00:08:10,550
We need to go and include the bootstrap javascript file.

129

00:08:10,830  -->  00:08:15,660
So if we go back to the bootstrap docs We'll click on download.

130

00:08:15,780  -->  00:08:19,800
There's also a javascript file that we need which is right here.

131

00:08:19,800  -->  00:08:24,460
I'll use the Cdn version but it also comes inside the folder that you download.

132

00:08:24,510  -->  00:08:25,700
It's just called bootstrapped.

133

00:08:25,810  -->  00:08:26,220
Yes.

134

00:08:26,250  -->  00:08:29,890
Or the minimized version bootstrapped up Mencius.

135

00:08:30,420  -->  00:08:36,210
And let's add that and we'll do it down at the bottom of our body and save.

136

00:08:36,210  -->  00:08:38,280
And I know we haven't talked about javascript.

137

00:08:38,380  -->  00:08:42,860
You don't know what a script is and what source here does it doesn't matter.

138

00:08:42,900  -->  00:08:44,710
We're just going to plug it into bootstrap.

139

00:08:44,910  -->  00:08:46,550
And now our refresh.

140

00:08:46,710  -->  00:08:52,590
Can we solve one small problem which I'll show you here tells us that bootstraps javascript requires

141

00:08:52,700  -->  00:08:53,470
query.

142

00:08:53,790  -->  00:08:56,180
Don't worry about what this is and how it got to this message.

143

00:08:56,250  -->  00:08:59,970
But I just want to show it to you so that you see the actual message we get.

144

00:08:59,970  -->  00:09:03,240
We need to require J query which we also haven't talked about.

145

00:09:03,580  -->  00:09:05,360
But it's easy enough to go and get.

146

00:09:05,400  -->  00:09:07,140
We don't have to write any javascript.

147

00:09:07,170  -->  00:09:08,830
You don't have to know any javascript.

148

00:09:08,830  -->  00:09:10,180
We just have to include it.

149

00:09:10,230  -->  00:09:18,200
So all we need to do is search for Jay queries CDN which is on code that Jay dot com and down here will

150

00:09:18,200  -->  00:09:23,890
need to select the most recent version and copy this URL.

151

00:09:23,910  -->  00:09:30,150
This is the Querrey file and then we'll go back down here.

152

00:09:30,150  -->  00:09:32,560
We're going to add another one of these script tags.

153

00:09:32,640  -->  00:09:34,410
Basically copying this exact code.

154

00:09:34,410  -->  00:09:40,670
In fact I'll do that to make it easier to duplicate that exact line and change this url to be the jey

155

00:09:40,680  -->  00:09:42,030
query you are.

156

00:09:42,610  -->  00:09:44,530
If all else fails you can just type this out.

157

00:09:44,560  -->  00:09:51,220
It's not that bad if a you are l but I got this by searching for Jay queery CDN and will save and this

158

00:09:51,210  -->  00:09:56,290
does need to come before bootstraps javascript file because it relies on a query.

159

00:09:56,560  -->  00:10:00,370
So one more time don't worry too much about what it is how it works what Jay query is.

160

00:10:00,450  -->  00:10:02,150
That's all coming up a few minutes from now.

161

00:10:02,430  -->  00:10:06,550
But to get the most out of bootstrap and in particular the nav bars and the dropdown menu.

162

00:10:06,750  -->  00:10:13,210
We just need to have these two lines any time we're using it so we'll go back now and refresh.

163

00:10:13,230  -->  00:10:18,850
First of all are dropped on menus now work as you can see we now have dropdown menus.

164

00:10:18,880  -->  00:10:24,430
We're not going to talk about that in this video but as I resize and I get that hamburger.

165

00:10:25,050  -->  00:10:26,980
The hamburger now works when I click on it.

166

00:10:26,980  -->  00:10:29,480
It toggles that hidden material.

167

00:10:29,560  -->  00:10:36,850
So the way that it works right here there's this little breakpoint right here where all of this content

168

00:10:36,880  -->  00:10:43,280
hides and all that we see is the header and that button.

169

00:10:43,380  -->  00:10:48,870
And then when we click on the button all that previously hidden content reappears Let's get that to

170

00:10:48,880  -->  00:10:49,120
work.

171

00:10:49,120  -->  00:10:50,650
Now for us.

172

00:10:50,950  -->  00:10:55,930
But we're going to do a much less complicated version where we just want to hide these four links so

173

00:10:55,930  -->  00:11:01,960
that when we resize these four links are hidden and then really quick they'll be displayed.

174

00:11:02,250  -->  00:11:07,830
To do that going to start by taking a look at how is it accomplishes in this default version this giant

175

00:11:07,840  -->  00:11:09,830
monster of a nav bar.

176

00:11:10,380  -->  00:11:13,650
And I'll just point out the important line right here.

177

00:11:13,760  -->  00:11:22,090
Div class collapse nav bar collapse whatever we put inside of this div will be collapsed when we hit

178

00:11:22,090  -->  00:11:24,850
Mobile size so it won't make the button for us.

179

00:11:24,850  -->  00:11:30,040
It won't do the toggling in the re-appearing in hiding but it will hide whatever content we put inside

180

00:11:30,040  -->  00:11:33,470
of it when we hit that tablet and mobile size.

181

00:11:33,650  -->  00:11:38,500
So we're going to copy this and we just need to wrap it around the content we want to hide and we want

182

00:11:38,500  -->  00:11:40,320
to hide this here.

183

00:11:40,330  -->  00:11:49,980
These two Juelz So the four links we want to hide when we hit that smaller screen size.

184

00:11:50,440  -->  00:11:56,800
So add in the closing tag and save and there is a line here and this is important and I'll get to it

185

00:11:56,830  -->  00:11:57,820
in just a moment.

186

00:11:57,850  -->  00:12:01,230
It won't impact us just yet but if we refresh.

187

00:12:01,690  -->  00:12:02,160
You'll see.

188

00:12:02,170  -->  00:12:09,790
Now when I resize there is a point right here where all that content inside of the collapse div goes

189

00:12:09,790  -->  00:12:10,650
away.

190

00:12:10,680  -->  00:12:11,650
Now it doesn't reappear.

191

00:12:11,640  -->  00:12:13,180
We don't get this hamburger.

192

00:12:13,330  -->  00:12:16,940
We don't get a click on anything but it has collapsed it's gone away.

193

00:12:17,050  -->  00:12:24,580
And that's because we added in this line here div class collapse nav bar collapse.

194

00:12:24,630  -->  00:12:29,780
Next thing we need to do is add in the hamburger and it is quite a bit of code.

195

00:12:29,780  -->  00:12:33,010
Unfortunately it's still much better than if we had to do it ourselves.

196

00:12:33,280  -->  00:12:37,220
But the hamburger is actually all of this right here.

197

00:12:37,800  -->  00:12:48,660
So I'm going to copy that and paste it on up inside of a nap or Hetter before our coffee incontact.

198

00:12:48,970  -->  00:12:52,420
And we'll save I'll come back to what it does.

199

00:12:53,320  -->  00:12:54,680
Let's just refresh.

200

00:12:55,140  -->  00:12:57,910
And now if I resize I get the hamburger.

201

00:12:58,120  -->  00:13:00,280
There we go.

202

00:13:00,310  -->  00:13:03,240
Now let me explain a little bit about how it works.

203

00:13:03,250  -->  00:13:09,700
So there's a button and then inside that button there's three spans and each one is responsible for

204

00:13:09,700  -->  00:13:13,000
making one of these bars.

205

00:13:13,210  -->  00:13:18,510
So it's not an image that we're seeing here it's actually each team that's making this little spand

206

00:13:18,670  -->  00:13:21,780
that are being styled into those narrow bars to make that hamburger.

207

00:13:22,030  -->  00:13:26,530
And then as far as the showing and hiding of the content when we click on it what's really important

208

00:13:26,950  -->  00:13:34,310
is that we have this data target attribute and whatever this is set to in our case B-S example.

209

00:13:34,310  -->  00:13:41,700
Now for our collapse one bootstrap example net for our club so and let's just change it to yes.

210

00:13:42,180  -->  00:13:44,330
Nav. demo just like that.

211

00:13:44,470  -->  00:13:48,880
Then we need to change the ID of the content that we want to actually collapse that we want to show

212

00:13:48,880  -->  00:13:49,810
and hide.

213

00:13:49,870  -->  00:13:57,310
So I'll change it to match vs nav demo.

214

00:13:57,340  -->  00:13:59,710
Notice one important difference.

215

00:13:59,710  -->  00:14:05,860
We're not adding in the Arctic Thor So it's just like CSI s when we select something with C says we

216

00:14:05,860  -->  00:14:11,420
need to use that Octa Thorpe to target an ID so we leave the ID as just the text the name.

217

00:14:11,440  -->  00:14:18,120
Now if demo here we add that to Thorpe it will save refresh.

218

00:14:18,120  -->  00:14:24,600
Now if I resize we get the hamburger and they click on it and it works to toggle that showing and hiding

219

00:14:24,610  -->  00:14:25,490
.

220

00:14:26,250  -->  00:14:27,040
Great.

221

00:14:27,070  -->  00:14:32,400
The last thing that will show to you is that if we move something outside of this collapse.

222

00:14:32,470  -->  00:14:35,710
So let's take these links here.

223

00:14:36,070  -->  00:14:44,100
The account or the about and contact and we just move those right here outside of the collapse div and

224

00:14:44,110  -->  00:14:53,310
I refresh can see that they don't actually collapse they stay there and then I click on that and the

225

00:14:53,320  -->  00:14:55,710
other two that are instead of the collapse are toggled.

226

00:14:55,720  -->  00:15:00,390
Now I'm not saying this looks good but it does illustrate the importance of that collapse div..

227

00:15:00,630  -->  00:15:06,480
So whatever happened side of collapse or whatever we have in our case for different links to that are

228

00:15:06,490  -->  00:15:08,160
on the right to the or on the left.

229

00:15:08,160  -->  00:15:12,070
They all will collapse whenever we hit that smaller mobile size.

230

00:15:12,070  -->  00:15:18,250
And then to make them show again we click on this button here and that button has a data target attribute

231

00:15:18,490  -->  00:15:23,570
and whatever ID this corresponds to will be hidden and shown when we click on that.

232

00:15:24,010  -->  00:15:25,930
And that happens to be this idea here.

233

00:15:26,440  -->  00:15:28,230
OK so kind of a marathon.

234

00:15:28,270  -->  00:15:30,750
A lot of stuff that goes into making a bootstrap nav bar.

235

00:15:30,970  -->  00:15:36,940
But again the way we got there was just by straight up copying this into our file and dissecting pieces

236

00:15:36,940  -->  00:15:37,450
of it.

237

00:15:37,540  -->  00:15:42,160
And that's how we make enough are pretty much every time we just take that example code and figure out

238

00:15:42,150  -->  00:15:44,080
what pieces we need and go from there.
