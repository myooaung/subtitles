00:00:00.070  -->  00:00:04.860
Well come back in this lesson we're going to continue to work on yo camp but we're not going to add

2

00:00:04.890  -->  00:00:06.620
any new features or functionality.

3

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:09.220
We're just going to refactor existing code.

4

00:00:09.240  -->  00:00:14.460
So I've been talking about refactoring the routes and our app J.S. for a long time and it's just grown

5

00:00:14.460  -->  00:00:19.410
more and more out of control and we have enough code here that it warrants refactoring it and we're

6

00:00:19.410  -->  00:00:20.750
going to focus on the routes.

7

00:00:21.000  -->  00:00:25.000
So let me just highlight the different groups of routes that we have right now.

8

00:00:25.050  -->  00:00:32.790
We have our authentication routes about 40 something lines here and we have a comment routes right there

9

00:00:32.790  -->  00:00:33.690
.

10

00:00:33.690  -->  00:00:39.860
And then we also have our campground drops that go another 40 or so lines here.

11

00:00:40.080  -->  00:00:42.590
So those are the three main groups of routes that we have.

12

00:00:42.880  -->  00:00:47.400
And we're going to split them out into three different files and then require all of them so will have

13

00:00:47.450  -->  00:00:57.240
a require a pier that looks like var comment routes equals require and we'll have a route's directory

14

00:00:57.420  -->  00:00:59.180
slash comments.

15

00:00:59.550  -->  00:01:00.770
So then we'll need to make that work.

16

00:01:00.770  -->  00:01:05.480
It won't work right now and we'll do the same thing for campground and for our throats.

17

00:01:05.490  -->  00:01:06.740
And that's just the first part.

18

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:11.160
Splitting things into different files and then I'm going to show you another way we can dry up our routes

19

00:01:11.190  -->  00:01:15.300
even more and to make things a little bit cleaner using the Express router.

20

00:01:15.360  -->  00:01:20.190
So we'll get to that but I'm going to begin by making a route's directory and I'm working inside of

21

00:01:20.310  -->  00:01:26.150
7 at this point because we're making substantial changes to the application structure and the directories

22

00:01:26.160  -->  00:01:26.280
.

23

00:01:26.370  -->  00:01:29.390
So it would be pretty confusing if I didn't make a new version.

24

00:01:29.940  -->  00:01:37.020
We're going to make a directory called for routes and then we'll make three different files routes slash

25

00:01:37.710  -->  00:01:50.520
campgrounds J US routes slash comments towards us and routes up routes slash and we can either call

26

00:01:50.520  -->  00:01:57.390
this off J.S. or we could call it index which is another one you'll see often for the all purpose routes

27

00:01:57.390  -->  00:01:59.730
that aren't related to a particular model.

28

00:01:59.730  -->  00:02:00.780
And I'll go with that for now.

29

00:02:00.790  -->  00:02:03.140
Index Yes.

30

00:02:03.240  -->  00:02:09.840
So let's open those up and if we do C9 on a directory it will open all three of them appear.

31

00:02:10.020  -->  00:02:12.140
And then we can just click on the ones that we want.

32

00:02:12.210  -->  00:02:15.160
So we now have this little subtree that we favored.

33

00:02:15.420  -->  00:02:21.210
Let's start by working with campgrounds open that up and I'm just going to copy all the campground routes

34

00:02:21.210  -->  00:02:22.230
out of here.

35

00:02:22.410  -->  00:02:30.460
So that starts right here and that goes down until our comment routes right there.

36

00:02:30.930  -->  00:02:35.190
And let's paste that into camp grounds and it's not just going to work automatically out of the box

37

00:02:35.190  -->  00:02:35.430
.

38

00:02:35.430  -->  00:02:36.860
We will have to change some things.

39

00:02:37.020  -->  00:02:39.920
But let's start by just splitting the files up.

40

00:02:39.960  -->  00:02:45.400
So next I'll work with the comments and we only have 2 comment routes or no.

41

00:02:45.990  -->  00:02:48.980
So I'll take both of those put them in this file.

42

00:02:49.500  -->  00:02:55.790
Lastly we'll open up the index yes and we'll add the other route so we have our route route.

43

00:02:56.040  -->  00:03:03.660
And then the authentication routes as well down to here and I'm going to take this is logged in along

44

00:03:03.660  -->  00:03:10.680
with us and we will be refactoring that separately but that belongs with the authentication routes because

45

00:03:10.680  -->  00:03:11.890
that's where we're using it.

46

00:03:12.030  -->  00:03:14.630
And it's also a dependency of the comment routes.

47

00:03:14.760  -->  00:03:17.450
Yes we're using is logged in in here as well.

48

00:03:17.490  -->  00:03:19.040
So let's copy all that in.

49

00:03:19.080  -->  00:03:24.480
So is logged in all the way up all the routes including the route route.

50

00:03:25.150  -->  00:03:27.810
And now we've really cleaned up the access file.

51

00:03:28.320  -->  00:03:32.530
Let's paste that into index yes and save.

52

00:03:33.270  -->  00:03:37.990
And we're getting errors all over the place because our files don't know what app is referring to.

53

00:03:38.430  -->  00:03:41.960
As you can see that's one of the problems are running into.

54

00:03:42.360  -->  00:03:48.900
But we're not actually going to declare a variable app like we would in the past where we do our app

55

00:03:49.230  -->  00:03:51.390
equals Express.

56

00:03:51.390  -->  00:03:53.610
We're going to do something slightly different.

57

00:03:53.610  -->  00:03:58.010
We're going to use the express router and the machine with that looks like to start.

58

00:03:58.140  -->  00:04:06.450
We're going to require expressive here for Express equals require express and then we're going to write

59

00:04:06.450  -->  00:04:16.590
var router equals express dot router and then we're going to add all the routes onto router rather than

60

00:04:16.590  -->  00:04:18.000
app.

61

00:04:18.350  -->  00:04:24.240
And we're going to do this first just to show you and then I'll explain why this is even worth doing

62

00:04:24.260  -->  00:04:24.850
.

63

00:04:25.650  -->  00:04:26.890
So we'll do that.

64

00:04:27.270  -->  00:04:32.490
And then of course we have to export something from this file and all that we need to export is router

65

00:04:32.640  -->  00:04:36.140
so module that exports equals router.

66

00:04:36.870  -->  00:04:43.350
So we've created this router variable equal to express dot router basically a new instance of the Express

67

00:04:43.350  -->  00:04:49.790
router and then we're adding all the routes to the router no longer adding them to the app itself.

68

00:04:49.830  -->  00:04:55.260
But to this router and then we're returning or exporting the router at the very end.

69

00:04:55.350  -->  00:04:57.330
And this is campgrounds that yes.

70

00:04:57.580  -->  00:05:02.570
And if I go to my app yes I'm going to start by requiring all my router files.

71

00:05:03.090  -->  00:05:11.290
So I'll do that separately from the other dependencies of var comment routes and then we'll have campground

72

00:05:11.860  -->  00:05:20.850
routes Eco's require dot slash routes slash campgrounds.

73

00:05:21.490  -->  00:05:31.510
And then we also have Auth. and will do all throughout equals and all grouped together nicely.

74

00:05:32.690  -->  00:05:34.260
It's like this.

75

00:05:34.930  -->  00:05:43.950
OK require dot slash routes slash index and we can call this index Raf's if you want to.

76

00:05:44.380  -->  00:05:47.180
OK so we'll save that.

77

00:05:47.230  -->  00:05:50.220
We're now importing or requiring those three files.

78

00:05:50.470  -->  00:05:53.420
But that's not enough for us to actually be using them just yet.

79

00:05:53.410  -->  00:05:58.690
We've required the files and only one of them by the way is actually exporting anything.

80

00:05:58.900  -->  00:06:02.540
The comments and the index j s are still problematic.

81

00:06:02.770  -->  00:06:07.390
But if we go back to Apter Yes we need to write an app I use.

82

00:06:07.450  -->  00:06:13.860
So I'm just going to do this down here and I'll show you what it looks like first after I use.

83

00:06:14.080  -->  00:06:17.020
And then we need to give it the name of our routes that we required.

84

00:06:17.140  -->  00:06:20.340
So comment routes campground routes and index routes.

85

00:06:20.440  -->  00:06:21.620
So we'll do that.

86

00:06:21.670  -->  00:06:28.810
So we'll start with index routes and then another update use comment routes.

87

00:06:28.810  -->  00:06:36.010
And then another one after it is campground draps and that tells we're apt to use those three route

88

00:06:36.010  -->  00:06:41.830
files that we've required right now only campground J us actually set up correctly.

89

00:06:42.010  -->  00:06:51.040
So let's finish off with the other ones comments J us and we'll change all those app dot CB router dot

90

00:06:52.090  -->  00:07:00.880
and then at the very bottom we do module that exports equals router and save but we still have some

91

00:07:00.880  -->  00:07:01.710
problems.

92

00:07:01.750  -->  00:07:03.380
You can see is logged in.

93

00:07:03.430  -->  00:07:07.720
We need to define that campground isn't defined.

94

00:07:08.380  -->  00:07:11.030
And this is also complaining that campground isn't defined.

95

00:07:11.320  -->  00:07:14.420
So we need to make sure we're adding in the correct models as well.

96

00:07:14.440  -->  00:07:22.950
So up here we'll just do another far and not start with campground equals require.

97

00:07:23.240  -->  00:07:25.180
And we need to get the correct file path.

98

00:07:25.180  -->  00:07:31.770
So right now we're inside the routes directory and we need to go inside the models directory campground

99

00:07:31.940  -->  00:07:32.080
.

100

00:07:32.240  -->  00:07:33.140
Yes.

101

00:07:33.220  -->  00:07:43.750
So we need to do dot dot slash models slash campground and then we'll also import comments that needs

102

00:07:43.750  -->  00:07:46.190
to be model slash comment.

103

00:07:46.250  -->  00:07:48.400
Those are the two models we want to require here

104

00:07:52.000  -->  00:07:59.510
and will save but we still have this issue of is logged in and to start I'm just going to copy the code

105

00:07:59.630  -->  00:08:00.770
is logged in.

106

00:08:01.060  -->  00:08:03.130
So it's at the bottom of this one.

107

00:08:03.130  -->  00:08:07.870
So copy that into both places so we'll keep it in our index routes.

108

00:08:08.050  -->  00:08:14.440
We're also going to add it to our comments route and just put them at the bottom for now and save.

109

00:08:14.950  -->  00:08:20.690
And now that air goes away and we're air free we get to go in this file.

110

00:08:20.870  -->  00:08:26.320
Now it's address our index J.S. where there's a little bit more to worry about because we're using some

111

00:08:26.350  -->  00:08:28.680
other code that's going to throw up some issues.

112

00:08:28.880  -->  00:08:38.410
So we need to start with our code that requires express and then it creates the Express router just

113

00:08:38.410  -->  00:08:42.420
copy it over here.

114

00:08:43.500  -->  00:08:53.020
Set in and then we'll change all of these apps to the router does get routed up posts just like that

115

00:08:57.300  -->  00:08:58.890
and save.

116

00:08:59.050  -->  00:09:00.270
We have a problem.

117

00:09:00.640  -->  00:09:05.190
It's complaining that passport isn't defined and that's because it's not defined.

118

00:09:05.360  -->  00:09:12.840
So all we need to do is a VAR passport equals require passport.

119

00:09:13.850  -->  00:09:17.700
And we're almost there but we also have a problem where user isn't defined.

120

00:09:17.920  -->  00:09:28.940
So we need to define user so our user equals require dot dot slash models slash user.

121

00:09:28.930  -->  00:09:33.310
So you probably noticed that in order for us to break things up into the separate files and keep our

122

00:09:33.320  -->  00:09:34.920
app just nice and clean.

123

00:09:35.140  -->  00:09:40.250
It does mean that we have to require things a little bit more often and that's the one downside.

124

00:09:40.270  -->  00:09:45.440
It's a little bit more code to require things but in the long term it makes a lot more sense to break

125

00:09:45.440  -->  00:09:46.560
a code out like this.

126

00:09:46.610  -->  00:09:51.640
Keep things organized have some order and structure to our app and it might mean an extra line or two

127

00:09:51.640  -->  00:09:55.260
here but it keeps her Applecross file nice and short.

128

00:09:55.580  -->  00:10:01.660
OK so if we try and test this out right now we have our three routes that we're requiring all of these

129

00:10:01.660  -->  00:10:06.720
files are now set up where they have the important dependencies required.

130

00:10:06.770  -->  00:10:13.360
The models express an express router and then we're exporting at the bottom of all of them although

131

00:10:13.370  -->  00:10:20.400
we're not doing it on this one which we need to do an index such as module but exports equals router

132

00:10:22.400  -->  00:10:23.790
Now if we try and start the app.

133

00:10:23.820  -->  00:10:26.320
Let's see if we get any errors.

134

00:10:26.430  -->  00:10:27.410
It looks good.

135

00:10:27.690  -->  00:10:28.950
Let's test it out.

136

00:10:29.310  -->  00:10:33.120
So we'll go to the root path to start that route is working.

137

00:10:33.600  -->  00:10:34.920
Feel the campgrounds.

138

00:10:34.950  -->  00:10:40.130
We have a problem here is we didn't define campground instead of the campgrounds route.

139

00:10:40.640  -->  00:10:49.830
So we need to open that up campground J.S. and just add in our VAR campground equals require dot dot

140

00:10:49.860  -->  00:10:54.680
slash models slash campground just like we did in the other files.

141

00:10:54.690  -->  00:10:56.610
Make sure there are no other errors in here.

142

00:10:56.630  -->  00:10:58.240
It looks good.

143

00:10:58.320  -->  00:11:04.140
Restart the server and try it out again.

144

00:11:04.130  -->  00:11:05.710
Now we're get to go.

145

00:11:06.460  -->  00:11:08.030
So we're viewing the show page.

146

00:11:08.100  -->  00:11:09.050
Let's go back.

147

00:11:09.120  -->  00:11:10.890
Try and log in.

148

00:11:11.000  -->  00:11:11.750
Great.

149

00:11:12.210  -->  00:11:16.790
Severus password and it all works just fine.

150

00:11:16.860  -->  00:11:17.970
Which is great.

151

00:11:17.980  -->  00:11:23.280
It was actually a bigger change we can make to dry up or code a little bit and it has to do with this

152

00:11:23.270  -->  00:11:28.230
line right here are these three lines actually what we're doing after you use index routes campground

153

00:11:28.250  -->  00:11:33.160
routes and comment routes what we can do is shorten the route declarations.

154

00:11:33.210  -->  00:11:36.660
So let's take an example of comment routes in common Jay.

155

00:11:36.690  -->  00:11:37.380
Yes.

156

00:11:37.440  -->  00:11:45.770
The two routes that we have all start with campgrounds slash ID slash comments campgrounds slash ID

157

00:11:45.810  -->  00:11:51.260
slash comments and then we have Slash knew on the end of one of them or in the campground drought's

158

00:11:51.290  -->  00:11:58.080
page if I open that up you can see that they all start with Slash campgrounds and we can actually reduce

159

00:11:58.080  -->  00:12:02.260
that duplication when we require them in our app.

160

00:12:02.310  -->  00:12:03.390
Yes.

161

00:12:03.380  -->  00:12:04.770
So lets start with campground.

162

00:12:05.070  -->  00:12:12.630
I can say all campground routes should start with Slash campgrounds and we'll take all of these campground

163

00:12:12.620  -->  00:12:19.130
G-S routes that weve to find these routes here and append slash campground in front of them.

164

00:12:19.500  -->  00:12:25.380
So if were going to make this change we then need to go to a campground JS file and get rid of all slash

165

00:12:25.380  -->  00:12:26.490
campgrounds.

166

00:12:26.490  -->  00:12:32.100
So the index now to show all campgrounds is just slash.

167

00:12:32.750  -->  00:12:41.130
The create is just slash our new is just slash New our show.

168

00:12:41.190  -->  00:12:44.900
Its just slash ID and thats all we have.

169

00:12:45.000  -->  00:12:51.230
So we'll save and what that does again is it takes campground routes all these routes were defined in

170

00:12:51.240  -->  00:12:54.710
that file and it appends slash campgrounds in front of them.

171

00:12:54.990  -->  00:13:00.690
So it helps us clean up the code and we can do the same thing although for index routes there is nothing

172

00:13:00.690  -->  00:13:05.840
in common that we want to stick in front of them so we can just leave it how it is or we can just say

173

00:13:06.170  -->  00:13:11.160
they all start with Slash if we want to have them all match this pattern where we provide the string

174

00:13:11.150  -->  00:13:20.460
first and let's just test that out start the server up refresh on the campgrounds page which is now

175

00:13:20.460  -->  00:13:24.220
working even though the route itself we go to campground.

176

00:13:24.260  -->  00:13:27.680
Yes the index route is just slash.

177

00:13:27.890  -->  00:13:32.370
It's actually slash campground because of this line right here.

178

00:13:32.660  -->  00:13:33.850
So comment routes.

179

00:13:33.920  -->  00:13:43.430
It's a little bit more complicated because they all start with Slash campground slash colon ID slash

180

00:13:43.590  -->  00:13:50.830
comments and then we can go to the comment file comment J us routes and change all of these so that

181

00:13:50.880  -->  00:13:53.280
this is only slash new.

182

00:13:53.850  -->  00:13:56.070
And this is just slash.

183

00:13:56.880  -->  00:14:02.700
So we shorten up the routes a lot and we grouped things into these ideas these topics so that all the

184

00:14:02.700  -->  00:14:07.320
campground routes start with Slash campgrounds and we can write shorter route declarations.

185

00:14:07.320  -->  00:14:12.720
And that's especially true with comments where we don't have to supply this long prefix here but there

186

00:14:12.720  -->  00:14:13.650
is a problem.

187

00:14:13.760  -->  00:14:18.200
If we save make sure we save the comment file and go back and restart

188

00:14:21.240  -->  00:14:27.710
and refresh and we go to one of the comment routes like add a new comment.

189

00:14:27.720  -->  00:14:29.750
First we're going to have to log in of course.

190

00:14:30.060  -->  00:14:35.120
So I'll log in a Severus and try that again.

191

00:14:35.750  -->  00:14:38.310
And now I try and add a comment.

192

00:14:38.370  -->  00:14:43.920
We have a problem and it's hard to tell what the problem is from this error which is always frustrating

193

00:14:44.300  -->  00:14:49.660
but it says cannot read a property name of NULL and it's pointing to this line right here.

194

00:14:49.750  -->  00:14:51.160
Campgrounds name.

195

00:14:51.210  -->  00:14:57.290
So from that error we can garner that campground is null which means that it's not finding our campground

196

00:14:57.360  -->  00:15:03.840
in the database because instead of this comment route when we create a new comment the first thing it

197

00:15:03.840  -->  00:15:06.500
does is find a campground by the ID.

198

00:15:06.750  -->  00:15:10.050
And what's happening is that our ID is actually not being found.

199

00:15:10.230  -->  00:15:18.400
So we can prove that by doing a confidant log request parameter ID and not start the server over.

200

00:15:18.990  -->  00:15:24.080
And this was working just fine until we moved those routes and we used this express router like this

201

00:15:24.620  -->  00:15:30.390
where we specified that all comment routes start with this where we did add Colan ID but if we try it

202

00:15:30.380  -->  00:15:39.620
out and we are fresh and we look here before this long arrow is pointed out we can see no was printed

203

00:15:39.620  -->  00:15:39.870
.

204

00:15:39.890  -->  00:15:42.420
So it's not finding the ID.

205

00:15:42.570  -->  00:15:48.450
What's happening is that our I.D. or colon I.D. route parameter isn't making it through to our comment

206

00:15:48.440  -->  00:15:49.180
routes.

207

00:15:49.380  -->  00:15:55.260
And there's a really easy fix when we use the express router in this file we pass in an option instead

208

00:15:55.250  -->  00:15:56.160
of an object.

209

00:15:56.250  -->  00:15:57.850
Merge programs.

210

00:15:58.110  -->  00:15:58.830
True.

211

00:15:59.340  -->  00:16:04.310
And that will then merge the Paramo from the campground and the comments together so that inside the

212

00:16:04.320  -->  00:16:09.270
comment routes we're able to access this Kolin ID that we defined.

213

00:16:09.270  -->  00:16:14.210
So let's restart now node Aptera Yes.

214

00:16:14.690  -->  00:16:23.180
If we are fresh right now we need to go back slash campgrounds refresh.

215

00:16:24.570  -->  00:16:27.690
I'll have to log back in as Severus password

216

00:16:31.020  -->  00:16:35.340
then let's go and try and add a comment and you can see that it works now just fine.

217

00:16:35.430  -->  00:16:39.080
And we're finding that ID and then we're finding the correct campground.

218

00:16:39.270  -->  00:16:40.430
So we don't have a problem.

219

00:16:40.800  -->  00:16:41.240
OK.

220

00:16:41.280  -->  00:16:43.200
So we successfully refactored the routes.

221

00:16:43.350  -->  00:16:48.110
The last thing we could really focus on is cleaning some other code up so we could go into our comments

222

00:16:48.120  -->  00:16:49.300
file for instance.

223

00:16:49.500  -->  00:16:51.730
And we don't need to say comment routes here anymore.

224

00:16:52.050  -->  00:16:57.990
But if we wanted to go in and add the semi-colons and also just add a little message before each route

225

00:16:57.990  -->  00:16:58.270
.

226

00:16:58.290  -->  00:17:09.480
So this is the comments new and then this is comments create and we'll save make sure everything's formatted

227

00:17:09.470  -->  00:17:11.700
nicely and get rid of that.

228

00:17:12.170  -->  00:17:13.520
We still have this is logged in.

229

00:17:13.530  -->  00:17:19.790
I'll just add a message here middleware that we will be refactoring and moving to it's own file that

230

00:17:19.800  -->  00:17:25.940
will then require Instead the comments file and our index japes file because we have it in both places

231

00:17:25.970  -->  00:17:26.740
.

232

00:17:27.440  -->  00:17:29.500
Let's make sure we have some comments here.

233

00:17:29.520  -->  00:17:31.440
So this is the route route.

234

00:17:31.940  -->  00:17:37.950
This is our register form route this handles the Sign-Up logic route.

235

00:17:38.120  -->  00:17:39.860
This is our log and form route.

236

00:17:40.160  -->  00:17:44.150
This handles the log and forms logic and actually does the logging in.

237

00:17:44.390  -->  00:17:47.040
And this is the log out route.

238

00:17:47.760  -->  00:17:51.010
And then we have our middleware here.

239

00:17:51.080  -->  00:17:51.460
All right.

240

00:17:51.470  -->  00:17:53.190
And then lastly the go to campground.

241

00:17:53.220  -->  00:17:55.260
Yes we have our index route.

242

00:17:55.670  -->  00:18:00.630
Our create route and our new route and our show.

243

00:18:00.620  -->  00:18:01.220
Great.

244

00:18:01.400  -->  00:18:06.280
And actually yes let's see if there's anything else we can really clean up in here.

245

00:18:06.330  -->  00:18:09.570
Let's go ahead and add a comment in here.

246

00:18:09.990  -->  00:18:15.030
Are we right requiring routes and otherwise for good to go.

247

00:18:15.300  -->  00:18:20.870
So we changed a lot of things around as far as the files and the directories but our logic is exactly

248

00:18:20.880  -->  00:18:22.060
the same.

249

00:18:22.080  -->  00:18:27.600
Really the biggest change aside from moving things into different files was showing this use of the

250

00:18:27.600  -->  00:18:35.370
Express router where we can require route files and in our case our route files are exporting the router

251

00:18:35.550  -->  00:18:40.040
that we're using and that doesn't have to be called router but that's the conventional name.

252

00:18:40.050  -->  00:18:46.310
So whatever we named here we just need to reference an ad Didcot gets and posts onto that object and

253

00:18:46.320  -->  00:18:52.550
then send that out at the very bottom and we can provide this prefix that will be added in front of

254

00:18:52.560  -->  00:18:54.620
every single route in that file.

255

00:18:54.620  -->  00:18:54.920
Great.

256

00:18:54.930  -->  00:19:01.320
So we really clean things up just to show you how much we have 46 lines in this app us in the previous

257

00:19:01.320  -->  00:19:01.920
version.

258

00:19:02.070  -->  00:19:05.930
If we open up SJS we had 177 lines.

259

00:19:06.120  -->  00:19:07.760
So that's a pretty drastic reduction.
