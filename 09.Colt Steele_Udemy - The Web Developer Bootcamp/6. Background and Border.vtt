00:00:00.350  -->  00:00:06.000
In this lesson we're going to cover two new properties background which we use to change the background

2

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:10.120
color or the background image of an element and border.

3

00:00:10.260  -->  00:00:14.670
So we're going to start with background as you can see I have a little example here.

4

00:00:14.670  -->  00:00:16.260
So here's her end result.

5

00:00:16.440  -->  00:00:19.890
Notice that we have a gray background on the body.

6

00:00:20.010  -->  00:00:25.840
Coming from here and then we have a blue background on the div which is coming from here.

7

00:00:26.040  -->  00:00:29.490
And then we also have white text on the paragraph.

8

00:00:29.580  -->  00:00:35.040
So let's go ahead and try this using the About Me page that we've been working with.

9

00:00:35.220  -->  00:00:40.140
And let's go ahead and change the my hobbies h forward and give it a background color.

10

00:00:40.560  -->  00:00:42.460
Let's give it an orange color.

11

00:00:42.900  -->  00:00:47.840
So again we want to select this age four so we type age four.

12

00:00:48.540  -->  00:00:54.990
And then inside the curly braces you're going to say background and we'll do an R G B and we'll make

13

00:00:54.990  -->  00:00:57.230
like a orangey color.

14

00:00:57.260  -->  00:01:04.560
So they'll be a lot of red a little green and the little blue and let's refresh and we get this nice

15

00:01:04.560  -->  00:01:06.670
coral color.

16

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:11.760
So next let's give the background let's give the body a background which is something you see often

17

00:01:12.120  -->  00:01:15.490
on a Web site where the entire background is a new color.

18

00:01:15.780  -->  00:01:16.830
So let's do some

19

00:01:19.430  -->  00:01:28.590
something like background and let's just say that to be pink for now and then we go the entire background

20

00:01:28.860  -->  00:01:31.290
is pink.

21

00:01:31.290  -->  00:01:36.870
So that is the background property being used to change the color of something.

22

00:01:37.680  -->  00:01:43.650
But we can also use the background property to change the background to be an image which show also

23

00:01:43.650  -->  00:01:44.820
see pretty often.

24

00:01:45.150  -->  00:01:52.680
So the way it works we still specify background but instead of a color we say you Arel and then in parentheses

25

00:01:52.950  -->  00:01:55.760
we give it a u r l where the image is located.

26

00:01:56.190  -->  00:02:04.920
So let's go find some woodgrain let's find an image like this one here.

27

00:02:05.350  -->  00:02:06.980
So let's just copy this image.

28

00:02:07.200  -->  00:02:11.560
You throw in we're going to set that as the background.

29

00:02:12.390  -->  00:02:21.900
So on our body I'm just going to say background you Earl and in that you are Ellett I just copied.

30

00:02:21.900  -->  00:02:23.770
So this will work with any image.

31

00:02:24.050  -->  00:02:32.460
And if we refresh great we see that our background has been set but you'll notice one small thing which

32

00:02:32.460  -->  00:02:35.220
is that our image is not really big enough.

33

00:02:35.220  -->  00:02:41.760
If we go back to it it's not close to being big enough to cover our entire body here.

34

00:02:41.850  -->  00:02:44.100
So what's happened is that it's being tightened.

35

00:02:44.280  -->  00:02:48.900
You can see you know it's being titled tiled horizontally and vertically.

36

00:02:49.320  -->  00:02:53.870
So if we don't want that and sometimes you do but most the time it doesn't look very good.

37

00:02:54.180  -->  00:03:03.220
So if we don't want that there's another property that we can set and that is background repeat.

38

00:03:04.380  -->  00:03:11.530
And if we set this to be no repeat and save.

39

00:03:12.300  -->  00:03:15.720
Now we've set the background of her body and it's not repeating.

40

00:03:16.260  -->  00:03:21.190
But you'll also notice that it's not stretching out to cover the entire body.

41

00:03:21.240  -->  00:03:27.690
So if we wanted to get it to stretch out across the entire screen or across the entire body there's

42

00:03:27.720  -->  00:03:38.230
one other property we can set which is background size and we can set that to cover.

43

00:03:39.240  -->  00:03:42.890
So as you can see it now takes up the entire body.

44

00:03:43.430  -->  00:03:48.600
Of course it's not the best image for this because it's a little blurry it's a little pixilated but

45

00:03:48.630  -->  00:03:54.690
when you're doing a background image usually want to make sure you have something that is either large

46

00:03:54.840  -->  00:04:00.840
and high resolution or something that has a smaller image that can be repeated seamlessly unlike this

47

00:04:00.840  -->  00:04:01.680
one.

48

00:04:01.740  -->  00:04:07.430
It's not you know symmetrical on both axes so if we repeat it it's very clear that there's divisions

49

00:04:07.470  -->  00:04:08.870
and tiling happening.

50

00:04:09.300  -->  00:04:09.600
OK.

51

00:04:09.600  -->  00:04:16.210
So that's background and using background color and background to set a background image.

52

00:04:16.350  -->  00:04:19.460
The next thing I want to show is how we get a border.

53

00:04:19.770  -->  00:04:24.660
So I'm actually going to come at this out because it's a little distracting and let's just go back to

54

00:04:25.320  -->  00:04:27.170
background as pink

55

00:04:30.400  -->  00:04:33.960
and let's go and add borders to all h ones.

56

00:04:34.470  -->  00:04:38.560
So a border and C S has three different parts.

57

00:04:38.700  -->  00:04:43.630
There's the with the color and the style.

58

00:04:45.090  -->  00:04:49.310
So let's start by giving a border color to each one.

59

00:04:49.320  -->  00:04:54.660
It just looks like this border color and that border.

60

00:04:54.780  -->  00:05:01.140
Let's just go with purple and if we refresh we don't actually see anything and that's because currently

61

00:05:01.140  -->  00:05:03.110
our border has no width.

62

00:05:03.150  -->  00:05:05.780
So the next thing we need to do is give it away.

63

00:05:06.120  -->  00:05:10.020
So border with it will just give it a number in pixels.

64

00:05:10.230  -->  00:05:20.270
Let's do five pixels five x refresh and we're still missing one thing which is style.

65

00:05:21.300  -->  00:05:25.920
So you'll see that none of this works unless we have all three of them set.

66

00:05:25.920  -->  00:05:29.060
So the border style there's a few different options.

67

00:05:29.100  -->  00:05:30.810
We can say solid.

68

00:05:31.040  -->  00:05:33.160
I dashed a dotted border.

69

00:05:33.390  -->  00:05:34.470
There's a few others.

70

00:05:34.470  -->  00:05:41.600
Most the time what you see is just solid so solid border five pixels purple.

71

00:05:41.820  -->  00:05:46.490
And we get a border around all the H ones.

72

00:05:47.100  -->  00:05:50.230
There is a nice short cuts and tax that we can use.

73

00:05:50.250  -->  00:05:57.080
So because we often set all three of these at once there is the equivalent syntax that's just called

74

00:05:57.090  -->  00:05:57.940
border.

75

00:05:58.560  -->  00:06:08.040
And we right border colon we give it with 5 pixels the style solid and the color purple.

76

00:06:08.040  -->  00:06:11.760
So I can actually comment these out and you'll see nothing changes.

77

00:06:11.760  -->  00:06:13.350
It's identical.

78

00:06:13.350  -->  00:06:15.410
So let's play the play around a bit.

79

00:06:15.450  -->  00:06:30.110
Let's go with a 8 pixel dasht Forder that is let's just take our R.G. B from down here and we have this

80

00:06:30.120  -->  00:06:32.690
nice dashed border effect.

81

00:06:32.760  -->  00:06:35.050
So you know usually I haven't seen this.

82

00:06:35.310  -->  00:06:40.380
I haven't seen this since websites back in the 90s using this all the time different styles.

83

00:06:40.380  -->  00:06:46.960
Usually all you see is a nice thin one or two pixel solid border.

84

00:06:47.530  -->  00:06:48.010
OK.

85

00:06:48.120  -->  00:06:54.230
So just to recap on border we can set properties individually or we can use the short cuts and tax and

86

00:06:54.240  -->  00:06:58.040
set the with the style and the color.

87

00:06:58.110  -->  00:06:58.900
All in one go
