00:00:00.900  -->  00:00:05.640
So we've only just begun javascript and it's already time for our first quick problem set.

2

00:00:05.640  -->  00:00:11.370
So there are three challenges here and I'd like for you to try to do them without any code without running

3

00:00:11.370  -->  00:00:13.080
them in the browser and the console.

4

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:14.480
That's not the point here.

5

00:00:14.520  -->  00:00:20.250
What really we're trying to do is check for your conceptual understanding of the percentage sign or

6

00:00:20.310  -->  00:00:25.490
the plus sign between two strings or the square brackets or link and the double backslash.

7

00:00:25.740  -->  00:00:31.920
So go ahead and try evaluating these mentally and pause video and then following this we'll have solutions

8

00:00:31.940  -->  00:00:33.140
.

9

00:00:34.320  -->  00:00:38.130
OK so I'm going to go ahead and start discussing the first problem here.

10

00:00:38.160  -->  00:00:43.600
So 100 maade three modules over remember is the remainder operator.

11

00:00:43.800  -->  00:00:48.150
So we divide three into 100 as many times as he can go in.

12

00:00:48.150  -->  00:00:50.690
So that is going to be 33 times.

13

00:00:50.940  -->  00:00:57.630
And then we subtract 33 times three which is ninety nine from 100 and we get 1.

14

00:00:57.960  -->  00:01:02.250
So divide 3 in as many times as possible and then take the remainder.

15

00:01:02.250  -->  00:01:04.250
So that should be 1.

16

00:01:04.440  -->  00:01:14.100
So if we want to run this in our council we can go ahead and do 100 maade 3 and we get 1.

17

00:01:14.190  -->  00:01:15.330
All right.

18

00:01:15.330  -->  00:01:17.120
So let's move on to the second one now.

19

00:01:17.730  -->  00:01:21.540
We have the string blah that is being added to another string blah.

20

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:23.520
Remember that's called concatenation.

21

00:01:23.790  -->  00:01:27.560
And because we have the parentheses around it that will happen first.

22

00:01:27.570  -->  00:01:35.760
So that's basically the equivalent of running law plus law which will just give us blah blah no space

23

00:01:36.480  -->  00:01:41.800
and then we're adding the square brackets onto that character 6.

24

00:01:42.030  -->  00:01:47.570
So that's going to be the sixth index which is actually the seventh character because it starts 0.

25

00:01:47.730  -->  00:01:55.490
So we would end up with 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 the letter A.

26

00:01:55.830  -->  00:01:57.870
And that's what we get just to verify.

27

00:01:57.870  -->  00:02:00.260
I'll just run the entire line.

28

00:02:00.360  -->  00:02:00.630
Great.

29

00:02:00.630  -->  00:02:01.900
And we get the letter A.

30

00:02:02.370  -->  00:02:04.040
So let's move on to the final one here.

31

00:02:04.230  -->  00:02:05.800
So this one's a little bit trickier.

32

00:02:05.820  -->  00:02:11.160
It actually combines numbers and strings together in one expression here.

33

00:02:11.190  -->  00:02:13.290
So we start just on the left side.

34

00:02:13.380  -->  00:02:15.030
Hello hotlink.

35

00:02:15.390  -->  00:02:18.520
So that's going to be one two three four five.

36

00:02:18.960  -->  00:02:28.680
So we end up with five books modulo And then this one is even trickier because it looks like it's four

37

00:02:28.680  -->  00:02:31.890
characters length on those four characters.

38

00:02:31.890  -->  00:02:40.680
But in actuality when we run this string and I hit enter it comes back to me as just three characters

39

00:02:41.010  -->  00:02:43.740
and that's because we're escaping this backslash.

40

00:02:43.740  -->  00:02:51.240
Just like if I did backslash double quote The backslash goes away and we end up with our double quote

41

00:02:51.270  -->  00:02:52.160
inside.

42

00:02:52.740  -->  00:02:58.990
So if we evaluate this we end up with five maade three.

43

00:02:59.520  -->  00:03:03.920
And that of course three goes into five one time with the remainder of two.

44

00:03:04.140  -->  00:03:07.190
So if we try that out we should get two.

45

00:03:07.530  -->  00:03:08.390
And we do.

46

00:03:08.940  -->  00:03:09.540
OK.

47

00:03:09.540  -->  00:03:13.620
So hopefully you enjoy those super quick exercises very soon.

48

00:03:13.620  -->  00:03:19.530
These exercises will then become making a tic tac toe game making a blog app all sorts of fun things

49

00:03:19.530  -->  00:03:20.490
using javascript.

50

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:21.660
But we have to start small
