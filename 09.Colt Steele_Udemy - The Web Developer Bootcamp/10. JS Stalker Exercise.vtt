00:00:00.690  -->  00:00:04.170
All right it's time for another quick javascript exercise.

2

00:00:04.350  -->  00:00:10.320
And this one's going to cover variables and strings as well as the prompt and cons. dealt Lague methods

3

00:00:10.500  -->  00:00:11.880
that we just covered.

4

00:00:12.210  -->  00:00:17.390
And along with that you'll be writing your javascript in a separate file so you'll need to make an to

5

00:00:17.380  -->  00:00:22.890
himself file a javascript file you need to use a script tag to connect them and then you'll run it in

6

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:24.000
the browser.

7

00:00:24.300  -->  00:00:27.180
So you're going to make a very simple javascript stocker.

8

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:31.950
Basically when you refresh the page it's going to ask you for your name your first name.

9

00:00:31.950  -->  00:00:36.240
It's going to ask you for your last name and it's going to ask you for your age and then it's going

10

00:00:36.240  -->  00:00:44.520
to print out a string that says your full name is first name and last name your age is your age.

11

00:00:44.790  -->  00:00:50.250
So I'll show you I'm going to refresh the page here and it's going to ask me for my first name.

12

00:00:50.250  -->  00:00:53.450
So let's go ahead and do my dog Rusty.

13

00:00:54.180  -->  00:01:02.390
His last name Steele his age let's stewed dog years three.

14

00:01:03.390  -->  00:01:09.870
So it doesn't look like anything happened but I've opened up my con. you'll see it says your full name

15

00:01:09.870  -->  00:01:11.230
is rusty steel.

16

00:01:11.310  -->  00:01:13.350
You are three years old.

17

00:01:13.350  -->  00:01:15.300
So a few things I'll point out here.

18

00:01:15.300  -->  00:01:17.230
The spacing is really important.

19

00:01:17.820  -->  00:01:23.670
So it's easy to mess this up to not have a space here or a space missing here or here.

20

00:01:23.730  -->  00:01:29.720
Make sure that you add those spaces in appropriately so that it's a nice formatted sentence also.

21

00:01:29.790  -->  00:01:33.420
These are two separate lines so pay attention to that.

22

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:37.970
And then one other thing is that you do not need to have any of this to him out here.

23

00:01:38.010  -->  00:01:39.800
This is just for me to explain it to you.

24

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:42.810
You can just have a totally blank white page of h him.

25

00:01:43.190  -->  00:01:43.440
OK.

26

00:01:43.440  -->  00:01:44.940
So go ahead and attempt this.

27

00:01:44.940  -->  00:01:45.990
Pause the video.

28

00:01:46.140  -->  00:01:50.440
Make your new file your age to e-mail your javascript's and give it a go.
