00:00:00.690  -->  00:00:04.500
Now let's go and set up the post route where we can submit the form to.

2

00:00:05.130  -->  00:00:07.500
So I'll do that just below this.

3

00:00:08.070  -->  00:00:16.200
And that's going to be apt at Post and The URL is slash campgrounds slash idea again slash comments

4

00:00:16.590  -->  00:00:18.750
and that's it.

5

00:00:18.750  -->  00:00:24.690
And we'll add in our requests and response to Colback and didn't hear we need to do a few things we

6

00:00:24.690  -->  00:00:33.750
need to look up campground using ID then we need to create new comments.

7

00:00:33.750  -->  00:00:39.220
Then we want to connect new comments to campground.

8

00:00:39.660  -->  00:00:44.820
And then lastly we want to redirect somewhere and it would make sense to redirect back to the show page

9

00:00:45.150  -->  00:00:46.960
of the campground that we're already on.

10

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:54.010
So a redirect to campground show page just like that.

11

00:00:54.350  -->  00:00:54.870
OK.

12

00:00:55.290  -->  00:01:02.190
Let's begin by looking up the campground using the ID and remember that's inside it for Quest dot harams

13

00:01:02.340  -->  00:01:03.470
that ID.

14

00:01:03.510  -->  00:01:09.380
So we'll do a campground find by Id just like we did up here.

15

00:01:09.950  -->  00:01:17.580
Request Amzah ID and then our callback function with the error and the campground and then we need this

16

00:01:17.580  -->  00:01:20.620
here and then our closing print to see.

17

00:01:20.880  -->  00:01:24.120
And then in here what's it complaining about we're not using the error.

18

00:01:24.270  -->  00:01:26.210
So we'll handle the error.

19

00:01:26.480  -->  00:01:34.380
Constable log our or otherwise then we're going to move on and do all this code and if we can't find

20

00:01:34.380  -->  00:01:38.480
the campground that they're adding a comment to then we have a problem.

21

00:01:38.730  -->  00:01:45.720
So we won't do any of this but we could do instead just redirect back to slash campgrounds which is

22

00:01:45.720  -->  00:01:47.820
pretty of noxious from a user's point of view.

23

00:01:47.820  -->  00:01:49.780
But at least the app won't stall.

24

00:01:49.780  -->  00:01:54.180
We're going to redirect somewhere eventually we'll be showing an error message explaining the problem

25

00:01:54.200  -->  00:01:54.540
.

26

00:01:54.820  -->  00:01:55.070
OK.

27

00:01:55.080  -->  00:02:01.230
So redirect then needs to be rez redirect and then inside the else we're now going to create the new

28

00:02:01.230  -->  00:02:02.000
comment.

29

00:02:02.250  -->  00:02:05.340
So that's done with comments that create.

30

00:02:05.820  -->  00:02:11.220
But before we do that we commented out and I want to show you what I was talking about when I introduced

31

00:02:11.220  -->  00:02:13.690
this new way of adding the name attribute.

32

00:02:13.860  -->  00:02:17.690
But rejoined things regroup them together under the name comment.

33

00:02:17.790  -->  00:02:27.480
So we'll go back in here and let's just do a that log request dot body dot comments and save restart

34

00:02:27.480  -->  00:02:32.670
the server and we'll go visit sosh campgrounds.

35

00:02:33.030  -->  00:02:40.150
Click on one of them and then go do slash comments slash new and then we'll submit a comment.

36

00:02:40.160  -->  00:02:43.980
This will be Ho ho ho from Santa.

37

00:02:44.130  -->  00:02:45.160
Just like that.

38

00:02:45.240  -->  00:02:49.790
Click submit and this request isn't going to actually end up seeing anything.

39

00:02:49.830  -->  00:02:53.520
It's going to time out eventually because we haven't handled it properly.

40

00:02:53.520  -->  00:02:57.280
We're not redirecting we're only redirecting if we can't find the campground.

41

00:02:57.450  -->  00:02:59.210
Otherwise we're not doing anything.

42

00:02:59.310  -->  00:03:04.710
But more importantly if we look at what request up body duck comment is you can see it's this pre-made

43

00:03:04.710  -->  00:03:07.700
object that has everything we need to make a new comment.

44

00:03:08.160  -->  00:03:18.270
So we don't have to sit here and do the VAR text equals request body text and then var author and so

45

00:03:18.270  -->  00:03:22.210
on we can just use request up body document.

46

00:03:22.590  -->  00:03:31.260
So we'll now create comments that create and instead of passing in that object we just pass and request

47

00:03:31.770  -->  00:03:36.710
that body document which has those two pieces already in there.

48

00:03:36.960  -->  00:03:44.910
And then our callback and we'll have our error and then our comment OK.

49

00:03:45.060  -->  00:03:54.050
And then as always going to check if there's an error and we'll just do a simple con. log again.

50

00:03:54.930  -->  00:04:02.700
And if it's all good then what we need to do is associate that comment to the campground and all we

51

00:04:02.700  -->  00:04:07.930
have to do to make that work is do campground which is this variable here.

52

00:04:08.080  -->  00:04:15.390
It's referring to the campground that we found with this ID you are well Dot comments.

53

00:04:15.450  -->  00:04:22.050
Push comments which is the comment that just came back from the database that we created and then we

54

00:04:22.050  -->  00:04:32.270
need to do a campground save for campground that save just like that and then we'll redirect.

55

00:04:32.370  -->  00:04:39.420
So we'll do a rez that redirects to the show page of the campground and that show page again is going

56

00:04:39.420  -->  00:04:44.690
to look like Slash campgrounds slash ID.

57

00:04:44.760  -->  00:04:46.650
So we need to build that string.

58

00:04:46.650  -->  00:04:49.920
It's a redstart redirect slash campgrounds.

59

00:04:50.370  -->  00:04:52.010
But we need to put the idea in there.

60

00:04:52.170  -->  00:04:57.950
So slash floods that's going to be campground dot underscore.

61

00:04:58.050  -->  00:05:00.060
Id just like that.

62

00:05:00.720  -->  00:05:01.020
OK.

63

00:05:01.030  -->  00:05:02.490
So we're almost there.

64

00:05:02.490  -->  00:05:07.560
This will hopefully redirect us to the right route so we can see the comment that was created but we

65

00:05:07.560  -->  00:05:12.810
have a problem which is that comment is not defined and that's because this is the first time we're

66

00:05:12.810  -->  00:05:19.530
actually using comment inside this app inside the US even though we are already accessing comments.

67

00:05:19.590  -->  00:05:25.170
We never had to use the comment model because we were accessing comments off of the campground model

68

00:05:25.290  -->  00:05:26.780
automatically in the template.

69

00:05:26.970  -->  00:05:38.640
What we need to do is require comment appear and that's equal to require dot slash models slash comment

70

00:05:39.240  -->  00:05:43.930
and save the comma and it now it should be good to go.

71

00:05:44.250  -->  00:05:47.250
Let's restart those syntax errors.

72

00:05:47.250  -->  00:05:49.010
Always a good sign.

73

00:05:49.080  -->  00:05:50.090
I need to go back.

74

00:05:50.130  -->  00:05:55.080
Here's the time out that I got when I never sent a response and never redirected or never rendered anything

75

00:05:55.080  -->  00:05:55.610
.

76

00:05:55.740  -->  00:05:59.660
Poor cloud 9 sent back their own message that just said something went wrong.

77

00:06:00.230  -->  00:06:01.190
OK.

78

00:06:01.300  -->  00:06:02.590
Slash campgrounds.

79

00:06:02.760  -->  00:06:05.790
Now we'll click on one.

80

00:06:05.790  -->  00:06:09.610
Now we'll go to slash comments slash new.

81

00:06:10.050  -->  00:06:16.130
Here's our comment form and we'll do expect to Trona them.

82

00:06:16.320  -->  00:06:18.110
And that's from Harry Potter.

83

00:06:18.180  -->  00:06:20.790
Submit and what do you know.

84

00:06:20.790  -->  00:06:25.470
We have a second comment that a down here the very last thing we'll do is add a simple button that will

85

00:06:25.470  -->  00:06:30.330
take us to the new comment page rather than having to type that really long Lincoln manually.

86

00:06:30.390  -->  00:06:36.540
We'll just add a button and that's on the show template and we'll just do it right before the comment

87

00:06:36.810  -->  00:06:42.000
and we'll just make that an anchor tag inside of a paragraph so that it's spaced a little bit more.

88

00:06:42.060  -->  00:06:43.170
So paragraph tag.

89

00:06:43.320  -->  00:06:50.540
And then we want an anchor tag with each ref equal to slash campgrounds.

90

00:06:50.910  -->  00:06:55.510
And then we need the ID and that ID is a campground ID.

91

00:06:55.530  -->  00:07:04.590
So I'm just going to steal this and put it right in there and change it to be it underscore ID slash

92

00:07:04.770  -->  00:07:10.330
comments and needs to go in the quotes slash comments slash new.

93

00:07:10.950  -->  00:07:18.750
And then the text of the link should just be add new comment and we'll make it a bootstrap button.

94

00:07:18.750  -->  00:07:26.900
So class is equal to let's do between DTN success which will make it green.

95

00:07:27.030  -->  00:07:27.360
All right.

96

00:07:27.360  -->  00:07:28.590
Let's test this out.

97

00:07:28.590  -->  00:07:30.250
Start the server over again.

98

00:07:30.680  -->  00:07:34.970
Let's go back to camp ground click on one of these.

99

00:07:35.100  -->  00:07:36.560
We have add new comment.

100

00:07:36.900  -->  00:07:40.320
Let's try adding just jibberish comment submit.

101

00:07:40.320  -->  00:07:41.180
There we go.

102

00:07:41.550  -->  00:07:43.220
So we have that functionality down.

103

00:07:43.470  -->  00:07:46.940
And let's just verify that it works on other comments as well.

104

00:07:46.950  -->  00:07:52.260
So let's go back to the campground and add on to canyon floor.

105

00:07:52.640  -->  00:07:57.330
And this is jibberish again and it works great.

106

00:07:57.660  -->  00:08:02.670
And as you know by now I like to end by doing a quick recap and we have a lot to recap here but I'll

107

00:08:02.670  -->  00:08:05.580
do my best to do it in 30 seconds.

108

00:08:05.580  -->  00:08:12.000
So we started by talking about nested routes or we have campground slash ID and then comments and the

109

00:08:12.000  -->  00:08:17.010
routes for comments are added after that because that comment is dependent on a campground and its particular

110

00:08:17.010  -->  00:08:17.990
ID.

111

00:08:18.000  -->  00:08:19.670
So we set those two routes up.

112

00:08:19.890  -->  00:08:21.270
We moved our templates.

113

00:08:21.270  -->  00:08:26.730
So now we have a campground directory and a common directory we had to change some of the linking and

114

00:08:26.810  -->  00:08:29.130
especially linking to the Parshall's.

115

00:08:30.600  -->  00:08:34.130
And then the bulk of what we did was down here in our routes.

116

00:08:34.530  -->  00:08:41.210
So we created the new and create comment routes both of them we have to look up the correct campground

117

00:08:41.240  -->  00:08:41.850
first.

118

00:08:42.060  -->  00:08:47.910
Once we look up the campground on new all we do is render the form but once we look up the campground

119

00:08:48.050  -->  00:08:54.540
on create what we actually had to do was then create the comment and then push that comment into the

120

00:08:54.540  -->  00:08:56.380
campground and save.

121

00:08:56.610  -->  00:09:00.060
And then we redirected back to the campground show page.

122

00:09:00.510  -->  00:09:02.390
So a lot of changes lots of new stuff.

123

00:09:02.490  -->  00:09:07.710
If you want to go back and compare v3 is the most recent version that doesn't have any of this new material

124

00:09:07.710  -->  00:09:08.490
.

125

00:09:08.520  -->  00:09:13.350
And the last important thing we have left to do around comments is just adding some styling so that

126

00:09:13.350  -->  00:09:17.700
the show page looks a little bit nicer than it currently does and that the comments look a little better

127

00:09:17.700  -->  00:09:18.420
as well.
