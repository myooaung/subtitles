00:00:00.820  -->  00:00:01.310
OK.

2

00:00:01.380  -->  00:00:05.730
So it's time again for a few quick javascript function exercises.

3

00:00:05.880  -->  00:00:10.740
So like the first few problem sets I'm not going to have you actually write code just yet.

4

00:00:10.740  -->  00:00:15.870
I'm just going to give you a function here and a little bit of code and I'd like for you to evaluate

5

00:00:16.080  -->  00:00:18.140
what happens when I run this code.

6

00:00:18.180  -->  00:00:18.830
So go ahead.

7

00:00:18.830  -->  00:00:25.660
Pause the video and then we'll talk about what actually happens in just a few moments.

8

00:00:25.680  -->  00:00:32.850
So in this code we're declaring a function called test and it takes two arguments x and y and then all

9

00:00:32.850  -->  00:00:38.610
that it does is a returned Y which is the second argument minus X which is the first.

10

00:00:38.610  -->  00:00:45.610
So when I called test here with 10 and 40 X is going to be 10 y is going to be 40.

11

00:00:45.630  -->  00:00:50.770
So we end up with a return 40 minus 10 which should return 30.

12

00:00:51.060  -->  00:00:55.220
So let's verify that by opening up the cancel and pasting the code in.

13

00:00:55.590  -->  00:00:58.610
And you can see we get 30 great.

14

00:00:58.900  -->  00:00:59.170
OK.

15

00:00:59.190  -->  00:01:00.670
So we have one more here.

16

00:01:00.720  -->  00:01:05.850
This is another function also called test like for you to pause the video and evaluate what happens

17

00:01:05.850  -->  00:01:07.770
when we run this code.

18

00:01:08.790  -->  00:01:17.010
OK so this function test takes a single argument x and then it returned X times 2 and then it looks

19

00:01:17.010  -->  00:01:21.950
like it also confidant logs X and then it returns X divided by two.

20

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:28.020
But if you'll remember from the video on the return key word as soon as we return something execution

21

00:01:28.020  -->  00:01:29.850
of a function stops.

22

00:01:29.850  -->  00:01:33.980
So when we return x times 2 the function is over.

23

00:01:34.020  -->  00:01:36.350
And so neither of these lines actually runs.

24

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:42.710
So test 40 is going to return 80 and then that's it.

25

00:01:42.720  -->  00:01:45.570
So to verify that open up the con..

26

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:52.700
Paste this in and you can see we get 80 but we never get counted out log 40 or return 20
