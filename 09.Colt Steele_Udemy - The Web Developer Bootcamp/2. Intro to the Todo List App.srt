1

00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:02,460
OK we'll come back in this video.

2

00:00:02,490  -->  00:00:06,370
I want to introduce the project that we're going to build over the next few videos.

3

00:00:06,660  -->  00:00:11,910
So we're going to make AJ Querrey based to do app but it's also going to have a pretty heavy focus on

4

00:00:12,030  -->  00:00:18,210
CSSA and styling some animation some effects and overall it's going to be a pretty polished application

5

00:00:18,210  -->  00:00:18,630
.

6

00:00:18,630  -->  00:00:22,200
So I'll give you a quick demo of what it looks like and how it works.

7

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:24,850
So here is our To Do list.

8

00:00:24,930  -->  00:00:28,580
The first thing I'll point out is that it's responsive.

9

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:35,490
So we can resize it but to do list is for Harry Potter in this case of fill that with some sample data

10

00:00:35,510  -->  00:00:35,720
.

11

00:00:35,940  -->  00:00:42,650
And as I hover over things you'll see I get this nice little delete button with the trash can icon.

12

00:00:43,080  -->  00:00:51,300
And if I click on that it will delete the to do entirely or if I just click on the text I can check

13

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:53,230
it off if I want to keep it there.

14

00:00:53,310  -->  00:00:57,810
Sometimes you know when making a to do list you cross things off but you might want to be able to go

15

00:00:57,810  -->  00:01:01,790
back and uncheck them or keep them there so that you can see them again.

16

00:01:01,890  -->  00:01:04,290
And some people just want to delete things entirely.

17

00:01:04,410  -->  00:01:06,630
They don't care about seeing what they've already done.

18

00:01:06,630  -->  00:01:08,550
So then you can click on the delete button.

19

00:01:08,700  -->  00:01:16,730
Let's say that I killed Voldemort click on that button and it fades out and then it disappears.

20

00:01:17,120  -->  00:01:19,610
And then I can also add in a new to do.

21

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:21,250
So let's add one here.

22

00:01:21,480  -->  00:01:29,400
Go to Potions class and all I have to do is hit enter and we automatically get a new to do down here

23

00:01:29,480  -->  00:01:29,670
.

24

00:01:29,760  -->  00:01:32,660
I can check off or remove.

25

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:38,330
Also of note is the fact that this button here will hide the form.

26

00:01:38,400  -->  00:01:43,860
If I just want to view my list I can click on that or I can click again and view the form and start

27

00:01:43,860  -->  00:01:45,060
adding to deuce.

28

00:01:45,630  -->  00:01:47,840
So that's a preview of the functionality.

29

00:01:47,850  -->  00:01:52,260
Now I want to talk a bit about behind the scenes what we're going to talk about and some of the new

30

00:01:52,260  -->  00:01:54,310
things that we're going to learn.

31

00:01:54,420  -->  00:01:59,700
As I mentioned earlier this is a lot of Jay query and a lot of seeis us and in particular we're going

32

00:01:59,700  -->  00:02:06,300
to talk about some of the common methods we already learned about like key press and on for events fade

33

00:02:06,410  -->  00:02:13,020
out slide out fade toggle slide toggle all the different effects and then also selecting are going to

34

00:02:13,020  -->  00:02:15,390
be doing a lot of selecting here as well.

35

00:02:15,390  -->  00:02:21,350
And then wase SS We'll get more practice with the box model margin and padding and border.

36

00:02:21,390  -->  00:02:25,540
We'll talk more about floating elements and we'll get more practice with font's.

37

00:02:25,650  -->  00:02:31,440
And then there's also a whole host of new features new methods new properties for Jay queery and assess

38

00:02:31,470  -->  00:02:36,690
both that I'm going to introduce through this video and the first one up here is that we're going to

39

00:02:36,690  -->  00:02:40,540
be using a better folder structure in this application.

40

00:02:40,560  -->  00:02:41,950
We're going to have Jay queery.

41

00:02:41,970  -->  00:02:46,350
We're going to have our Each team will have to see assess but we'll also have another library called

42

00:02:46,350  -->  00:02:51,420
fun awesome and we need a better way of keeping things organized rather than just having everything

43

00:02:51,420  -->  00:02:53,160
in one folder together.

44

00:02:53,220  -->  00:02:58,010
We're going to have some subdirectories in and break things out into different sections.

45

00:02:58,500  -->  00:03:01,930
As far as J.A.G. goes we're going to introduce two new methods.

46

00:03:02,100  -->  00:03:07,470
One is called pairings and another one is called append along with the pen and we're also going to talk

47

00:03:07,470  -->  00:03:11,460
about how we create new elements and add them to the page and the last point.

48

00:03:11,460  -->  00:03:13,720
Here is something called event delegation.

49

00:03:13,870  -->  00:03:20,070
But then as far as CSSA goes we're going to use Fonte awesome to get some new icons in our application

50

00:03:20,510  -->  00:03:25,020
so you can see we have the trashcan here and the plus sign here that's coming from a library called

51

00:03:25,020  -->  00:03:25,310
fun.

52

00:03:25,320  -->  00:03:26,220
Awesome.

53

00:03:26,250  -->  00:03:32,400
We'll also talk about box shadow and other property called transition that we saw when we made the color

54

00:03:32,400  -->  00:03:33,220
guessing game.

55

00:03:33,300  -->  00:03:37,620
We're going to see how to use it in a slightly different way and then we're also going to look at CSSA

56

00:03:37,620  -->  00:03:40,130
gradients which is how I made this background here.

57

00:03:40,320  -->  00:03:44,680
So it's not actually an image CSSA is making this for me.

58

00:03:44,760  -->  00:03:48,660
All right so there's a lot of fun stuff packed into here things that we're going to get more practice

59

00:03:48,660  -->  00:03:50,290
with and some new things.

60

00:03:50,290  -->  00:03:53,280
We're also going to throw in there so we'll get started in the next video.
