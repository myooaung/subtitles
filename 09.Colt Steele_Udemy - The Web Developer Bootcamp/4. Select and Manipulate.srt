1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:03,940
So now we've discussed why you should care about the Domm why it's exciting.

2

00:00:03,990  -->  00:00:07,640
And we've also talked about what it is what the document object model means.

3

00:00:07,680  -->  00:00:13,320
The fact that it's just a model of every element on a page using javascript objects the top level object

4

00:00:13,350  -->  00:00:15,130
is called the document.

5

00:00:15,240  -->  00:00:18,340
So that's great but we haven't seen how to do anything with it yet.

6

00:00:18,390  -->  00:00:23,460
So in this video I'm going to briefly introduce the process of manipulating things using the dog.

7

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:29,630
So I've boiled down the whole process to two keywords select and manipulate.

8

00:00:29,670  -->  00:00:36,540
So just like see assess where we write a selector to select something with the class of special or all

9

00:00:36,540  -->  00:00:43,620
h ones or all image tags we select elements and then we apply styles like background color purple border

10

00:00:43,710  -->  00:00:47,840
one pixel solid black with javascript and Dom and population.

11

00:00:47,850  -->  00:00:51,380
We also select elements although we do it in a very different way.

12

00:00:51,480  -->  00:00:56,910
We write javascript code which goes and selects elements and returns them back to us and then we change

13

00:00:56,910  -->  00:01:01,260
properties on them so we select something and then we manipulate it.

14

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:06,810
So in the next few slides I'm going to show you how he could select this H-1 my header and how we could

15

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:09,750
change it to be pink.

16

00:01:09,750  -->  00:01:14,070
I've been saying this a lot in the last few videos but I don't want you to focus on the syntax as much

17

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:15,290
as the concepts.

18

00:01:15,330  -->  00:01:18,930
The next few videos will get into the nitty gritty of selecting and manipulating.

19

00:01:18,930  -->  00:01:21,150
This is just an overview of how it works.

20

00:01:21,150  -->  00:01:25,600
So on this slide I'm going to show how you could select that H1 just like with C.

21

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:28,580
There's a lot of different ways of selecting a given element.

22

00:01:28,800  -->  00:01:36,270
In this case this line of code document dot queries selector H-1 is going to select the H-1 on this

23

00:01:36,270  -->  00:01:36,920
page.

24

00:01:37,050  -->  00:01:40,960
So I've highlighted here with this green box so you can see what's being selected.

25

00:01:41,340  -->  00:01:48,640
So again var H-1 this is just any any variable we want equals document that query selector 8:1.

26

00:01:48,690  -->  00:01:52,420
So we'll spend a lot more time with queries selector and define what it is and how it works.

27

00:01:52,470  -->  00:01:59,920
But it returns an object that represents this H1 and it saves that in the H-1 variable.

28

00:01:59,970  -->  00:02:02,190
So that's the selecting process.

29

00:02:02,190  -->  00:02:08,340
The next part is manipulating it so to manipulate it I can do all sorts of things and all that I'm going

30

00:02:08,340  -->  00:02:11,170
to do here is change the color to be pink.

31

00:02:11,490  -->  00:02:18,470
So we just write H-1 which is our variable that has the object representing the H-1 dot style.

32

00:02:18,510  -->  00:02:24,690
That's one property and that style property is a huge object with a bunch of other properties and color

33

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:25,580
is one of them.

34

00:02:25,920  -->  00:02:28,920
So H-1 does style but color equals pink.

35

00:02:28,920  -->  00:02:30,240
And then that's all we have to do.

36

00:02:30,270  -->  00:02:35,400
And the browser sees that I change that property to pink and it automatically updates what's displayed

37

00:02:35,820  -->  00:02:37,500
by turning it pink.

38

00:02:37,500  -->  00:02:41,140
So we selected here and then we manipulated.

39

00:02:42,120  -->  00:02:43,560
So I have one more example here.

40

00:02:43,610  -->  00:02:45,230
It's a little more complicated.

41

00:02:45,240  -->  00:02:50,610
We're doing a very simple animation where every second we're changing the background color of the body

42

00:02:50,910  -->  00:02:52,940
between blue and white.

43

00:02:52,950  -->  00:02:58,620
So what we need to do first is select the body and then manipulate it so to select it.

44

00:02:58,740  -->  00:03:03,300
I have another line using document dump query selector which again we're going to come back to in the

45

00:03:03,300  -->  00:03:06,720
next video document that query selector body.

46

00:03:06,780  -->  00:03:11,880
So that gives me the body element where it actually gives me the object representation the model of

47

00:03:11,880  -->  00:03:15,450
it that I save in the body variable.

48

00:03:15,450  -->  00:03:20,490
Then I have this variable is blue which is just a boolean that I'm going to use because I need to know

49

00:03:20,640  -->  00:03:23,940
if I'm going from blue to white or white to blue.

50

00:03:24,030  -->  00:03:28,870
So it starts out as false and then I'm using set interval which we covered a few years ago.

51

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:32,230
If you don't remember how it works it basically takes two arguments.

52

00:03:32,340  -->  00:03:38,880
The first one is some code to run a function and the second one is a number or a time in milliseconds

53

00:03:38,900  -->  00:03:39,030
.

54

00:03:39,150  -->  00:03:44,880
So it takes this number of milliseconds which is one thousand or one second and every one second it

55

00:03:44,880  -->  00:03:46,230
will call this code.

56

00:03:46,560  -->  00:03:51,080
So what this code does is it checks if the background is currently blue if it is.

57

00:03:51,180  -->  00:03:56,330
We then change it to be white if the background is white then we change it to be blue.

58

00:03:56,610  -->  00:04:00,030
So to take a closer look we have our if is blue.

59

00:04:00,120  -->  00:04:01,640
So that's just variable.

60

00:04:01,650  -->  00:04:02,900
It starts out as false.

61

00:04:02,910  -->  00:04:07,890
So the very first time the page loads the background is white is blue is false.

62

00:04:07,920  -->  00:04:15,240
So this line doesn't run but this one does else body does style dark background equals to this hexadecimal

63

00:04:15,240  -->  00:04:16,570
color which is blue.

64

00:04:16,770  -->  00:04:18,840
So that changes the background to be blue.

65

00:04:19,140  -->  00:04:22,960
So then we just change our is blue variable from false to true.

66

00:04:23,130  -->  00:04:27,690
And that's a nice sort way of doing it with the exclamation point or the not operator.

67

00:04:27,780  -->  00:04:32,550
So then this code runs again next time is blue is already true.

68

00:04:32,850  -->  00:04:36,870
So this code does run body does style but background equals white.

69

00:04:36,870  -->  00:04:38,550
So now we're going back to white.

70

00:04:38,670  -->  00:04:42,980
This doesn't run and then we change is blue back to false.

71

00:04:43,290  -->  00:04:44,980
And that keeps going forever.

72

00:04:45,090  -->  00:04:49,740
So not that you would ever want something as distracting as a background color that changes every second

73

00:04:49,760  -->  00:04:49,950
.

74

00:04:50,190  -->  00:04:56,160
But this does go to show that we can do things more complex than just changing an H1 from black to pink

75

00:04:56,160  -->  00:04:57,450
.

76

00:04:57,450  -->  00:05:03,930
So to wrap all of this up two words select manipulate we select We grab some objects that represent

77

00:05:03,930  -->  00:05:06,260
elements and then we do something to them.

78

00:05:06,750  -->  00:05:11,010
So the rest of this unit is going to be focused on different ways of selecting and then different ways

79

00:05:11,010  -->  00:05:12,370
of manipulating.

80

00:05:12,390  -->  00:05:16,830
So the next video is going to dive deep into the different ways of selecting elements using javascript

81

00:05:16,830  -->  00:05:17,190
.

82

00:05:17,190  -->  00:05:19,470
We've seen one already queery selector.

83

00:05:19,500  -->  00:05:21,450
We're going to expand on that and learn a few more
