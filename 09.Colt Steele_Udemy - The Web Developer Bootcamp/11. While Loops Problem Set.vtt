00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:03.080
OK so now it's your turn to start writing some while loops.

2

00:00:03.330  -->  00:00:08.100
So this is a problem set where you're actually going to be writing code rather than just evaluating

3

00:00:08.100  -->  00:00:08.600
it.

4

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:10.200
There are four different problems.

5

00:00:10.200  -->  00:00:15.440
I'd like you to do can see them right here and you'll need to write them in a separate file.

6

00:00:15.600  -->  00:00:17.150
So not just in the console.

7

00:00:17.150  -->  00:00:22.620
So you'll need a HDMI file and a single javascript file and then you can just write all four of these

8

00:00:22.620  -->  00:00:24.360
in the same file.

9

00:00:24.390  -->  00:00:30.570
So here's the output I'm going to open up the console and it just runs to four problems one after another

10

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:31.040
.

11

00:00:31.080  -->  00:00:32.090
So the very first one.

12

00:00:32.220  -->  00:00:36.020
Print all numbers between negative 10 and 19.

13

00:00:36.180  -->  00:00:40.920
So I added a little the log just to delineate which problem is which.

14

00:00:41.190  -->  00:00:45.180
And you can see I get the numbers between negative 10 and 19.

15

00:00:45.390  -->  00:00:49.010
Next up print all even numbers between 10 and 40.

16

00:00:49.050  -->  00:00:51.130
So I get a little console dialog here.

17

00:00:51.570  -->  00:01:00.250
And then even numbers between 10 and forty third one print all the odd numbers between 300 and 333.

18

00:01:00.390  -->  00:01:04.360
So we get this output here and then the final one.

19

00:01:04.530  -->  00:01:09.900
Print all numbers divisible by both five and three between five and 50.

20

00:01:09.900  -->  00:01:13.040
So multiples of five and three there's only three of them.

21

00:01:13.170  -->  00:01:15.900
15 30 and 45.

22

00:01:15.900  -->  00:01:21.090
So all of these are done with while loops and that's the only requirement here is that you use a while

23

00:01:21.090  -->  00:01:23.300
loop for all four parts.

24

00:01:23.340  -->  00:01:25.830
So in the next video we'll go and create the solutions
