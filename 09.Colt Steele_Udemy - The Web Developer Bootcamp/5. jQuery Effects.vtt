00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:01.500
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.500  -->  00:00:06.510
So when I initially introduced Jay queery I mentioned that it helps us do things like select elements

3

00:00:06.630  -->  00:00:08.820
manipulate them at event listeners.

4

00:00:08.930  -->  00:00:11.990
And I also mentioned that it helps with effects and animations.

5

00:00:12.180  -->  00:00:16.800
So in this video I'm going to do a quick preview of some of those built in effects in particular I'm

6

00:00:16.800  -->  00:00:22.000
going to show two broad categories of effects fading effects and slides.

7

00:00:22.250  -->  00:00:26.220
So I'm on the Jay Corey docks here on the effects category.

8

00:00:26.280  -->  00:00:31.650
You can see there are quite a few methods that have to do with effects and I'm going to start by showing

9

00:00:31.650  -->  00:00:36.010
the fade effects so I'm going to look at fade out to start.

10

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:41.900
What fadeout does is you select an element with a dollar sign or a set of elements and you call that

11

00:00:41.910  -->  00:00:48.480
fade out on it and it will animate that element from full opacity down to full transparency or zero

12

00:00:48.480  -->  00:00:49.470
opacity.

13

00:00:49.500  -->  00:00:56.130
So it basically fades an element out and you can provide a duration if you want it to be slow or fast

14

00:00:56.220  -->  00:00:57.380
or very slow.

15

00:00:57.510  -->  00:00:59.690
You can provide a number of milliseconds.

16

00:00:59.700  -->  00:01:05.520
The default is 400 milliseconds and then you can provide a callback to run at the end which I'll show

17

00:01:05.520  -->  00:01:06.630
in just a moment.

18

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:13.740
So I'm going to make a new file here to demonstrate this effect study demo and I'll just copy over our

19

00:01:13.740  -->  00:01:18.660
structure from the last demo page and this one will call J Querrey effects.

20

00:01:18.960  -->  00:01:24.480
So we have that set up and I'm going to get rid of all of this content here and then I'm going to add

21

00:01:24.480  -->  00:01:27.000
in a few divs.

22

00:01:27.120  -->  00:01:33.240
Let's do three divs and we're going to use these divs and fade them out and animate them and slide them

23

00:01:33.240  -->  00:01:34.340
up and down.

24

00:01:34.450  -->  00:01:43.620
And so I'm going to give them some content inside this first one will be these don't fade me the next

25

00:01:43.620  -->  00:01:45.470
one.

26

00:01:45.900  -->  00:01:48.300
I'm begging you please.

27

00:01:48.660  -->  00:01:52.380
And then lastly we'll have one that says Help help help.

28

00:01:52.720  -->  00:01:55.790
So these divs are desperate not to be faded away.

29

00:01:56.040  -->  00:01:58.210
Unfortunately today's not their lucky day.

30

00:01:58.410  -->  00:02:00.230
And we are going to be fighting them out.

31

00:02:00.240  -->  00:02:05.280
So to make this clearer I'm going to add in some style here to our lives so that they have a color that

32

00:02:05.280  -->  00:02:06.720
we can see fade away.

33

00:02:07.110  -->  00:02:10.900
And they also have a width and height that we can see slide up and down.

34

00:02:10.950  -->  00:02:20.200
So I'm going to select all divs and give them a with 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels and a color

35

00:02:20.220  -->  00:02:28.150
background of teal and let's save and we'll open this up.

36

00:02:28.860  -->  00:02:30.420
We have three divs.

37

00:02:30.420  -->  00:02:32.570
However I'd like them to be on the same line.

38

00:02:32.880  -->  00:02:36.900
So one way to do that is with the float left.

39

00:02:37.020  -->  00:02:39.880
Now they're all in the same line but they bleed into one another.

40

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:43.020
So to fix that we can add a margin.

41

00:02:43.020  -->  00:02:46.850
So we'll just do a margin of 20 pixels on all sides.

42

00:02:46.860  -->  00:02:51.930
Now we end up with three squares and they each have some text inside and we really don't need to go

43

00:02:51.930  -->  00:02:56.740
overboard styling them because all we're going to do is demonstrate how we can fit them in and out.

44

00:02:57.060  -->  00:03:03.060
So we're going to add a button up top here and this button will just say click me.

45

00:03:03.270  -->  00:03:08.000
And when we click this button what will happen is that our animations will run.

46

00:03:08.220  -->  00:03:12.760
So I click this and these three items should fade out to start.

47

00:03:13.320  -->  00:03:19.350
So to reiterate fade out will take an element from full opacity or whatever opacity It's currently at

48

00:03:19.650  -->  00:03:22.500
and faded to the point of full transparency.

49

00:03:22.500  -->  00:03:29.730
So it looks like this select dot fadeout and we can provide an optional string of the speed so slow

50

00:03:29.730  -->  00:03:33.370
or fast or we can give it a number of milliseconds.

51

00:03:33.390  -->  00:03:34.490
So let me show you that now.

52

00:03:34.740  -->  00:03:39.870
I'm actually going to do this in a separate file so I'm going to make a javascript file and save.

53

00:03:40.250  -->  00:03:45.000
I'll call it affects just genius save safe that had my alert

54

00:03:47.940  -->  00:03:52.470
connected and linked this together correctly the bottom.

55

00:03:52.470  -->  00:03:54.020
Just add a script tag.

56

00:03:54.480  -->  00:03:56.450
Source equals effects.

57

00:03:56.560  -->  00:03:57.320
Yes.

58

00:03:57.690  -->  00:04:01.030
And if we refresh we get our connected alert.

59

00:04:01.350  -->  00:04:04.380
So what we want to do here is Faid these divs out.

60

00:04:04.380  -->  00:04:10.040
So we need to select the device just like that and not fade out.

61

00:04:10.380  -->  00:04:13.290
And then we can provide a speed or just leave it like that.

62

00:04:13.290  -->  00:04:20.630
And if that's all we want to do or refresh and you can see as the page loads they start to fade up.

63

00:04:20.640  -->  00:04:23.740
So let's actually make that happen when we click the button.

64

00:04:24.090  -->  00:04:34.800
So we're going to want to do a dollar sign button dot and we can either do click or I'll do dot on quick

65

00:04:36.300  -->  00:04:38.480
and then pass in our callback function.

66

00:04:38.640  -->  00:04:47.770
So when we click will then fade out all the divs just like that and now will refresh and if I click

67

00:04:48.490  -->  00:04:50.870
you can see they all fade out.

68

00:04:50.980  -->  00:04:56.060
So as I mentioned we can provide a number here something like 1000 which is a full second.

69

00:04:56.260  -->  00:05:02.370
And if I refresh you'll see when I click it takes a full second for them to fade out.

70

00:05:02.620  -->  00:05:09.580
An important point about fadeout is that if I inspect the page here and I look at the elements are divs

71

00:05:09.580  -->  00:05:12.400
are still in the team either still in the dorm.

72

00:05:12.430  -->  00:05:15.760
We just don't see them because their display has been set to none.

73

00:05:15.760  -->  00:05:18.730
So it doesn't delete them or doesn't remove them from the page.

74

00:05:18.910  -->  00:05:20.010
It's just hiding them.

75

00:05:20.170  -->  00:05:22.890
And that's definitely an important distinction.

76

00:05:22.990  -->  00:05:28.960
So let's say that I wanted to just print a message once the divs had faded out so I would fade them

77

00:05:28.960  -->  00:05:35.150
out and then do something like this fade completed as it cancelled out log.

78

00:05:35.680  -->  00:05:39.590
And if I run this I'll open the console and watch the order that things happen.

79

00:05:39.730  -->  00:05:45.800
So when I click here I get Faid completed way before the fade is actually done.

80

00:05:46.090  -->  00:05:51.490
So what happens here is that we select all the divs and we start the fade out but it takes a full second

81

00:05:51.500  -->  00:05:51.730
.

82

00:05:52.060  -->  00:05:56.280
And javascript doesn't wait for that second to finish before it moves on to the next line.

83

00:05:56.350  -->  00:06:02.310
It immediately moved onto this line and prints out Faid completed and then the fade out finishes.

84

00:06:02.470  -->  00:06:08.230
So if we want code to happen right after the fade out finishes we want it to be guaranteed to be after

85

00:06:08.680  -->  00:06:11.390
we can pass in a callback here.

86

00:06:11.440  -->  00:06:16.860
And so this callback will be called inside of the fadeout automatically when it's done.

87

00:06:17.020  -->  00:06:20.830
So I'm going to move our constant log right there and save.

88

00:06:21.300  -->  00:06:29.530
And if I refresh and now I click the fade out finishes and then we get 3 Fade completed console dot

89

00:06:29.540  -->  00:06:31.650
logs for each one of those.

90

00:06:31.690  -->  00:06:37.390
A more common scenario rather than just printing out a string in the Consul is to actually remove the

91

00:06:37.390  -->  00:06:39.220
elements once we fade them.

92

00:06:39.220  -->  00:06:42.580
So I mentioned that they're just hidden they're not actually gone.

93

00:06:42.660  -->  00:06:47.350
And if we wanted to delete them like on our to do list we're going to build when we click on the trash

94

00:06:47.350  -->  00:06:51.940
can next to an item we want it to fade out slowly do a nice animation.

95

00:06:52.060  -->  00:06:55.620
But then also just delete off the page entirely off the DOM.

96

00:06:55.810  -->  00:07:02.320
So we need to use a method called remove and we only want to remove it after the fadeout is finished

97

00:07:02.320  -->  00:07:03.180
.

98

00:07:03.340  -->  00:07:09.460
So that looks like this will just do this remove.

99

00:07:10.010  -->  00:07:13.930
And what this will do is wait until the fadeout is finished.

100

00:07:13.990  -->  00:07:17.050
And for each div it will run the Remove method on it.

101

00:07:17.050  -->  00:07:20.430
So refresh and click on click me.

102

00:07:21.100  -->  00:07:26.650
They fade out and then if we go over to elements you can see that our body only has a button now and

103

00:07:26.650  -->  00:07:29.850
a tag all of the divs are completely gone.

104

00:07:30.100  -->  00:07:36.520
And if I comment that line out and refresh you can see where they start here three divs and I click

105

00:07:36.520  -->  00:07:39.130
on the button and all that happens.

106

00:07:39.160  -->  00:07:42.910
They fade away and then display is set to none.

107

00:07:42.910  -->  00:07:51.340
So if I put my code in the wrong place and I ran the Remove method down here I did all divs dot remove

108

00:07:51.430  -->  00:07:52.850
just like that.

109

00:07:52.900  -->  00:07:57.080
What would actually happen is that the order is not guaranteed.

110

00:07:57.280  -->  00:07:59.210
And this is going to take a full second.

111

00:07:59.410  -->  00:08:01.800
And this code won't wait for that second to finish.

112

00:08:01.930  -->  00:08:06.410
So it will start to fade out and then run remove immediately after.

113

00:08:06.610  -->  00:08:13.150
So that ends up looking like this where it starts to fade and just immediately after it removes them

114

00:08:13.160  -->  00:08:13.490
.

115

00:08:13.780  -->  00:08:16.450
So it's basically no fade at all.

116

00:08:16.480  -->  00:08:17.110
So that's why J.

117

00:08:17.110  -->  00:08:21.940
Corey provides this callback because it's pretty common for us to want to do something after we fade

118

00:08:21.940  -->  00:08:26.810
something out or after we slide something down or whatever the animation is.

119

00:08:26.830  -->  00:08:30.760
So that brings me to my next point which is that I want to show some of the other animations that we

120

00:08:30.760  -->  00:08:33.790
can do so we can also fade things in.

121

00:08:34.030  -->  00:08:40.920
So if I set the display to be none in the beginning like this and I refresh.

122

00:08:41.020  -->  00:08:46.780
We don't see the divs because now they're hidden rather than fading them out when we click we can fade

123

00:08:46.780  -->  00:08:49.840
them in and it works just like you would expect.

124

00:08:49.840  -->  00:08:55.720
Click on the button and they fade in over a second and then if we want to run some code afterwards when

125

00:08:55.720  -->  00:09:00.350
we know that they're done fading in we can put some code and said if the callback here.

126

00:09:00.970  -->  00:09:02.310
All right so that's Faden.

127

00:09:02.350  -->  00:09:09.610
GK provides one more nice fade method which is called Faid toggle and Faid toggle works the same way

128

00:09:09.610  -->  00:09:10.400
.

129

00:09:10.660  -->  00:09:16.330
I provide a number of milliseconds and it will know if it needs to fade something in or out depending

130

00:09:16.330  -->  00:09:18.080
on if it's currently showing or not.

131

00:09:18.310  -->  00:09:25.360
So if I refresh and I click on Fade toggle it starts by feeding them all in and then fading them all

132

00:09:25.360  -->  00:09:27.020
out and back in.

133

00:09:27.040  -->  00:09:32.500
It's basically like adding a class to the class list or using toggle class with Jay Querrey where it

134

00:09:32.500  -->  00:09:35.860
just decides if it needs to fade in or fade out.

135

00:09:35.860  -->  00:09:43.960
All right so that's fading the next set of effects that I want to demonstrate are these sliding effects

136

00:09:43.960  -->  00:09:44.260
.

137

00:09:44.320  -->  00:09:49.170
So down here we have a slide down slide toggle and slide up.

138

00:09:49.240  -->  00:09:55.270
So I'll start with slide down and what it does is it takes an element that's currently not showing rather

139

00:09:55.270  -->  00:10:00.640
than animating the opacity on an element like Faid does it actually animates the height of an element

140

00:10:00.640  -->  00:10:01.060
.

141

00:10:01.090  -->  00:10:03.030
So I'll show you how that works.

142

00:10:03.130  -->  00:10:04.300
We're is going to change this.

143

00:10:04.300  -->  00:10:07.870
Rather than fade toggle we'll just slide down.

144

00:10:08.650  -->  00:10:11.810
And that's because when we refresh our elements are hidden.

145

00:10:11.920  -->  00:10:19.000
So if I run slide down when we click on a button you'll see that the height is animated down and same

146

00:10:19.000  -->  00:10:21.270
thing goes for slide up.

147

00:10:21.400  -->  00:10:22.420
It does the opposite.

148

00:10:22.480  -->  00:10:26.360
So if I get rid of display on so that they are showing.

149

00:10:26.710  -->  00:10:28.630
And now I click on the button.

150

00:10:28.630  -->  00:10:33.590
Their height is animated and they slide upwards and then display set to None at the end.

151

00:10:33.910  -->  00:10:41.540
And the other method is slide toggle which works just like Faid toggle where it decides what to do.

152

00:10:41.650  -->  00:10:48.090
So if I click they slide up and now slide down and back up and down.

153

00:10:48.370  -->  00:10:51.740
So that's all there is to slide up slide down and slide toggle.

154

00:10:51.760  -->  00:10:54.320
They were just like they're Faid analog methods.

155

00:10:54.610  -->  00:10:57.580
There's also a optional callback that we can pass in.

156

00:10:57.790  -->  00:11:04.250
So if we give a duration like 1 second and then I can get my call back in.

157

00:11:04.600  -->  00:11:09.380
And I'll just do another con. that log at the end slide is done.

158

00:11:09.730  -->  00:11:15.250
And that will only prints out once the full second slide has finished.

159

00:11:15.250  -->  00:11:16.130
So I refresh.

160

00:11:16.270  -->  00:11:24.970
Let's look at the console and they click on click me and you can see this only printed once the slide

161

00:11:24.970  -->  00:11:25.630
was done.

162

00:11:25.630  -->  00:11:28.380
Same thing here pay attention right here.

163

00:11:28.390  -->  00:11:31.330
This will change to six.

164

00:11:31.330  -->  00:11:32.630
There we go.

165

00:11:33.290  -->  00:11:40.510
But again a more common pattern is to remove the items once we've slided them out or fade them out or

166

00:11:40.510  -->  00:11:43.670
whatever we have done is to remove them.

167

00:11:43.690  -->  00:11:48.400
So here it will take a second to slide them and then they're removed from the page.

168

00:11:48.460  -->  00:11:53.970
And if we go to the elements tab our body is empty except for that button and the script.

169

00:11:54.580  -->  00:11:58.810
So hopefully they give you a good idea of how some of the effects in a quarry work.

170

00:11:58.810  -->  00:12:02.110
These are by far the most common fading and sliding.

171

00:12:02.110  -->  00:12:06.190
And we're going to use them instead of our to do list app which we're going to start in the next video

172

00:12:06.200  -->  00:12:06.560
.
