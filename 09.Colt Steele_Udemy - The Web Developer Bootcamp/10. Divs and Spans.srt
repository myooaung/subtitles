1

00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:00,640
There.

2

00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:01,610
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,920  -->  00:00:04,060
So this lesson is going to be very quick.

4

00:00:04,200  -->  00:00:10,680
We're just talking about two tags the DIV tag and the spand tag and we really can't talk about much

5

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:16,480
as far as what they do and how we use them until we get to see assess where we can style things.

6

00:00:16,560  -->  00:00:22,410
But I just want to introduce them now because I am going to show you things using divs and spans.

7

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:27,110
In the next few videos and I didn't do a great job actually of explaining it in the first draft of this

8

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:27,640
course.

9

00:00:27,690  -->  00:00:31,820
So I went back and added this in an after the fact after the Course was published.

10

00:00:31,950  -->  00:00:37,890
I saw a few questions that I noticed maybe I could clear up if I just did a better job explaining Dave's

11

00:00:37,920  -->  00:00:38,800
earlier on.

12

00:00:39,000  -->  00:00:39,340
OK.

13

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:42,030
So let's get started talking about divs and spans.

14

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:47,490
The first thing I'll say is that both of them as I mentioned are not that useful until we actually get

15

00:00:47,490  -->  00:00:49,770
to styling elements.

16

00:00:49,770  -->  00:00:56,760
But what they do is they allow you to group content together so a div according to MT-NW is just a generic

17

00:00:56,760  -->  00:00:58,060
container.

18

00:00:58,320  -->  00:01:04,440
So it's just a it's a way of grouping things together as an example I'm not saying that this is a div

19

00:01:05,040  -->  00:01:09,210
right here but this could be a div just a box around some content.

20

00:01:09,210  -->  00:01:15,420
It looks like some text here some images and some more text to group that altogether and give it a big

21

00:01:15,420  -->  00:01:20,380
border or give it a background excuse me you can do that with a div.

22

00:01:20,400  -->  00:01:24,960
Again we haven't talked about how you do that just yet but the idea is that you can just group things

23

00:01:24,960  -->  00:01:25,780
together.

24

00:01:25,950  -->  00:01:29,660
So you'll be seeing me use divs a lot in this course going forward.

25

00:01:29,760  -->  00:01:32,450
Let me just show you a quick example.

26

00:01:32,520  -->  00:01:40,290
So if I add some text here and this is actually something that one of the students in this course pointed

27

00:01:40,290  -->  00:01:41,750
out in the discussion forum.

28

00:01:41,790  -->  00:01:47,410
I didn't know about which is nice if you just type Lorem and hit tab.

29

00:01:47,590  -->  00:01:53,170
It will give us Lorem Ipsum basically just a bunch of sample text placeholder text.

30

00:01:53,280  -->  00:01:58,100
So I'm going to use this make two of those.

31

00:01:58,440  -->  00:02:06,470
And then also add in an H1 and let's say that this H-1 it doesn't really matter or just put anything

32

00:02:06,470  -->  00:02:06,890
there.

33

00:02:07,020  -->  00:02:08,990
But let's say that this is a paragraph

34

00:02:12,060  -->  00:02:14,300
and I want to group these two things together.

35

00:02:14,310  -->  00:02:19,560
The H-1 in the paragraph let's say eventually again we can't do it now but eventually I want to have

36

00:02:19,560  -->  00:02:22,150
a box around is a border and orange border.

37

00:02:22,260  -->  00:02:24,230
But it doesn't include this one.

38

00:02:24,270  -->  00:02:28,630
What I can do is just group them together in a div tag so d v

39

00:02:33,090  -->  00:02:35,340
and save.

40

00:02:35,460  -->  00:02:41,700
And if I refresh the page or actually open it in the first place it's not going to look different at

41

00:02:41,700  -->  00:02:42,350
all.

42

00:02:42,430  -->  00:02:48,180
It's not going to look like anything actually because there is no styling for us to see all that's happened

43

00:02:48,180  -->  00:02:53,580
is that these two things are now grouped in a container just a generic box a container to hold them

44

00:02:53,580  -->  00:02:56,540
together that we can then go style later.

45

00:02:56,580  -->  00:03:01,800
So if I gave that div a background if I made it have a yellow background that yellow background would

46

00:03:01,800  -->  00:03:07,350
go roughly around this but it wouldn't include any of the second paragraph.

47

00:03:07,350  -->  00:03:12,440
So that's a div span on the other hand is also a generic container.

48

00:03:12,630  -->  00:03:14,840
But there's a key difference.

49

00:03:14,910  -->  00:03:17,640
So let me start with an example here.

50

00:03:17,910  -->  00:03:23,520
Let's say I wanted to highlight some of these words right here.

51

00:03:23,670  -->  00:03:24,600
Ipsum door.

52

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:30,840
Whatever whatever I want to make this yellow rather than black so the rest of the text is black.

53

00:03:30,930  -->  00:03:34,510
But I want to highlight this as yellow and make the font bigger or something.

54

00:03:34,590  -->  00:03:36,090
Again we don't know how to do that yet.

55

00:03:36,450  -->  00:03:43,410
But the idea is I would need a tag around this and if I put a div right there which is a generic container

56

00:03:45,390  -->  00:03:54,960
ups and I save and refresh you'll see that it gets knocked onto a new line and that's because a div

57

00:03:54,990  -->  00:03:57,120
is a block level element.

58

00:03:57,120  -->  00:04:01,410
So that means that it takes up its own line just like a paragraph does.

59

00:04:01,410  -->  00:04:06,960
When you add a paragraph in everything after that paragraph is pushed down to a new line.

60

00:04:07,230  -->  00:04:10,470
So a div is a block level generic container.

61

00:04:10,470  -->  00:04:17,430
If I replace this with a span this is not going to be impressive at all because how can I see anything

62

00:04:17,430  -->  00:04:22,410
really you will see a change here but it will just look like a regular paragraph so I'm going to refresh

63

00:04:23,930  -->  00:04:25,340
and there is a container.

64

00:04:25,340  -->  00:04:30,140
Now there's a generic span around this content that's not doing anything.

65

00:04:30,540  -->  00:04:33,860
Unlike a div though it's an inline container.

66

00:04:33,870  -->  00:04:40,680
So span is for basically grouping content selecting content in line and a div is another way of grouping

67

00:04:40,680  -->  00:04:41,200
content.

68

00:04:41,310  -->  00:04:42,930
But it's a block level element.

69

00:04:43,200  -->  00:04:45,840
So I know this is a little bit theoretical at this point.

70

00:04:45,970  -->  00:04:48,820
It's kind of hard to understand the utility of.

71

00:04:48,990  -->  00:04:55,290
But very soon when we get into C Ss we'll be able to say something like go find that span I added in

72

00:04:55,380  -->  00:05:03,830
and make it fifteen point font and yellow or go find that div I added in and give it an orange border

73

00:05:04,010  -->  00:05:08,060
and whatever we do and then we end up with an orange border around this content.

74

00:05:08,070  -->  00:05:11,020
All right great divs span's generic containers.

75

00:05:11,190  -->  00:05:12,510
One is black one is in line
