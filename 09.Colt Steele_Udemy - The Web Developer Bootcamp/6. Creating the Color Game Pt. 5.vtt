00:00:00.650  -->  00:00:02.670
OK we'll come back in this video.

2

00:00:02.670  -->  00:00:05.040
We're going to work on a few new features.

3

00:00:05.040  -->  00:00:08.190
The first one is when I win the game.

4

00:00:08.460  -->  00:00:09.410
It tells me correct.

5

00:00:09.630  -->  00:00:15.440
And then I can click play again to get new colors and if I haven't won yet.

6

00:00:15.530  -->  00:00:19.460
But I also want new colors because for some reason I don't like the colors that I have.

7

00:00:19.680  -->  00:00:21.750
I can also click that new colors button.

8

00:00:21.930  -->  00:00:27.300
So basically we need a button that will reset the game pick new colors pick a new random color appear

9

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:32.770
out of the six random colors and we'll come back to the easy and hard mode last.

10

00:00:32.940  -->  00:00:35.870
So this button it does the same thing.

11

00:00:36.040  -->  00:00:42.240
The text changes though if we've won the game and it asked if we want to play again so we can click

12

00:00:42.240  -->  00:00:44.150
play again and that will reset it.

13

00:00:44.220  -->  00:00:48.540
But I can also click new colors and that will also reset it.

14

00:00:48.570  -->  00:00:49.840
So that's what we're going to focus on.

15

00:00:50.010  -->  00:00:55.590
And to start I'm going to go ahead and add in the button and add that stripe that goes across so that

16

00:00:55.590  -->  00:01:00.290
stripe will contain this button for a new color or for play again.

17

00:01:00.870  -->  00:01:02.890
And it contains the message that we already have.

18

00:01:03.060  -->  00:01:04.970
And then the two buttons that we'll do later.

19

00:01:05.250  -->  00:01:11.590
So if we go the first thing we need to do we already have a div I'm just going to give it id of stripe

20

00:01:12.750  -->  00:01:14.240
and then we can use that.

21

00:01:14.550  -->  00:01:19.560
And then we already have our span inside that will show something like correct or try again.

22

00:01:19.590  -->  00:01:27.990
And inside here we'll just add our button and this button will start by saying new colors we can save

23

00:01:28.780  -->  00:01:29.820
we refresh.

24

00:01:30.160  -->  00:01:33.140
OK that looks about just as bad as you would expect.

25

00:01:33.330  -->  00:01:39.330
Let's go ahead and add the white background color and center everything in this div So our div is called

26

00:01:39.330  -->  00:01:40.210
stripe.

27

00:01:40.590  -->  00:01:45.220
Let's go to our C Ss and we're going to select Strype which is an ID.

28

00:01:45.360  -->  00:01:48.970
So we need to use stripe with an afterthought.

29

00:01:49.260  -->  00:01:54.580
And we're going to set a background color background to be white.

30

00:01:54.660  -->  00:02:02.460
I'm going to set the height to be 30 pixels so that we have a nice and tall div are relatively tall

31

00:02:02.460  -->  00:02:09.030
div and I'm going to set text align to be Center.

32

00:02:09.300  -->  00:02:13.330
And now if I refresh you get a white div goes all the way across.

33

00:02:13.350  -->  00:02:15.220
It's a little bit taller than it was.

34

00:02:15.240  -->  00:02:17.230
We have a button in here just in to anything.

35

00:02:17.400  -->  00:02:23.640
And if I win or lose or get the wrong answer there's a span you just can't see it.

36

00:02:23.640  -->  00:02:27.290
And that's because the text from that span is white.

37

00:02:28.380  -->  00:02:34.950
So what you might think about doing is going into our stripe the div and saying the text color should

38

00:02:34.950  -->  00:02:38.690
be black but unfortunately that doesn't work.

39

00:02:38.880  -->  00:02:45.390
And this is an issue of specificity because we're saying that with this line right here everything inside

40

00:02:45.390  -->  00:02:52.110
the thing with the idea of stripe should be black text color black and you would think OK that's snidey

41

00:02:52.170  -->  00:02:58.890
that is super specific if you can think back to our early C S S specificity lectures and ID is very

42

00:02:58.890  -->  00:02:59.710
specific.

43

00:02:59.790  -->  00:03:05.440
The thing is though this is setting the colors to be black on the div with ID stripe.

44

00:03:05.970  -->  00:03:13.080
And then we're setting all spans so you can see here to be color white so that setting this to be white

45

00:03:13.140  -->  00:03:17.820
and that makes it more specific because we're actually targeting the element itself rather than the

46

00:03:17.820  -->  00:03:20.630
parent and having it inherit the color.

47

00:03:21.090  -->  00:03:22.570
So we have a few options.

48

00:03:22.590  -->  00:03:25.960
What I will do is actually just get rid of this for now.

49

00:03:26.040  -->  00:03:31.710
We're not going to set the color to be white anymore and we can refresh and you'll see that this doesn't

50

00:03:31.710  -->  00:03:36.720
change color it's still a white span even though we got rid of the line that said all spans are white

51

00:03:37.050  -->  00:03:42.960
and that's because it's inside of an H1 and it inherits the H1 text color which is white.

52

00:03:42.990  -->  00:03:45.590
Same way that this span here is black.

53

00:03:45.600  -->  00:03:51.720
It inherited the text color of black or just regular colored black from the stripe div that's around

54

00:03:51.720  -->  00:03:55.160
it which you can see here color black.

55

00:03:55.410  -->  00:03:56.770
And that's our striked it.

56

00:03:57.060  -->  00:03:57.660
OK.

57

00:03:57.810  -->  00:04:06.720
So let's now work on getting this button to reset the game so to start we need to add an event listener

58

00:04:06.730  -->  00:04:06.800
.

59

00:04:06.870  -->  00:04:09.750
And before we can do that we need to select that button.

60

00:04:09.960  -->  00:04:18.000
So I'm going to give that button and ID here we'll just call it ID equals reset and then we'll select

61

00:04:18.000  -->  00:04:21.000
that reset button instead of a Javascript.

62

00:04:21.000  -->  00:04:31.980
So var reset button equals document that query selector with our octave or reset.

63

00:04:31.980  -->  00:04:37.120
And then as always I'd like to add my simple test event listener.

64

00:04:37.140  -->  00:04:40.680
So reset button does add event listener.

65

00:04:40.860  -->  00:04:51.990
Click and when we click all that we'll do is do a simple alert quick reset button just like that be

66

00:04:52.070  -->  00:04:52.820
refresh.

67

00:04:52.970  -->  00:04:57.590
And if I click on this I get my alert and that means we're good to go.

68

00:04:57.590  -->  00:05:01.030
So next up we can actually work on the logic to reset.

69

00:05:01.250  -->  00:05:03.890
So what we need to do let's write the pseudo code.

70

00:05:03.890  -->  00:05:10.030
When you click on that button need to generate all new colors.

71

00:05:10.040  -->  00:05:20.750
We need to pick a new random color from array and then we need to change the colors of the squares on

72

00:05:20.750  -->  00:05:22.030
the page.

73

00:05:22.280  -->  00:05:28.310
So to generate all new colors we actually already have that function existing generate random colors

74

00:05:28.310  -->  00:05:28.910
.

75

00:05:29.030  -->  00:05:33.940
So we'll just say colors is now equal to generate random colors of six.

76

00:05:34.580  -->  00:05:41.270
And then we'll pick a new random color so pick the color is now equal to pick color the method or the

77

00:05:41.270  -->  00:05:42.860
function that we defined.

78

00:05:42.860  -->  00:05:48.890
There's one more thing we actually need to do which is change this display color to match the new picks

79

00:05:48.890  -->  00:05:49.540
color.

80

00:05:49.850  -->  00:05:52.040
So we'll just say change

81

00:05:55.250  -->  00:06:01.090
color display to match picked color so that one is simple.

82

00:06:01.160  -->  00:06:08.870
All we need to do is say color display dot text content

83

00:06:12.890  -->  00:06:21.890
equals picked color and if we refresh our page and we try clicking new colors what it's doing is generating

84

00:06:21.890  -->  00:06:23.110
six new colors.

85

00:06:23.120  -->  00:06:25.400
We're not seeing them yet because we don't have that code.

86

00:06:25.580  -->  00:06:30.750
And then it's picking one of those as picked color and then changing what we see here to match picta

87

00:06:30.770  -->  00:06:31.410
color.

88

00:06:31.730  -->  00:06:36.220
So it gives us a new random color up there and six random colors behind the scenes.

89

00:06:36.230  -->  00:06:42.230
So the last piece is to reflect those six new colors on the page and we've done that before.

90

00:06:42.260  -->  00:06:49.070
Down here we're looping through all the squares and we're changing squared up style that background

91

00:06:49.460  -->  00:06:50.440
to be colors.

92

00:06:50.450  -->  00:06:56.060
I so I'm going to start by just duplicating all of that here and we will refactor this.

93

00:06:56.350  -->  00:06:58.340
But to start to put it all here.

94

00:06:58.370  -->  00:07:07.170
So loop through all the squares squares to outflank I plus plus and then all we need to do is say squares

95

00:07:07.450  -->  00:07:12.600
I style that background equals colors.

96

00:07:13.020  -->  00:07:15.820
I will save.

97

00:07:16.070  -->  00:07:21.660
And if we refresh and we click on new colors it generates 60 random colors.

98

00:07:21.740  -->  00:07:22.820
It picks one.

99

00:07:22.820  -->  00:07:29.090
It updates the display to reflect the picture color and it changes all the six squares to match the

100

00:07:29.090  -->  00:07:30.360
new six colors.

101

00:07:30.710  -->  00:07:34.730
So let's try it out and see if our previous logic holds up as well.

102

00:07:35.240  -->  00:07:35.850
OK.

103

00:07:36.290  -->  00:07:39.130
So this one is decent amount of red.

104

00:07:39.140  -->  00:07:41.460
Very little green and a decent amount of blue.

105

00:07:41.840  -->  00:07:45.280
Let's try clicking on some that we don't think are right.

106

00:07:46.160  -->  00:07:48.880
And now let's go for one of the purples.

107

00:07:49.070  -->  00:07:50.940
So it looks like a little more red the blue.

108

00:07:50.960  -->  00:07:56.510
So I'm going to guess this and we're right and it looks like things are still working just fine.

109

00:07:56.540  -->  00:07:58.470
Quick new colors again.

110

00:07:58.610  -->  00:08:00.320
We want to reset this.

111

00:08:00.320  -->  00:08:01.960
That's a really minor cosmetic thing.

112

00:08:02.030  -->  00:08:08.470
But when we click on new colors we should reset the display here so that it goes back to black or to

113

00:08:08.510  -->  00:08:11.000
this dark gray color.

114

00:08:11.000  -->  00:08:16.670
The other thing we want to do is that when we when we want it to say play again as you can see here

115

00:08:17.030  -->  00:08:18.480
so I'll win here.

116

00:08:18.530  -->  00:08:20.350
This one is a lot of green.

117

00:08:20.540  -->  00:08:24.980
I win and it tells me play again and it does the same thing.

118

00:08:24.980  -->  00:08:29.260
Functionally it doesn't really change it's just us and different text.

119

00:08:29.300  -->  00:08:31.060
So that's simple to do.

120

00:08:31.100  -->  00:08:35.150
All we need to do is find where the code is to check if you win.

121

00:08:35.180  -->  00:08:36.240
That's right here.

122

00:08:36.620  -->  00:08:39.500
And then we just want to change the text content of that button.

123

00:08:39.740  -->  00:08:41.820
So the button was called reset button.

124

00:08:41.930  -->  00:08:51.740
So reset button that text content equals play again with a question mark refresh it says new colors

125

00:08:51.740  -->  00:08:52.700
.

126

00:08:52.790  -->  00:08:54.560
Now let's try playing one of these.

127

00:08:54.740  -->  00:08:58.750
So this one is a lot of red and a lot of green and a little bit of blue.

128

00:08:58.790  -->  00:09:02.070
So a lot of red and a lot of green is going to give us a yellow color.

129

00:09:02.210  -->  00:09:04.100
So let's narrow down some of them.

130

00:09:04.100  -->  00:09:08.180
And then a little bit of blue is going to make it lighter and brighter.

131

00:09:08.480  -->  00:09:13.590
So if we try one of these like this or this one you'll see that they're not quite right.

132

00:09:13.880  -->  00:09:17.230
And this is our answer here and it tells us play again.

133

00:09:17.300  -->  00:09:20.120
And real quick and it does the exact same thing.

134

00:09:20.180  -->  00:09:23.570
The last thing as I mentioned is changing the background color back.

135

00:09:23.570  -->  00:09:28.430
So right here we can just do that at the end of the reset button.

136

00:09:28.520  -->  00:09:30.950
We're just going to select that H-1.

137

00:09:31.200  -->  00:09:34.610
It's one dot which we selected here.

138

00:09:34.670  -->  00:09:37.090
That's dial up background.

139

00:09:37.160  -->  00:09:40.600
UPS equals.

140

00:09:40.640  -->  00:09:47.600
And it's that hexadecimal 2 3 2 3 2 3 which is if you forgot about that you could go look in SEE assess

141

00:09:47.900  -->  00:09:49.560
the body background color.

142

00:09:49.800  -->  00:09:55.410
Or we set it down here when we eliminate one of the colors if you pick the wrong color.

143

00:09:55.580  -->  00:09:58.680
We change the background color to be the same as the body.

144

00:09:59.150  -->  00:10:02.130
OK let's refresh new colors.

145

00:10:02.330  -->  00:10:03.820
Let's win now.

146

00:10:04.010  -->  00:10:10.760
Just quick randomly just for the sake of time we click on play again and it changes back to a black

147

00:10:10.760  -->  00:10:11.300
background.

148

00:10:11.310  -->  00:10:13.060
Or the dark gray background.

149

00:10:13.570  -->  00:10:15.530
OK so that's all for this video.

150

00:10:15.530  -->  00:10:19.790
Next up we're going to add the buttons to pick between easy and hard mode.

151

00:10:19.820  -->  00:10:22.590
And then lastly we're going to style things so that they look nice
