00:00:00,350  -->  00:00:03,100
Welcome back to our last video on this blog.

2

00:00:03,310  -->  00:00:04,400
So we have to change.

3

00:00:04,400  -->  00:00:05,050
We're going to make.

4

00:00:05,100  -->  00:00:11,070
The first one is to implement the Express sanitiser that I mentioned which will help us with that problem

5

00:00:11,400  -->  00:00:17,760
where if for displaying HDMI Olafur actually rendering him a user could potentially enter some harmful

6

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:20,030
javascript instead of a script hack.

7

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:27,240
We don't want to run that code so we use sanitiser to help us with that basically takes that input and

8

00:00:27,240  -->  00:00:30,980
it removes all scripts out of it and just gives us the peer aged him out.

9

00:00:31,290  -->  00:00:33,660
And then we also want to style the index page a bit.

10

00:00:33,690  -->  00:00:38,820
It's looking a little bit rough and the last thing will do is make a small update to a restful Rhodes

11

00:00:38,820  -->  00:00:41,730
table just to make it a little more useful for you.

12

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:44,000
So let's begin with the sanitiser.

13

00:00:44,400  -->  00:00:51,350
So I'm going to install a package called Express dash sanitiser dash dash.

14

00:00:51,390  -->  00:00:53,430
Save.

15

00:00:54,930  -->  00:00:55,660
OK.

16

00:00:55,710  -->  00:01:06,060
Now that that's done in our app yes we're going to require that so express sanitiser equals require

17

00:01:07,050  -->  00:01:12,080
express Desch sanitiser just like that.

18

00:01:12,330  -->  00:01:20,820
And then we have to tell our app to use it app use Express sanitiser and the only requirement is that

19

00:01:20,820  -->  00:01:23,690
this goes after all the parser.

20

00:01:23,730  -->  00:01:25,110
Define here.

21

00:01:25,270  -->  00:01:25,960
OK.

22

00:01:26,410  -->  00:01:27,730
And that's it.

23

00:01:27,750  -->  00:01:34,410
Now to use it you want to do it to start instead of are created when you create a new blog.

24

00:01:34,410  -->  00:01:36,180
So it's really create an update.

25

00:01:36,180  -->  00:01:39,900
Are the two places where we're taking data and saving into the database.

26

00:01:39,900  -->  00:01:47,340
Both times you want to make sure sanitize the input and instead of create what we want to sanitize is

27

00:01:47,340  -->  00:01:54,630
request up body up log of body which is kind of a mess remember request up body is whatever is coming

28

00:01:54,630  -->  00:02:01,230
from a form whatever data is in the request body which in our case is coming from a form then blog is

29

00:02:01,230  -->  00:02:03,770
because of this line right here.

30

00:02:04,240  -->  00:02:09,020
Blog title blog image and find finally blog body.

31

00:02:09,270  -->  00:02:11,020
And this is the one that we care about.

32

00:02:11,280  -->  00:02:13,500
So we have to do blog dot body.

33

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:18,470
So it's kind of a long long name here but request body up blog temp body.

34

00:02:18,720  -->  00:02:25,740
And we're going to change it so that it's equal to request that sanitize and we're going to sanitize

35

00:02:25,740  -->  00:02:27,630
this entire thing.

36

00:02:29,100  -->  00:02:35,580
So we're taking what it's currently equal to sanitizing it and then changing the entire request a body

37

00:02:35,590  -->  00:02:38,670
dump logged body to equal that.

38

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:42,230
So let me make that clear for you let's do a constable blog.

39

00:02:42,770  -->  00:02:51,510
Request that body before and after.

40

00:02:51,510  -->  00:02:53,080
Just like that.

41

00:02:53,520  -->  00:02:59,330
And let me add in something to make it a little easier to see.

42

00:02:59,340  -->  00:03:00,100
Great.

43

00:03:00,570  -->  00:03:01,080
OK.

44

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:02,360
So let's give it a shot now.

45

00:03:02,400  -->  00:03:03,210
Start the server

46

00:03:06,990  -->  00:03:08,140
fresh the page.

47

00:03:08,250  -->  00:03:10,600
We will have to create a new post.

48

00:03:11,340  -->  00:03:18,480
Let's make one just called Demo random image and let's add in some good HMO that we want to use or to

49

00:03:18,480  -->  00:03:24,790
enter and then something bad which will just be an alert again.

50

00:03:26,680  -->  00:03:28,630
There we go.

51

00:03:28,680  -->  00:03:35,330
So if this works we should see that before has both of these and the after only has this.

52

00:03:35,730  -->  00:03:37,920
Let's take a look at what's come to about.

53

00:03:37,950  -->  00:03:38,620
Perfect.

54

00:03:38,640  -->  00:03:41,610
You can see the first time body is equal to this.

55

00:03:41,610  -->  00:03:45,320
Or we had our script tag in there the second time.

56

00:03:45,390  -->  00:03:47,360
Body only has the H-1.

57

00:03:47,820  -->  00:03:49,830
So that's all we have to do to sanitize something.

58

00:03:50,040  -->  00:03:56,690
And if we now display did we go to our new post which they believe is this one.

59

00:03:56,690  -->  00:03:59,700
Here we take a look.

60

00:03:59,730  -->  00:04:03,350
We're displaying the issue himself but there's no script tag at all.

61

00:04:03,540  -->  00:04:04,950
So that works great.

62

00:04:04,950  -->  00:04:14,380
The last thing they want to do is run the same code but do it instead of the update.

63

00:04:15,180  -->  00:04:21,040
We are right there before we update request up on the blog.

64

00:04:21,390  -->  00:04:23,110
Well did the same thing.

65

00:04:23,400  -->  00:04:24,630
A minor No.

66

00:04:24,750  -->  00:04:29,220
This would be a good use case for what's known as a middleware which we haven't really talked about

67

00:04:29,220  -->  00:04:34,170
yet but it's something that we're repeating two times in two different routes.

68

00:04:34,170  -->  00:04:39,960
What we can do is write a middleware which will run this code before these two routes but we'll cover

69

00:04:39,960  -->  00:04:40,410
middleware.

70

00:04:40,440  -->  00:04:45,270
Later in this course towards the end of EXPRESS So we're leaving it how it is for now.

71

00:04:45,720  -->  00:04:47,270
And that works just fine.

72

00:04:47,520  -->  00:04:52,840
That will sanitize it both time when you update anybody create next.

73

00:04:52,860  -->  00:04:55,300
Let's focus on or index that E.J..

74

00:04:55,320  -->  00:04:56,050
Yes.

75

00:04:56,060  -->  00:04:57,800
So it needs a little bit of work.

76

00:04:57,850  -->  00:04:59,380
Looks like this right now.

77

00:04:59,760  -->  00:05:03,160
Let's start by deleting a few things.

78

00:05:03,600  -->  00:05:08,400
And that was one of the posts that I had created before we added the sanitiser in.

79

00:05:08,440  -->  00:05:15,820
I To delete some of these ones that don't have images just so that we end up with something easier to

80

00:05:15,820  -->  00:05:18,120
style where we can actually see the images.

81

00:05:18,570  -->  00:05:23,920
OK so we have these what we want to do is center them to start and I'm going to use a lot of the code

82

00:05:23,920  -->  00:05:25,370
that we already have used.

83

00:05:25,600  -->  00:05:32,110
So instead of our index we have a header that's good but then we're going to put everything inside of

84

00:05:33,010  -->  00:05:41,890
a div and this div will have class equal to UI main text container which is what gives us that centered

85

00:05:41,890  -->  00:05:42,800
container.

86

00:05:43,060  -->  00:05:45,730
And then inside will have our div.

87

00:05:46,060  -->  00:05:51,310
And this is basically recycled from the last little line in the last little bit we wrote for the forms

88

00:05:51,570  -->  00:05:52,690
and for the show page.

89

00:05:52,720  -->  00:05:58,890
So class equals you huge header and then we'll just put a set of index page.

90

00:05:58,930  -->  00:06:03,990
Let's just put it rest for a blog.

91

00:06:04,390  -->  00:06:05,710
Just like that.

92

00:06:05,830  -->  00:06:09,700
And then when we have that done well I added another div.

93

00:06:09,700  -->  00:06:18,370
This one will have our segment in it which gives this UI top attached segment that gives just that little

94

00:06:18,370  -->  00:06:23,770
line in the box and then inside of there are going to be looping through.

95

00:06:24,010  -->  00:06:33,100
And we set off one more line before we even get to the loop which is a div with the class UI divided

96

00:06:33,340  -->  00:06:33,880
items

97

00:06:36,970  -->  00:06:43,390
and then for each item we go inside of you I divided items and we get an automatic divider put between

98

00:06:43,390  -->  00:06:43,940
them.

99

00:06:44,170  -->  00:06:49,120
So we're going to copy this code into this you are divided items.

100

00:06:49,120  -->  00:06:53,700
What we do need to make some changes.

101

00:06:53,710  -->  00:06:58,470
The first is just in debt but we're not just going to print this inside.

102

00:06:58,510  -->  00:07:07,690
We're going to create a div class equal to item and then inside the item we have our image first and

103

00:07:07,690  -->  00:07:16,450
the image will go instead of a div with class equal to image and we'll put that out there and that will

104

00:07:16,450  -->  00:07:21,000
help constrain the size of the image so we don't get those gigantic images taking up the entire screen

105

00:07:21,030  -->  00:07:21,620
anymore.

106

00:07:21,990  -->  00:07:29,780
OK so did the image put the image inside then need another div class equal to the content.

107

00:07:30,220  -->  00:07:32,470
And this is where I will put a few things.

108

00:07:32,470  -->  00:07:38,290
First one is the title and rather than making an H-2 with a title actually and to make an anchor tag

109

00:07:39,270  -->  00:07:47,140
and or anchor tag will have class equal to Hetter but will also have a ref equal to the show page which

110

00:07:47,150  -->  00:07:53,430
and Riskin a copy that you are here just like that which you already have.

111

00:07:53,440  -->  00:07:59,740
So the read more link so the reason we're doing this so that we can end up with our header for each

112

00:07:59,740  -->  00:08:04,470
blog I can click on it to go to the show page or click on read more.

113

00:08:04,880  -->  00:08:07,410
Let's make sure we have a small syntax error.

114

00:08:07,450  -->  00:08:11,450
We're missing our closing quote right here for Atra flops.

115

00:08:12,670  -->  00:08:13,630
OK.

116

00:08:13,960  -->  00:08:18,520
Atra is the show page and then inside the brackets we have a blog title.

117

00:08:18,520  -->  00:08:19,860
It's kind of a mess.

118

00:08:19,930  -->  00:08:27,460
Then after that we'll add in a div with class equal to Metta which is just a place for us to put information

119

00:08:27,460  -->  00:08:35,080
about this particular item which in our case will just be a span with the date which we already have

120

00:08:35,090  -->  00:08:35,530
.

121

00:08:36,040  -->  00:08:42,040
But I'm going to format this date as well so blog dot created to date string which we already saw on

122

00:08:42,040  -->  00:08:51,890
the show page and then we close that live there then we'll have a div class equal to description.

123

00:08:52,210  -->  00:08:55,280
And that's where we'll put this content.

124

00:08:55,690  -->  00:08:58,230
The actual body of the blog.

125

00:08:58,600  -->  00:09:04,060
And rather than doing equal sign I'll change it back to a dash or not change it back but we'll change

126

00:09:04,060  -->  00:09:08,160
it to a dasht so that we get the actual age of our content that's now sanitized.

127

00:09:08,380  -->  00:09:17,380
Lastly I a div classical to extra and instead of that will put the button to to read more and will make

128

00:09:17,380  -->  00:09:24,430
an anchor tag and I'm going to copy a tag we already have in and change it just a little bit.

129

00:09:24,430  -->  00:09:30,710
So we don't need the classical to header anymore but we do want instead is a large button.

130

00:09:30,970  -->  00:09:35,280
So I floated basic.

131

00:09:35,470  -->  00:09:38,410
Pick your color of do Violet again.

132

00:09:39,370  -->  00:09:42,190
And we can do this a little bit.

133

00:09:42,190  -->  00:09:44,630
It's definitely a lot to look at.

134

00:09:44,950  -->  00:09:48,090
So let's put this let's put this up just a little bit.

135

00:09:48,160  -->  00:09:57,340
So after the opening here then set the anchor tag we'll have read more and we'll add on an icon

136

00:10:01,680  -->  00:10:07,360
a chevron icon which will just be a little arrow after read more.

137

00:10:07,380  -->  00:10:09,040
OK marathon there.

138

00:10:09,070  -->  00:10:10,680
Lots of stuff we added in.

139

00:10:10,750  -->  00:10:18,880
Just make sure everything is looking OK and definitely just take a look at the solution code if you

140

00:10:18,880  -->  00:10:20,470
don't want to take this from scratch.

141

00:10:20,710  -->  00:10:25,360
Let's see how it's looking for you don't have any syntax errors.

142

00:10:27,310  -->  00:10:30,570
That or we go just what we're looking for.

143

00:10:30,580  -->  00:10:37,550
So we're truncating the first 100 characters in that or as many characters as there are in this post

144

00:10:37,550  -->  00:10:37,570
.

145

00:10:37,570  -->  00:10:43,560
In this case very short click on read more the link works takes us to the show page.

146

00:10:43,690  -->  00:10:47,760
We can edit go back.

147

00:10:47,760  -->  00:10:49,170
We have her images here.

148

00:10:49,210  -->  00:10:57,370
After divided lines we have our Hetter we have this segment going around everything and we're done pretty

149

00:10:57,380  -->  00:10:57,910
much.

150

00:10:58,210  -->  00:11:04,060
So again don't feel like we definitely don't feel like you have to know all of these classes.

151

00:11:04,060  -->  00:11:04,940
I kind of just did.

152

00:11:05,140  -->  00:11:06,090
You know gave them to you.

153

00:11:06,130  -->  00:11:07,380
Rapid fire style.

154

00:11:07,510  -->  00:11:10,660
Because a point is not that you you learn all these.

155

00:11:11,080  -->  00:11:14,670
But if you do want to learn more and go to semantic dashi why dotcom.

156

00:11:14,690  -->  00:11:17,200
There's a lot of great tutorials and resources.

157

00:11:17,260  -->  00:11:21,270
It's still not as widely used as bootstrap but it's definitely growing.

158

00:11:21,400  -->  00:11:24,770
I have noticed a lot of my students would find it on their own.

159

00:11:24,880  -->  00:11:30,700
Whereas in the past I would introduce it to them after bluechip in the most the two most recent classes

160

00:11:30,700  -->  00:11:35,860
I taught the students really quickly fell in love with it without me ever showing it to them and they

161

00:11:35,870  -->  00:11:37,430
ended up using it over bootstrap.

162

00:11:37,630  -->  00:11:40,800
Most students but totally up to you.

163

00:11:40,880  -->  00:11:45,300
I enjoyed both of them and bootstrap is definitely more popular for now.

164

00:11:45,340  -->  00:11:50,780
OK so the last thing I mentioned we do is refactor our table just a tiny bit.

165

00:11:50,920  -->  00:11:56,470
And all I want to do is add in a final column for the mongoose method that corresponds to each one of

166

00:11:56,470  -->  00:11:57,140
these.

167

00:11:57,400  -->  00:12:03,510
So find by id find by 80 an update find by id add remove and so on.

168

00:12:03,860  -->  00:12:06,100
I'll be a quick review of how tables work.

169

00:12:06,110  -->  00:12:15,590
So here's a chart that age the amount we need to add in another th and we'll just call it mongoose method

170

00:12:16,930  -->  00:12:24,540
and let's open up the preview a cooking preview and move it to the bottom here.

171

00:12:24,750  -->  00:12:27,150
There's our table or new th.

172

00:12:27,460  -->  00:12:36,450
And then for index we'll add a TV in the mongoose method there for dog should be dog find.

173

00:12:36,880  -->  00:12:38,230
There you go.

174

00:12:38,230  -->  00:12:43,400
Next up we have new which actually doesn't have a monkish method at all.

175

00:12:43,450  -->  00:12:50,890
So rather than leaving it blank I'll just put in a file that it does is render a form.

176

00:12:51,130  -->  00:12:59,330
Next we have create and create is going to do a dog dot create.

177

00:13:01,150  -->  00:13:07,760
And one really cool feature if you do this life preview is as a MIDI editing the came noticed that it

178

00:13:07,750  -->  00:13:12,040
shows me when I'm selecting down here which is pretty cool.

179

00:13:12,190  -->  00:13:15,920
So you don't even have to open up the inspector and just see live.

180

00:13:16,120  -->  00:13:21,900
And if they change things they update live as well without having to save or refresh the page.

181

00:13:22,420  -->  00:13:22,820
OK.

182

00:13:22,930  -->  00:13:31,900
So then we have a show which does a dog that find by ID then we have it.

183

00:13:32,260  -->  00:13:35,400
Which also does a dog get fined by ID.

184

00:13:35,710  -->  00:13:44,830
We have to find the dog that we're editing and that's for the form and then update does a dog that trimed

185

00:13:44,830  -->  00:13:49,880
by id and update long one.

186

00:13:50,360  -->  00:14:00,830
And he is also somewhat long dog does find by id and remove every go.

187

00:14:01,300  -->  00:14:02,300
Let's take a look.

188

00:14:02,620  -->  00:14:04,250
Here's our table.

189

00:14:04,380  -->  00:14:12,410
Looks like I accidentally deleted one of the CDs here which is supposed to display what update does

190

00:14:12,670  -->  00:14:23,150
so update is supposed to update the dog stuper tickler dog then redirect somewhere.

191

00:14:24,150  -->  00:14:24,860
All right.

192

00:14:25,150  -->  00:14:26,430
Now we should be back to normal.

193

00:14:26,480  -->  00:14:28,220
Here's our table.

194

00:14:28,210  -->  00:14:31,740
So the only one that doesn't have any mongoose methods at all.

195

00:14:31,960  -->  00:14:37,390
It's going to be new because new is not finding anything the database it's not adding anything.

196

00:14:37,570  -->  00:14:40,090
It just renders us a form.

197

00:14:40,210  -->  00:14:40,570
Great.

198

00:14:40,570  -->  00:14:44,580
So hopefully this is useful for you in the future can refer to this table.

199

00:14:44,870  -->  00:14:49,150
I'll be referring back to it certainly it covers a lot of important information that we'll be using

200

00:14:49,150  -->  00:14:50,290
a lot.

201

00:14:50,290  -->  00:14:50,860
All right.

202

00:14:50,980  -->  00:14:56,280
So we finish this now we get to move on to some more fun things some more complicated apps.

203

00:14:56,360  -->  00:14:59,980
I noticed there was a little bit of America on covered a lot.

204

00:15:00,040  -->  00:15:01,710
It's always a tough one to make.

205

00:15:01,710  -->  00:15:03,870
Interesting because just a lot of information.

206

00:15:03,880  -->  00:15:11,170
But but it's important to have that credibility be able to create read update and delete an entity takes

207

00:15:11,170  -->  00:15:12,380
a lot of wraps.

208

00:15:12,380  -->  00:15:12,810
All right.

209

00:15:12,900  -->  00:15:13,920
I'll see you in the next year.
