00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:05,740
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to use bootstrap to create a landing page for a fictitious startup

2

00:00:05,740  -->  00:00:05,940
.

3

00:00:06,070  -->  00:00:08,760
Our startup is called Perfect match.

4

00:00:08,760  -->  00:00:09,210
Very funny.

5

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:15,300
I know it's a human feline dating app and I'll leave it up to you to interpret what human feline dating

6

00:00:15,300  -->  00:00:21,750
is it might be relatively innocuous it could just be matching Sheldrick cats with lonely humans could

7

00:00:21,750  -->  00:00:22,430
be something else.

8

00:00:22,440  -->  00:00:23,260
I don't know.

9

00:00:23,550  -->  00:00:27,690
Let's get started by doing a quick tour of the site and write to her.

10

00:00:27,690  -->  00:00:29,920
I really just mean pointing out a few features.

11

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:31,250
There's not much here.

12

00:00:31,290  -->  00:00:33,780
We don't actually have this hooked up it doesn't do anything yet.

13

00:00:33,840  -->  00:00:37,770
So it's really just HD mounseers s but that's all that we've covered so far.

14

00:00:38,100  -->  00:00:42,510
So we have enough our perfect match home about incontact lengths.

15

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:50,100
They don't actually go anywhere sign up and log in on the right side two little icons there we get her

16

00:00:50,100  -->  00:00:51,030
hamburger.

17

00:00:51,180  -->  00:00:52,320
I can click on it.

18

00:00:52,380  -->  00:00:55,980
All of those links are now inside that hamburger.

19

00:00:55,980  -->  00:01:01,650
Then we have a big background image that stays centered and it covers the entire background.

20

00:01:01,740  -->  00:01:07,590
So in the middle we have the name of our start up perfect match with to ours and then we have our caption

21

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:09,750
The only human feed on dating app.

22

00:01:09,750  -->  00:01:15,420
And then we have a little H R here horizontal rule and then a button to get started with an icon.

23

00:01:15,810  -->  00:01:21,990
And as I shrink this it all stays in the middle and it also moves up a little bit so that we don't have

24

00:01:21,990  -->  00:01:26,960
some sort of awkward layout on your mobile device where the text starts halfway down the page.

25

00:01:27,060  -->  00:01:29,690
So we move it up a bit and it stays centered.

26

00:01:29,700  -->  00:01:33,900
This layouts really easy to do and bootstrap but it's relatively effective for landing page.

27

00:01:33,900  -->  00:01:38,180
All that we have is a single column that takes up the entire width.

28

00:01:38,220  -->  00:01:40,850
So this column goes 12 units across.

29

00:01:40,860  -->  00:01:46,890
We're not dividing it up into any sections just to one column 12 units across and then we center everything

30

00:01:46,890  -->  00:01:48,510
inside of that column.

31

00:01:48,540  -->  00:01:49,860
So let's get started.

32

00:01:49,860  -->  00:01:52,350
First thing we need to do is make a file.

33

00:01:52,440  -->  00:01:54,640
I have one called index at DML.

34

00:01:54,720  -->  00:01:58,890
I'll add this in my regular boilerplate perfect match

35

00:02:01,700  -->  00:02:04,950
and then start by adding in Bootstrap and I'll use a CDN

36

00:02:08,580  -->  00:02:10,410
Bitstrips CDN.

37

00:02:11,490  -->  00:02:14,350
Let's do the SS and Javascript out here.

38

00:02:14,400  -->  00:02:16,860
We will need that javascript for the taskbar.

39

00:02:17,220  -->  00:02:19,130
So we need to link tag.

40

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:22,770
Then we get the javascript.

41

00:02:22,770  -->  00:02:24,030
Copy that.

42

00:02:24,090  -->  00:02:32,030
Put this down at the bottom which is a script tag and then we set source equal to that you are.

43

00:02:32,520  -->  00:02:41,040
Now if we open this up OK open up the console we have a small problem which is that we need Jay query

44

00:02:41,040  -->  00:02:43,390
as well in order for the bootstrap javascript.

45

00:02:43,450  -->  00:02:46,290
Remember back from the nav bar lesson we need to require J.

46

00:02:46,290  -->  00:02:46,750
Querrey.

47

00:02:46,860  -->  00:02:52,500
So we'll get a CDN for that.

48

00:02:53,730  -->  00:02:55,290
We'll do the modified version.

49

00:02:55,290  -->  00:02:57,500
Copy that URL.

50

00:02:57,600  -->  00:03:04,110
And finally we go back here and we have to do it before the linked to bootstrap to the javascript.

51

00:03:04,440  -->  00:03:09,360
Otherwise it will still not know about your query so it needs to load the query first.

52

00:03:09,360  -->  00:03:10,650
Now let's try again.

53

00:03:10,870  -->  00:03:11,960
Fire refresh.

54

00:03:12,520  -->  00:03:17,490
OK we don't see anything that's a good sign because we don't see any errors.

55

00:03:18,570  -->  00:03:20,850
Let's begin with the text in the middle.

56

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:22,480
All this content here.

57

00:03:22,620  -->  00:03:29,570
So we need to create a container and then inside the container we need a row to div class ECOs container

58

00:03:30,870  -->  00:03:35,870
and then inside of there we have another div we always need that row.

59

00:03:35,930  -->  00:03:45,780
Anytime we're using the grid system and then our div that's going to be class equal to column dash large

60

00:03:46,230  -->  00:03:47,220
12.

61

00:03:48,240  -->  00:03:50,750
And that will span all the way across that container.

62

00:03:51,210  -->  00:03:59,330
And then inside if they're going to have an H1 that will just say perfect match and save.

63

00:03:59,520  -->  00:04:02,280
And let's leave it at that refresh.

64

00:04:02,580  -->  00:04:06,660
And it's not really what we want yet and that's because there's a few things we need to do.

65

00:04:06,660  -->  00:04:09,010
The first is that we need to center everything in that column.

66

00:04:09,300  -->  00:04:16,700
So if we inspect what we're dealing with here you could see that the H1 goes all the way across and

67

00:04:16,710  -->  00:04:19,190
we just need to center it inside of that.

68

00:04:19,410  -->  00:04:21,680
And the second is that we need to push it down a bit.

69

00:04:21,720  -->  00:04:26,250
We need to add some padding or margin so that doesn't go right to the top of our page.

70

00:04:26,250  -->  00:04:28,480
Let's start by adding in the rest of the content.

71

00:04:28,830  -->  00:04:36,180
So we also have the only human feline dating app and that will just be an H 3 and we could really play

72

00:04:36,180  -->  00:04:46,110
with that could be any element that we want but I'll make it an H-3 the only human dash feline dating

73

00:04:46,590  -->  00:04:47,730
app.

74

00:04:48,090  -->  00:04:54,060
And then we can add in that horizontal rule which won't look like much but we'll style it after the

75

00:04:54,060  -->  00:04:59,180
fact and then we'll also add in a button in the class on that button.

76

00:04:59,240  -->  00:05:01,680
We take a look.

77

00:05:02,100  -->  00:05:06,010
This is a bootstrap button default and it's a button large.

78

00:05:06,330  -->  00:05:07,830
Let's go back.

79

00:05:07,830  -->  00:05:18,120
So we need PTEN and then the color default and then the size between LG for large and in here we'll

80

00:05:18,120  -->  00:05:20,520
just add the text which is get started

81

00:05:24,290  -->  00:05:29,320
and save let's see what we end up with.

82

00:05:29,340  -->  00:05:30,330
All right.

83

00:05:30,330  -->  00:05:34,270
So we have our content now next but Center inside of the grid.

84

00:05:34,470  -->  00:05:36,920
And then we'll focus on the padding and moving it down.

85

00:05:36,930  -->  00:05:41,430
But to start with the center inside this grid and to make that easier I'm going to group it all inside

86

00:05:41,430  -->  00:05:44,720
of a div so that we don't have to center each thing individually.

87

00:05:44,760  -->  00:05:49,680
We have to center the H-1 and then the three and then the button rather we can group in a div and just

88

00:05:49,680  -->  00:05:51,430
Center that div with one line.

89

00:05:51,750  -->  00:06:01,490
Let's make a div and I'll give it an ID of Cantet and then we'll put everything inside of there.

90

00:06:01,560  -->  00:06:08,340
So the H-1 the age 3 the H.R. and the button will properly indent and save.

91

00:06:08,580  -->  00:06:13,420
So nothing should look different if I refresh the page before we do that let's add in our style sheet

92

00:06:13,420  -->  00:06:14,270
.

93

00:06:14,340  -->  00:06:18,840
So I added a link tag and I'll call my style sheet app.

94

00:06:18,920  -->  00:06:20,920
SS It doesn't exist yet.

95

00:06:21,120  -->  00:06:24,220
So I need to make it save it.

96

00:06:24,230  -->  00:06:27,060
I see SS in the same directory.

97

00:06:27,420  -->  00:06:31,550
And let's start with something simple like all h ones are purple.

98

00:06:31,680  -->  00:06:35,030
Just to make sure it works OK.

99

00:06:35,400  -->  00:06:37,060
Let's go back refresh.

100

00:06:37,390  -->  00:06:39,100
Andrew get a purple H-1.

101

00:06:39,180  -->  00:06:39,670
Great.

102

00:06:39,870  -->  00:06:44,970
So now let's select that Dave we added with idea of content and center it.

103

00:06:45,030  -->  00:06:53,620
So get rid of that and we need an ID content and omitting to do is text align Center.

104

00:06:54,210  -->  00:06:56,430
Let's go back.

105

00:06:56,430  -->  00:06:57,110
There we go.

106

00:06:57,120  -->  00:06:59,490
So things are Center aligned to now.

107

00:06:59,490  -->  00:07:06,720
Next we'll push this down a bit 25 percent down the page to be exact with padding equal to 25 percent

108

00:07:06,720  -->  00:07:07,440
.

109

00:07:07,470  -->  00:07:15,270
So in here we'll do padding top 25 percent.

110

00:07:16,270  -->  00:07:21,720
And rather than giving it a hard number of pixels if we keep it as a percentage it's a little bit more

111

00:07:21,720  -->  00:07:22,870
responsive.

112

00:07:22,890  -->  00:07:24,790
So that's right in the center.

113

00:07:25,230  -->  00:07:29,940
And then 25 percent changes as we resize the screen.

114

00:07:29,940  -->  00:07:30,540
Great.

115

00:07:30,540  -->  00:07:32,480
Now let's add in the background image.

116

00:07:32,670  -->  00:07:38,460
So the image that I'm using is adorable cat and human interaction going on here is from this on Splash

117

00:07:38,460  -->  00:07:43,280
Web site which I introduced in the last video where we created the bootstrap image grid.

118

00:07:43,680  -->  00:07:48,300
And they have all sorts of really great high quality images that you can use without any issue.

119

00:07:48,480  -->  00:07:54,110
And the one that I use is right here I search for cat links in that description as well.

120

00:07:54,450  -->  00:08:00,230
Here's the you Aro of this image just right click copy the image you are l.

121

00:08:00,360  -->  00:08:06,310
Now let's go back and I'm going to add it to the body as a background image.

122

00:08:06,800  -->  00:08:13,830
So background and then give it a URL which is that giant You are right there.

123

00:08:13,830  -->  00:08:22,530
And if we leave it at that it's form at this level or refresh we get a gigantic background image and

124

00:08:22,530  -->  00:08:26,010
all we can tell is that this is some sort of startup for fingernails.

125

00:08:26,010  -->  00:08:36,060
So we need to resize it and to do that we use background size and change that to be covered afresh.

126

00:08:36,060  -->  00:08:39,230
Again we're getting closer.

127

00:08:39,270  -->  00:08:44,430
This will make the image as small as possible while still covering the entire width and height of the

128

00:08:44,430  -->  00:08:44,950
screen.

129

00:08:45,240  -->  00:08:50,820
So it won't change the aspect ratio it won't skew the image in any way but it will stretch in both directions

130

00:08:50,850  -->  00:08:52,240
as much as it needs to.

131

00:08:52,350  -->  00:08:57,060
But the minimum amount that it needs to to fit on our screen and it's still not perfect.

132

00:08:57,210  -->  00:09:01,900
And what we want to do is not change the size of it but change the position.

133

00:09:02,190  -->  00:09:10,280
We're going to center it background position center but save that we're closer.

134

00:09:10,290  -->  00:09:13,320
But it's still not a perfect match as far as the image goes.

135

00:09:13,800  -->  00:09:15,510
And those changes will come later.

136

00:09:15,510  -->  00:09:21,540
For now I want to focus on adding in the nav bar and to do that when you go to the Boucek docs and go

137

00:09:21,540  -->  00:09:24,650
to components and I've mentioned this before.

138

00:09:25,080  -->  00:09:27,690
I always do this if I'm adding in a bootstrap nav bar.

139

00:09:27,810  -->  00:09:29,850
It's just too much stuff to remember otherwise.

140

00:09:30,230  -->  00:09:32,070
And I just copy this right here.

141

00:09:32,370  -->  00:09:39,630
Will take the entire nav to start go back to our app here and just put it right at the top.

142

00:09:39,630  -->  00:09:46,110
This is definitely not the NAF that we want but it contains the pieces that we want to refresh.

143

00:09:46,380  -->  00:09:47,380
It's close enough.

144

00:09:47,610  -->  00:09:49,360
So there's a few changes we want to make.

145

00:09:49,470  -->  00:09:55,890
The first and easiest one is that our content on the solution is in a container so it doesn't go all

146

00:09:55,890  -->  00:09:58,570
the way to the edges like it does here.

147

00:09:59,100  -->  00:10:05,670
So we can go back and inset or are we just change this to be div class container and if we go back now

148

00:10:07,290  -->  00:10:13,020
you can see that because we added in that container we now have some spacing just like we do over here

149

00:10:13,260  -->  00:10:14,250
on the solution.

150

00:10:14,250  -->  00:10:16,920
Now let's get to work on the actual content of the Nev..

151

00:10:17,070  -->  00:10:26,520
So the easiest thing is to change the brand which right now just says Brand back in here this line class

152

00:10:26,550  -->  00:10:33,950
equals neth bar brand and we'll change it to per fixed match and save.

153

00:10:33,940  -->  00:10:34,990
Try it out.

154

00:10:35,490  -->  00:10:37,500
OK good.

155

00:10:37,500  -->  00:10:39,050
Now let's get rid of this form.

156

00:10:39,060  -->  00:10:41,150
We don't need this at all.

157

00:10:41,310  -->  00:10:45,030
So our form all starts right here.

158

00:10:45,030  -->  00:10:50,490
Get rid of that entire thing refresh.

159

00:10:50,860  -->  00:10:52,560
Let's also get rid of the dropdown.

160

00:10:52,560  -->  00:10:54,570
You don't need that.

161

00:10:54,570  -->  00:10:56,680
So that starts right here.

162

00:10:56,680  -->  00:10:58,680
This lie that ends there

163

00:11:01,770  -->  00:11:02,810
are fresh again.

164

00:11:03,120  -->  00:11:04,540
Now we have a single link.

165

00:11:04,710  -->  00:11:10,910
So we'll start with these two links which are supposed to be sign up and log it.

166

00:11:11,360  -->  00:11:18,110
That's this link right here so we can change that one to be sign up and then duplicate it.

167

00:11:18,390  -->  00:11:21,450
Just an ally with an anchor tag inside of it.

168

00:11:21,450  -->  00:11:23,840
And this one will be logged in.

169

00:11:24,750  -->  00:11:26,640
Let's check it out.

170

00:11:26,700  -->  00:11:27,260
Great.

171

00:11:27,270  -->  00:11:29,100
So the icons will come at the end.

172

00:11:29,100  -->  00:11:30,380
We have the two links.

173

00:11:30,450  -->  00:11:32,320
Now we need three links here.

174

00:11:32,340  -->  00:11:35,500
We already have two of them and we'll get rid of that dropdown.

175

00:11:35,610  -->  00:11:38,560
So we need home about in contact.

176

00:11:38,600  -->  00:11:41,490
So a locate that dropdown which is right here.

177

00:11:41,490  -->  00:11:43,100
Class equals dropdown.

178

00:11:43,140  -->  00:11:49,070
Let's get rid of it and are now Akbar's simplified a lot.

179

00:11:49,080  -->  00:11:50,370
Now we have two different lengths.

180

00:11:50,390  -->  00:11:53,760
We'll actually get rid of both of them and do it from scratch.

181

00:11:53,760  -->  00:12:00,120
So we'll add in one ally with an anchor tag and then we'll do that three times.

182

00:12:00,120  -->  00:12:02,260
This first one should say home.

183

00:12:02,550  -->  00:12:04,100
The next one is about.

184

00:12:04,320  -->  00:12:06,530
And the last one is contact.

185

00:12:07,020  -->  00:12:08,760
Let's check it out.

186

00:12:08,760  -->  00:12:11,050
There we go are three lengths.

187

00:12:11,070  -->  00:12:11,970
One minor thing.

188

00:12:11,970  -->  00:12:16,830
Home is supposed to be active and a bootstrap that's really easy.

189

00:12:16,980  -->  00:12:24,860
All that we have to do is add class equals active to the ally not the anchor tag but the parent ally

190

00:12:26,220  -->  00:12:29,390
and now we end up with home being the active link.

191

00:12:29,400  -->  00:12:29,960
Great.

192

00:12:30,200  -->  00:12:36,900
OK so that's our nav bar and if we resize you'll see that we already have this hamburger working just

193

00:12:36,900  -->  00:12:37,940
fine.

194

00:12:38,520  -->  00:12:42,420
We do have a problem which is that our background image is messed up.

195

00:12:42,420  -->  00:12:45,750
We'll cover that in just a little bit but we have the hamberger working fine.

196

00:12:45,750  -->  00:12:47,400
Everything looks good.

197

00:12:47,430  -->  00:12:53,360
Now let's address the font so the font that I used over here is Ledo L.A..

198

00:12:53,430  -->  00:12:57,900
It's from Google fonts so I'll go to Google fonts and look for Ledo.

199

00:12:58,010  -->  00:13:02,720
LA T-O every go to collection.

200

00:13:03,180  -->  00:13:06,820
Let's use it if it will get normal and bold.

201

00:13:06,840  -->  00:13:10,050
Also we want our H-1 to be bold.

202

00:13:10,590  -->  00:13:11,040
Okay.

203

00:13:11,070  -->  00:13:16,290
And then we'll add this link right into her application.

204

00:13:16,290  -->  00:13:24,090
Up top here save now enter apps The assess we're going to apply that font to everything.

205

00:13:24,270  -->  00:13:33,720
So I'm going to select inside the body font family is Ledo and let's make sure that it's loading correctly

206

00:13:33,720  -->  00:13:33,970
.

207

00:13:34,050  -->  00:13:36,780
See what we have refresh.

208

00:13:37,520  -->  00:13:43,000
And our front changes it's hard to see because the text is dark but changed you can also see it on the

209

00:13:43,000  -->  00:13:43,990
NFR here.

210

00:13:44,160  -->  00:13:44,790
It's changed.

211

00:13:44,790  -->  00:13:47,510
It matches what we have in this solution.
