00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:06.360
Welcome back in this unit I'm going to introduce a new tool called Jay queery And before we get writing

2

00:00:06.360  -->  00:00:12.990
Jay Corey I'm going to take a little bit to talk about conceptually what it is and then talk about why

3

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:17.790
you would use a query and why you might not use it and give you a little bit of my own opinion on that

4

00:00:17.790  -->  00:00:18.710
debate.

5

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:21.050
OK let's get started.

6

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:25.990
So what is Jay query if you've done any research on your own.

7

00:00:26.040  -->  00:00:31.040
If you've been taking any classes online or reading books you've probably encountered the term before

8

00:00:31.350  -->  00:00:36.330
and you may have learned a little bit of it as well and that's because it is the most popular tool out

9

00:00:36.330  -->  00:00:37.600
there for javascript.

10

00:00:37.680  -->  00:00:40.600
It's the most popular javascript library period.

11

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:43.900
And what it does is it helps us manipulate the DOM.

12

00:00:44.190  -->  00:00:48.290
So I have the J query docs open here the official homepage.

13

00:00:48.450  -->  00:00:55.960
J Querrey dot com and I'm just going to read briefly this paragraph right here so it tells us queery

14

00:00:56.040  -->  00:01:02.880
is a fast small and feature rich javascript library and makes things like H.T. mail document traversal

15

00:01:03.120  -->  00:01:07.080
and manipulation event handling animation and Ajax.

16

00:01:07.080  -->  00:01:13.650
Much simpler with an easy use API that works across a multitude of browsers with a combination of versatility

17

00:01:13.920  -->  00:01:15.270
and extensibility.

18

00:01:15.390  -->  00:01:19.140
Jay Querrey has changed the way that millions of people write javascript.

19

00:01:19.230  -->  00:01:24.600
To sum that up Jay query is a javascript library that makes our lives easier.

20

00:01:24.630  -->  00:01:30.030
It helps us do things like selecting elements and manipulating elements changing styles adding event

21

00:01:30.030  -->  00:01:34.840
handlers animating things and Ajax which we'll talk about in another unit.

22

00:01:35.310  -->  00:01:40.290
So the point of J query is that it helps us do things faster and it makes it easier to do those things

23

00:01:40.290  -->  00:01:41.580
.

24

00:01:41.580  -->  00:01:45.030
Now let's talk about the term javascript library.

25

00:01:45.030  -->  00:01:50.130
So this says here that J query is a fast small and feature rich javascript library.

26

00:01:50.310  -->  00:01:52.290
So what is a library.

27

00:01:52.290  -->  00:01:57.450
The concept of a library in javascript is actually one that exists in other programming languages as

28

00:01:57.450  -->  00:01:58.200
well.

29

00:01:58.200  -->  00:02:03.810
The core idea is that we can take code that someone else wrote and we can add it to our own project

30

00:02:03.900  -->  00:02:05.700
and use it instead of her own code.

31

00:02:06.120  -->  00:02:06.870
So that's all that J.

32

00:02:06.870  -->  00:02:07.620
Korea's.

33

00:02:07.770  -->  00:02:13.920
It's a single file that someone else wrote a team wrote now with a bunch of methods and properties inside

34

00:02:13.920  -->  00:02:19.380
of it and then we just add it to our own project so that we can use all of those methods and I'll show

35

00:02:19.380  -->  00:02:21.230
you on the API docs here.

36

00:02:21.450  -->  00:02:24.700
J worry comes with a ton of methods and you can see over here.

37

00:02:24.870  -->  00:02:27.590
Let's click on one of these categories see SS.

38

00:02:27.780  -->  00:02:32.860
And these are all the methods that J Querrey comes with that have to do with C Ss.

39

00:02:33.090  -->  00:02:36.830
We'll talk about how we include J query and just a little bit.

40

00:02:37.830  -->  00:02:42.900
Again it helps us with things like selecting and manipulating elements creating elements adding event

41

00:02:42.900  -->  00:02:48.250
listeners animating adding effects and then this last thing AJAX which we haven't talked about yet.
