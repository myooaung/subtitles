00:00:00.370  -->  00:00:00.800
There.

2

00:00:00.810  -->  00:00:01.970
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01.970  -->  00:00:04.990
So in this section we're going to focus on something brand new.

4

00:00:05.070  -->  00:00:11.850
It's going to be a little bit of a side trip for a moment away from Noad and express and the Yelp camp

5

00:00:11.850  -->  00:00:14.420
and all of the stuff we've been covering.

6

00:00:14.460  -->  00:00:19.870
We're not even we can write javascript h h him out or C Ss for the next few videos.

7

00:00:20.070  -->  00:00:25.530
We're going to focus on something called Get and most of you have probably heard of it or come across

8

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:27.180
it in some way.

9

00:00:27.180  -->  00:00:32.490
It's very popular and important technology but it's it's very different than what we've done so far

10

00:00:32.580  -->  00:00:32.830
.

11

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:34.860
It's not really a full language.

12

00:00:34.860  -->  00:00:37.890
It's not something that is actually that complex.

13

00:00:37.920  -->  00:00:43.200
It is a little tricky to really master and to get going at the beginning so I'm not trying to trivialize

14

00:00:43.200  -->  00:00:48.470
that at all but it is it's not like learning javascript or learning all of CCs.

15

00:00:48.480  -->  00:00:51.200
It's scope is much much smaller.

16

00:00:51.660  -->  00:00:53.460
So as I mentioned it is popular.

17

00:00:53.460  -->  00:00:56.400
I still haven't told you what it is really but it is popular.

18

00:00:56.400  -->  00:01:03.180
I just read today that 42 percent of developers use it and I don't know if that's in the US or across

19

00:01:03.750  -->  00:01:04.660
the entire world.

20

00:01:04.680  -->  00:01:10.980
But 42 percent of some population of developers uses it which is more than we can say about a lot of

21

00:01:10.980  -->  00:01:12.280
technologies.

22

00:01:12.300  -->  00:01:16.230
So what it is is a version control system.

23

00:01:16.290  -->  00:01:24.960
So if I go to the official get home page which is get dash as CMD dot com it's not going to be all that

24

00:01:24.960  -->  00:01:30.300
illuminating up front but what it tells us is that it is a free and open source distributed version

25

00:01:30.300  -->  00:01:36.960
control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with with speed and efficiency

26

00:01:36.960  -->  00:01:38.420
.

27

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:40.800
So what is a version control system.

28

00:01:41.010  -->  00:01:48.240
Basically it's a way for us to work with different versions of our code so that we can save different

29

00:01:48.240  -->  00:01:54.420
features and make notes as we progress and have different versions that we can move forwards and backwards

30

00:01:54.420  -->  00:01:55.650
through time.

31

00:01:55.950  -->  00:02:01.020
And then we can also collaborate with other people and incorporate different versions of some code that

32

00:02:01.020  -->  00:02:04.190
I wrote with code that my coworker wrote.

33

00:02:04.200  -->  00:02:05.880
So it's really powerful.

34

00:02:05.880  -->  00:02:07.400
I said a lot of developers use it.

35

00:02:07.500  -->  00:02:09.160
It's definitely important.

36

00:02:09.240  -->  00:02:15.750
You might be wondering why I waited until this point to teach it and I've been I've seen a lot of questions

37

00:02:15.750  -->  00:02:16.510
about that.

38

00:02:16.590  -->  00:02:22.650
People who are starting the course wondering when when recovery get the reason that I didn't teach it

39

00:02:22.650  -->  00:02:23.680
up front.

40

00:02:23.730  -->  00:02:24.570
BUSH I actually have.

41

00:02:24.570  -->  00:02:29.280
Usually they do historically as I spend time teaching get at the beginning.

42

00:02:29.320  -->  00:02:31.830
And we also start with a command line early on.

43

00:02:31.830  -->  00:02:33.210
There's a few reasons really.

44

00:02:33.210  -->  00:02:36.970
One is that it's not that exciting.

45

00:02:37.080  -->  00:02:42.960
And I didn't want to lose people's interest right at the beginning especially in an online course where

46

00:02:42.990  -->  00:02:49.030
it's so easy to check out to not pay attention versus in an online or in an in-person class.

47

00:02:49.080  -->  00:02:55.140
I have you hostage for at least 45 minutes for a lecture where you have said you know you have to try

48

00:02:55.140  -->  00:02:55.800
it.

49

00:02:55.800  -->  00:02:59.800
So I didn't want to discourage people early on on top of that.

50

00:02:59.880  -->  00:03:02.140
It is something that requires the terminal.

51

00:03:02.280  -->  00:03:04.240
So you need to understand command line.

52

00:03:04.350  -->  00:03:08.850
And I didn't want to move command line to the beginning because then we have to talk about cloud 9 and

53

00:03:08.850  -->  00:03:09.780
installation.

54

00:03:09.780  -->  00:03:12.380
And I wanted just to keep it simple at the beginning.

55

00:03:12.390  -->  00:03:14.280
So that's the two of the reasons.

56

00:03:14.280  -->  00:03:20.130
The third one that's most important is that it's really hard to understand the utility of good to really

57

00:03:20.130  -->  00:03:25.310
see why it makes sense when you're working by yourself and when you're just starting out.

58

00:03:25.320  -->  00:03:30.510
So I mentioned that it helps you save different versions and helps you collaborate with people if you

59

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:33.360
have a huge project it's really beneficial.

60

00:03:33.360  -->  00:03:37.830
But of course the beginning of this class we don't have any huge projects.

61

00:03:38.010  -->  00:03:39.900
We're not collaborating with people.

62

00:03:39.990  -->  00:03:42.610
And even at this point you're not necessarily collaborating.

63

00:03:42.610  -->  00:03:45.170
You're most likely learning on your own.

64

00:03:45.360  -->  00:03:48.000
So it's a little bit hard to really motivate.

65

00:03:48.090  -->  00:03:50.880
Why get is all that useful.

66

00:03:50.910  -->  00:03:57.270
I can I can convince you that it's useful but I don't think I would be able to get you to use it willingly

67

00:03:57.410  -->  00:04:00.760
and get you to want to use it until later in the course.

68

00:04:00.780  -->  00:04:03.350
So we're at that point now we're covering it.

69

00:04:03.420  -->  00:04:08.280
You've also probably heard of get hub if I go back here to our notes these are the big things I want

70

00:04:08.280  -->  00:04:09.080
to talk about.

71

00:04:09.240  -->  00:04:09.960
So what is it.

72

00:04:09.960  -->  00:04:11.050
What is it hub.

73

00:04:11.250  -->  00:04:12.390
They're very different.

74

00:04:12.390  -->  00:04:17.720
They are related maybe very different is too strong of a word but they're not the same thing.

75

00:04:17.790  -->  00:04:22.420
That's a really common misconception with beginners who just kind of lumped them in together.

76

00:04:22.620  -->  00:04:24.550
Get is that technology.

77

00:04:24.640  -->  00:04:28.060
It's totally separate get hub is a Web site.

78

00:04:28.080  -->  00:04:33.970
It's an application that works with get but they're they're not the same thing at all.

79

00:04:34.110  -->  00:04:38.250
So I'm actually going to talk more about what good hub is further down here.

80

00:04:39.000  -->  00:04:44.550
We can work with get and not even know about not care about get hub at all and lots of people do that

81

00:04:44.630  -->  00:04:47.250
though use get but they won't use get hub.

82

00:04:47.340  -->  00:04:49.540
It's not that common but it's possible.

83

00:04:49.560  -->  00:04:55.540
So we're going to focus on just get at the beginning so we talked about these two why you should care

84

00:04:55.540  -->  00:04:57.010
again is that it's really useful.

85

00:04:57.010  -->  00:05:02.440
So that's one thing you will potentially use this a lot especially for it if you end up working with

86

00:05:02.440  -->  00:05:07.150
people whether it's as a contractor or you get a job as a developer.

87

00:05:07.150  -->  00:05:09.760
It's something that lots and lots of teams use.

88

00:05:09.760  -->  00:05:12.210
As I mentioned 42 percent of developers from.

89

00:05:12.250  -->  00:05:14.470
So that's mainly why you should care.

90

00:05:14.470  -->  00:05:17.550
It's also one of those things is just good to have on your resume.

91

00:05:17.890  -->  00:05:22.020
And it's actually not limited only to writing code.

92

00:05:22.330  -->  00:05:24.800
Initially that was what it was kind of created for.

93

00:05:24.940  -->  00:05:27.940
But more recently there's been other applications.

94

00:05:27.940  -->  00:05:34.420
So one of those that I want to talk about is using it to help manage the process of writing a novel

95

00:05:34.450  -->  00:05:36.510
or a play or screenplay.

96

00:05:36.940  -->  00:05:42.850
So imagine that you are a writer and you have some huge story that's in your head that you're going

97

00:05:42.850  -->  00:05:45.960
to sit down and write in and I don't know.

98

00:05:45.970  -->  00:05:51.850
I've tried writing a screenplay before my process was very difficult.

99

00:05:51.880  -->  00:05:58.660
Lots of revisions lots of different drafts that I would save and my process is much the same as my process

100

00:05:58.660  -->  00:06:08.980
for writing essays in college was to write a version and save it as essay V-1 and then if I wanted to

101

00:06:08.980  -->  00:06:14.560
make some other crazy change or I decided I'm going to lead this entire paragraph and try something

102

00:06:14.560  -->  00:06:15.480
totally different.

103

00:06:15.610  -->  00:06:21.730
But I don't want to abandon what I had at the beginning then I would use Save As and make a copy and

104

00:06:21.730  -->  00:06:23.780
have essay V-2.

105

00:06:24.130  -->  00:06:29.530
And every time I wanted to have sort of a checkpoint where I could go back I could revert to my old

106

00:06:29.530  -->  00:06:35.800
draft I could read what I used to have I would create a new document and you as could give it a new

107

00:06:35.800  -->  00:06:41.950
title and usually increment the numbers and eventually I'd get something like this essay like Final

108

00:06:42.070  -->  00:06:44.580
real version.

109

00:06:44.620  -->  00:06:50.380
Pick this on something ridiculous because my name is my naming conventions are wasn't really a convention

110

00:06:50.410  -->  00:06:52.540
but my name and got out of hand.

111

00:06:52.540  -->  00:06:59.470
So that's a problem that get solved or one of the problems is that with get what I can do is have one

112

00:06:59.470  -->  00:07:02.940
essay or one screenplay that I'm working on and use.

113

00:07:02.950  -->  00:07:08.250
Get in and basically tell it to save my files to keep track of them.

114

00:07:08.320  -->  00:07:12.020
I still have to save the files in my text editor.

115

00:07:12.040  -->  00:07:20.050
But what I can do with get is say all right at this point save all these files and I've just added in

116

00:07:20.200  -->  00:07:28.240
the death of the main character and then I could write a little bit more and save again using get and

117

00:07:28.240  -->  00:07:35.890
say that I've now just added in the death of the secondary character and then I could change my mind

118

00:07:35.890  -->  00:07:38.910
and say maybe I should take the story in a different route.

119

00:07:39.280  -->  00:07:42.940
So then I could try something and save another version of it.

120

00:07:42.940  -->  00:07:49.780
Not really a draft but save another version where instead of killing off the two main characters they

121

00:07:49.780  -->  00:07:52.290
both live and they get married and they have kids.

122

00:07:52.360  -->  00:07:57.460
And what I can do later on if you know my editor gets the story and decides you know you really should

123

00:07:57.460  -->  00:07:58.750
of killed them off.

124

00:07:58.810  -->  00:08:01.480
I can easily just using a simple get command.

125

00:08:01.630  -->  00:08:08.140
It's a go back to the point where I saved it where I said that I killed off the main character or where

126

00:08:08.140  -->  00:08:09.930
I said you know X or Y.

127

00:08:10.150  -->  00:08:16.570
Basically you can leave little messages for yourself and it's not only that it's not limited to one

128

00:08:16.570  -->  00:08:23.650
file which is something that's very different from traditional systems of managing your version so on

129

00:08:23.650  -->  00:08:25.540
an essay it's one file that I'm working on.

130

00:08:25.540  -->  00:08:28.900
I save it and then I might save as.

131

00:08:28.900  -->  00:08:30.700
But it's always one file.

132

00:08:30.700  -->  00:08:35.410
What you can do with it get is if you have a huge project so going going to code.

133

00:08:35.410  -->  00:08:42.460
Now if we have a project with 10 javascript files a bunch of CSSA some images HCM lots of different

134

00:08:42.460  -->  00:08:43.520
technologies.

135

00:08:43.540  -->  00:08:46.950
Let's say it's an express app that's lots of folders.

136

00:08:47.050  -->  00:08:51.820
What I can do is target individual pieces and save them using get.

137

00:08:52.000  -->  00:08:57.850
So I can say OK I just created the directory and added in the views for dogs.

138

00:08:58.090  -->  00:09:01.400
And I can save that as a checkpoint that I can come back to later.

139

00:09:01.810  -->  00:09:08.470
And then I could do something later on raid and decide OK just remove the dogs from the views directory

140

00:09:08.500  -->  00:09:12.800
and instead move them into their own dog's directory inside with a view directory.

141

00:09:12.820  -->  00:09:18.460
And I can say that is a checkpoint and then I could do that for all different pieces so usually what

142

00:09:18.460  -->  00:09:24.800
you end up with is at the end of a project you'll have lots and lots of different little commits is

143

00:09:24.820  -->  00:09:26.080
what they're called.

144

00:09:26.110  -->  00:09:31.980
So I'm going to show you a quick example of that and I am going to get hub which again is not the same

145

00:09:31.980  -->  00:09:32.630
as get.

146

00:09:32.650  -->  00:09:39.250
Think of it as a viewer forget a way to share different versions of things to share code with people

147

00:09:39.250  -->  00:09:39.880
.

148

00:09:39.880  -->  00:09:42.070
It's not get itself though.

149

00:09:42.250  -->  00:09:45.650
So this is the express repository on get hub.

150

00:09:45.820  -->  00:09:47.210
And what I want to point out.

151

00:09:47.320  -->  00:09:53.140
So this is the code for express that we've been using when we run NPM install Express.

152

00:09:53.140  -->  00:10:00.210
This code is run well not necessarily run when we install but when we include Express and we execute

153

00:10:00.210  -->  00:10:02.650
it then a lot of this code is run.

154

00:10:02.770  -->  00:10:05.420
What I want to show though is right here.

155

00:10:05.680  -->  00:10:08.070
Five thousand one hundred ninety four commits.

156

00:10:08.260  -->  00:10:13.030
So in the next video we actually write our own commits and I'll show you with that what that looks like

157

00:10:13.030  -->  00:10:14.180
and really what it means.

158

00:10:14.410  -->  00:10:19.660
But take a look at all these messages and there's thousands of them.

159

00:10:20.080  -->  00:10:23.130
So let me just pick an arbitrary one here.

160

00:10:24.000  -->  00:10:28.200
Let's let's look at let's find Harry.

161

00:10:28.220  -->  00:10:28.920
This is fine.

162

00:10:28.960  -->  00:10:31.280
Update exampled dependencies.

163

00:10:31.750  -->  00:10:37.740
If I click on that what I see here are the files that were included in this commit.

164

00:10:37.750  -->  00:10:43.930
So the files that were basically targeted to be saved to make a version of a message that says update

165

00:10:43.930  -->  00:10:45.490
example dependencies.

166

00:10:45.520  -->  00:10:48.090
And I see what was changed.

167

00:10:48.100  -->  00:10:49.710
So we changed the versions.

168

00:10:49.710  -->  00:10:54.530
It looks like Harry whoever wrote this Doug Wilson changed the versions.

169

00:10:55.120  -->  00:10:57.550
So that's a simple example of a commit.

170

00:10:57.550  -->  00:11:01.930
Let's see if we can try to find something a little bit more complex.

171

00:11:01.930  -->  00:11:02.190
All right.

172

00:11:02.200  -->  00:11:09.310
Well here's one or two files so Express is probably 100 plus files across this entire repository.

173

00:11:09.580  -->  00:11:14.760
But in this case someone made a small commit with two changes across two files.

174

00:11:15.100  -->  00:11:17.110
So that's just a few examples.

175

00:11:17.140  -->  00:11:18.710
Feel free to take a look.

176

00:11:19.000  -->  00:11:24.430
Obviously you're not expected to understand the code or all the terminology but take a look and it's

177

00:11:24.430  -->  00:11:26.860
fun to go back to the very beginning.

178

00:11:26.910  -->  00:11:31.570
I actually don't know if there's a really easy way to get to do that just to hop back to the very beginning

179

00:11:32.050  -->  00:11:38.440
but you could try changing this to be page 50 and that takes you back to 2012.

180

00:11:38.440  -->  00:11:40.570
So that's a lot of show of express.

181

00:11:40.660  -->  00:11:45.940
Again we'll return to get her up shortly but we're going to start by talking about get in our terminal

182

00:11:46.030  -->  00:11:51.830
where we're just writing our own code and saving it at different places using get to make our own commits

183

00:11:52.030  -->  00:11:56.220
but we're not going to be sharing those with anyone until we talk about get up.

184

00:11:56.230  -->  00:12:01.010
So the last thing I want to mention is installing get and I have in parentheses.

185

00:12:01.030  -->  00:12:02.010
Not really.

186

00:12:02.140  -->  00:12:07.270
And that's because using Cloud 9 we don't have to install kid ourselves.

187

00:12:07.270  -->  00:12:10.730
It comes installed already when you make a new cloud nine instance.

188

00:12:11.050  -->  00:12:15.730
But if you're not using Cloud 9 if you're using a terminal your own terminal your own shell that you

189

00:12:15.730  -->  00:12:22.200
installed you will have to install it so you can find plenty of instructions online.

190

00:12:22.210  -->  00:12:28.560
Occasionally things go wrong you need some dependencies but it's one of the most installed tools on

191

00:12:28.710  -->  00:12:33.440
in all of web development so there's lots of tutorials resources stack overflow posts everywhere.

192

00:12:33.640  -->  00:12:36.780
But using cloud 9 we don't have to worry about that.

193

00:12:36.790  -->  00:12:40.250
So just to make sure that it works here's the test you can do.

194

00:12:40.450  -->  00:12:44.930
Get dash dash version.

195

00:12:45.970  -->  00:12:50.300
And as long as you see something here it doesn't have to be one point nine point one.

196

00:12:50.320  -->  00:12:54.610
If you're seeing this in the future and you have a different version there that's fine.

197

00:12:54.700  -->  00:12:58.080
All that matters is that you don't see commed not found.

198

00:12:58.360  -->  00:13:03.160
You don't see an error message and that's all we're going to do with get for now in the next lesson

199

00:13:03.160  -->  00:13:03.360
.

200

00:13:03.430  -->  00:13:05.740
We're going to talk about three new commands.

201

00:13:05.740  -->  00:13:08.920
Get a net get ADD and get commit.

202

00:13:09.010  -->  00:13:10.240
All right I'll see if Nelson
