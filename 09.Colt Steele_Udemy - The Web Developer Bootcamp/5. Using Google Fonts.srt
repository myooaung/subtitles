00:00:00,350  -->  00:00:05,460
In this video we're going to talk about ways of including custom fonts and using them in our success

2

00:00:05,940  -->  00:00:11,550
so that we don't have to rely on these built in fonts the system fonts like Arial and Georgia that are

3

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:13,340
not very reliable in the first place.

4

00:00:13,350  -->  00:00:18,150
Some people's machines won't have them and they're pretty limited even if all of them are available

5

00:00:18,150  -->  00:00:18,440
.

6

00:00:18,450  -->  00:00:21,700
It's not many fonts and it's not many good fonts.

7

00:00:21,930  -->  00:00:27,660
So luckily it's pretty easy to include her own fonts and that can be a font that we own that we've purchased

8

00:00:27,660  -->  00:00:32,550
that our company owns although they can get very very expensive if you've never looked into font pricing

9

00:00:32,550  -->  00:00:32,850
.

10

00:00:32,850  -->  00:00:36,120
Some of the better ones can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

11

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:40,820
So Google has an option out there it's called Google fonts and it's a really great resource.

12

00:00:40,980  -->  00:00:48,420
Basically Google has a bunch of I think it's about 100 fonts online for free that are very easy to include

13

00:00:48,450  -->  00:00:49,540
in our own application.

14

00:00:49,620  -->  00:00:50,710
Just a few clicks.

15

00:00:50,790  -->  00:00:52,940
So I'm going to show you how to do that now.

16

00:00:53,910  -->  00:01:01,140
So if we go to Google fonts and just Google dot com slash fonts you'll see we're immediately presented

17

00:01:01,140  -->  00:01:04,760
with a list of fonts here we can scroll through them.

18

00:01:05,040  -->  00:01:09,520
We can sort them by popularity alphabetical most recent.

19

00:01:09,660  -->  00:01:12,220
We can change the preview text that we're looking at.

20

00:01:12,780  -->  00:01:14,440
Usually it just keep it how it is.

21

00:01:14,850  -->  00:01:20,490
And I'm actually going to just pick two fonts here that are very distinct so don't judge me based off

22

00:01:20,490  -->  00:01:21,550
of which ones they pick.

23

00:01:21,600  -->  00:01:26,310
They may not be my favorite but they're just going to be obvious so that you can see that they're different

24

00:01:26,320  -->  00:01:26,940
.

25

00:01:27,600  -->  00:01:35,190
So I'm going to go let's do popularity and let's pick a railway here and I'm going to click this button

26

00:01:35,250  -->  00:01:39,890
add to collection and what that does it sort of adds it to my shopping cart.

27

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:41,770
And then the next one I'm going to pick.

28

00:01:41,910  -->  00:01:45,390
Let's go for another very different one.

29

00:01:46,230  -->  00:01:49,800
Let's try this Andy Flower ad to collection.

30

00:01:50,220  -->  00:01:53,120
So the next thing I want to do is click on this use tab.

31

00:01:53,280  -->  00:01:55,640
So what I've said is I want both of these fonts.

32

00:01:55,710  -->  00:02:01,430
Now click on use and now I need to decide which font weights I want available.

33

00:02:01,800  -->  00:02:06,390
So different fonts have different weights that are available on Google fonts so you can see railway

34

00:02:06,390  -->  00:02:11,740
has every single possible option between 100 and ultra bold at 900.

35

00:02:11,760  -->  00:02:16,790
One thing to pay attention to is you don't want to include more than you're going to use and this little

36

00:02:16,800  -->  00:02:22,230
meter over here reminds you of the page load the effect on page of that including multiple weight will

37

00:02:22,230  -->  00:02:27,270
have and that's because every single font and weight that you include is another request that needs

38

00:02:27,270  -->  00:02:29,930
to be made its more data that needs to be loaded.

39

00:02:30,360  -->  00:02:36,000
So what we want to do here is just minimize the number that we need to understand to use normal and

40

00:02:36,000  -->  00:02:37,400
bold for a railway.

41

00:02:37,450  -->  00:02:39,520
And then I don't have an option for Andy Flower.

42

00:02:39,540  -->  00:02:42,150
There's only one weight which is normal.

43

00:02:43,260  -->  00:02:49,360
So now that I've selected those I scroll down and all I have to do is copy this link right here.

44

00:02:49,740  -->  00:02:53,130
So this is a link they put in my HMO.

45

00:02:53,970  -->  00:03:01,380
When I go to my HQ here and just paste it in and safe and you can look at the you are well here and

46

00:03:01,380  -->  00:03:06,700
you'll notice it's almost the same words exactly the same type of tag it's a link tag.

47

00:03:07,020  -->  00:03:12,340
The only difference between my style sheet and this style sheet is the ref.

48

00:03:12,390  -->  00:03:19,230
So rather than styles that CSSA my custom local style sheet it's on Google dot com or Fahnestock Google

49

00:03:19,230  -->  00:03:20,560
API celcom.

50

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:25,210
And we have family equals railway wait for 107 100.

51

00:03:25,460  -->  00:03:26,650
Andy Flower.

52

00:03:27,150  -->  00:03:32,950
So suppose I did want a bold I could just easily go here net eight hundred.

53

00:03:33,880  -->  00:03:34,130
OK.

54

00:03:34,140  -->  00:03:36,260
So that is all we have to do to get the font.

55

00:03:36,270  -->  00:03:38,430
It's so so easy to do.

56

00:03:38,550  -->  00:03:40,170
The next step is to use it.

57

00:03:40,500  -->  00:03:45,170
So I'm going to go ahead and just show you what it looks like right now in case you forgot.

58

00:03:45,180  -->  00:03:46,360
Wonderful site.

59

00:03:46,650  -->  00:03:49,490
Let's start by changing this H-1.

60

00:03:50,310  -->  00:03:53,370
Let's make the H-1 use the indie flower font.

61

00:03:53,760  -->  00:03:55,370
So I'm just going to change it here.

62

00:03:55,390  -->  00:03:58,200
H-1 and have fun family as Georgia.

63

00:03:58,240  -->  00:04:02,690
I just change it to Andy Flower and that's it.

64

00:04:02,790  -->  00:04:06,110
Very very easy refresh and you can see it's now.

65

00:04:06,120  -->  00:04:11,260
And if I were same thing to use railway on paragraphs.

66

00:04:11,610  -->  00:04:20,670
I just changed the font family to railway save and refresh and I now have this new fun here.

67

00:04:20,670  -->  00:04:25,960
The other thing we can do is change our paragraph to use the other font weight.

68

00:04:26,040  -->  00:04:30,670
So we got to remember let's just go with normal.

69

00:04:30,840  -->  00:04:35,970
It looks a lot better doesn't look very good either way but I prefer the lighter weight rather than

70

00:04:35,970  -->  00:04:37,530
the Bold.

71

00:04:37,530  -->  00:04:40,650
So again Google fonts is a great great resource.

72

00:04:40,650  -->  00:04:45,990
One thing though I'll mention is if you do have fonts that you own all you have to do to link to them

73

00:04:46,320  -->  00:04:47,490
is use it like tag.

74

00:04:47,880  -->  00:04:53,520
So rather than linking to one of Google's fonts you just link to your own font file so you can read

75

00:04:53,520  -->  00:04:57,890
more NTN about this specific font file types that are supported.

76

00:04:58,110  -->  00:05:02,840
But basically it works the same way except rather than including a Google fund.

77

00:05:02,940  -->  00:05:04,630
You can include your own custom font.

78

00:05:04,980  -->  00:05:08,260
Luckily though Google fonts has all sorts of great fonts.

79

00:05:08,430  -->  00:05:14,100
You can make awesome websites and plenty of people use Google fonts exclusively even for professional

80

00:05:14,100  -->  00:05:15,000
web sites.
