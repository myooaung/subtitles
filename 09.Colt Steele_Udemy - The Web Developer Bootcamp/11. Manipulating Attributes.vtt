00:00:00.640  -->  00:00:05.130
This video we're going to continue learning about different ways of manipulating elements.

2

00:00:05.160  -->  00:00:06.360
Once we select them.

3

00:00:06.690  -->  00:00:11.040
So we've talked about manipulating style changing classes removing classes.

4

00:00:11.040  -->  00:00:15.290
We've talked about altering the text content and enraged him.

5

00:00:15.600  -->  00:00:18.600
Now we're going to talk about manipulating attributes.

6

00:00:18.810  -->  00:00:25.820
So remember attributes are things like H.F. equals Google like com or source on an image.

7

00:00:26.550  -->  00:00:32.460
So they always follow this some property name equals something inside of quotes and attributes are really

8

00:00:32.460  -->  00:00:33.330
important.

9

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:36.410
And sometimes we want to manipulate them we want to change things.

10

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:40.890
So we're going to do some simple things early on like changing every link on Google.

11

00:00:40.900  -->  00:00:45.950
Dotcom's homepage to be a link to.

12

00:00:46.200  -->  00:00:51.040
So we're going to do some simple things to start like changing every link on Google dot com homepage

13

00:00:51.060  -->  00:00:52.460
to be Bing dotcom.

14

00:00:52.490  -->  00:00:58.280
But changing attributes is something that is really important and useful in real projects.

15

00:00:58.320  -->  00:01:05.610
So if we made an image slider for instance a lot of times image galleries image sliders are made by

16

00:01:05.610  -->  00:01:11.440
changing the source of an image and it's just one image and the source is being changed.

17

00:01:11.730  -->  00:01:16.800
So that's just one quick example there but we're going to talk about how we can retrieve the value of

18

00:01:16.890  -->  00:01:21.460
specific attributes and how we can also alter or manipulate the value.

19

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:28.050
In this example we have an anchor tag with a draft to be google.com and an image tag with source is

20

00:01:28.050  -->  00:01:30.110
logo dot DNG.

21

00:01:30.360  -->  00:01:36.300
So we select the anchor tag to start query selector a save that to link and there's a method we can

22

00:01:36.300  -->  00:01:41.880
use called Get attribute and get attribute does what it sounds like it retrieves or it gets the value

23

00:01:42.150  -->  00:01:44.360
of the specific attribute that we ask for.

24

00:01:44.490  -->  00:01:51.810
So if we ask for a breath on this link it's going to give us www.youtube.com and then I can also change

25

00:01:51.810  -->  00:01:56.580
that attribute using Set attribute and set attribute takes two arguments.

26

00:01:56.640  -->  00:02:01.890
The first one is the name of the attribute and the second one is what I want to change it to.

27

00:02:01.890  -->  00:02:08.820
So in this case I'm changing the Tref on this link to be WDW that dogs dot com.

28

00:02:09.540  -->  00:02:13.200
Let's go ahead and demonstrate this in the browser.

29

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:17.940
So I'm going to use get attribute to retrieve the source of this first image here.

30

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:19.430
So I need to select it.

31

00:02:19.680  -->  00:02:26.970
Let's just call it image one equals document and let's do get elements by tag name

32

00:02:29.610  -->  00:02:33.810
image and we want the first one.

33

00:02:33.810  -->  00:02:43.330
And if we look at it image 1 if we asked for the source we just do get attribute as sarcy.

34

00:02:44.280  -->  00:02:45.840
And this is our source.

35

00:02:46.170  -->  00:02:52.620
If I wanted to change that image I actually have an image prepared here of another adorable corgi mix

36

00:02:52.770  -->  00:02:54.290
a husky corgi.

37

00:02:54.780  -->  00:03:03.180
I'm going to go ahead and just copy this you r l and change it using image one dot set attribute like

38

00:03:03.180  -->  00:03:07.700
this and then passing it in as the second argument.

39

00:03:07.700  -->  00:03:12.500
And we hit enter and I now get my image updated there.

40

00:03:13.020  -->  00:03:15.700
And I could do the same thing of course to the second image.

41

00:03:15.750  -->  00:03:22.290
I just need to select it so we can do something like this for image to document to get elements by tag

42

00:03:22.290  -->  00:03:35.970
name image 1 and then image to set attribute source to be the same thing.

43

00:03:35.970  -->  00:03:41.520
Now we have two of those adorable mis proportioned Husky's.

44

00:03:41.670  -->  00:03:45.220
So just for variety sake I'll add an anchor tag as well.

45

00:03:45.360  -->  00:03:53.220
So just up top will have an anchor tag with Tref BW dot Google dot com and then we'll go in here.

46

00:03:53.370  -->  00:04:01.380
Link to Google and what we can do to start is change that links a ref.

47

00:04:01.390  -->  00:04:07.950
So if we are fresh the page we have that link we selected so far a equals document that query selector

48

00:04:08.510  -->  00:04:09.480
A.

49

00:04:09.930  -->  00:04:17.880
And then we'll do a dot set attribute a Tref are not doing source anymore we're changing the nature

50

00:04:17.880  -->  00:04:27.600
of attribute and we'll do it to Corgies dot com and if we look first of all if we look at the a tag

51

00:04:27.910  -->  00:04:32.940
you can see the way that it's represented to us and the cons. It's changed to Corgies dot com.

52

00:04:33.090  -->  00:04:35.080
If I inspect it.

53

00:04:35.690  -->  00:04:38.200
HCF has changed the Corgies start com.

54

00:04:38.370  -->  00:04:46.680
And lastly if I click on it in a new tab takes us to Corgies dot com and you'll notice it didn't actually

55

00:04:46.680  -->  00:04:51.620
take us to the Web site Corgies star com tried to do it on a relative path.

56

00:04:51.660  -->  00:04:57.390
So to fix that if we wanted it to actually go to the website Corgies start com which I'm not sure is

57

00:04:57.390  -->  00:04:58.750
a real web site.

58

00:04:59.160  -->  00:05:06.750
We need to do HTP colon slash slash and that tells the browser that this link is not relative to where

59

00:05:06.750  -->  00:05:07.280
we are.

60

00:05:07.410  -->  00:05:12.210
It's an absolute path which means just go to this URL don't try and add it onto the end of where we

61

00:05:12.210  -->  00:05:12.600
are.

62

00:05:12.780  -->  00:05:18.260
So we're using the HTP protocol and I do that now if we inspect.

63

00:05:18.810  -->  00:05:21.400
You can see it's changed HGP.

64

00:05:21.660  -->  00:05:29.070
And if we click on a new tab Corgies dotcom nobody owns that really or somebody owns it but they don't

65

00:05:29.070  -->  00:05:30.000
use it.

66

00:05:30.000  -->  00:05:32.690
It's a shame and shame.

67

00:05:32.700  -->  00:05:37.350
So the last thing just to update this link that doesn't say link to Google.

68

00:05:37.350  -->  00:05:38.850
All we need to do is a.

69

00:05:39.000  -->  00:05:45.240
And we have two choices but text content is usually the better option for just changing the text edit

70

00:05:45.270  -->  00:05:54.940
text content equals link to corgi dot com and now our tag has changed.

71

00:05:54.960  -->  00:05:59.260
It's Atra attribute and the inner content has changed as well.

72

00:06:00.030  -->  00:06:05.350
So to wrap up we have get attribute and set attribute and those work on any attributes.

73

00:06:05.550  -->  00:06:11.400
So I showed it for a Tref and for source but you could use it if you wanted to change an ID to change

74

00:06:11.430  -->  00:06:13.970
a class or any other attribute that's out there.

75

00:06:13.980  -->  00:06:18.120
There are quite a few more but these are the more common ones that will work with
