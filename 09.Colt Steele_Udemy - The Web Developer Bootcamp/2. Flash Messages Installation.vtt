00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:00.500
Either.

2

00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:01.450
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01.770  -->  00:00:06.290
So in this lesson we're focusing on improving the usability of our camp.

4

00:00:06.510  -->  00:00:12.990
Right now it's kind of a disaster as far as giving feedback or error messages or success messages to

5

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:13.710
our users.

6

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:17.090
And by disaster I just mean that it doesn't exist at all.

7

00:00:17.100  -->  00:00:21.400
We have a council log which obviously our users can't see.

8

00:00:21.480  -->  00:00:27.000
We see it as developers in our consul here where the servers are running but no one else sees that.

9

00:00:27.360  -->  00:00:31.770
So we're going to focus on adding some messages in and I'll show you what that looks like in just a

10

00:00:31.770  -->  00:00:32.370
moment.

11

00:00:32.460  -->  00:00:36.790
Before I do that we have three main objectives I'll just talk about them now.

12

00:00:36.990  -->  00:00:37.980
So I do want to demo it.

13

00:00:37.980  -->  00:00:44.490
First show you what to expect how it will look how it behaves then we'll actually install and configure

14

00:00:44.580  -->  00:00:46.630
a package called connect flash.

15

00:00:46.830  -->  00:00:53.580
So what we're doing is adding in Flash or the flasher a flash of her different pronouns and people call

16

00:00:53.580  -->  00:00:53.940
it.

17

00:00:54.000  -->  00:00:56.070
In other frameworks the flash hash.

18

00:00:56.070  -->  00:01:02.010
People call it flash messages but basically the idea is we're going to show a message to a user like

19

00:01:02.250  -->  00:01:05.520
successfully logged in or successfully logged out.

20

00:01:05.700  -->  00:01:08.310
Or maybe something like you don't have permission to do that.

21

00:01:08.320  -->  00:01:12.270
Or Please log in before you add a campground something like that.

22

00:01:12.390  -->  00:01:17.640
We want to show it to a user just once and we don't want it to be a permanent fixture on the page.

23

00:01:17.700  -->  00:01:22.680
We want to just flash it to them one time and then it goes away on the next page or if the user refreshes

24

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:30.780
and then the last thing is to add in our flash messages to the header and add in some bootstrap classes

25

00:01:30.780  -->  00:01:31.470
that will style.

26

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:34.230
So there's some built in ways of doing things with bootstrap.

27

00:01:34.350  -->  00:01:40.650
This is such a common feature to have messages that are flashed to your user on all sorts of sites that

28

00:01:40.650  -->  00:01:44.100
bootstrap has some built in styling for that that will take advantage of.

29

00:01:44.250  -->  00:01:47.850
So I'll start by showing you what it will look like.

30

00:01:47.940  -->  00:01:49.530
So I have up camp running.

31

00:01:49.610  -->  00:01:56.190
Let me well I'll show you if I just log out right now so I'm signed in as freezer if I log out I get

32

00:01:56.190  -->  00:01:59.970
a message that says loungy up we can change that message text.

33

00:01:59.970  -->  00:02:06.840
Obviously if I try and add a new campground right now when I'm not logged in I now should get a message

34

00:02:06.840  -->  00:02:09.340
that says you must be signed in to do that.

35

00:02:09.420  -->  00:02:11.070
And notice that it's read here.

36

00:02:11.520  -->  00:02:13.420
So that's a bootstrap class.

37

00:02:13.440  -->  00:02:18.610
This alert that we get if I were fresh the page goes away.

38

00:02:18.690  -->  00:02:25.690
So now if I try and sign up I must say that I sign up as resti which already exists.

39

00:02:25.950  -->  00:02:28.500
So I shouldn't be able to do that in the past.

40

00:02:28.500  -->  00:02:30.070
The page would just refresh.

41

00:02:30.330  -->  00:02:36.060
But what we'll end up with is a message that says a user with a given user name is already registered

42

00:02:36.070  -->  00:02:36.470
.

43

00:02:36.870  -->  00:02:37.370
OK.

44

00:02:37.470  -->  00:02:39.490
So let me sign up as someone new.

45

00:02:39.690  -->  00:02:42.620
Let's try doing blunder.

46

00:02:42.630  -->  00:02:50.330
I've now moved apparently from vegetables to household appliances and I get a message success successfully

47

00:02:50.350  -->  00:02:50.890
signed up.

48

00:02:50.910  -->  00:02:52.330
Nice to meet you Bunder.

49

00:02:52.380  -->  00:02:55.130
And if I refresh the page it goes away.

50

00:02:55.710  -->  00:03:00.560
So there are other places that we have those messages but I'll show you.

51

00:03:00.690  -->  00:03:04.050
For instance if I try and edit this campground that I don't own.

52

00:03:04.050  -->  00:03:05.580
Tater tots owns it.

53

00:03:05.580  -->  00:03:07.260
I'm logged in this blender.

54

00:03:07.770  -->  00:03:10.950
I don't have a link to go to Edit here because that's hidden.

55

00:03:11.280  -->  00:03:17.220
But technically I still could go to slash at it where I now get a message that says you don't have permission

56

00:03:17.220  -->  00:03:17.950
to do that.

57

00:03:18.030  -->  00:03:19.710
It redirects me back here.

58

00:03:20.070  -->  00:03:26.950
So same thing with comments if I if there was a comment here and it was created by someone else.

59

00:03:27.150  -->  00:03:32.310
If I manually went to that link and added slash at it then I would also see a message but that's a lot

60

00:03:32.310  -->  00:03:34.720
of work because we have to find the ID.

61

00:03:34.900  -->  00:03:40.080
And anyway I don't want to go into it now but it will be the same bit of code that we add that will

62

00:03:40.080  -->  00:03:42.030
say you don't have permission to do that.

63

00:03:42.060  -->  00:03:50.400
And then lastly if I do log out and I go back and I try and add new comments I get the same message

64

00:03:50.400  -->  00:03:50.420
.

65

00:03:50.430  -->  00:03:52.030
You must be signed in to do that.

66

00:03:52.050  -->  00:03:55.010
Just like if I tried to create a campground when I wasn't signed it.

67

00:03:55.260  -->  00:03:55.530
OK.

68

00:03:55.530  -->  00:04:00.340
So that's the end goal and it's actually pretty easy for us to make this work.

69

00:04:00.360  -->  00:04:05.580
Using this package we could do this without a package of course what we could do something like.

70

00:04:05.700  -->  00:04:07.520
When we open up the correct version.

71

00:04:07.740  -->  00:04:12.960
So I made a new version for this v 11 that I'll be working inside of.

72

00:04:13.440  -->  00:04:23.470
So let's see into v. 11 and let me clear everything and open up yes.

73

00:04:24.610  -->  00:04:25.040
OK.

74

00:04:25.110  -->  00:04:26.210
So we'll be working here.

75

00:04:26.280  -->  00:04:30.390
Again this is V 11 just in case you're following along.

76

00:04:30.390  -->  00:04:33.790
The first thing that I'll do is show you the package we're going to use.

77

00:04:33.820  -->  00:04:35.400
So it's called Kinect flash.

78

00:04:35.400  -->  00:04:38.080
There were other packages out there that do this.

79

00:04:38.280  -->  00:04:45.090
If you take a look at the get home repo the documentation is actually a little bit out of date.

80

00:04:45.510  -->  00:04:51.410
We're using Express for which came out earlier in 2015.

81

00:04:51.930  -->  00:05:00.090
The docs talk about Express to point X and three point X we're on for next though.

82

00:05:00.180  -->  00:05:08.670
So these instructions aren't exactly the same although if you go back to Connect flash you'll see some

83

00:05:08.670  -->  00:05:15.000
of the first external links are expressed 4.00 set up with K'NEX flash which I already took a look at

84

00:05:15.360  -->  00:05:23.000
or you could always use something like this had expressed for afterwards and you can see we get that

85

00:05:23.000  -->  00:05:29.060
same link and there are tutorials down here there's a stack overflow post about it if you want to take

86

00:05:29.060  -->  00:05:29.710
a look.

87

00:05:29.990  -->  00:05:32.910
So I did this earlier.

88

00:05:33.080  -->  00:05:37.450
Something you have to do a lot when you know code is being updated when new things are coming out.

89

00:05:37.550  -->  00:05:42.620
Especially with something like Express 4.0 where things change pretty significantly.

90

00:05:42.680  -->  00:05:48.110
Lots of things that used to be part of Express were moved out of express as separate packages.

91

00:05:48.110  -->  00:05:50.280
Some of the naming and syntax changed.

92

00:05:50.430  -->  00:05:55.640
So I always say it's something you just do a lot when you're trying to do something you haven't done

93

00:05:55.640  -->  00:06:03.380
yet in Express add in Express for to your searches because oftentimes you'll find great tutorials for

94

00:06:03.680  -->  00:06:03.850
it.

95

00:06:03.880  -->  00:06:10.220
Two years ago that still are 90 percent the same but that 10 percent is really important that you understand

96

00:06:10.220  -->  00:06:14.900
how it's different from you know two years ago versus current Express.

97

00:06:14.900  -->  00:06:15.950
All right.

98

00:06:15.950  -->  00:06:19.110
So first thing we want to do is install this package.

99

00:06:19.400  -->  00:06:21.070
So it's called connect flash.

100

00:06:21.110  -->  00:06:29.260
So we want NPM install dash dash save connect dash flash.

101

00:06:31.050  -->  00:06:31.700
OK.

102

00:06:31.910  -->  00:06:37.530
Now that that's done up here we'll just add in Flash.

103

00:06:38.030  -->  00:06:45.030
We'll just call it flash rather than connect flash equals require connect dash flash.

104

00:06:45.080  -->  00:06:52.730
Make sure we have a comma in there then what we need to do is tell express tell the app to use Flash

105

00:06:52.730  -->  00:06:53.320
.

106

00:06:53.360  -->  00:07:00.470
So we took the contents of K'NEX flash that the package and saved into the flash variable and we'll

107

00:07:00.470  -->  00:07:09.700
need to execute that variable app use flash just like that.

108

00:07:09.710  -->  00:07:11.500
So technically that's all we need to do.

109

00:07:11.510  -->  00:07:18.350
We now have Connect Flash installed and if we do go back and take a look at the docs there is some other

110

00:07:18.350  -->  00:07:24.920
configuration that they do here with cookie parser in session but we actually already have that set

111

00:07:24.920  -->  00:07:27.700
up where we're already doing our.

112

00:07:27.730  -->  00:07:31.210
Where are you require express session and we're setting up a secret.

113

00:07:31.220  -->  00:07:36.620
And so we don't actually have to worry about that because we already have set up our app to use Express

114

00:07:36.620  -->  00:07:37.580
session.

115

00:07:38.070  -->  00:07:44.710
OK so what we'll do is on every single page we're going to show the contents of the flash.

116

00:07:44.810  -->  00:07:46.940
We're going to take the message that's in there.

117

00:07:46.940  -->  00:07:51.360
It might be good or might be bad it might be empty and we're going to show it at the top of the page

118

00:07:52.280  -->  00:07:54.290
and that will happen in our header file.

119

00:07:54.330  -->  00:07:54.710
E.J..

120

00:07:54.740  -->  00:08:01.460
Yes we'll have some code that just displays the error or the success message and then all that we'll

121

00:08:01.460  -->  00:08:08.570
do is when we encounter an error or a place we want a message so an instance of that might be instead

122

00:08:08.570  -->  00:08:15.650
of let's do campgrounds and instead of our campgrounds for we have this is logged in Middleware where

123

00:08:15.740  -->  00:08:18.430
you can't add a new campground unless you're logged in.

124

00:08:18.440  -->  00:08:26.120
If we if we go to that middleware and we'll look at is logged in we might want to have a message that

125

00:08:26.120  -->  00:08:30.500
says you need to be logged in to do that or Please log in.

126

00:08:30.500  -->  00:08:32.800
So that code would go right here.

127

00:08:32.900  -->  00:08:38.440
So right before we redirect to slash log in we're going to add something to the flash.

128

00:08:38.840  -->  00:08:44.860
So that looks just like this actually request dot flash.

129

00:08:45.260  -->  00:08:47.370
And then we can give it a key.

130

00:08:47.720  -->  00:08:50.000
So in a moment I'll show you.

131

00:08:50.000  -->  00:08:57.140
We'll be using success and error and we'll just use that to determine if the message the alert should

132

00:08:57.140  -->  00:08:59.300
be green or red.

133

00:08:59.300  -->  00:09:04.200
So that part doesn't matter for now but this part does matter where we're going to pass in a message

134

00:09:04.210  -->  00:09:04.550
.

135

00:09:04.760  -->  00:09:09.560
So we could do something like Please log in first.

136

00:09:09.590  -->  00:09:12.470
Again this is inside the is logged in Middleware.

137

00:09:12.740  -->  00:09:16.740
So it's checking if the request is authenticated if the users logged in.

138

00:09:16.800  -->  00:09:19.430
Then keep going to whatever you were doing before.

139

00:09:20.180  -->  00:09:24.030
But if that's not the case before you redirect to slash log in.

140

00:09:24.090  -->  00:09:26.390
Yes remember if we redirect to slash log in.

141

00:09:26.390  -->  00:09:29.320
Without this line it just goes on too.

142

00:09:29.320  -->  00:09:35.360
I'll have to open up the route but it will go right to the code and slash logon which is right here

143

00:09:35.360  -->  00:09:36.740
.

144

00:09:36.740  -->  00:09:43.960
So it renders the log in for before we do that though we're going to run this code flash.

145

00:09:44.120  -->  00:09:50.000
And what this will do is basically take Please log in first and it will add it to the flash and it won't

146

00:09:50.000  -->  00:09:53.060
be displayed until the next thing that we see.

147

00:09:53.180  -->  00:09:59.210
So in this case this doesn't actually render anything it just redirects us to slash log in and the way

148

00:09:59.210  -->  00:10:06.290
that the Flash works is really nice in that it isn't just going to flash itself right away immediately

149

00:10:06.290  -->  00:10:06.540
.

150

00:10:06.550  -->  00:10:09.650
It it only works or it shows up on the next page.

151

00:10:09.650  -->  00:10:13.130
So you actually do it before you redirect.

152

00:10:13.130  -->  00:10:18.890
So in this case please log in first and then we redirect to slash log in and then on the log and form

153

00:10:19.070  -->  00:10:20.690
we'll hopefully see a message.

154

00:10:20.690  -->  00:10:22.470
Right now we're not displaying that though.

155

00:10:22.520  -->  00:10:29.570
So again just to reiterate just adding this line won't display anything for us all that this does is

156

00:10:29.570  -->  00:10:35.510
it gives us the capability it gives us a way of accessing this on the next request.

157

00:10:35.510  -->  00:10:40.570
So we're not flashing it right away we're not seeing anything we're not showing the user anything.

158

00:10:40.580  -->  00:10:46.190
All this does is it says in the flash and rather than success I think it makes more sense to call this

159

00:10:46.190  -->  00:10:54.900
error in the flash add please log in first for the next request and then we redirect to slash logon

160

00:10:54.930  -->  00:10:55.320
.

161

00:10:55.820  -->  00:11:02.610
So then we have to handle that in logon which is right here slash log in.

162

00:11:02.990  -->  00:11:06.790
So I could do something like pass in message.

163

00:11:07.340  -->  00:11:14.660
And of course all I can just show you this to start so if we just have message be error you messed it

164

00:11:14.660  -->  00:11:23.540
up just like that we could just display that on our template so slash log in which is inside of fuse

165

00:11:23.780  -->  00:11:24.330
log in.

166

00:11:24.540  -->  00:11:31.900
Yes just at the very top I could just have an H-1 that displayed message just like that.

167

00:11:31.940  -->  00:11:33.650
Nothing very new.

168

00:11:33.650  -->  00:11:37.140
So I'll just show you what that looks like right now.

169

00:11:37.190  -->  00:11:44.920
Start the server up redirect to slash log in and I get this message every time error.

170

00:11:44.960  -->  00:11:46.060
You messed it up.

171

00:11:46.250  -->  00:11:52.310
As you can see which is hopefully what you expected at this point because I hardcoded it in every time

172

00:11:52.310  -->  00:11:55.570
we go to slash log in we see you messed it up.

173

00:11:56.080  -->  00:12:04.180
OK so using flash what we can do is now say message is equal to request of flash and we can just do

174

00:12:04.250  -->  00:12:06.370
the error in the flash.

175

00:12:06.740  -->  00:12:09.110
So its a little bit confusing.

176

00:12:09.530  -->  00:12:15.320
But basically the idea is right now if I just refresh the page restart the server and refresh there

177

00:12:15.320  -->  00:12:16.980
shouldn't be an error in the flash.

178

00:12:17.090  -->  00:12:19.120
So we actually don't see anything.

179

00:12:20.000  -->  00:12:28.160
But then if we make this code run wups this code here and the way we do that is trying to access something

180

00:12:28.160  -->  00:12:33.470
where we have to be logged in where this middleware is called then what will happen is that we're adding

181

00:12:33.470  -->  00:12:38.870
this to the flash under the key error with the value please log in first then we're going to slash log

182

00:12:38.870  -->  00:12:39.310
in.

183

00:12:39.440  -->  00:12:47.540
Then inside of slash logon we're sending under the key of message request up flash error which is a

184

00:12:47.540  -->  00:12:51.230
lot of things that have to be connected and it's a little bit confusing again.

185

00:12:51.350  -->  00:12:53.370
But let me just show you now.

186

00:12:53.690  -->  00:12:54.740
So I restart.

187

00:12:54.740  -->  00:12:58.550
I actually didn't have to do that this time but we don't see anything.

188

00:12:58.550  -->  00:13:05.140
Now let me go to campgrounds and try and add a new campground even though I'm not logged in.

189

00:13:05.630  -->  00:13:10.640
And now I get that message that says Please log in first which wasn't there before and if I refresh

190

00:13:10.640  -->  00:13:12.330
the page it goes away.

191

00:13:12.530  -->  00:13:16.740
So that's a really simple version of what we can accomplish using Flash.

192

00:13:16.910  -->  00:13:21.530
So before we move on in the next video to implementing this with all the different messages and the

193

00:13:21.530  -->  00:13:22.500
styling.

194

00:13:22.700  -->  00:13:24.860
Let's just summarize how this works again.

195

00:13:24.920  -->  00:13:30.350
So whenever we want to display a message whether it's a success message or an error message whatever

196

00:13:30.350  -->  00:13:33.500
it is we're going to use this line right here.

197

00:13:33.650  -->  00:13:34.730
Request flash.

198

00:13:34.760  -->  00:13:38.630
And then we pass in a key and a value and we do that before we redirect.

199

00:13:38.630  -->  00:13:41.450
It's really important if I put this line after we redirect.

200

00:13:41.450  -->  00:13:42.680
It won't work.

201

00:13:43.130  -->  00:13:47.940
So before you redirect and then you still have to handle it in the template yourself to handle it and

202

00:13:47.950  -->  00:13:53.630
the route all that it gives you is the capability of adding some data in before you redirect.

203

00:13:53.630  -->  00:13:55.300
That makes it to the next route.

204

00:13:55.460  -->  00:13:59.030
And that data won't persist on every single request to that route.

205

00:13:59.030  -->  00:14:00.140
So it's a one time thing.

206

00:14:00.410  -->  00:14:01.860
Which is why it's called Flash.

207

00:14:02.060  -->  00:14:02.560
OK.

208

00:14:02.660  -->  00:14:06.860
So in the next video I'm going to show you how to actually implement this for real where we don't have

209

00:14:06.860  -->  00:14:08.550
to do this.

210

00:14:08.600  -->  00:14:14.060
Passing it off message to every template where we can style thinks nicely with the bootstrap where we

211

00:14:14.060  -->  00:14:17.930
can have red and green messages we can have different colors if we want to put red and green are the

212

00:14:17.930  -->  00:14:18.810
standard ones.

213

00:14:18.970  -->  00:14:19.180
OK.

214

00:14:19.190  -->  00:14:20.370
So that's in the next video.

215

00:14:20.390  -->  00:14:20.800
