00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:01.390
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:07.470
And this video I'm going to introduce a few new command line commands that help us create folders and

3

00:00:07.470  -->  00:00:14.700
files using the command line rather than having to go over here and do file new file or right click

4

00:00:14.700  -->  00:00:20.370
somewhere and do new folder or a new file rather than having to do that we'll be able to do it all through

5

00:00:20.370  -->  00:00:22.630
the command line before we get started on that.

6

00:00:22.630  -->  00:00:28.920
Though I want to show you a few ways you can customize your environment and your editor on cloud nine

7

00:00:28.920  -->  00:00:29.560
.

8

00:00:29.610  -->  00:00:35.700
So if we go over here to the little Settings button it opens up preferences and there's a few different

9

00:00:35.700  -->  00:00:36.680
things I'll point out.

10

00:00:36.810  -->  00:00:41.870
The first one that most people tend to care about is the theme and the syntax highlighting colors.

11

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:47.310
When I first started teaching and I showed my students how they could change their color scheme on the

12

00:00:47.310  -->  00:00:54.300
terminal and also in a blind text students went crazy and spent hours and hours creating custom themes

13

00:00:54.300  -->  00:00:59.670
and sharing them online and comparing them trying to find the one that works just right for them.

14

00:00:59.670  -->  00:01:03.040
So if you do want to explore some of this and find one that you prefer.

15

00:01:03.270  -->  00:01:05.910
There are two different things you can customize in cloud nine.

16

00:01:05.910  -->  00:01:09.420
The first one is the theme of the actual application.

17

00:01:09.510  -->  00:01:13.650
So the color of the folder structure and the background colors.

18

00:01:13.770  -->  00:01:19.830
And the second one is the syntax highlighting the colors instead of this file.

19

00:01:19.830  -->  00:01:24.320
There are three choices for the theme and I like this one here.

20

00:01:24.480  -->  00:01:30.590
The flat theme I'll be using this one because it's higher contrast and easier to read over screencast

21

00:01:30.600  -->  00:01:31.110
.

22

00:01:31.110  -->  00:01:38.070
So this is the syntax highlighting here and we can change it using this little dropdown and we can make

23

00:01:38.070  -->  00:01:43.380
it into polarized dark which is a pretty common one.

24

00:01:43.450  -->  00:01:49.950
You can see it changes so totally up to you what you work with I'll use cloud nine day and the flat

25

00:01:49.950  -->  00:01:56.200
theme and then the next thing I want to do is increase this font size down here.

26

00:01:56.580  -->  00:02:02.690
So what you can do is go to settings and then scroll down to editors and terminal.

27

00:02:02.790  -->  00:02:06.160
You can change everything from the text color the background color.

28

00:02:06.210  -->  00:02:14.260
All of that I'm going to change the font size here and I think that should work around 18.

29

00:02:14.790  -->  00:02:19.680
And there are quite a few other settings that you can work with here so feel free to play around with

30

00:02:19.680  -->  00:02:20.320
those.

31

00:02:20.430  -->  00:02:21.860
Find what works best for you.

32

00:02:21.870  -->  00:02:29.460
You can change everything from the font size to the number of spaces in your tabs to some of the autocomplete

33

00:02:29.460  -->  00:02:31.560
options as well.

34

00:02:31.560  -->  00:02:33.680
So I'll close out of that.

35

00:02:33.690  -->  00:02:38.640
Let's talk about the command line command that I want to introduce the first one is a command called

36

00:02:38.820  -->  00:02:42.570
touch and touch will let us make a new file.

37

00:02:42.570  -->  00:02:46.400
Currently I'm inside of the workspace directory.

38

00:02:46.520  -->  00:02:51.140
Let's CD down to the colors directory and there's two ways I could do that.

39

00:02:51.210  -->  00:02:59.460
I could do cd enter the command line and hit enter and then I could do cd colors and now I'm in the

40

00:02:59.460  -->  00:03:02.730
colors directory or I'll go back.

41

00:03:02.790  -->  00:03:10.590
I can also do and one line by typing CD insert to command line slash colors and that will CD into both

42

00:03:10.590  -->  00:03:14.270
of them and now I'm in the colors directory.

43

00:03:14.430  -->  00:03:18.430
So as I mentioned the touch command will help us make a new file.

44

00:03:18.780  -->  00:03:21.760
So we type touch and then the name of the file.

45

00:03:21.960  -->  00:03:28.840
So I'll make one called Orange dot txt and we can use it to make any type of file H.T. Melchior says

46

00:03:28.860  -->  00:03:29.730
Javascript.

47

00:03:29.880  -->  00:03:35.850
And those are the three main ones that we'll be using it for but DXi is fine markdown even add a word

48

00:03:35.850  -->  00:03:40.360
document if you want it to or spreadsheet you can create any type of file from the command line.

49

00:03:40.650  -->  00:03:41.680
So that's on you to do.

50

00:03:41.700  -->  00:03:43.410
Touch orange cut to 60.

51

00:03:43.470  -->  00:03:46.840
And if I hit Enter two things happen.

52

00:03:46.920  -->  00:03:52.890
One over here you can see that orange that 260 has been added under the colors directory.

53

00:03:53.310  -->  00:03:57.990
And if I type LS I now see orange dot 60.

54

00:03:58.440  -->  00:03:59.670
Let's make one more file.

55

00:03:59.730  -->  00:04:03.160
Touch yellow that TXI.

56

00:04:03.810  -->  00:04:06.270
And that's also added over here.

57

00:04:06.270  -->  00:04:15.300
And if I type LS again I see I have now red orange and yellow textfiles So that's touch it will create

58

00:04:15.360  -->  00:04:22.490
a new file and if you want to create a whole directory I can use a new command called M-K D.

59

00:04:22.530  -->  00:04:29.350
Or make directory so people will call it make dear make directory just M-K dear.

60

00:04:29.360  -->  00:04:30.940
You'll hear all sorts of different things.

61

00:04:30.990  -->  00:04:34.610
I usually call it make directory and it makes a directory.

62

00:04:34.860  -->  00:04:39.120
So just like touch we need to give it an argument.

63

00:04:39.120  -->  00:04:45.690
So I'm inside of the colors directory and I want to make a new folder called fav colors.

64

00:04:45.990  -->  00:04:51.480
I could go over here and right click and find the new folder and then I'd have to type in the folder

65

00:04:51.480  -->  00:04:59.230
name and hit enter or I can do make directory m Qadeer fav colors just like that.

66

00:04:59.400  -->  00:05:06.990
And you can see five colors has been added and now will go into 5 colors CD fav colors and I'll make

67

00:05:06.990  -->  00:05:17.560
some of my favorite color files so purple dot DX T and will do green tea XTi as well and blue that T

68

00:05:17.640  -->  00:05:18.440
T.

69

00:05:19.080  -->  00:05:24.240
And in case you're wondering purple is actually my favorite color green and blue are just they're completely

70

00:05:24.240  -->  00:05:26.730
as fillers so disregard that.

71

00:05:26.760  -->  00:05:34.040
All right so if we type LS You see now we have three files inside of fav colors.

72

00:05:34.440  -->  00:05:41.160
And if I see the dot dot I'm now inside of the colors directory and we have fav colors orange Suttie

73

00:05:41.200  -->  00:05:45.880
XTi red dot to 60 and yellow that t s t.

74

00:05:45.930  -->  00:05:46.470
OK.

75

00:05:46.620  -->  00:05:54.140
So to review we have touch to make a new file and make directory and Qadeer to make a directory.

76

00:05:54.570  -->  00:05:59.180
So now if I say let's make a new directory called X or a new file called Aptor.

77

00:05:59.410  -->  00:06:06.420
J.S. you'll see me most of the time doing touch app dot J Yes or if I need to make a directory called

78

00:06:06.840  -->  00:06:10.950
models it will be make directory models at the beginning.

79

00:06:10.950  -->  00:06:16.730
I will make a point of showing both ways so that if you're still getting used to the command line you

80

00:06:16.940  -->  00:06:20.880
see how you can do it over here by right clicking or by using the File menu.

81

00:06:21.060  -->  00:06:26.330
But it is the developer way and the faster way of getting things done to just use a command line
