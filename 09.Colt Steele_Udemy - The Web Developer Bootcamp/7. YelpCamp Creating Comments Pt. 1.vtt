00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:05.140
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to tackle the comment creation functionality.

2

00:00:05.400  -->  00:00:06.830
So we have three main objectives.

3

00:00:06.870  -->  00:00:11.660
I'll highlight those first we need to start by talking about something called nested routes.

4

00:00:11.820  -->  00:00:16.340
So we'll get to that then we need to make our two routes in order to create comets.

5

00:00:16.380  -->  00:00:21.630
We need a route for the form which is new and then we need a post route where we actually create the

6

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:27.880
actual comment which is called create new and create and then we need the new comment form.

7

00:00:27.900  -->  00:00:30.270
Let's begin by discussing what we have so far.

8

00:00:30.300  -->  00:00:31.720
So I'm running this server.

9

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:36.850
We have three campgrounds that we've seen in the database and I can click on one and we have a comment

10

00:00:36.860  -->  00:00:37.080
.

11

00:00:37.380  -->  00:00:42.720
What we would like to do is ALSO have a button that says add new comment or leave her for you or something

12

00:00:42.720  -->  00:00:43.350
like that.

13

00:00:43.500  -->  00:00:49.440
We click on it and then we go to a new page that shows a form and then on that form we could submit

14

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:55.850
a new comment with an author's name and some text and hit submit and take us back here and we'll see

15

00:00:55.850  -->  00:00:56.810
our new comment.

16

00:00:57.180  -->  00:01:00.170
So that's the end goal to get there.

17

00:01:00.180  -->  00:01:02.930
I want to start by talking about something called nested routes.

18

00:01:03.090  -->  00:01:08.640
And before I do that I'll just highlight I'm now on VIF for because we are going to be moving some files

19

00:01:08.640  -->  00:01:11.040
around to changing the structure a little bit.

20

00:01:11.040  -->  00:01:14.620
So I want to make it into a new version just so that you can compare those changes.

21

00:01:14.700  -->  00:01:16.570
So again version 4.

22

00:01:16.940  -->  00:01:17.280
OK.

23

00:01:17.280  -->  00:01:21.890
So let's begin by doing a review of the restful routes that we've seen so far.

24

00:01:22.170  -->  00:01:29.370
So we've talked about index which displays a list of all dogs and the route is slash dogs or whatever

25

00:01:29.370  -->  00:01:34.020
our resources slash comments slash campgrounds slash users.

26

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:35.390
And it's the get request.

27

00:01:35.670  -->  00:01:41.430
Then we have new uncreate which are kind of paired together where all that new does is it shows us a

28

00:01:41.450  -->  00:01:48.450
form and then we submit the form and the form sends the data to create ad which is flash dogs the same

29

00:01:48.450  -->  00:01:52.450
path as the index except it's a post request.

30

00:01:52.950  -->  00:01:57.720
And then we have a show which is a little bit different because there is a path parameter inside the

31

00:01:57.720  -->  00:02:04.140
route the ID and we need that because the whole point of show is that it shows information and details

32

00:02:04.140  -->  00:02:06.770
about one particular entity.

33

00:02:06.780  -->  00:02:08.010
So this works just fine.

34

00:02:08.010  -->  00:02:09.500
This is what we have so far.

35

00:02:09.630  -->  00:02:14.430
We have our Index for campgrounds which is slash campgrounds.

36

00:02:14.430  -->  00:02:19.470
We have new and create and show for campgrounds.

37

00:02:19.470  -->  00:02:26.840
So we have Slash campgrounds and then we have Slash campgrounds slash new and then we have Slash campgrounds

38

00:02:28.230  -->  00:02:35.300
as a post for create and slash campgrounds slash ID for show.

39

00:02:35.580  -->  00:02:40.650
But now we need to add in some comment routes because we want to be able to add a comment again when

40

00:02:40.650  -->  00:02:42.210
we click a button right here.

41

00:02:42.210  -->  00:02:47.760
It should take us to a route to add a comment to this particular campground and that's the important

42

00:02:47.760  -->  00:02:48.490
part.

43

00:02:48.510  -->  00:02:51.090
So our route isn't actually going to look like this.

44

00:02:51.090  -->  00:02:57.570
We're not going to have new uncreate for comments that look like this where we have Slash comments slash

45

00:02:57.570  -->  00:03:03.490
new and slash comments as opposed to actually create.

46

00:03:04.200  -->  00:03:10.530
That's not what we're going to have because this you know has no information about the particular campground

47

00:03:10.590  -->  00:03:12.480
that we're adding the comment to.

48

00:03:12.480  -->  00:03:15.550
So this would work if we were just arbitrarily creating comments.

49

00:03:15.720  -->  00:03:20.980
But if we actually want them to be associated to a particular campground which we do we need to have

50

00:03:20.980  -->  00:03:23.330
the campground ID in the URL.

51

00:03:23.610  -->  00:03:27.620
So this gets to the first topic I want to bring up which is nested wraps.

52

00:03:28.110  -->  00:03:34.140
So what we can do is take these restful routes and combine them and we can nest the comment routes on

53

00:03:34.140  -->  00:03:36.410
top of for after the campground routes.

54

00:03:36.690  -->  00:03:47.760
So our comment new is actually going to look like campground slash ID slash comments slash new and or

55

00:03:47.760  -->  00:03:48.430
create.

56

00:03:48.480  -->  00:03:50.700
It's going to be campgrounds.

57

00:03:50.820  -->  00:03:53.530
Slash ID slash comments.

58

00:03:53.850  -->  00:03:59.490
So what we've done is we've taken the campground in the ID and just put it before all of the routes

59

00:03:59.490  -->  00:04:01.020
that have to do with comments.

60

00:04:01.020  -->  00:04:04.320
And that's because a comment is dependent on a campground.

61

00:04:04.500  -->  00:04:07.550
We don't have comments that exist away from campgrounds.

62

00:04:07.560  -->  00:04:09.210
They are inherently linked.

63

00:04:09.480  -->  00:04:14.070
And inside the create for instance we're not just going to make a comment we're going to make a comment

64

00:04:14.100  -->  00:04:16.830
and then we're going to associate it with the campground.

65

00:04:16.890  -->  00:04:21.660
So we're going to have to do a find by ID for camp ground and then we're going to have to create a comment

66

00:04:21.990  -->  00:04:24.720
and then we're going to have to connect them and save them both.

67

00:04:24.720  -->  00:04:29.600
So we need this idea in the wrap so all of that's to say we're going to use nested routes.

68

00:04:29.790  -->  00:04:33.720
These are the two new routes we're adding so new and create for comments.

69

00:04:33.720  -->  00:04:34.200
All right.

70

00:04:34.440  -->  00:04:35.820
So let's get started.

71

00:04:35.820  -->  00:04:42.670
I'm going to change over to V for right now I'm in v3 so I'm going to C.D out and then CD into before

72

00:04:42.680  -->  00:04:43.050
.

73

00:04:43.320  -->  00:04:44.220
Just like that.

74

00:04:44.340  -->  00:04:47.280
And then I'm going to open up after Yes.

75

00:04:47.310  -->  00:04:51.780
And this is where we'll be doing most of our work and we're going to start by adding in the new route

76

00:04:52.290  -->  00:04:53.710
which looks like this right here.

77

00:04:53.730  -->  00:05:01.590
Campgrounds slash ID slash comments slash new as a get request and it should show a form for us to create

78

00:05:01.620  -->  00:05:02.520
a new comment.

79

00:05:03.060  -->  00:05:06.740
And we have a lot of routes which again and we will be moving very shortly.

80

00:05:07.010  -->  00:05:13.500
But I'm going to start by just adding a little divider here just to make it clear duplicate that and

81

00:05:13.500  -->  00:05:16.220
then I'll just say comments routes.

82

00:05:16.470  -->  00:05:17.180
Okay.

83

00:05:17.610  -->  00:05:27.410
And we're going to add an apt get slash campground slash and Id slash comments slash new.

84

00:05:27.780  -->  00:05:35.110
And then our callback and in here we want our request and our response.

85

00:05:35.120  -->  00:05:40.090
And then inside we're going to start by doing a redstart send.

86

00:05:40.270  -->  00:05:47.590
This will be a comment form just to make sure that our route is hooked up correctly and if we now start

87

00:05:47.590  -->  00:05:56.260
the server node mapped out J us and then we go to the campground page refresh and let's click on one

88

00:05:56.260  -->  00:06:00.160
of these and to get to the new comment route.

89

00:06:00.230  -->  00:06:03.110
Need to add slash comments slash new.

90

00:06:03.970  -->  00:06:04.990
And there we go.

91

00:06:05.020  -->  00:06:07.990
It says this will be the common form.

92

00:06:08.000  -->  00:06:09.890
Now let's go back.

93

00:06:09.880  -->  00:06:15.860
Instead of sending back this response let's render a template and that should be new.

94

00:06:16.030  -->  00:06:18.020
That's the name of the template new that E.J..

95

00:06:18.070  -->  00:06:18.690
Yes.

96

00:06:19.060  -->  00:06:26.050
But there is a problem which is we have a new form already existing for our campground new right here

97

00:06:27.400  -->  00:06:31.630
so we can have another template called new and must we make a small change and that's what we're going

98

00:06:31.630  -->  00:06:32.270
to do.

99

00:06:32.290  -->  00:06:37.990
We're going to split up the views this directory here we're going to add in two new directories campground

100

00:06:38.290  -->  00:06:40.370
and we're going to add in comment.

101

00:06:40.750  -->  00:06:42.220
So we'll do that now.

102

00:06:42.640  -->  00:06:51.770
Make a directory instead of use called comments and make another one called campgrounds and you can

103

00:06:51.760  -->  00:06:56.740
see those two new directories here and underscore to drag the files over to where I need them to go

104

00:06:56.750  -->  00:06:56.780
.

105

00:06:56.770  -->  00:07:05.140
So index is for campground new is for campgrounds show is for campground and then we'll need to make

106

00:07:05.260  -->  00:07:06.110
our new.

107

00:07:06.320  -->  00:07:08.040
US instead of comments.

108

00:07:08.350  -->  00:07:09.530
So let's do that now.

109

00:07:09.620  -->  00:07:19.420
Will do touch views slash comments slash new each Yes and then we'll do the same thing but open it up

110

00:07:22.750  -->  00:07:31.930
and we'll open that file up and let's add our H-1 that just says new comment form and save that.

111

00:07:32.530  -->  00:07:36.270
So what we want to do is see that when we go to this you are well.

112

00:07:36.340  -->  00:07:40.350
So we have our redstart render new but we need to change it.

113

00:07:40.390  -->  00:07:44.920
It should now be redstart render comments slash new.

114

00:07:45.070  -->  00:07:47.750
It's not just new in the route of views.

115

00:07:47.760  -->  00:07:51.070
It's now instead of comments you can see there.

116

00:07:51.620  -->  00:07:54.650
And we'll also need to change over all of the other routes as well.

117

00:07:54.670  -->  00:08:00.230
So this needs to be campground slash.

118

00:08:01.330  -->  00:08:04.870
This needs to be campgrounds as well and we don't need the dam.

119

00:08:04.880  -->  00:08:09.040
E.J. Yes and then we have one more

120

00:08:12.300  -->  00:08:12.770
here.

121

00:08:12.790  -->  00:08:19.820
This one can stay the same but index needs to be campgrounds slash index.

122

00:08:19.820  -->  00:08:20.280
Okay.

123

00:08:20.290  -->  00:08:23.470
And landing is on its own because it doesn't belong to campgrounds.

124

00:08:23.480  -->  00:08:26.440
It doesn't belong to comments it's its own thing.

125

00:08:26.460  -->  00:08:29.680
We'll just leave it where it is and it's really pretty much empty still.

126

00:08:29.680  -->  00:08:36.970
We haven't actually filled out most of the landing page so let's try running this code now node abduct

127

00:08:37.190  -->  00:08:44.320
us and we'll go to the campground page and we have a problem.

128

00:08:44.440  -->  00:08:49.300
You might be thinking that the problem is that express didn't find the file we just created the campground

129

00:08:49.300  -->  00:08:55.660
slash index but that's not actually the issue with the issue is if we if we read closely here it can't

130

00:08:55.660  -->  00:08:56.450
find the file.

131

00:08:56.480  -->  00:08:58.290
No such file or directory.

132

00:08:58.530  -->  00:09:01.550
Yup camp version for views campgrounds.

133

00:09:01.780  -->  00:09:03.180
Parshall's header.

134

00:09:03.240  -->  00:09:04.220
Each Yes.

135

00:09:04.270  -->  00:09:08.990
So it's not finding the parcels that we're including if we open up the index.

136

00:09:09.110  -->  00:09:10.180
This right here.

137

00:09:10.610  -->  00:09:13.300
And that's because we changed where this file was.

138

00:09:13.420  -->  00:09:19.340
So we need to change how we're linking to Parshall's because we used to be in the same directory as

139

00:09:19.340  -->  00:09:21.060
Parshall's like lending each.

140

00:09:21.080  -->  00:09:21.570
Yes.

141

00:09:21.670  -->  00:09:24.980
But now this file is nested inside of campgrounds.

142

00:09:25.270  -->  00:09:33.280
So we need to go back one folder first which will take us from here up to here and then into Parshall's

143

00:09:33.500  -->  00:09:35.460
and then heterodoxy J us.

144

00:09:35.590  -->  00:09:42.410
So dot dot slash Parshall's dot dot represents one level back one folder back just like when we do see

145

00:09:42.410  -->  00:09:43.780
the dot dot.

146

00:09:44.260  -->  00:09:48.540
All right and we'll do the same thing for the footer dot dot slash.

147

00:09:48.760  -->  00:09:52.900
And if we save now and refresh this works just fine.

148

00:09:53.000  -->  00:09:56.530
But if we try and go to the show page we have the same problem.

149

00:09:56.650  -->  00:10:07.090
So we need to go to those different templates campgrounds new Let's do dot dot slash slash and also

150

00:10:07.100  -->  00:10:10.540
show will do dot dot slash again.

151

00:10:10.880  -->  00:10:15.150
And one more and save now this template should work for us.

152

00:10:15.160  -->  00:10:19.170
So we have show she can go back at a new campground.

153

00:10:19.250  -->  00:10:20.830
This works just fine.

154

00:10:20.870  -->  00:10:21.960
Great.

155

00:10:21.970  -->  00:10:24.260
Now let's try out the comment new template.

156

00:10:24.480  -->  00:10:29.720
So let's click on any show page and add on slash comments slash new.

157

00:10:30.380  -->  00:10:32.360
And we're getting the correct each time out.

158

00:10:32.750  -->  00:10:39.050
So now let's actually add the form in here and I'm going to steal from our other new template which

159

00:10:39.040  -->  00:10:46.010
is the new campground was going to take all of this actually and copy it and now go over to comment

160

00:10:46.030  -->  00:10:50.710
new and paste that in and we'll need to change a few things.

161

00:10:50.870  -->  00:10:59.230
Well keep the same Parshall's the head or the footer and we'll change this to be add new comments and

162

00:10:59.230  -->  00:11:03.410
save that and then we need to change the you are out here.

163

00:11:03.770  -->  00:11:06.290
Are you are needs to be slashed campgrounds.

164

00:11:06.430  -->  00:11:10.920
Slash and we need the ID of the campground which we don't have yet.

165

00:11:11.090  -->  00:11:12.550
We don't have it in this template.

166

00:11:12.860  -->  00:11:18.260
What we need to do is actually pass it through to this template and we could just pass the idea itself

167

00:11:18.250  -->  00:11:20.800
through as a variable and display it here.

168

00:11:21.080  -->  00:11:26.120
But I actually want to use the title or the name of the campground as well so that we can say add new

169

00:11:26.120  -->  00:11:27.840
comment to.

170

00:11:28.070  -->  00:11:35.870
And then here we could do campground name which right now we can't because campground isn't defined

171

00:11:36.560  -->  00:11:37.580
so we'll do that.

172

00:11:37.630  -->  00:11:44.090
And then here we'll just pre-filled the code we want to work rather than campground name will add in

173

00:11:44.170  -->  00:11:52.040
campground dot ID and then we need the rest of the route which is sashed comments because remember this

174

00:11:52.030  -->  00:11:54.870
is the post route to create a comment.

175

00:11:55.150  -->  00:11:56.670
So we have this route right now.

176

00:11:56.680  -->  00:12:02.200
That's the template we're looking at and the form on that template the new template needs to send a

177

00:12:02.200  -->  00:12:07.010
request submit the form data as a post to this you know.

178

00:12:07.340  -->  00:12:08.280
OK.

179

00:12:08.620  -->  00:12:12.950
So we've written this it's not going to work right now because campground is not defined in the template

180

00:12:12.960  -->  00:12:13.220
.

181

00:12:13.420  -->  00:12:20.180
So what we need to do is go to the route the new route that we have the very bottom here and we need

182

00:12:20.170  -->  00:12:26.110
to find camp ground by id and then we want to send that through when we render.

183

00:12:26.530  -->  00:12:36.940
So that's going to be a campground that we all do find by id and the ID is request harams that Id whatever

184

00:12:36.940  -->  00:12:37.990
we named here.

185

00:12:38.170  -->  00:12:40.230
And the standard name is ID.

186

00:12:40.630  -->  00:12:48.460
And then when that's done we'll have a callback error and then campground and we'll just check if there's

187

00:12:48.460  -->  00:12:53.810
an error we'll cancel that log for now.

188

00:12:53.810  -->  00:12:59.120
Otherwise we're going to render the comments new.

189

00:12:59.530  -->  00:13:07.640
And we're going to pass in campground so campground will be equal to the value of this campground coming

190

00:13:07.630  -->  00:13:09.860
back from the database.

191

00:13:10.150  -->  00:13:16.540
So we'll save this and we can try taking a look at that template now if we restart CheckFree of any

192

00:13:16.540  -->  00:13:17.550
syntax errors.

193

00:13:17.590  -->  00:13:19.260
Looks good.

194

00:13:19.750  -->  00:13:24.820
We can't just refresh because every timer app loads up we're actually generating new campgrounds and

195

00:13:24.830  -->  00:13:26.330
they'll have different ideas.

196

00:13:26.570  -->  00:13:32.450
So what we need to do is go back to camp grounds and then click on one of these and then go to slash

197

00:13:32.440  -->  00:13:35.050
comments slash new.

198

00:13:36.130  -->  00:13:37.620
And we're getting a forum here.

199

00:13:37.780  -->  00:13:39.000
Let's inspect the form.

200

00:13:39.110  -->  00:13:43.950
But the first thing that looks good to me is that it's telling me add new comment to clads rest.

201

00:13:44.140  -->  00:13:49.020
So let's inspect and let's take a look at the URL that the form is submitting to.

202

00:13:49.590  -->  00:13:53.160
So the form action is set to slash campground slash.

203

00:13:53.170  -->  00:13:58.070
This giant ID slash comments as a post which is exactly what we need.

204

00:13:58.340  -->  00:14:01.380
Now we need to make this form have the correct attributes.

205

00:14:01.610  -->  00:14:08.700
So we'll go back and we want this form to have comment text so we'll just call it text for now.

206

00:14:08.870  -->  00:14:09.730
And an author.

207

00:14:09.760  -->  00:14:11.250
And that's all we need.

208

00:14:11.650  -->  00:14:15.940
So we don't need the description that we had to delete that.

209

00:14:16.730  -->  00:14:19.030
And then we'll also change the names here.

210

00:14:19.370  -->  00:14:24.380
And I'm going to show you another strategy for setting the names up rather than doing them separate

211

00:14:24.380  -->  00:14:24.480
.

212

00:14:24.550  -->  00:14:27.980
Like author and then appear doing text.

213

00:14:28.030  -->  00:14:34.600
What we can do is group them together like this comment and then square brackets around author and then

214

00:14:34.610  -->  00:14:41.480
comment square brackets and text and then when we submit this form it will all be nested inside of comment

215

00:14:41.480  -->  00:14:41.740
.

216

00:14:41.750  -->  00:14:48.310
So inside of my objects in the route I'll be able to extract comment request up body duck comment and

217

00:14:48.310  -->  00:14:52.820
it will already have text and author inside of it so I'll show you that in just a second.

218

00:14:53.090  -->  00:14:56.050
Let's just make sure the form looks OK now.

219

00:14:56.170  -->  00:14:57.760
Refresh the page.

220

00:14:57.760  -->  00:15:01.440
All right so we have two inputs text an author we can submit it
