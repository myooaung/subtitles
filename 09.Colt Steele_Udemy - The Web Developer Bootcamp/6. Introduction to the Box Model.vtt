00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:06.090
So one of the most important concepts that we have yet to cover and assess is positioning of elements

2

00:00:06.090  -->  00:00:06.440
.

3

00:00:06.600  -->  00:00:10.290
So how do we lay out a page or move a div to the top right.

4

00:00:10.410  -->  00:00:15.720
Or how do we make an anchor tag wider or add spacing between images.

5

00:00:15.780  -->  00:00:20.110
All of that is really important and it's all related to something called the box model.

6

00:00:20.220  -->  00:00:26.820
So the box model is this basic idea that's really central to everything in HD you assess which is that

7

00:00:26.820  -->  00:00:31.190
basically every element has a rectangular box around it.

8

00:00:31.680  -->  00:00:38.040
So we can see here just going to go to any web page on MDA and I have the inspector open and I have

9

00:00:38.040  -->  00:00:39.620
the magnifying glass selected.

10

00:00:40.010  -->  00:00:44.810
And as I hover over every element you can see that there's a box around it.

11

00:00:44.910  -->  00:00:48.180
So this H2 has a blue box around it.

12

00:00:48.180  -->  00:00:49.810
This one has a box.

13

00:00:50.130  -->  00:00:53.370
Even things that aren't particularly boxy.

14

00:00:53.490  -->  00:00:56.320
So this rounded corner div..

15

00:00:56.490  -->  00:00:58.080
It still has a box around it.

16

00:00:58.080  -->  00:00:59.310
Behind the scenes.

17

00:00:59.520  -->  00:01:05.790
So does this here and this one is really not round or not boxy looking to have these rounded corners

18

00:01:05.820  -->  00:01:09.130
but it's still a box.

19

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:14.940
So these boxes are really useful behind the scenes because we can style different properties on them

20

00:01:14.940  -->  00:01:15.870
.

21

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:19.350
So there are four properties or four different parts of every box.

22

00:01:19.350  -->  00:01:23.550
There's a lot more properties but for parts of the box that we can manipulate.

23

00:01:23.610  -->  00:01:29.790
So let's suppose that this diagram which is also from MDA and is of a paragraph.

24

00:01:29.790  -->  00:01:35.010
So I have some text in a paragraph and I give it a orange or a yellow border and this is what the user

25

00:01:35.010  -->  00:01:42.210
sees some text and a border but behind the scenes there's actually some other things happening.

26

00:01:42.360  -->  00:01:47.920
So between the border and the text there's something called padding.

27

00:01:48.000  -->  00:01:51.040
So padding is just the space on the inside of the border.

28

00:01:51.190  -->  00:01:56.730
So between the content and the border is padding and then there's also margin which is on the other

29

00:01:56.730  -->  00:02:01.060
side it's between the border on the outside and anything else.

30

00:02:01.170  -->  00:02:04.720
So we use margin often to add spacing between elements.

31

00:02:04.860  -->  00:02:10.470
So if we had two paragraphs and I wanted them to be further apart then I would use margin and increase

32

00:02:10.470  -->  00:02:11.340
that.

33

00:02:11.880  -->  00:02:16.380
So now we're going to do a little bit of a deep dive into actually the syntax of some of the properties

34

00:02:16.380  -->  00:02:18.700
that we want to use before we do that.

35

00:02:18.720  -->  00:02:24.000
I want to just show you two things you can look forward to making the first one of the most exciting

36

00:02:24.330  -->  00:02:29.870
but what is important is that we now have a way of making something that looks like this.

37

00:02:29.880  -->  00:02:34.500
Up until now we don't actually have a way of making these boxes that are connected to one another that

38

00:02:34.500  -->  00:02:39.330
have a with assigned to them but they're empty there's no text inside.

39

00:02:39.330  -->  00:02:46.260
So we're going to learn about the box model and apply that here to make this tic tac toe board and then

40

00:02:46.260  -->  00:02:50.830
we're going to make this portfolio site for a fictional photographer.

41

00:02:51.450  -->  00:02:52.350
So this is nice.

42

00:02:52.420  -->  00:03:00.690
It's images it's responsive so it changes size a change the window size and the grid.

43

00:03:00.750  -->  00:03:04.270
All of this is based off of the concepts you're going to learn here.

44

00:03:04.710  -->  00:03:07.020
So I'm going to go ahead and open up sublime here.

45

00:03:07.560  -->  00:03:10.510
And I have a really simple document that I've created.

46

00:03:10.740  -->  00:03:12.600
So it's just simple HTML.

47

00:03:12.660  -->  00:03:14.670
It has a style sheet connected.

48

00:03:14.700  -->  00:03:15.330
It's empty.

49

00:03:15.330  -->  00:03:18.930
Aside from a few comments and then two paragraphs.

50

00:03:18.930  -->  00:03:25.620
So if I open this up you can see that it's very basic very boring and we're just going to use this to

51

00:03:25.620  -->  00:03:27.660
play around with the box model.

52

00:03:28.860  -->  00:03:35.910
So I'm going to go to my success and I'm going to select paragraphs and then I'm just going to copy

53

00:03:35.910  -->  00:03:41.940
these comments inside so that I can write some code beneath them just to visually tell you what I'm

54

00:03:41.940  -->  00:03:43.370
doing.

55

00:03:43.380  -->  00:03:45.740
So let's start by giving these a border.

56

00:03:45.900  -->  00:03:54.450
So this should be review border and let's do to pixel solid blue save that refresh and you can see that

57

00:03:54.450  -->  00:03:57.630
we get a border all the way around the content.

58

00:03:57.630  -->  00:04:02.360
And what you also notice is that the content here goes all the way across the screen.

59

00:04:02.370  -->  00:04:08.460
Our border doesn't stop right here and that's because when we make a paragraph by default it goes all

60

00:04:08.460  -->  00:04:09.620
the way across the screen.

61

00:04:09.630  -->  00:04:20.210
So if I want to change the width of the paragraph itself of the text I can use the width property and

62

00:04:20.220  -->  00:04:23.260
I'm going to go ahead and give a width of one.

63

00:04:23.490  -->  00:04:25.390
Let's do 200 pixels to start.

64

00:04:25.890  -->  00:04:29.190
And if I refresh you can see we've now changed the width.

65

00:04:29.190  -->  00:04:34.920
If I inspect the content isn't blue.

66

00:04:35.940  -->  00:04:37.840
And then we have a border around it.

67

00:04:38.310  -->  00:04:39.700
So the content is blue.

68

00:04:40.110  -->  00:04:45.350
And on this diagram that is this box right here this element box.

69

00:04:45.630  -->  00:04:48.330
And then we have a border that is directly around it.

70

00:04:48.330  -->  00:04:52.020
There's no space between the border and the content.

71

00:04:52.020  -->  00:04:56.920
One other thing with the width and also there's a height.

72

00:04:57.060  -->  00:05:02.360
So let's do a height of 300 pixels and see we've just added a bunch of space.

73

00:05:02.370  -->  00:05:06.620
I'm going to get rid of that but there's a height that we can use just like with.

74

00:05:06.930  -->  00:05:11.760
We don't have to just use pixels so we can use percentages.

75

00:05:13.890  -->  00:05:15.780
And those are really useful so let me show you.

76

00:05:15.810  -->  00:05:23.310
Let's do 50 percent and you might be wondering what is it 50 percent of.

77

00:05:23.310  -->  00:05:27.290
And the answer is that it's 50 percent of the parent element.

78

00:05:27.300  -->  00:05:34.230
So in this case it's the body that the paragraph is inside of the paragraph goes halfway across the

79

00:05:34.230  -->  00:05:35.240
body.

80

00:05:35.310  -->  00:05:37.390
In our case the body is the entire page.

81

00:05:37.410  -->  00:05:38.240
It was all the way across.

82

00:05:38.250  -->  00:05:40.620
So we end up with half the page.

83

00:05:40.800  -->  00:05:51.870
And what's nice about this if I change the window size it also changes so a lot of people use this and

84

00:05:51.900  -->  00:05:54.890
will use that actually to use in this image grid.

85

00:05:55.280  -->  00:05:59.490
You can see that the images change their width and that's a percentage.

86

00:06:00.040  -->  00:06:04.590
OK so I'm going to keep it like that for now.

87

00:06:04.770  -->  00:06:10.080
And then the next property we're going to talk about is padding and remember padding is this space between

88

00:06:10.080  -->  00:06:11.600
the element and the border.

89

00:06:11.750  -->  00:06:15.410
And right now we don't have any space the borders right on top.

90

00:06:15.840  -->  00:06:21.570
So there's a property called padding and we can give it a number of pixels and let's do 10 pixels to

91

00:06:21.570  -->  00:06:22.120
start.

92

00:06:22.230  -->  00:06:25.130
Save the file refresh.

93

00:06:25.410  -->  00:06:28.700
And now we have 10 pixels of padding on all sides.

94

00:06:29.040  -->  00:06:36.660
So if I inspect now you'll see there's now this green content that's introduced so we have the blue

95

00:06:37.080  -->  00:06:45.390
content itself and then we have the green around it which is between the border and the content so we

96

00:06:45.380  -->  00:06:49.760
can obviously increment this and we get a lot more space on the inside.

97

00:06:50.490  -->  00:06:52.890
But this is not the only way to set padding.

98

00:06:52.920  -->  00:06:57.250
This sets it on all four sides as exactly the same.

99

00:06:57.380  -->  00:07:01.760
But sometimes we only want padding on one side or two sides just like with border.

100

00:07:01.800  -->  00:07:09.510
There are short cuts for the longer version where it's a border top 10 pixels border bottom five pixels

101

00:07:09.500  -->  00:07:09.830
.

102

00:07:09.900  -->  00:07:17.940
Same thing with padding and it comment that out and we can do something like padding left 40 pixels

103

00:07:19.440  -->  00:07:20.270
and fresh.

104

00:07:20.520  -->  00:07:22.090
And we get padding right here.

105

00:07:22.320  -->  00:07:24.250
And that's the only place for padding is.

106

00:07:24.330  -->  00:07:29.640
And I remember the space over here this blue is not the padding that's her actual content that's from

107

00:07:29.630  -->  00:07:30.830
this with here.

108

00:07:30.990  -->  00:07:33.610
So different even though it looks like there's space on the right.

109

00:07:33.620  -->  00:07:35.930
It's coming from a different place.

110

00:07:37.170  -->  00:07:40.920
So another thing that we can do here is play with the margin.

111

00:07:41.160  -->  00:07:43.780
So the margin is a last piece of the puzzle.

112

00:07:43.860  -->  00:07:45.900
It's the space on the outside of the border.

113

00:07:45.900  -->  00:07:47.980
So between elements.

114

00:07:48.450  -->  00:07:54.620
So this is going to be useful because we might want to increment or increase this space right here or

115

00:07:54.620  -->  00:08:01.280
as an example here this space right here in between the images is set using Marjan.

116

00:08:01.500  -->  00:08:07.090
So it actually looks just like padding so we can say margin and let's do something obvious like 100

117

00:08:07.110  -->  00:08:10.240
pixels to start and refresh.

118

00:08:10.410  -->  00:08:15.810
And what happened is we now have 100 pixels of space on all sides of the element on the outside of the

119

00:08:15.810  -->  00:08:17.100
border.

120

00:08:18.240  -->  00:08:19.360
So find aspect.

121

00:08:19.980  -->  00:08:26.910
You'll see that in Chrome that's identified as orange so blue is the content Green is the padding in

122

00:08:27.000  -->  00:08:28.710
Orange is the margin.

123

00:08:28.800  -->  00:08:30.030
So just like padding.

124

00:08:30.030  -->  00:08:36.050
Sometimes we only want to set one part of the margin one side so we can do something like margin top

125

00:08:36.690  -->  00:08:38.890
is 500 pixels.

126

00:08:38.900  -->  00:08:45.000
And then when they come at this one out for now and save and we only get space on the top on the left

127

00:08:45.000  -->  00:08:46.070
there's nothing.

128

00:08:46.160  -->  00:08:48.180
And then more space on the top of this one.

129

00:08:48.170  -->  00:08:50.480
Nothing on the bottom or the left or the right.

130

00:08:50.610  -->  00:08:52.710
So that's margin.

131

00:08:52.710  -->  00:08:58.500
So sometimes we to add values to all sides of the margin but we don't want to have to do it with four

132

00:08:58.500  -->  00:08:59.510
different lines.

133

00:08:59.660  -->  00:09:04.110
So we don't want them to be exactly the same if they are here but we don't all have to say margin top

134

00:09:04.200  -->  00:09:06.500
margin left margin right margin bottom.

135

00:09:06.570  -->  00:09:09.550
So there's another shortcut just like for border.

136

00:09:09.570  -->  00:09:14.780
Or we can do things at once we can do this margin and give it four values.

137

00:09:14.820  -->  00:09:21.300
So the first one is for the top and then the right and then the bottom.

138

00:09:21.750  -->  00:09:24.330
Let's do 500 pixels and then the left

139

00:09:27.570  -->  00:09:35.550
and by doing that we get this nice four sided margin where the values are all different but we only

140

00:09:35.550  -->  00:09:36.820
had to do in one line.

141

00:09:37.290  -->  00:09:44.190
So just to inspect this here and see if we get the 500 pixels on the bottom it the 20 on top we get

142

00:09:44.180  -->  00:09:49.920
the hundred on the left and then we have our 40 on the right.

143

00:09:50.010  -->  00:09:53.790
So there's one last thing that you'll see often with margin which is margin.

144

00:09:53.790  -->  00:09:54.480
Auto.

145

00:09:54.780  -->  00:09:59.340
So what we can do is set the margin to be auto on the left or the right.

146

00:09:59.370  -->  00:10:02.550
And what that will do is actually Center an element for us.

147

00:10:02.550  -->  00:10:04.570
So let me show you how that works.

148

00:10:04.710  -->  00:10:12.870
And the comment this out again and we can write margin and let's just say zero margin on top auto on

149

00:10:12.870  -->  00:10:18.390
the left or on the right zero margin and bottom and auto on the left.

150

00:10:18.510  -->  00:10:23.520
And if I make this full size and refresh you'll see that it centers things for us.

151

00:10:23.520  -->  00:10:30.740
So what that means it's decided that this is 50 percent because we said that here and then it figures

152

00:10:30.750  -->  00:10:36.810
out the left is auto and the right is auto so just does it as much as it needs to do and that will actually

153

00:10:36.810  -->  00:10:37.880
center it for us.

154

00:10:37.980  -->  00:10:41.540
And then we have zero on the top and the bottom so they're scrunched together.

155

00:10:41.930  -->  00:10:47.940
What we can also do there's an even shorter way of doing this and it looks like this margin zero Otto

156

00:10:47.980  -->  00:10:48.200
.

157

00:10:48.540  -->  00:10:53.470
And so this will set the top and bottom to zero the left and right to auto.

158

00:10:53.580  -->  00:11:01.380
So nothing changes and we can also use this syntax if I want to add 50 pixels to the top and auto or

159

00:11:01.380  -->  00:11:04.700
I want to add 50 pixels and 20 pixels.

160

00:11:04.740  -->  00:11:09.830
The one thing to remember is you need the x there unless the number is zero.

161

00:11:10.430  -->  00:11:17.720
So if I do this it adds 20 on the top on the left and the right and then it adds 50 on the top and bottom

162

00:11:17.730  -->  00:11:18.760
.

163

00:11:18.780  -->  00:11:21.070
So let's recap here just one more time.

164

00:11:21.120  -->  00:11:25.370
We've got the inner content which is right here.

165

00:11:25.830  -->  00:11:31.290
We've got padding which is between the borders so all we have is padding left and then we have margin

166

00:11:31.430  -->  00:11:33.440
which is between the border and on the other side.

167

00:11:33.450  -->  00:11:35.530
So between elements basically.

168

00:11:35.610  -->  00:11:40.150
So in the next few videos we are going to apply these concepts and use them throughout this course
