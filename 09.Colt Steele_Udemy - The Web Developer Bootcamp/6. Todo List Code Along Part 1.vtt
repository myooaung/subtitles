00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:06.330
OK in this video we're going to use what we've learned so far about javascript arrays to build a very

2

00:00:06.330  -->  00:00:07.790
simple to do list.

3

00:00:08.160  -->  00:00:13.290
And of course we haven't learned about having our javascript interact with our Jim Clancy is us.

4

00:00:13.350  -->  00:00:18.770
So this to do list app is all going to be based around prompts and alert and constantly logs.

5

00:00:18.960  -->  00:00:24.210
But very soon we'll be learning about dominant mutation which is how we get our javascript to add age

6

00:00:24.210  -->  00:00:29.400
to Moul elements or remove them or change them or add the SS and at that point we'll actually make a

7

00:00:29.400  -->  00:00:33.080
nice looking to do list where it's not just Konst but logs.

8

00:00:33.150  -->  00:00:34.620
So here's how it's going to work.

9

00:00:34.620  -->  00:00:38.480
When I refresh the page it asks me what would I like to do.

10

00:00:38.700  -->  00:00:43.870
And you can see on the left I have three choices I can type a new phone add a new to do.

11

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:47.990
I can type list to view all to or type quit to quit.

12

00:00:48.030  -->  00:00:50.780
So let's try typing list to start.

13

00:00:51.440  -->  00:00:56.190
And it prints me all the to do's which is just an empty array for now.

14

00:00:56.190  -->  00:00:57.640
So let's add a new one.

15

00:00:57.750  -->  00:01:03.870
Notice that it asks me again I didn't have to reload all type new and now it says enter a new to do

16

00:01:03.870  -->  00:01:04.340
.

17

00:01:04.560  -->  00:01:07.200
So I'm going to walk rusty.

18

00:01:07.350  -->  00:01:11.010
Hit enter and now it asks me what would you like to do.

19

00:01:11.220  -->  00:01:16.320
So I will list and I can see that walk resti has been added to my To Do list.

20

00:01:16.650  -->  00:01:17.830
Let's add one more.

21

00:01:17.850  -->  00:01:27.790
So new this one will be feed resti and the list and I now have both items in that array.

22

00:01:27.810  -->  00:01:32.180
So now to end this cycle I'll take it I don't get prompted again.

23

00:01:32.430  -->  00:01:33.720
So that's our goal here.

24

00:01:34.020  -->  00:01:37.980
Let's go ahead and open up sublime and create the necessary files.

25

00:01:38.700  -->  00:01:39.870
So I have a list.

26

00:01:39.990  -->  00:01:45.280
HMO going to add my boilerplate to do list.

27

00:01:45.960  -->  00:01:55.350
And then inside of here I'm going to go ahead and add in just an H1 to make it clear to do list and

28

00:01:55.350  -->  00:01:57.440
then a few allies.

29

00:01:58.770  -->  00:02:08.580
The first one just so that we remember that commands add a to do and then we're going to have list

30

00:02:11.490  -->  00:02:15.170
lists all to do's.

31

00:02:15.210  -->  00:02:21.590
And then lastly quit which is just to quit.

32

00:02:22.060  -->  00:02:23.220
Save this.

33

00:02:23.250  -->  00:02:27.140
Now let's link in our javascript file which we still need to create.

34

00:02:27.690  -->  00:02:31.600
And I'm going to call that list.

35

00:02:31.640  -->  00:02:38.420
Jay Yes and then I'm going to create that file and save it list that J.S..

36

00:02:39.540  -->  00:02:44.640
And of course like I always like to do I'm going to start by just let's do a console that log this time

37

00:02:45.630  -->  00:02:50.420
connected just to double check that everything worked correctly.

38

00:02:50.430  -->  00:02:54.670
Now let's go open this up in our browser.

39

00:02:55.030  -->  00:02:57.860
Here's a little to do list and we get connected.

40

00:02:58.110  -->  00:02:59.050
Awesome.

41

00:02:59.700  -->  00:03:01.860
Just going to increase the font a little bit here.

42

00:03:01.860  -->  00:03:04.050
Now let's talk about our logic.

43

00:03:04.050  -->  00:03:08.500
So what we're going to do is use an array to model our To Do list.

44

00:03:08.550  -->  00:03:10.010
So we're going to need an.

45

00:03:10.020  -->  00:03:13.440
I'm going to call it to do's and it will start as empty.

46

00:03:14.490  -->  00:03:18.930
And then the next thing we need to do is ask the user for input.

47

00:03:19.110  -->  00:03:26.020
So we'll just call that input var input equals prompt.

48

00:03:26.460  -->  00:03:30.030
What would you like to do.

49

00:03:31.470  -->  00:03:37.000
And then the next step is to just check what input is if input is LIST.

50

00:03:37.020  -->  00:03:41.660
We're going to do one thing if input is new we're going to do something else.

51

00:03:41.700  -->  00:03:50.310
So let's try that if input and let's start by just checking if it's equal to list.

52

00:03:50.700  -->  00:03:58.050
If that's the case we're just going to cancel don't log all to do just like that.

53

00:03:58.860  -->  00:04:08.910
Let's go ahead and add in some to do here and let's add one here by new turtle save and let's check

54

00:04:08.910  -->  00:04:11.040
if this works.

55

00:04:11.040  -->  00:04:13.120
So to check if it works will refresh.

56

00:04:13.320  -->  00:04:19.510
And all we need to do is type list and we should see our array that says buy new turtle.

57

00:04:19.650  -->  00:04:25.530
However if we type something else anything else we don't see anything because our code only runs if

58

00:04:25.530  -->  00:04:27.680
input is equal to list.

59

00:04:28.500  -->  00:04:29.780
So there's that.

60

00:04:29.820  -->  00:04:33.170
The next step is to add another condition.

61

00:04:33.200  -->  00:04:33.730
Let's just do.

62

00:04:33.720  -->  00:04:37.740
Else if input equals new.

63

00:04:38.400  -->  00:04:46.260
And if that's the case we're going to want to ask the user for a new to do ask for new to do add two

64

00:04:46.260  -->  00:04:48.080
to do's array.

65

00:04:48.960  -->  00:04:55.200
So to ask for the new to do we just use prompt for our new to do equals prompt.

66

00:04:56.370  -->  00:05:03.340
Enter new to do and then to add it to the Dewes array we have a lot of options.

67

00:05:03.360  -->  00:05:05.860
I'm going to add it to the end of the array.

68

00:05:05.970  -->  00:05:10.680
So all used to use up push new to do.

69

00:05:10.680  -->  00:05:13.670
So that's all that we need to do here to make this work.

70

00:05:13.680  -->  00:05:20.940
The only issue is that if I run this right now and I try an had a new to do typing new it asks me to

71

00:05:20.940  -->  00:05:29.300
enter a new to do let's do WOC new turtle and if I hit Enter I'm done.

72

00:05:29.700  -->  00:05:32.220
I actually don't have a way of checking if it worked.

73

00:05:32.550  -->  00:05:38.850
I could go over here and type in the console and I can verify OK both of them are here but I don't have

74

00:05:38.850  -->  00:05:42.470
a way of using the list command to print them out.

75

00:05:42.780  -->  00:05:47.390
And that's because right now we're just asking one time what would you like to do.

76

00:05:47.430  -->  00:05:49.990
So the next step is to get this to repeat.

77

00:05:50.130  -->  00:05:55.210
We wanted to keep asking over and over and over until the user types quit.

78

00:05:55.230  -->  00:05:58.750
So hopefully that screams out to you that we should be using a loop.

79

00:05:58.860  -->  00:06:02.200
We want to do something over and over until the condition is true.

80

00:06:02.640  -->  00:06:08.070
So the loop that we want to write is going to be a while loop and the condition is going to be while

81

00:06:08.130  -->  00:06:12.570
input is not equal to quit.

82

00:06:12.780  -->  00:06:17.720
So when it's anything else besides quit we're going to run this code.

83

00:06:18.420  -->  00:06:20.760
And then afterwards I'll come to that blog.

84

00:06:21.070  -->  00:06:27.470
OK you quit the app so that we just see some feedback.

85

00:06:27.630  -->  00:06:31.370
So we'll only see this line once this is done.

86

00:06:31.620  -->  00:06:39.120
So that means the user has typed quick and then inside of here at the bottom we're going to ask again

87

00:06:39.240  -->  00:06:40.420
for new input.

88

00:06:40.690  -->  00:06:45.600
And at the top we're going to handle input.

89

00:06:45.600  -->  00:06:51.540
So we're going to start by asking the user for input one time and then I'm going to move this code into

90

00:06:51.540  -->  00:06:52.020
the loop

91

00:06:55.290  -->  00:06:57.860
just like this.

92

00:06:58.020  -->  00:07:03.950
So I'm going to ask them one time what would you like to do is input equal to quit.

93

00:07:04.050  -->  00:07:05.760
Hopefully they don't quit right away.

94

00:07:05.820  -->  00:07:08.810
But if they do we just get OK you quit.

95

00:07:09.030  -->  00:07:13.850
But if they don't type quit we're going to check to day type list did they type new.

96

00:07:14.280  -->  00:07:22.140
And then the very last thing is that we need to ask again for new input so to ask again for new input

97

00:07:22.140  -->  00:07:22.170
.

98

00:07:22.170  -->  00:07:28.040
All that we need to do is copy this line down just like that.

99

00:07:28.110  -->  00:07:30.440
So I'm going to make this a little bit bigger.

100

00:07:31.590  -->  00:07:38.130
So here we're asking for input again and that will start to loop over and all check is input equal to

101

00:07:38.130  -->  00:07:39.310
quit this time.

102

00:07:39.600  -->  00:07:41.180
Yes then we're done.

103

00:07:41.580  -->  00:07:42.990
So let's try that out.

104

00:07:43.230  -->  00:07:46.590
Going to refresh the page what would you like to do.

105

00:07:47.010  -->  00:07:55.220
Let's do new hires are new to do feed new turtle What would you like to do.

106

00:07:55.260  -->  00:07:57.430
It asked me again first.

107

00:07:57.870  -->  00:08:00.930
So now I have those two to do's inside my to do list.

108

00:08:00.990  -->  00:08:04.810
Now let's try quitting and we get OK.

109

00:08:04.830  -->  00:08:05.800
You quit the app.

110

00:08:06.090  -->  00:08:10.160
So I typed quit this condition suddenly it was true and then we're done.

111

00:08:10.380  -->  00:08:14.760
So let's just form this little bit better and then things properly.

112

00:08:15.150  -->  00:08:17.500
So that's it for our basic to do list for now.

113

00:08:17.700  -->  00:08:22.320
Shortly we're going to add some extra features and some other commands but we need to learn a few new

114

00:08:22.320  -->  00:08:24.140
things about arrays before we can do that.
