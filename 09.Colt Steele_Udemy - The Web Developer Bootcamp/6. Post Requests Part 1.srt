00:00:00,390  -->  00:00:01,300
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01,560  -->  00:00:06,300
In this video we're going to take you through the steps of creating a simple application very very simple

3

00:00:06,570  -->  00:00:12,150
and the goal here is to show you how POST requests work and express how we create routes that are listening

4

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:18,810
for post requests then how we can test them with postman and then see how we can write a form on a different

5

00:00:18,810  -->  00:00:24,100
express template and have that form make a POST request to our express app.

6

00:00:24,180  -->  00:00:29,010
So as I mentioned we are going to make a simple application together and I am going to start from scratch

7

00:00:29,190  -->  00:00:31,380
and install and include Express.

8

00:00:31,380  -->  00:00:34,180
And then we'll get going on the actual application logic.

9

00:00:34,410  -->  00:00:42,990
So I'm going to start now and just make a new directory which I'll call post request demo CD into that

10

00:00:43,830  -->  00:00:56,310
and we'll run NPM in it and we'll just hit enter a few times change entry point.

11

00:00:56,560  -->  00:00:57,310
OK.

12

00:00:57,900  -->  00:00:59,310
There we go.

13

00:00:59,310  -->  00:01:07,010
We have our package that Jason let's now install express dash dash save.

14

00:01:08,580  -->  00:01:14,590
And while we're here let's NPM install E.J. s as well and save that.

15

00:01:15,080  -->  00:01:15,650
OK.

16

00:01:15,870  -->  00:01:17,450
Now let's create our app.

17

00:01:17,510  -->  00:01:18,750
Yes.

18

00:01:19,350  -->  00:01:26,020
And then we will open that up and add in our basic expressed code we need.

19

00:01:26,190  -->  00:01:34,470
So we're going to import it with require and then create an app variable where we execute.

20

00:01:34,470  -->  00:01:45,650
EXPRESS And while we're here we'll also do app does set you engine to be Ejay Yes and I'll save that

21

00:01:45,650  -->  00:01:45,880
.

22

00:01:46,050  -->  00:01:52,650
And then we also do our apt up listen at the bottom instead of here will do you process that.

23

00:01:52,660  -->  00:01:55,630
And we got it.

24

00:01:56,010  -->  00:02:01,750
And to process ENFP IP and our callback function.

25

00:02:01,980  -->  00:02:10,110
And lastly I'll just do a very simple come to the log server started.

26

00:02:10,890  -->  00:02:11,180
OK.

27

00:02:11,190  -->  00:02:12,510
So we have that set up.

28

00:02:12,570  -->  00:02:14,550
Now let's create our brute route

29

00:02:17,400  -->  00:02:26,850
just like that and we'll just render a template for now restaurant render called home just like that

30

00:02:27,270  -->  00:02:28,460
and save.

31

00:02:28,530  -->  00:02:30,020
Now let's make that template.

32

00:02:30,120  -->  00:02:37,650
So we need a used directory make directory views and you need to touch your file views slash home.

33

00:02:37,760  -->  00:02:38,490
Yes.

34

00:02:38,760  -->  00:02:47,540
And then open that file and inside of there we'll do a simple H-1 that says home page just like that

35

00:02:48,390  -->  00:02:49,850
and we'll make sure that works.

36

00:02:50,070  -->  00:02:58,350
So let's run node Apalachee us go back here refresh and we get home page.

37

00:02:58,790  -->  00:03:05,270
OK so we have the basic skeleton set up we have express included we have Ejaz included.

38

00:03:05,340  -->  00:03:09,260
We've set the default view engine and we have our route route.

39

00:03:09,690  -->  00:03:14,730
The app that we're going to make is basically a list of friends or friends list that you can then go

40

00:03:14,730  -->  00:03:18,780
in and through a form you can add a new friend to your list.

41

00:03:18,960  -->  00:03:24,510
And this could be anything friends or to do's or contacts or dogs just something that we're going to

42

00:03:24,510  -->  00:03:28,610
have a list of that we then can create a new one using a form.

43

00:03:28,800  -->  00:03:37,920
So we'll do friends and we're going to add in app and get slash friends and this will be the page the

44

00:03:37,920  -->  00:03:41,410
template that shows a list of friends.

45

00:03:42,990  -->  00:03:48,810
And instead of here are going to do a redstart render and we'll just call it friends and now we need

46

00:03:48,810  -->  00:03:50,120
to create that template.

47

00:03:50,400  -->  00:04:00,430
So we'll do touch views slash friend that Ejay us and then open that file just like that.

48

00:04:00,790  -->  00:04:10,460
And inside of here we'll add another H-1 just right friends list goes here and we'll run our server

49

00:04:11,250  -->  00:04:12,720
make sure that it works.

50

00:04:12,930  -->  00:04:17,290
If we go to slash friends we get friends list goes here.

51

00:04:17,610  -->  00:04:18,270
OK.

52

00:04:18,270  -->  00:04:21,010
So what we're going to do is display a list of friends.

53

00:04:21,210  -->  00:04:22,890
And so we need to create that list.

54

00:04:22,890  -->  00:04:23,970
We need the data.

55

00:04:24,210  -->  00:04:32,320
So I'm going to create an array of friends names and it's going to be very simple just far friends equals

56

00:04:33,030  -->  00:04:46,080
and we'll just add in a few names here like Tony and Justin Pierre and Lilly.

57

00:04:46,290  -->  00:04:46,860
OK.

58

00:04:47,140  -->  00:04:52,450
So we have an array of friends and then we're going to pass that array of friends through to our friends

59

00:04:52,450  -->  00:04:57,580
template where we'll then loop through and display each friend as a list item.

60

00:04:57,640  -->  00:04:59,220
So we need to pass that in.

61

00:04:59,300  -->  00:05:02,770
Remember it's an object and we have two things need to do.

62

00:05:02,770  -->  00:05:09,340
We need to give it a name or a property that we'll use to look it up in the view which I would just

63

00:05:09,340  -->  00:05:15,040
call friends and our data that we're passing in as also friends which is confusing when you're just

64

00:05:15,040  -->  00:05:15,730
starting out.

65

00:05:15,760  -->  00:05:20,800
But this is what you'll see most often where you just use the same name but remember this can be anything

66

00:05:20,800  -->  00:05:21,560
at all.

67

00:05:21,580  -->  00:05:24,810
And this refers to our friend array right here.

68

00:05:25,150  -->  00:05:31,560
OK so now let's go to the template friend study genius and add in our loop and I'm going to do a for

69

00:05:31,560  -->  00:05:32,070
each.

70

00:05:32,290  -->  00:05:36,690
So I'll just write the regular javascript first without the brackets without the Ejay us.

71

00:05:36,820  -->  00:05:47,380
So we have friends for each function and our function will take friend parameter there and then we have

72

00:05:47,470  -->  00:05:50,760
our opening closing curly braces just like that.

73

00:05:50,920  -->  00:05:59,230
And instead of here what we'll do is make an ally for each one that says I have a friend just like that

74

00:05:59,230  -->  00:05:59,620
.

75

00:05:59,610  -->  00:06:05,870
Now let's go back and add in the phrases that we need no equal sign or remember this is just for logic

76

00:06:05,880  -->  00:06:06,120
.

77

00:06:06,280  -->  00:06:09,800
We don't want anything to show up on these two lines.

78

00:06:09,970  -->  00:06:16,330
So we have that done and if we save and refresh we should see an ally that says I have a friend for

79

00:06:16,330  -->  00:06:21,640
every friend in that list and let's try that out make sure we don't have any errors.

80

00:06:21,880  -->  00:06:26,890
Refresh the page and we get 5 list items that say I have a friend.

81

00:06:27,530  -->  00:06:32,130
Now we'll go back again and rather than just saying I have a friend let's actually print the friend's

82

00:06:32,140  -->  00:06:32,690
name.

83

00:06:32,950  -->  00:06:39,110
So this time we do need the equal sign because we want the value that evaluated to be added to the team

84

00:06:39,250  -->  00:06:40,620
itself right here.

85

00:06:40,750  -->  00:06:47,570
We want it to be replaced with the value of a friend which is coming from right here in our for each

86

00:06:47,570  -->  00:06:47,750
.

87

00:06:47,740  -->  00:06:49,140
Again this can be anything.

88

00:06:49,140  -->  00:06:50,620
Name it whatever we want x.

89

00:06:50,720  -->  00:06:54,010
And if it put X here it will work.

90

00:06:54,430  -->  00:07:01,300
So let me just show you that refresh and we get our five friends and because X is a terrible variable

91

00:07:01,300  -->  00:07:07,090
name many go back to friend just like that to restart the server.

92

00:07:07,120  -->  00:07:10,690
One more time and you can see nothing changes.

93

00:07:10,690  -->  00:07:12,910
OK so we have this list of friends.

94

00:07:13,060  -->  00:07:16,880
Now what we're going to do is talk about setting up the post route.

95

00:07:17,110  -->  00:07:22,840
The goal in the end is to have a form at the bottom of this page and we can type in a name into that

96

00:07:22,840  -->  00:07:27,760
form and hit the submit button and it will then add a new friend to our list.

97

00:07:27,790  -->  00:07:33,340
So we'll be pushing a new name into the Friends array and then rendering this template again which will

98

00:07:33,340  -->  00:07:37,250
then add a new bullet point and new list item for that newly added friend.

99

00:07:37,390  -->  00:07:43,000
We need to start by setting up a post-road and remember that we use a post Strout any time we are adding

100

00:07:43,000  -->  00:07:47,770
data to something when we're sending data through and we want to add it to the database whether we're

101

00:07:47,770  -->  00:07:53,800
signing up a user or we're creating a new comment or creating a new post or in this case a new friend

102

00:07:54,540  -->  00:07:55,400
a post route.

103

00:07:55,420  -->  00:07:59,390
Is what makes the most sense although it isn't the only option.

104

00:07:59,530  -->  00:08:02,120
For now we're going to treat it as if it is the only option.

105

00:08:02,140  -->  00:08:08,260
So get it's just for retrieving information and a post is for sending new data to be added or to be

106

00:08:08,260  -->  00:08:10,810
used somehow on the server side.

107

00:08:11,140  -->  00:08:18,790
And all we need to write is apt up post and the name of the route let's call it add friend just like

108

00:08:18,790  -->  00:08:26,290
that and it looks the same with the request and response and we'll leave it as this for now.

109

00:08:26,410  -->  00:08:31,770
And inside we'll just do a rest up send We won't make a template just RES dot send.

110

00:08:32,080  -->  00:08:41,040
You have reached the post route just like that.

111

00:08:41,080  -->  00:08:46,930
So now let's see if we can trigger this out if we can hit it add friend as a post request by using postman

112

00:08:47,030  -->  00:08:47,820
.

113

00:08:47,950  -->  00:08:55,090
So I'm going to take this URL and copy this over to postman and where we want to make a request.

114

00:08:55,090  -->  00:09:00,880
We can start by just doing sosh friends as a get request and you see we get back each team him with

115

00:09:00,880  -->  00:09:02,270
the five friends.

116

00:09:02,270  -->  00:09:08,970
But now let's make a post request and we're making it to slash add friend.

117

00:09:09,550  -->  00:09:15,130
And now if we send a post request we get a message can not post add friend and that's for a silly reason

118

00:09:15,150  -->  00:09:15,290
.

119

00:09:15,400  -->  00:09:18,490
We need to restart the server any time we add a new route.

120

00:09:18,850  -->  00:09:22,770
And now if we go back and send the request again we get a message.

121

00:09:22,930  -->  00:09:24,740
You have reached the post route.

122

00:09:24,820  -->  00:09:29,380
So we're sending in post request and we're doing it through postman rather than using a form but it's

123

00:09:29,380  -->  00:09:31,010
the same exact idea.

124

00:09:31,030  -->  00:09:32,130
It works the same way.

125

00:09:32,170  -->  00:09:36,650
We send a post request and this code is being run right here.

126

00:09:36,710  -->  00:09:42,300
OK so the next thing that we want to do is use a form to send that post request.

127

00:09:42,430  -->  00:09:48,960
So I'm going to go to the friends study each page and at the bottom a lot of form and this form will

128

00:09:48,970  -->  00:09:51,320
submit to that route.

129

00:09:51,670  -->  00:09:54,390
So remember there are two important attributes.

130

00:09:54,440  -->  00:09:57,900
There is action and then method.

131

00:09:58,540  -->  00:09:59,790
So let's start with method.

132

00:09:59,920  -->  00:10:06,780
We want to send a post request and action is the you are a whole which is slash and friend.

133

00:10:07,420  -->  00:10:10,700
And again that needs to match this rate here.

134

00:10:10,990  -->  00:10:13,440
Slash add friend as a post.

135

00:10:13,910  -->  00:10:14,620
All right.

136

00:10:14,620  -->  00:10:22,330
And instead of here we're going to have a single input type equals text and then we also want to have

137

00:10:22,330  -->  00:10:25,880
a placeholder that says name or whatever we want to put there.

138

00:10:25,900  -->  00:10:31,540
That's just the placeholder text and then we'll also add a button at the end and this will just say

00:10:32,260  -->  00:10:37,180
I made a new friend and save that.

140

00:10:37,890  -->  00:10:40,320
And so this will create a form for us right now.

141

00:10:40,690  -->  00:10:46,930
If I restart the server and I go back and I refresh the page I now have a form here and if we inspect

142

00:10:46,930  -->  00:10:54,430
it it has those two attributes where we have action it's ADD friend method is post and it has a single

143

00:10:54,430  -->  00:10:55,090
input.

144

00:10:55,420  -->  00:11:00,150
And if I type something into here I made a new friend today named Bob and they click.

145

00:11:00,160  -->  00:11:02,500
I made a new friend.

146

00:11:02,770  -->  00:11:04,560
You can see that we're getting that response.

147

00:11:04,570  -->  00:11:09,070
You have reached the post route which means that we are sending a post request and that we're sending

148

00:11:09,070  -->  00:11:09,980
it to the right place.

149

00:11:10,030  -->  00:11:14,140
Slash add friend but we're not doing anything in that route.

150

00:11:14,140  -->  00:11:19,570
Aside from responding with this message and what we actually want to do is take the data from the form

151

00:11:19,920  -->  00:11:21,240
you want to take Bob.

152

00:11:21,430  -->  00:11:25,990
And then we want to add it to the friends array and then we want the user to come back to this page

153

00:11:26,080  -->  00:11:28,060
where they can see Bob as new bullet point
