00:00:00.350  -->  00:00:03.240
This video I have a fun and quick challenge for you.

2

00:00:03.300  -->  00:00:09.540
So on this event reference page there are a ton of events as we saw in the last video and I want to

3

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:11.550
know exactly how many are here.

4

00:00:11.790  -->  00:00:17.610
And I definitely don't want you to count manually so write javascript code to figure out how many of

5

00:00:17.610  -->  00:00:20.550
these events exist on this page.

6

00:00:20.730  -->  00:00:24.660
So I recommend that you just open up the console and start typing some stuff in here.

7

00:00:24.990  -->  00:00:29.990
And the hint that you'll get is that each event is one of these elements.

8

00:00:29.990  -->  00:00:35.520
Whatever these are I don't know what these are but whatever each one of these is corresponds to a separate

9

00:00:35.520  -->  00:00:36.560
event on this page.

10

00:00:36.660  -->  00:00:38.720
So count how many of these there are.

11

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:41.940
So this problem is a great use for the javascript con..

12

00:00:42.000  -->  00:00:47.430
It covers a lot of the stuff that we've been talking about selecting and looping through things.

13

00:00:47.430  -->  00:00:50.850
So go ahead and give this a shot on your own positive video if you need to.

14

00:00:50.850  -->  00:00:52.120
And then I'll go for solution.

15

00:00:52.140  -->  00:00:54.710
And just a moment.

16

00:00:56.520  -->  00:00:58.930
OK so let's talk about how we could find this out.

17

00:00:58.980  -->  00:01:01.320
How many events are on this page.

18

00:01:01.320  -->  00:01:04.060
My first instinct would be to inspect.

19

00:01:04.260  -->  00:01:05.830
So let's take a look.

20

00:01:05.850  -->  00:01:06.860
These are Tweedy's.

21

00:01:06.860  -->  00:01:07.790
It looks like.

22

00:01:08.210  -->  00:01:09.880
So we have one T.T. there.

23

00:01:10.130  -->  00:01:10.420
OK.

24

00:01:10.430  -->  00:01:12.750
So each event is its own.

25

00:01:12.750  -->  00:01:15.360
TR So you can see.

26

00:01:15.840  -->  00:01:17.350
So that's one event.

27

00:01:17.430  -->  00:01:24.270
This is the next event which is inside of a TR so we can do is just count the number of tiers on this

28

00:01:24.270  -->  00:01:25.080
page.

29

00:01:25.080  -->  00:01:28.680
The problem is there might be some other tables that we don't know about.

30

00:01:28.680  -->  00:01:34.410
So let's see let's do a query selector all.

31

00:01:34.410  -->  00:01:36.300
TR Well let's even just do table.

32

00:01:36.360  -->  00:01:38.920
Let's see how many tables are on the page.

33

00:01:39.000  -->  00:01:41.970
Forgot document.

34

00:01:41.970  -->  00:01:43.160
We have one table here.

35

00:01:43.200  -->  00:01:48.290
OK that looks good we have another table down below where is this one.

36

00:01:49.350  -->  00:01:51.330
Let's see.

37

00:01:52.900  -->  00:01:53.270
OK.

38

00:01:53.280  -->  00:01:54.450
Non-standard events.

39

00:01:54.450  -->  00:01:55.490
OK that's right.

40

00:01:55.530  -->  00:01:57.500
We also want to count those.

41

00:01:58.440  -->  00:02:03.220
And then we also want to count this table which we also got correct.

42

00:02:03.270  -->  00:02:06.930
And this one and then is a table at the bottom.

43

00:02:06.960  -->  00:02:08.830
So these are all the events that we want.

44

00:02:09.120  -->  00:02:14.200
So now that we figured out that the only tables on the page are the ones that we care about.

45

00:02:14.220  -->  00:02:18.430
I was worried they could be using a table over here on the nav bar or somewhere up here.

46

00:02:18.480  -->  00:02:24.180
But it turns out the only tables on the page and therefore the only team is on the page are relevant

47

00:02:24.180  -->  00:02:25.020
to this problem.

48

00:02:25.050  -->  00:02:32.640
They contain these events so we want to do now is select documents or queries like you're all TR And

49

00:02:32.640  -->  00:02:36.410
that would give us all the yours says 306.

50

00:02:36.750  -->  00:02:42.530
So let's open up the first one and we can see these correspond to the individual events.

51

00:02:42.540  -->  00:02:48.660
There is one small problem which is the very first TR is actually the headers here.

52

00:02:48.990  -->  00:02:57.720
So we would have to exclude one from this table and then we have this table down here that also has

53

00:02:57.780  -->  00:02:59.700
headers so we need to exclude that one.

54

00:02:59.850  -->  00:03:06.330
So for every table there's one two three four five really need to subtract five rows because we don't

55

00:03:06.330  -->  00:03:07.940
want these here.

56

00:03:08.310  -->  00:03:14.220
So to figure out how many events are on this page we just need to get the length of all the tiaras So

57

00:03:14.220  -->  00:03:16.170
that list that is returned.

58

00:03:16.500  -->  00:03:18.980
This one here I need to figure out how long that is.

59

00:03:18.990  -->  00:03:22.160
So document queries like your all TR length.

60

00:03:22.430  -->  00:03:26.290
And that gives us $360 on this page.

61

00:03:26.310  -->  00:03:32.270
The only thing we have to exclude those five headers so we could do it like this minus 5.

62

00:03:32.760  -->  00:03:34.600
And that gives us 301.

63

00:03:34.890  -->  00:03:40.160
However that is a little bit hard coded because we're assuming there's always five tables.

64

00:03:40.380  -->  00:03:46.200
What if they added a sixth table of events this would be accounting for all the TR is on the page but

65

00:03:46.200  -->  00:03:47.810
we would still be subtracting 5.

66

00:03:48.000  -->  00:03:53.040
So what we actually want to subtract is the length of how many tables are on the page.

67

00:03:53.160  -->  00:03:57.210
So for every table there is one TR that has the headings on it.

68

00:03:57.540  -->  00:04:02.520
So it will look like this document that queries Lechter all TR hotlink minus.

69

00:04:02.520  -->  00:04:04.550
Document that query selector.

70

00:04:04.920  -->  00:04:10.440
All tables are table hotlink.

71

00:04:11.100  -->  00:04:14.050
And that also gives us three hundred and one.

72

00:04:14.070  -->  00:04:19.890
So this exercise serves two purposes one just to get more practice using the console selecting things

73

00:04:19.900  -->  00:04:20.090
.

74

00:04:20.340  -->  00:04:25.560
And the second one is to show you that there are a ton of events out there way way more than you'll

75

00:04:25.560  -->  00:04:26.440
ever need to use.

76

00:04:26.460  -->  00:04:27.380
But it's good to be aware.

77

00:04:27.380  -->  00:04:32.760
There's apparently 301 but like I said a few years ago it's a pretty small world.

78

00:04:32.760  -->  00:04:36.860
Most of the time you'll use about 10 maybe 15.

79

00:04:37.050  -->  00:04:38.550
But there are apparently 301
