00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:01.740
Hear they're welcome back.

2

00:00:02.070  -->  00:00:06.180
So in this unit we're making probably my favorite thing ever.

3

00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:08.630
It's this simple but fun toy.

4

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:15.170
Using animation and an animation library some graphics some audio and audio library.

5

00:00:15.270  -->  00:00:20.970
And we're going to make a simple simple clone of that pad a tap app that I showed you early on where

6

00:00:21.150  -->  00:00:29.220
you can hit keys on your keyboard and each key corresponds to a sound that is played and a little animation

7

00:00:29.340  -->  00:00:30.700
and are just going to be simple.

8

00:00:30.720  -->  00:00:32.390
We're not going to have a bunch of different animations.

9

00:00:32.400  -->  00:00:33.700
I'll show you what it looks like.

10

00:00:33.840  -->  00:00:35.690
Every key has its own sound.

11

00:00:35.850  -->  00:00:41.370
And when I hit that key the sound is played and we get a colored circle through every key has its own

12

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:43.710
color and then the circles animate.

13

00:00:43.710  -->  00:00:44.900
They basically shrink down.

14

00:00:44.910  -->  00:00:54.990
So I'll show you what I mean and turn it up a bit.

15

00:00:55.640  -->  00:00:59.560
We're going to make this movie isn't the same sound here.

16

00:00:59.610  -->  00:01:02.370
Yes it's pretty fun but.

17

00:01:02.400  -->  00:01:06.190
But the reason that we're doing this is not just because it's a fun project.

18

00:01:06.390  -->  00:01:11.870
We're doing it because we have to use libraries here and we're going to use two libraries and mentioned

19

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:15.310
one is called Paper genius and another is called How they're genius.

20

00:01:15.720  -->  00:01:20.760
And I just want you to see what the process is like when you incorporate a library into your code.

21

00:01:20.760  -->  00:01:26.460
And whenever I'm writing curriculum whether it's for an evening course or a six month or a three month

22

00:01:26.460  -->  00:01:32.820
course or an online course I always make sure that there's some there's some project or some assignment

23

00:01:32.850  -->  00:01:39.330
that forces students to do a little bit of digging into the docks of a library or figuring out how to

24

00:01:39.330  -->  00:01:42.810
incorporate some external code into their own app.

25

00:01:42.810  -->  00:01:48.570
And I usually try and make it into something that's kind of fun sort of a toy maybe or a cool interactive

26

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:49.210
demo.

27

00:01:49.320  -->  00:01:55.260
So I've done things with audio before with animations but also with the webcam and face tracking and

28

00:01:55.260  -->  00:01:56.640
head tracking.

29

00:01:56.820  -->  00:02:01.050
There are libraries that can do pretty much anything now with the browser it's it's really impressive

30

00:02:01.050  -->  00:02:01.420
.

31

00:02:01.440  -->  00:02:03.750
This one though is really fun.

32

00:02:03.990  -->  00:02:10.380
Again we're taking two libraries Paperchase and how lurgy as we use paperchase to help out with graphics

33

00:02:10.380  -->  00:02:11.490
and animations.

34

00:02:11.790  -->  00:02:15.330
So they have some really really fun examples.

35

00:02:15.480  -->  00:02:23.490
If you click on Showcase actually and on paper Jasc dot showcase they show you some real use cases where

36

00:02:23.490  -->  00:02:27.110
people have used paper just in the wilds of clear cut examples.

37

00:02:27.270  -->  00:02:32.930
There's some fun toys I really love this one here can probably play with this for hours.

38

00:02:33.060  -->  00:02:36.910
Something is just very relaxing about this to me.

39

00:02:37.260  -->  00:02:40.360
So fun things that we can do with paperchase.

40

00:02:40.470  -->  00:02:48.210
Again anything that Paperchase does we can do on our own without Paperchase but it's a lot of work.

41

00:02:48.360  -->  00:02:50.460
So I'll show you what I mean.

42

00:02:50.460  -->  00:02:51.680
The code here.

43

00:02:51.690  -->  00:02:57.990
So I hit a key in this case the letter P to make that circle and to shrink it down like that to do that

44

00:02:57.990  -->  00:03:01.830
animation and also notice it it changes color a little bit.

45

00:03:02.040  -->  00:03:05.970
I don't know if you can see that but it goes from purple or blue down to purple.

46

00:03:06.060  -->  00:03:09.870
Or if I do another one this goes from yellow down to green.

47

00:03:10.200  -->  00:03:16.890
That animation and that transition without paper J us might be 50 lines.

48

00:03:17.040  -->  00:03:19.920
Maybe we could get by with 20 or so lines with paper.

49

00:03:19.950  -->  00:03:20.280
Yes.

50

00:03:20.280  -->  00:03:21.550
It's less than five.

51

00:03:21.690  -->  00:03:23.240
It's really really simple.

52

00:03:23.250  -->  00:03:26.960
Same thing with Hausler so howler helps us play audio.

53

00:03:27.120  -->  00:03:33.030
We can do all of this without however just like we can do all of J queery everything that it does and

54

00:03:33.030  -->  00:03:37.940
we can get by without j queery it just often means that we have to write more code.

55

00:03:38.070  -->  00:03:43.230
So this plays a sound Here's an example we're going to do something very similar to this where we're

56

00:03:43.230  -->  00:03:48.090
just going to play a sound when you hit a key and each key has its own unique sound so I'm hitting q

57

00:03:48.700  -->  00:03:57.070
q always plays that noise and it always is that light blue color transition to a darker blue.

58

00:03:57.120  -->  00:04:02.520
One last note is that the circles are in a random respond in a random location every time you press

59

00:04:02.520  -->  00:04:03.390
that key.

60

00:04:03.510  -->  00:04:09.300
So the location is not set doesn't correspond to the key just the color and the sound that's played

61

00:04:09.320  -->  00:04:09.710
.

62

00:04:10.180  -->  00:04:11.430
Okay great.

63

00:04:11.430  -->  00:04:13.560
So in the next video we'll get started.

64

00:04:13.560  -->  00:04:18.580
One thing I do want to point out before we get started is that all of these sound that you hear play

65

00:04:19.080  -->  00:04:21.670
them all really.

66

00:04:23.630  -->  00:04:26.940
Yes some really nice sounds.

67

00:04:27.060  -->  00:04:29.560
We actually can use them in this project together.

68

00:04:29.970  -->  00:04:31.600
I've included them as a download.

69

00:04:31.770  -->  00:04:36.660
I'll show you here if you download the sound zip file.

70

00:04:36.690  -->  00:04:37.740
There's a bunch of sounds.

71

00:04:37.740  -->  00:04:40.260
Twenty something sounds in that file.

72

00:04:40.290  -->  00:04:44.550
So there's some really nice sounds there and we actually can use all of those.

73

00:04:44.580  -->  00:04:46.970
They're from an open source project and ghetto.

74

00:04:47.310  -->  00:04:52.270
It's actually what patta tap uses or what Pedda tap actually is.

75

00:04:52.590  -->  00:04:54.680
It's this neuronal synchrony on get her.

76

00:04:54.690  -->  00:04:58.900
So it has animations if you want to look at those animations that we're not going to do.

77

00:04:58.970  -->  00:05:02.410
So a lot more complex but it also has all the sounds.

78

00:05:02.640  -->  00:05:08.730
So what I did is I just took the sound from this a folder right here all of these sounds and I zipped

79

00:05:08.730  -->  00:05:09.570
them together.

80

00:05:09.570  -->  00:05:14.330
There are a lot more if you want to choose different sounds you can go to get haven't download this

81

00:05:14.760  -->  00:05:19.160
but I like the sounds that are in that a folder.

82

00:05:19.330  -->  00:05:21.750
Also point out the license here.

83

00:05:21.750  -->  00:05:25.030
We can use it MIT license take a look at it if you like.

84

00:05:25.320  -->  00:05:29.790
Really nice sound so I'm not sure who made them if the creator here made them.

85

00:05:29.790  -->  00:05:33.690
But there's some really really good sounds that we'll be using and they're identical to what patta tap

86

00:05:33.690  -->  00:05:34.250
uses.

87

00:05:34.410  -->  00:05:35.620
So download those.

88

00:05:35.640  -->  00:05:38.600
It looks like this just a directory with a bunch of sounds.

89

00:05:38.640  -->  00:05:40.860
And we'll be using that in the next few lessons.

90

00:05:41.160  -->  00:05:46.970
So we go ahead and get started in the next video and I'll just leave you the last few seconds here and

91

00:05:46.990  -->  00:05:50.010
make something on this CD

92

00:05:57.320  -->  00:06:03.370
.
