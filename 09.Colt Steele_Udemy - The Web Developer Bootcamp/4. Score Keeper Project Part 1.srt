1

00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:01,340
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01,590  -->  00:00:08,000
So up until now everything we've been doing around events and event listeners in the dorm and dominant

3

00:00:08,030  -->  00:00:13,620
relation and dumps the letters we've just been doing one off quick exercises that don't really amount

4

00:00:13,620  -->  00:00:14,330
to much.

5

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:17,940
And that was just to kind of show individual pieces how they worked.

6

00:00:17,940  -->  00:00:22,140
Now we're going to see how they all fit together and make a somewhat substantial app.

7

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:25,700
So as you can see this is not the most beautiful app that's coming.

8

00:00:25,710  -->  00:00:31,020
We're just focusing on how conceptually the pieces fit together here how we take events how we select

9

00:00:31,020  -->  00:00:34,490
elements how we write aged him how and how those all fit together.

10

00:00:34,500  -->  00:00:35,820
Styling is just extra.

11

00:00:35,820  -->  00:00:37,740
At this point but in the next project we make.

12

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:41,120
We are going to place a lot of focus on styling and making it look nice.

13

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:42,050
I promise.

14

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:45,490
So what we're going to make is a simple scorekeeping app.

15

00:00:45,570  -->  00:00:50,520
So I want you to think back to all those times that you've been playing rock paper scissors with a friend

16

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:56,940
or ping pong or tic tac toe and it's just so tiring to keep track of the score and so difficult to know

17

00:00:56,940  -->  00:01:00,510
who's winning when this app is for you the way that it works.

18

00:01:00,600  -->  00:01:03,750
Two players player 1 score player to score.

19

00:01:03,750  -->  00:01:07,180
You load up the page and it tells us we're playing to five.

20

00:01:07,260  -->  00:01:10,950
And so all we do is add a point by clicking on a button.

21

00:01:10,950  -->  00:01:16,950
So to add a point to player 1 we click on Player 1 if we want to add a point player to click on Player

22

00:01:16,960  -->  00:01:20,070
2 and then whoever gets to five.

23

00:01:20,580  -->  00:01:22,010
You notice it turns green.

24

00:01:22,260  -->  00:01:25,180
And if I try and score again I can't.

25

00:01:25,350  -->  00:01:26,730
That's because the game is over.

26

00:01:26,970  -->  00:01:29,760
So I can reset by clicking the reset button.

27

00:01:30,090  -->  00:01:36,420
And now a top player two totally sweep and that's it we can't play anymore.

28

00:01:36,420  -->  00:01:37,850
And that quick reset.

29

00:01:37,860  -->  00:01:42,080
So one more feature is that we can also specify what we're playing to.

30

00:01:42,180  -->  00:01:48,000
So if you want to have a game that goes until 7:00 I can use this number input here and then all I have

31

00:01:48,000  -->  00:01:56,730
to do is let's make this a closer game and player one just sneaks by at the end 4:53 and the game ends

32

00:01:56,730  -->  00:02:02,500
at 7 and player 1 turns green and we can't add any more points and then we can reset again.

33

00:02:02,850  -->  00:02:04,570
So that's what we're going to focus on building here.

34

00:02:04,650  -->  00:02:09,660
So the first thing we want to do is get our file set up and then create the H team L structure and then

35

00:02:09,660  -->  00:02:12,410
we'll go in with javascript and make things work.

36

00:02:12,420  -->  00:02:14,390
So let's go ahead and get started.

37

00:02:15,090  -->  00:02:16,890
So I have a blank I'll document.

38

00:02:16,920  -->  00:02:24,390
I'm calling it scorekeeper dot h Timo going to add in our boilerplate and give it a title just like

39

00:02:24,390  -->  00:02:25,580
that.

40

00:02:25,910  -->  00:02:28,960
I then must start by talking about what we're looking at here.

41

00:02:28,980  -->  00:02:33,650
So this isn't H-1 H1 and we will be changing this eventually.

42

00:02:33,660  -->  00:02:40,110
We don't want it just to be a solid h one because there's two things inside of this H-1 it needs to

43

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:47,190
be like Player 1 score 2 player to score but we need to be able to select this separately from this

44

00:02:47,190  -->  00:02:47,560
.

45

00:02:47,580  -->  00:02:51,610
So we do want a way to divide this H1 into smaller pieces.

46

00:02:51,780  -->  00:02:54,020
So we'll see how we can do that in just a little bit.

47

00:02:54,030  -->  00:02:59,090
So next this is a paragraph you're playing to.

48

00:02:59,100  -->  00:03:01,440
And let's just right playing to seven to start.

49

00:03:01,590  -->  00:03:02,310
Or let's do five.

50

00:03:02,310  -->  00:03:04,240
I think that how had it.

51

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:05,830
And then we have an input here.

52

00:03:05,880  -->  00:03:10,050
This is input type equals number.

53

00:03:10,090  -->  00:03:14,920
So input type equals number and that's all we need.

54

00:03:15,000  -->  00:03:17,470
And then we have our first button.

55

00:03:17,880  -->  00:03:23,290
Player 1 or second button player 2.

56

00:03:23,490  -->  00:03:27,480
And our last button reset.

57

00:03:27,480  -->  00:03:33,300
So if we refresh this page and now we open up our own page that we created.

58

00:03:33,360  -->  00:03:35,780
Let's take a look.

59

00:03:35,820  -->  00:03:37,370
They look pretty much the same.

60

00:03:37,410  -->  00:03:41,040
Zoom in a little bit on this one that looks just right.

61

00:03:41,040  -->  00:03:43,560
Of course nothing happens when we click on anything.

62

00:03:43,560  -->  00:03:46,260
So now let's go in at our javascript in.

63

00:03:46,980  -->  00:03:55,020
So I'm going to create a new file I'm going to call it scorekeeper J.S. and like I always do or add

64

00:03:55,020  -->  00:03:58,940
my alert here that is connected.

65

00:03:59,290  -->  00:04:05,070
Then I'm going to go over to scorekeepers or h t m l and include my script and I'm going to do it at

66

00:04:05,070  -->  00:04:06,160
the bottom here to start.

67

00:04:06,160  -->  00:04:11,820
So script type calls javascript source equals scorekeeper.

68

00:04:11,970  -->  00:04:14,110
Yes just like that.

69

00:04:14,140  -->  00:04:15,290
Now if we refresh.

70

00:04:15,360  -->  00:04:20,550
This is my version of the page it tells me javascript alert connected.

71

00:04:20,670  -->  00:04:21,310
All right.

72

00:04:21,540  -->  00:04:23,090
So we have our e-mail set up.

73

00:04:23,100  -->  00:04:24,260
It looks great.

74

00:04:24,300  -->  00:04:28,740
What we need to do now is get some javascript code that actually add some functionality.

75

00:04:28,830  -->  00:04:32,800
And as always we need to start by selecting the different elements.

76

00:04:32,820  -->  00:04:37,500
So let's start by selecting the buttons and let's just do the player one and player or two buttons and

77

00:04:37,500  -->  00:04:42,380
the first feature we'll focus on is when we click one of these buttons the score should increment up

78

00:04:42,380  -->  00:04:43,660
here.

79

00:04:43,770  -->  00:04:50,590
So all we need to do is start by selecting that player one button and if we look it's just a button

80

00:04:50,930  -->  00:04:59,470
we may want to add in ID so we'll call this one and done here we'll add one for P2 and then we can also

81

00:04:59,470  -->  00:05:02,190
add one for the reset that we'll just call reset.

82

00:05:02,350  -->  00:05:03,880
So we have three ideas now.

83

00:05:04,030  -->  00:05:05,620
So it's much easier to select.

84

00:05:05,770  -->  00:05:12,410
We'll just call it VIP one button equals document query selector.

85

00:05:12,520  -->  00:05:14,490
Or we could do get element by ID.

86

00:05:14,530  -->  00:05:20,830
I will mix them up here so the first one will do with query selector P1 and then P2.

87

00:05:20,830  -->  00:05:29,530
Button will be document dot and we'll do get element by id and we don't need that Octa Thorpe anymore

88

00:05:29,530  -->  00:05:30,000
.

89

00:05:30,130  -->  00:05:32,030
So that gives us the two buttons.

90

00:05:32,500  -->  00:05:37,990
And let's just set up our first listener when we click on this first button will alert or cancel that

91

00:05:37,990  -->  00:05:39,010
log something.

92

00:05:39,400  -->  00:05:49,160
So we want to write P1 button and add event listener on click and then we add our function here.

93

00:05:49,390  -->  00:05:56,870
And inside that function we're just going to alert alert clicked and that's it.

94

00:05:57,610  -->  00:06:04,390
So if you refresh our page and retry clicking great that tells us we selected correctly and we added

95

00:06:04,390  -->  00:06:06,500
our listener for the Click event correctly.

96

00:06:06,640  -->  00:06:11,900
Player 2 though doesn't do anything because we only added that to the player 1 button.

97

00:06:12,790  -->  00:06:15,490
So now let's talk about how this will actually work.

98

00:06:15,550  -->  00:06:20,950
When I click here we need to have some variable that's called Player 1 score or something that keeps

99

00:06:20,950  -->  00:06:22,040
track of how many points.

100

00:06:22,040  -->  00:06:28,770
Player one has and I click it should add one to player 1 score and then the last part is updating this

101

00:06:28,780  -->  00:06:31,180
here to reflect player 1 score.

102

00:06:31,420  -->  00:06:36,790
So I'm going to make a variable let's just call it 1 score and set it to be zero to start.

103

00:06:37,180  -->  00:06:43,180
And then all I want to do is when we click we'll start but just always adding one to the player 1 score

104

00:06:43,200  -->  00:06:43,480
.

105

00:06:43,810  -->  00:06:47,760
So that will just be the one score plus plus.

106

00:06:47,860  -->  00:06:49,080
Just like that.

107

00:06:49,630  -->  00:06:54,620
And we refresh and we didn't see anything because we should probably cancel that log.

108

00:06:54,750  -->  00:06:58,350
He won score first rather than alert.

109

00:06:58,440  -->  00:07:04,180
It gets very annoying very fast if we refresh now and open up the console and McCook player 1 score

110

00:07:04,490  -->  00:07:05,110
and see how it goes.

111

00:07:05,130  -->  00:07:09,910
One two three four five and it's going to keep going.

112

00:07:10,480  -->  00:07:11,860
So there's a few problems.

113

00:07:11,860  -->  00:07:17,030
One is we're not displaying the score here and two it says we're playing to five.

114

00:07:17,170  -->  00:07:21,190
And that's obviously not the case because we're just incrementing it as much as we want.

115

00:07:21,340  -->  00:07:26,940
So we need to have some logic that says if greater than five game over or something like that.

116

00:07:27,190  -->  00:07:31,570
But let's start by figuring out how we can update this H1.

117

00:07:31,660  -->  00:07:34,480
So what we could do is just select the H-1 to start.

118

00:07:34,660  -->  00:07:37,260
So let's just call it far.

119

00:07:37,460  -->  00:07:45,300
H1 equals document that queries selector H-1 just like that.

120

00:07:45,610  -->  00:07:56,890
And then inside of here we'll just say H-1 dot text content equals one score just like that.

121

00:07:56,950  -->  00:08:01,730
So we're going to take this one and change the text content to be whatever the score is that we were

122

00:08:01,960  -->  00:08:02,720
without logging.

123

00:08:02,920  -->  00:08:09,640
And if I score here well that sort of works but you can see that we completely overrode everything that

124

00:08:09,640  -->  00:08:10,790
was inside of each one.

125

00:08:10,870  -->  00:08:14,730
We want to keep the two and the other score.

126

00:08:14,800  -->  00:08:17,220
We just want to change this one number.

127

00:08:17,380  -->  00:08:22,840
So there's a way of doing that using some extra h to a male that makes her life a lot easier if we go

128

00:08:22,840  -->  00:08:27,640
back to our scorekeeper but each time l we're going to introduce a span element.

129

00:08:27,640  -->  00:08:32,870
And the way that the span will work is that it will only wrap around the number the score.

130

00:08:33,370  -->  00:08:37,300
So what that means is we can now if I inspect this.

131

00:08:37,300  -->  00:08:39,940
Nothing looks like it changes and that's the point of a span.

132

00:08:40,060  -->  00:08:46,390
It's just day nonintrusive if you will it's just a way to wrap something with some tag that you can

133

00:08:46,390  -->  00:08:52,090
then use later or styled differently or select with javascript which is exactly what we'll do if we

134

00:08:52,090  -->  00:08:58,280
look for H-1 but right here we now have a special span wrapping that number.

135

00:08:58,300  -->  00:09:05,080
So if we select that span and change that span only We'll still have the tío and our spacing correctly

136

00:09:05,110  -->  00:09:06,460
and the other score.

137

00:09:06,460  -->  00:09:10,660
So we want to select that span and going to again just do an ID here.

138

00:09:10,990  -->  00:09:17,220
So span and we'll just call this P1 display just like that.

139

00:09:17,800  -->  00:09:21,390
And now we need to go to our scorekeeper J S and change a few things.

140

00:09:21,550  -->  00:09:25,480
So we don't need to select the H-1 any more to get rid of that.

141

00:09:25,570  -->  00:09:35,620
We're going to select far one display equals document get and let's do query selector just for variety

142

00:09:35,620  -->  00:09:37,160
again Query selector.

143

00:09:37,180  -->  00:09:45,640
And we call that P1 display so that will just give us the span and if we wanted to check that that was

144

00:09:45,630  -->  00:09:46,440
working.

145

00:09:46,650  -->  00:09:51,270
Why don't we just do a concert vault log right here.

146

00:09:51,630  -->  00:09:58,970
Won display just to see when we load the page refresh it should print out OK.

147

00:09:59,000  -->  00:10:00,510
Selected our spand correctly.

148

00:10:00,720  -->  00:10:01,280
OK.

149

00:10:01,620  -->  00:10:05,840
So now what we want to do and get rid of that is add one to the score.

150

00:10:06,350  -->  00:10:10,960
We can get rid of our other cons. But log in rather than changing the text content on the whole H-1

151

00:10:11,010  -->  00:10:11,250
.

152

00:10:11,350  -->  00:10:17,620
We just want to change it on our P1 display which is this little span right here.

153

00:10:17,620  -->  00:10:21,160
And if we refresh Now there we go.

154

00:10:21,150  -->  00:10:28,750
So we get that player 1 display updating player 2 still doesn't do anything but we have this feature

155

00:10:28,750  -->  00:10:29,400
working.

156

00:10:29,590  -->  00:10:31,530
So let's do the same thing for player 2.

157

00:10:31,840  -->  00:10:42,790
So I'll go back add in another span around our zero span ID equals to display and then move to zero

158

00:10:43,500  -->  00:10:44,830
in between.

159

00:10:44,910  -->  00:10:48,520
We refresh nothing should look different but we now have two spans.

160

00:10:48,570  -->  00:10:56,280
So you can see then let's go back to our scorekeeper J us and let's add in two new variables.

161

00:10:56,280  -->  00:11:01,740
So we need to display span for player to need to select it with that ID.

162

00:11:02,110  -->  00:11:03,660
I'll use query selector again.

163

00:11:03,900  -->  00:11:09,010
And then we need a variable for the score player to his we don't want them just to be the same score

164

00:11:09,000  -->  00:11:09,290
.

165

00:11:09,310  -->  00:11:13,480
Obviously we need two separate ways of tracking their values.

166

00:11:13,480  -->  00:11:18,710
So the first thing that I want to do is test that our player to button is selected correctly.

167

00:11:18,730  -->  00:11:25,980
So I'm just going to do a concert vault log player to button and just see what it prints out.

168

00:11:26,710  -->  00:11:32,160
And if we refresh and we look at the cons. You can see something's awry.

169

00:11:32,200  -->  00:11:35,090
We selected the player one button not the player two button.

170

00:11:35,250  -->  00:11:37,230
So something is wrong with our selector.

171

00:11:37,250  -->  00:11:43,190
You can see here we're selecting element by id P1 which is the same as what we had up here.

172

00:11:43,210  -->  00:11:45,450
So we need to select P2 instead.

173

00:11:45,820  -->  00:11:52,870
Ok so now that that's taken care of if we refresh we get button ID P2 which is great.

174

00:11:52,920  -->  00:11:54,640
Now let's add in our listener.

175

00:11:54,660  -->  00:12:04,000
So Pete to button that ad event listener click and I always like to start by just printing something

176

00:12:04,000  -->  00:12:11,920
out or alerting something a log P2 click just like that refresh.

177

00:12:12,620  -->  00:12:17,770
And we get P2 clicked our player one still works and P2 is running some code.

178

00:12:17,760  -->  00:12:21,320
Now we just need to put the right code in there.

179

00:12:21,330  -->  00:12:26,500
If we take a look at what we did for the player 1 button we need a player to score a variable increment

180

00:12:26,500  -->  00:12:27,400
to start.

181

00:12:27,390  -->  00:12:30,450
So far P2 score.

182

00:12:30,490  -->  00:12:32,770
And that should start at zero as well.

183

00:12:32,760  -->  00:12:40,560
And then we'll just come here and just change this to be P2 score plus for us and then we need to update

184

00:12:40,570  -->  00:12:43,620
it in the display which we haven't yet selected.

185

00:12:43,620  -->  00:12:45,880
So we also need to select that span.

186

00:12:45,900  -->  00:12:49,980
Remember the span right here ID of P2 display.

187

00:12:50,250  -->  00:12:51,520
So we're going to do that.

188

00:12:51,580  -->  00:12:58,750
She's going to copy that line and change it to display document Duckery selector P2 display and then

189

00:12:58,770  -->  00:13:06,590
we'll just change the display on to the text content to be equal to the player to score.

190

00:13:06,730  -->  00:13:07,810
So let's take a look.

191

00:13:07,860  -->  00:13:10,360
Click on player 1 that still works.

192

00:13:10,360  -->  00:13:13,090
How about player 2 that works as well.

193

00:13:13,680  -->  00:13:14,110
OK.

194

00:13:14,160  -->  00:13:16,020
So there is no end to our game right now.

195

00:13:16,020  -->  00:13:17,650
This would just keep going forever.

196

00:13:17,670  -->  00:13:20,300
So we need to work on adding that functionality.

197

00:13:20,400  -->  00:13:25,050
And the way that we're going to do that is with a variable that's going to keep track of the state of

198

00:13:25,060  -->  00:13:25,950
our game.

199

00:13:26,110  -->  00:13:27,680
So our game has two states.

200

00:13:27,790  -->  00:13:32,860
The first one is the normal state right now where I can click where I can play the game.

201

00:13:33,000  -->  00:13:37,520
And the second state would be what we might call game over where someone has one.

202

00:13:37,840  -->  00:13:42,140
So we need two states and we can use a boolean to model that just that true or false.

203

00:13:42,150  -->  00:13:45,200
And I'm going to call it game over so far.

204

00:13:45,420  -->  00:13:49,040
Game over and it starts this false because game over.

205

00:13:49,120  -->  00:13:50,840
Not true at the beginning of the game.

206

00:13:50,950  -->  00:13:57,660
And then what we'll do is we'll update game over to be true or false depending on if someone wins.

207

00:13:57,660  -->  00:14:04,150
So if someone gets to five game over should now be true and that should mean that we can no longer update

208

00:14:04,140  -->  00:14:09,940
the score and that we have to hit reset and reset should then make game over false again and start everything

209

00:14:09,930  -->  00:14:11,050
over.

210

00:14:11,050  -->  00:14:12,930
So let me show you what I mean.

211

00:14:12,930  -->  00:14:16,000
The first thing we want to do is add another variable.

212

00:14:16,000  -->  00:14:17,670
I'm going to call it winning score.

213

00:14:18,150  -->  00:14:19,940
And that's just going to be equal to 5.

214

00:14:20,130  -->  00:14:24,550
So that variable is what we're going to compare player 1 and player to score 2.

215

00:14:24,610  -->  00:14:29,920
So we're going to check as a player 1 score reached the winning score if he or she has.

216

00:14:30,100  -->  00:14:32,200
Then we need to say game over is true.

217

00:14:32,500  -->  00:14:33,910
So the logic will look like this.

218

00:14:33,910  -->  00:14:40,360
Going to have an if statement and it's just going to look like if game over is not been reached yet

219

00:14:40,360  -->  00:14:40,620
.

220

00:14:40,620  -->  00:14:48,370
So if not game over then we're going to let you add to the score just like this.

221

00:14:48,930  -->  00:14:51,930
When I run this right now you won't notice anything different.

222

00:14:51,930  -->  00:14:56,890
It will work exactly the same way for player 1 and that's because game over is always false.

223

00:14:56,880  -->  00:14:58,030
It never changes.

224

00:14:58,260  -->  00:15:00,370
So when would we change it to be true.

225

00:15:00,610  -->  00:15:02,040
Well when there's a game over.

226

00:15:02,230  -->  00:15:08,390
And when that happens is when the users score so when player 1 score is equal to the winning score.

227

00:15:08,760  -->  00:15:18,580
So after we add one to player 1 score we'll just check if let's do one score triples equals winning

228

00:15:18,580  -->  00:15:18,940
score.

229

00:15:18,930  -->  00:15:25,080
So if they're equal to one another then let's start by just saying Contador log.

230

00:15:25,260  -->  00:15:27,280
Game over.

231

00:15:27,280  -->  00:15:28,340
Just like that.

232

00:15:28,920  -->  00:15:36,790
And if we refresh and review our Consul and I tried changing this so far this is not true so this never

233

00:15:36,790  -->  00:15:37,890
happens.

234

00:15:38,080  -->  00:15:42,560
This time though I add one player one score goes to five.

235

00:15:42,750  -->  00:15:48,220
We're checking if player 1 score is equal to winning score and we get game over down here.

236

00:15:48,220  -->  00:15:53,670
So rather than just cancel the locking game over we actually want to change this state or now.

237

00:15:53,670  -->  00:15:56,130
Game over is true.

238

00:15:56,160  -->  00:16:01,930
So what that will do for us I'll show you if I refresh it will prevent us from adding more to the score

239

00:16:02,430  -->  00:16:04,390
because game over is true.

240

00:16:04,570  -->  00:16:05,920
This little check appear.

241

00:16:05,910  -->  00:16:06,700
It checks.

242

00:16:06,790  -->  00:16:07,930
Is it game over yet.

243

00:16:08,130  -->  00:16:11,370
And if it is game over none of this code runs.

244

00:16:11,530  -->  00:16:13,270
So let's try that.

245

00:16:13,390  -->  00:16:15,270
I get to five and I'm stuck.

246

00:16:15,460  -->  00:16:17,310
I can't increase it anymore.

247

00:16:17,350  -->  00:16:22,730
However I can go to player 2 and increase that score because our logic is only for player 1.

248

00:16:23,190  -->  00:16:28,520
We'll want to go over to this player to button out event listener and add in the same logic.

249

00:16:28,570  -->  00:16:39,630
So if it's not game over then we'll let you increment the score and update the display and then we also

250

00:16:39,630  -->  00:16:49,600
need to check if the new player to score is equal to the winning score then it is game over.

251

00:16:49,600  -->  00:16:55,390
Game over is true which means that the user neither user or player one or player two can continue to

252

00:16:55,380  -->  00:16:57,240
increment the score any more.

253

00:16:57,250  -->  00:17:01,080
So let's check that this works refresh.

254

00:17:01,990  -->  00:17:04,390
OK we can get to five here and we're done.

255

00:17:04,380  -->  00:17:08,120
Player 2 doesn't work or we can get to five over here and we're done.

256

00:17:08,130  -->  00:17:09,810
And player 1 doesn't work either.
