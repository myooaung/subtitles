00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:05.460
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to continue with the camp app and we're going to add in the

2

00:00:05.460  -->  00:00:09.070
feature or the ability for a user to submit a new campground.

3

00:00:09.270  -->  00:00:10.990
So there are a few things we need to do.

4

00:00:11.010  -->  00:00:15.540
The first one is to set up the post route that we actually create the new campground added into the

5

00:00:15.540  -->  00:00:16.130
array.

6

00:00:16.290  -->  00:00:21.600
Then we need to add in body parser and make sure that it's imported correctly and configured and then

7

00:00:21.600  -->  00:00:27.030
we have two other steps here to that concern creating the form and creating the route for the form where

8

00:00:27.030  -->  00:00:29.760
a user can go to actually send that POST request.

9

00:00:29.760  -->  00:00:30.840
So we'll get to that.

10

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:32.720
We're going to start by setting up the post route.

11

00:00:32.760  -->  00:00:40.950
So I'm still in V-1 and I'm going to open up actually yes an ad in our post-draft and I'll just do that

12

00:00:40.950  -->  00:00:49.350
at the bottom and I'm going to hop up post and rather than doing something like Slash new campground

13

00:00:49.410  -->  00:00:53.380
or add campground I'm actually going to do slash campgrounds.

14

00:00:53.670  -->  00:00:59.550
So that's the exact same you RL As we have for our Get route but there are totally different routes

15

00:00:59.580  -->  00:01:05.310
because one is a GED and one is a post and I'm not just doing this to show you that in fact we can have

16

00:01:05.310  -->  00:01:09.800
the same bureau with a different request method and there are actually different routes.

17

00:01:09.810  -->  00:01:10.920
Yes that's part of it.

18

00:01:10.920  -->  00:01:14.310
This is actually all part of a convention for how we name are routes.

19

00:01:14.360  -->  00:01:16.260
We have a lot of freedom in how we name are out.

20

00:01:16.380  -->  00:01:20.580
But there's actually a convention called the rest and we're going to be coming back to this in future

21

00:01:20.580  -->  00:01:21.200
videos.

22

00:01:21.330  -->  00:01:26.370
But all I want to say on it right now is that to make our routes follow this convention called rest

23

00:01:27.180  -->  00:01:33.120
when we have a page that shows all of the campgrounds that you are l should be slash campgrounds.

24

00:01:33.120  -->  00:01:38.740
When we have a page or a route where we can create a new campground it should be the exact same you

25

00:01:39.490  -->  00:01:40.990
slash campground.

26

00:01:41.340  -->  00:01:42.780
But it should be a post request.

27

00:01:42.780  -->  00:01:47.370
So that is a convention it's a format that we're going to follow if we're doing this for a friend.

28

00:01:47.410  -->  00:01:53.460
We would have Slash friends as it get would show all the friends and slash friends as a post is where

29

00:01:53.460  -->  00:01:56.170
we send a post request to make a new friend.

30

00:01:56.580  -->  00:01:58.470
So we'll get a lot more practice with that.

31

00:01:58.470  -->  00:02:01.040
This is just the very very first introduction to it.

32

00:02:01.110  -->  00:02:05.940
But there are actually seven different routes that are restful that follow this rest convention that

33

00:02:05.940  -->  00:02:07.120
we'll be seeing later.

34

00:02:07.470  -->  00:02:16.710
So inside of here what we want to do is two things we want to get data from form and add to a campground

35

00:02:16.770  -->  00:02:29.140
array and then we also want to redirect access to campgrounds page back to this route.

36

00:02:30.630  -->  00:02:38.400
So we have the ACT UP post set up and we can always just do a red dot send here you hit the post route

37

00:02:38.850  -->  00:02:40.630
and then we can test it out with postman.

38

00:02:40.770  -->  00:02:47.690
So I'll just copy the euro here go back to postman and the route that we're testing is slash campgrounds

39

00:02:48.120  -->  00:02:52.220
as a post not a get if we did it as a get request.

40

00:02:52.460  -->  00:02:57.780
It doesn't actually matter because our servers not started the H Tim L and the SS that we see here is

41

00:02:57.780  -->  00:02:59.300
the error page.

42

00:02:59.430  -->  00:03:02.460
This error page that cloud 9 gives us.

43

00:03:02.460  -->  00:03:04.800
So we need to start the server.

44

00:03:05.530  -->  00:03:11.440
Now if we go back and make the same GET request we'll see the list with the images and the H ones.

45

00:03:11.820  -->  00:03:17.130
And if we do a post request we should just get a little message that says you hit the post-draft.

46

00:03:17.360  -->  00:03:22.800
OK so that's all we'll do with postman proves to us that it's working as a post route and what we'll

47

00:03:22.800  -->  00:03:25.140
do next is install body parser.

48

00:03:25.260  -->  00:03:36.600
So we need to do NPM install body dash parser dash dash save and then we'll import it up here with our

49

00:03:37.230  -->  00:03:43.910
body parts are equals require body Desch parser and save.

50

00:03:43.910  -->  00:03:46.190
And then we need to tell express to use poddy parser.

51

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:54.990
So we'll do that use Oddy parser and then we also need to do the dot euro uncoated and then pass in

52

00:03:54.990  -->  00:03:59.680
an object and all that we need to do is add extended Colan true.

53

00:03:59.980  -->  00:04:04.470
Remember this is a line that will just see all the time you can just get used to either memorizing it

54

00:04:04.470  -->  00:04:07.290
or just copying and pasting it and will save.

55

00:04:07.290  -->  00:04:13.050
And now we have body parts are set up and we can tell if it works just by running after us and if we

56

00:04:13.050  -->  00:04:15.370
don't get an error we're good to go.

57

00:04:15.390  -->  00:04:17.490
Now let's focus on the form.

58

00:04:17.520  -->  00:04:24.180
So before what I had shown you is the friends app where we had the form on the same page as the friends

59

00:04:24.180  -->  00:04:27.080
list but that's not the approach we're going to take here.

60

00:04:27.090  -->  00:04:31.530
Rather we'll have a complete separate page and route that will actually show the form.

61

00:04:31.770  -->  00:04:34.610
It will be the form to make a new campground.

62

00:04:34.680  -->  00:04:41.280
And then you submit the form that sends a post request to slash campground as a post and then we're

63

00:04:41.280  -->  00:04:44.070
redirected back to campgrounds.

64

00:04:44.070  -->  00:04:48.930
So we're going to make a separate page so to do that we need a separate route and we can just do that

65

00:04:49.440  -->  00:04:53.430
at the bottom here or in between doesn't really matter get.

66

00:04:53.670  -->  00:04:57.900
And this will be slashed campgrounds slash new.

67

00:04:58.260  -->  00:05:02.860
And again this could be anything that we want it to but this is the restful convention.

68

00:05:02.880  -->  00:05:06.010
So this is the third of those conventional names.

69

00:05:06.060  -->  00:05:12.120
The first one was slash campground as a get should show you all the campgrounds slash campgrounds as

70

00:05:12.120  -->  00:05:18.210
a post is the route where you can create a new campground and then slash campground slash new should

71

00:05:18.210  -->  00:05:25.960
show the form that will send the data to this post route so let's flesh this out and all that it needs

72

00:05:25.960  -->  00:05:33.400
to do is render a form we don't need to pass in any data or anything so we'll just do a rez render and

73

00:05:33.400  -->  00:05:36.720
the form will just call new that.

74

00:05:36.970  -->  00:05:38.460
Yes just like that.

75

00:05:39.090  -->  00:05:40.340
And safe.

76

00:05:40.360  -->  00:05:44.290
Now back over here in our views directory we're going to make that template.

77

00:05:44.410  -->  00:05:47.760
So touch views slash new.

78

00:05:47.880  -->  00:05:48.440
Yes.

79

00:05:48.730  -->  00:05:54.530
And then we'll open that template and inside the template add in.

80

00:05:54.540  -->  00:06:04.900
And each one that says Create a new campground and then we'll add in a form tag in this form tag we

81

00:06:04.900  -->  00:06:13.900
need to have action and we need to have method and remember method should be post and action should

82

00:06:13.900  -->  00:06:18.380
be slash campgrounds which is the route here.

83

00:06:18.550  -->  00:06:20.820
Apt up post slash campgrounds.

84

00:06:20.860  -->  00:06:24.850
So this is where we'll get the form data and add to the campgrounds array.

85

00:06:25.090  -->  00:06:27.540
And inside we need two different inputs.

86

00:06:27.640  -->  00:06:34.570
So the first one is type because text and the placeholder will just be name.

87

00:06:35.290  -->  00:06:39.600
And the second one will do placeholder is image you rl.

88

00:06:39.710  -->  00:06:45.470
And let's just do like that and we'll keep it as Typee go to text and then we need our button at the

89

00:06:45.460  -->  00:06:54.280
bottom and here to say submit and save and then we also need the name attribute on both of these so

90

00:06:54.280  -->  00:06:59.320
name and this will be equal to just name.

91

00:06:59.320  -->  00:07:07.180
And here we'll have name is equal to image and we use this name attribute instead of our route to grab

92

00:07:07.180  -->  00:07:09.580
the data from the request Abati.

93

00:07:09.620  -->  00:07:10.370
Before we do that.

94

00:07:10.390  -->  00:07:12.760
Let's make sure this form is showing up correctly.

95

00:07:12.850  -->  00:07:21.880
So we're going to start the server and to visit this route we need to go to slash campgrounds slash

96

00:07:21.970  -->  00:07:25.870
new and we get our form excellent.

97

00:07:25.880  -->  00:07:28.160
We're not getting any of that bootstrap styling.

98

00:07:28.390  -->  00:07:33.090
Not that it looks like much but we're not getting it because we don't have our layouts included.

99

00:07:33.160  -->  00:07:36.990
We don't have the header and footer so we can also.

100

00:07:37.420  -->  00:07:47.680
So let's also add that in include Parshall's slash Hetter and then copy this line down here and include

101

00:07:47.680  -->  00:07:50.130
Parshall's slash footer.

102

00:07:51.040  -->  00:07:54.360
Restart the server go back.

103

00:07:54.380  -->  00:07:59.290
Now we get the beautiful bootstrap and we have the header file and then our footer down here as well

104

00:07:59.290  -->  00:07:59.910
.

105

00:08:00.460  -->  00:08:04.870
And we can test this out to see if it's going to the right route or just typing anything into here and

106

00:08:04.880  -->  00:08:11.440
hitting submit and we get you hit the post route which means that our code the form is submitting a

107

00:08:11.440  -->  00:08:13.430
post request to slash campgrounds.

108

00:08:13.570  -->  00:08:15.290
And we're getting this redstart settled.

109

00:08:15.580  -->  00:08:20.590
But rather than sending this we actually want to add the logic in to make this work.

110

00:08:20.750  -->  00:08:26.240
And remember to get the data from the form we use request of body and then we have request up bodycam

111

00:08:26.260  -->  00:08:31.550
name and request up body image and I'll save those to a variable.

112

00:08:31.570  -->  00:08:36.060
So far name and var image.

113

00:08:36.350  -->  00:08:41.830
And then what we want to do is push a new campground into our array here.

114

00:08:42.040  -->  00:08:47.590
And in order for that to work we have to move this out so that it's not inside of the apt.

115

00:08:47.600  -->  00:08:52.240
Get we'll just put it up top and that's not where it's going to stay.

116

00:08:52.250  -->  00:08:54.690
Remember we're moving to a database very soon.

117

00:08:55.000  -->  00:08:59.790
But for now we're putting it up top so that we have access to it inside of this post route.

118

00:09:00.080  -->  00:09:01.460
In the callback function.

119

00:09:01.880  -->  00:09:05.130
So we're going to push a new campground into the campground array.

120

00:09:05.430  -->  00:09:08.950
So campground set up push and we need to push in an object.

121

00:09:09.080  -->  00:09:11.310
So I'm going to make that new object with a variable.

122

00:09:11.360  -->  00:09:15.570
So I'm going to call it var new campground.

123

00:09:15.590  -->  00:09:24.350
It's an object and we have name is equal to name and image is equal to image just so that we match this

124

00:09:24.350  -->  00:09:31.550
format here or we have name and image and then the last thing we need to do is push new campground just

125

00:09:31.540  -->  00:09:33.580
like that save.

126

00:09:33.740  -->  00:09:36.890
And then let's redirect back to the campground page.

127

00:09:37.060  -->  00:09:37.960
So that will be.

128

00:09:38.000  -->  00:09:47.270
RAZ redirect to slash campgrounds and yes we do have to slash campgrounds.

129

00:09:47.380  -->  00:09:51.310
But when we do a redirect the default is to redirect as a get request.

130

00:09:51.380  -->  00:09:53.630
So we'll save and let's test it out

131

00:09:57.400  -->  00:10:01.140
go back refresh let's add in a new campground.

132

00:10:01.210  -->  00:10:08.820
We'll just call this one daisy mountain and we need a image you are I'll just copy this one here.

133

00:10:09.080  -->  00:10:10.520
Go back.

134

00:10:10.850  -->  00:10:12.640
Hit submit.

135

00:10:13.270  -->  00:10:17.060
And to tell if it worked we need to scroll down and there we go.

136

00:10:17.090  -->  00:10:18.700
Beautiful Daisy mountain.

137

00:10:18.700  -->  00:10:20.240
Pretty stunning sight.

138

00:10:20.230  -->  00:10:22.200
Let's go back and review a few things.

139

00:10:22.210  -->  00:10:23.620
There's a lot that we did.

140

00:10:23.620  -->  00:10:26.170
The first thing I want to bring up are the routes that we made.

141

00:10:26.170  -->  00:10:33.790
So we now have actually get slashed campground which shows us all the campgrounds we have up post slash

142

00:10:33.790  -->  00:10:35.480
campground the same bureau.

143

00:10:35.600  -->  00:10:40.370
And that's where we actually do the logic of making a new campground and then redirecting slash campground

144

00:10:40.380  -->  00:10:40.670
.

145

00:10:40.900  -->  00:10:44.520
And then we have Amtrak get slashed campgrounds slash new.

146

00:10:44.650  -->  00:10:46.330
And that shows the form.

147

00:10:46.690  -->  00:10:55.070
So remember campgrounds slash new shows the form which submit a post request to slash campgrounds which

148

00:10:55.070  -->  00:11:01.490
then in turn redirects us back to slash campgrounds as it get which then will show us all the campgrounds

149

00:11:01.820  -->  00:11:03.930
using the campground template.

150

00:11:04.740  -->  00:11:07.490
It's a little bit of a complicated flow definitely.

151

00:11:07.540  -->  00:11:11.360
There's a lot of moving pieces but this is a recipe that we'll be following a lot.

152

00:11:11.410  -->  00:11:13.910
So we have a form send to post requests somewhere.

153

00:11:14.050  -->  00:11:16.990
And then inside that post route we take the form data.

154

00:11:17.020  -->  00:11:20.530
We do something with it and then we redirect back somewhere else.

155

00:11:20.530  -->  00:11:24.570
So it's really typical for a post route to redirect you to another route.

156

00:11:25.070  -->  00:11:28.140
The very last thing we should do is open up the campgrounds template.

157

00:11:28.610  -->  00:11:37.930
So we'll do C9 use slash campground and we'll just add a simple link up top we'll make it a anchored

158

00:11:37.930  -->  00:11:48.790
tag to start a Tref equal slash campgrounds slash new and that inner text will be add new campground

159

00:11:48.910  -->  00:11:51.250
just like that and we'll save.

160

00:11:51.350  -->  00:11:59.300
And then we can restart the server and let's go back here to the landing page or to the campgrounds

161

00:11:59.290  -->  00:12:02.390
page excuse me and we have add new campground.

162

00:12:02.530  -->  00:12:07.040
Click on it and we get to the campgrounds page and then we can add our new campground.

163

00:12:07.270  -->  00:12:12.080
We should also add a back button so that we can go back to view all campgrounds.

164

00:12:12.380  -->  00:12:17.980
So on the new template at the bottom we'll just include our own anchor tag here.

165

00:12:18.120  -->  00:12:26.650
A draft should be equal to slash campgrounds and this will just say back or go back restart the server

166

00:12:26.650  -->  00:12:26.770
.

167

00:12:26.770  -->  00:12:32.320
One last time her fresh at a new campground go back.

168

00:12:32.530  -->  00:12:35.900
OK so now we have the link set up correctly in the next video.

169

00:12:35.920  -->  00:12:37.970
We're going to focus on some basic styling.
