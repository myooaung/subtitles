00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:05.960
Welcome back some of us video we got the blog app set up created our blog model and we added the index

2

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:07.540
template in this video.

3

00:00:07.560  -->  00:00:10.070
We won't actually be adding any new routes just yet.

4

00:00:10.090  -->  00:00:13.590
This will be very quick but we want to add in our header and footer Parshall's.

5

00:00:13.680  -->  00:00:16.030
And then I want to include semantic UI as well.

6

00:00:16.040  -->  00:00:18.980
And then finally we'll add a really simple nav bar at the top.

7

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:23.990
So let's start we want to create our header and footer that Ejay as files.

8

00:00:24.660  -->  00:00:26.810
And that should be inside if viewed directories.

9

00:00:26.820  -->  00:00:34.200
So we'll do a make directory use slash Parshall's then touch views slash Parshall's slash Hetter that

10

00:00:34.200  -->  00:00:40.990
Ejay us and then touch views slash Parshall's slash footer E.J..

11

00:00:41.430  -->  00:00:42.060
Great.

12

00:00:42.060  -->  00:00:45.990
Now let's open those up.

13

00:00:46.290  -->  00:00:47.960
Let's start with header.

14

00:00:48.570  -->  00:00:54.990
And why didn't the basic skeleton so HD a metal head title.

15

00:00:55.470  -->  00:01:02.540
We'll call it blog app and then we need our body just like that and we'll be moving this to the footer

16

00:01:02.790  -->  00:01:07.010
so we can cut that out for now and then just so that we know it's working.

17

00:01:07.140  -->  00:01:14.310
Let's add in just a paragraph at the top that says from the header file and if we see that on every

18

00:01:14.310  -->  00:01:16.710
page will know that we did it correctly.

19

00:01:16.710  -->  00:01:18.060
Now let's open up footer

20

00:01:22.980  -->  00:01:30.110
paste this in and we can do the same thing from the footer save.

21

00:01:30.450  -->  00:01:33.890
Now we need to link this and let's do it in our index to start.

22

00:01:34.140  -->  00:01:42.360
So at the top we need to have our include and our path is that we're instead of use in the index file

23

00:01:42.380  -->  00:01:42.600
.

24

00:01:42.780  -->  00:01:47.780
So we just want a dot slash Parshall's slash header.

25

00:01:48.240  -->  00:01:53.280
And then the same thing down here Parshall's slash for it.

26

00:01:53.700  -->  00:02:02.130
Let's test it out no problem so far and we get from the header file from the foot or five.

27

00:02:02.430  -->  00:02:02.990
Great.

28

00:02:03.180  -->  00:02:05.530
Now let's add in semantic UI.

29

00:02:05.880  -->  00:02:10.590
So I have this semantic UI web site open semantic Dasch you dot com.

30

00:02:10.620  -->  00:02:18.080
And just like bootstrap we can either download the files or we can include a CDN semantic UI CDN.

31

00:02:18.530  -->  00:02:23.790
Just click on this first example and you'll notice there are a lot of different files that we could

32

00:02:23.790  -->  00:02:24.630
pick from.

33

00:02:24.810  -->  00:02:30.120
And that's because the way that semantic UI is organized the way it's designed is that unlike bootstrap

34

00:02:30.300  -->  00:02:37.200
if all you want is after our section or you only want the forms you can just take that single component

35

00:02:37.560  -->  00:02:39.000
component slash formed us.

36

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:43.770
SS So you don't need the entire thing which is one of the criticisms of bootstrap is if you only want

37

00:02:43.770  -->  00:02:46.510
a small piece you still have to take the entire library.

38

00:02:46.770  -->  00:02:48.420
But we do want the entire library.

39

00:02:48.420  -->  00:02:55.920
So if you scroll down on all these idioms you want the one that says semantic that CDN which if you

40

00:02:55.920  -->  00:03:04.190
just do a search or semantic got reassess which is right here it's difficult to find if you don't know

41

00:03:04.190  -->  00:03:05.920
or you're looking for but just do a search.

42

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:09.320
No actually take a minute fied version to make things faster.

43

00:03:09.360  -->  00:03:16.950
So it's semantic that men see assess and we copy that you Erl over and we're going to put it up top

44

00:03:17.340  -->  00:03:20.040
in our header file inside the head.

45

00:03:20.490  -->  00:03:22.300
It's a length tag.

46

00:03:22.950  -->  00:03:29.030
And we want it to be link and then ref equals that right there.

47

00:03:29.120  -->  00:03:30.260
Yes yes.

48

00:03:30.420  -->  00:03:34.900
And we should also add in rel style sheet type equals text slash.

49

00:03:34.940  -->  00:03:40.500
C Ss So now we save and restart the server again.

50

00:03:41.640  -->  00:03:47.160
Take a look at our home page you'll see a few small changes just like when we first install bootstrap

51

00:03:47.250  -->  00:03:49.070
the font changes a little bit.

52

00:03:49.560  -->  00:03:49.830
OK.

53

00:03:49.830  -->  00:03:57.720
So that means that we have it working let's get rid of our paragraphs in the header and footer and instead

54

00:03:57.870  -->  00:04:01.180
let's add in a simple nav bar in the queue.

55

00:04:01.230  -->  00:04:03.740
Now of course are called menus.

56

00:04:03.990  -->  00:04:12.810
So if we go over here click on menu all the different components and we want to find menu which is under

57

00:04:12.810  -->  00:04:16.170
collection's menu.

58

00:04:16.170  -->  00:04:18.630
You can see there are quite a few different types of menus.

59

00:04:18.860  -->  00:04:22.190
There's menu which is what you see here.

60

00:04:22.500  -->  00:04:32.090
There's a Poynting menu there is tabular text vertical magination.

61

00:04:32.470  -->  00:04:40.450
And there's quite a few more all that we need though is to make the top of our body a div and let's

62

00:04:40.590  -->  00:04:43.170
get this properly.

63

00:04:43.170  -->  00:04:46.340
Kate does class equal to you.

64

00:04:46.340  -->  00:04:52.170
I fixed and we'll do an inverted menu which just changes the color just like in bootstrapped.

65

00:04:52.170  -->  00:04:57.410
You could say in verse and then inside of there we need another div.

66

00:04:58.020  -->  00:05:03.830
And this one will have class equals you container which is just like bootstrapped container.

67

00:05:04.260  -->  00:05:10.030
And then instead of there I'll have another div and this one will have class equal to Hetter item.

68

00:05:10.320  -->  00:05:13.550
And this is like the nav bar brand on bootstrap.

69

00:05:13.560  -->  00:05:18.920
So all that we want kids blog site or whatever we want our app to be called.

70

00:05:19.050  -->  00:05:28.830
And then after that we'll add an anchor tag for the home page and we'll just call it home and we'll

71

00:05:28.860  -->  00:05:37.140
add in class equal to item and then we'll do the same thing except rather than going to slash it will

72

00:05:37.140  -->  00:05:45.350
go to slash logs slash new which doesn't exist yet and it will be cold New Post or New Blog.

73

00:05:45.410  -->  00:05:47.470
That will be the text that we see.

74

00:05:48.350  -->  00:05:51.760
OK so you aren't fixed inverted menu.

75

00:05:51.900  -->  00:05:53.460
A container instead of that.

76

00:05:53.670  -->  00:06:00.010
And then inside the container we actually should have all of this small mistake on my part.

77

00:06:00.060  -->  00:06:02.670
So we want that to be in there as well.

78

00:06:03.360  -->  00:06:04.850
It's all in the container.

79

00:06:05.160  -->  00:06:10.250
And then we have our header and then we have two items that are anchored Tex.

80

00:06:10.260  -->  00:06:12.200
Let's take a look at that now.

81

00:06:13.500  -->  00:06:15.200
And we get our simple math bar.

82

00:06:15.520  -->  00:06:17.720
Yes we have a problem here with some spacing.

83

00:06:17.730  -->  00:06:21.450
We'll handle that in just a moment but we have a now where it works just fine.

84

00:06:21.660  -->  00:06:27.450
Let's add in a simple icon which in semantic You are just called icons.

85

00:06:28.070  -->  00:06:30.690
There's a bunch of them in the one that I used.

86

00:06:30.720  -->  00:06:32.960
It's called Code.

87

00:06:33.120  -->  00:06:35.500
Try and find it on here and just do a search.

88

00:06:35.550  -->  00:06:36.310
There it is.

89

00:06:36.480  -->  00:06:39.760
But feel free to pick your own if you like comment.

90

00:06:39.810  -->  00:06:43.560
The idea was that it was a code based blog but there might be something else.

91

00:06:43.560  -->  00:06:44.900
I like the idea one as well.

92

00:06:44.920  -->  00:06:46.190
Anyway there's a bunch of them.

93

00:06:46.350  -->  00:06:51.980
What is nice is that they also have a bunch of icons for companies which is useful.

94

00:06:52.020  -->  00:06:56.610
The very bottom I think they have them and we go to tons of different brands and common companies that

95

00:06:56.610  -->  00:06:59.100
you'd have linked to on your application.

96

00:06:59.430  -->  00:07:00.070
OK.

97

00:07:00.300  -->  00:07:07.160
So it's code a name for icon and I'm going to add it right here next to the blogsite header.

98

00:07:07.470  -->  00:07:11.190
So right here had her item and all we need is an eye tag.

99

00:07:11.670  -->  00:07:17.400
And it needs to have a class of code and an icon.

100

00:07:17.400  -->  00:07:26.040
So really simple just the name of the icon and then the class icon save refresh and we have a little

101

00:07:26.040  -->  00:07:26.290
code.

102

00:07:26.280  -->  00:07:27.340
I come there.

103

00:07:27.660  -->  00:07:31.830
Let's make a small change which is to make this icon a little bit bigger.

104

00:07:31.860  -->  00:07:38.730
To do that we could just write a style tag great here but rather than doing that let's use the public

105

00:07:38.730  -->  00:07:40.630
directory that we set up.

106

00:07:40.680  -->  00:07:41.930
We still need to make the directory.

107

00:07:41.940  -->  00:07:44.570
But we set up the fact that it's being served.

108

00:07:44.700  -->  00:07:51.340
So we'll do stylesheets slash and we'll just call it apt C Ss doesn't exist yet.

109

00:07:51.690  -->  00:08:03.330
So we need to do a make directory public and then also make directory public slash style sheets and

110

00:08:03.330  -->  00:08:11.490
finally touch public slash style sheets slash app Dotsie SS which we also want to open up so public

111

00:08:11.730  -->  00:08:16.710
stylesheets Aptos the SS tab completion is definitely your friend there.

112

00:08:16.740  -->  00:08:19.990
And to make all the icons a little bigger.

113

00:08:20.400  -->  00:08:26.370
Well just you actually rather than all icons and stewe icons that have that class of icon just to be

114

00:08:26.370  -->  00:08:35.940
a little more specific and we'll set font size BE2 IEMs just like that double the size of the container

115

00:08:36.600  -->  00:08:39.250
or double size of the parent save.

116

00:08:39.560  -->  00:08:45.180
OK so now we started server back up and we refresh the page.

117

00:08:45.180  -->  00:08:49.530
We should see that the icon gets larger which is just a matter of personal preference.

118

00:08:49.530  -->  00:08:52.340
But I think it looks a little bit better when it's larger.

119

00:08:52.710  -->  00:08:52.940
OK.

120

00:08:52.950  -->  00:08:56.850
Now that we have that done we're done with everything we needed to do in this video.

121

00:08:56.850  -->  00:09:03.210
So I just wanted to set up the nav bar added in the Header Footer files add in our own custom CSSA file

122

00:09:03.300  -->  00:09:09.810
even though it's only one line now we can easily add custom CSSA to every single file every single template

123

00:09:10.500  -->  00:09:13.580
and I wanted to show you how we can include semantic UI.

124

00:09:13.860  -->  00:09:19.420
OK so we'll pick up the next video with new and create so we can actually create new blogs.
