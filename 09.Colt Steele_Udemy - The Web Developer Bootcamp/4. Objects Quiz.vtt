00:00:00.250  -->  00:00:00.870
All right.

2

00:00:00.870  -->  00:00:03.180
So it's time for another quick set of exercises.

3

00:00:03.240  -->  00:00:05.640
This time we're going to cover javascript objects.

4

00:00:05.640  -->  00:00:06.670
Just the basics.

5

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:07.870
You know the drill by now.

6

00:00:08.070  -->  00:00:12.390
I'm going to give you some code and ask you to evaluate it without just copying it into the console

7

00:00:12.390  -->  00:00:12.960
.

8

00:00:12.960  -->  00:00:18.090
So here's the first one we are declaring an object and then we're adding four different properties to

9

00:00:18.090  -->  00:00:19.160
that object.

10

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:23.470
And I want you to figure out which of these are valid code and which will cause problems.

11

00:00:23.730  -->  00:00:26.450
So go ahead post a video and give it a shot.

12

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:29.780
OK so let's discuss the answer here.

13

00:00:30.420  -->  00:00:38.010
If we go ahead and create a new object some object equals empty object the first thing that we're doing

14

00:00:38.010  -->  00:00:42.960
is trying to add in Hedwig under the key underscore name.

15

00:00:43.110  -->  00:00:45.330
So does it work to do that.

16

00:00:45.420  -->  00:00:47.480
The answer is yes.

17

00:00:47.610  -->  00:00:52.880
If I look at some object you'll see that we have Headrick stored under underscore name.

18

00:00:52.890  -->  00:00:56.430
It's a little bit unorthodox to see that but it's definitely OK.

19

00:00:56.880  -->  00:01:05.160
So the next one here this is also valid some object dot age you can see get some object it has underscored

20

00:01:05.190  -->  00:01:06.130
name Hedwig.

21

00:01:06.180  -->  00:01:07.910
Age 6.

22

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:12.340
Next up we're using a variable called Propp which is equal to the string color.

23

00:01:12.450  -->  00:01:17.850
And then we're using Propp as the key inside of square brackets and setting the value to be read.

24

00:01:18.090  -->  00:01:27.780
So if we copy this over and we look at some object you'll see that we get color Colan red which is valid

25

00:01:27.790  -->  00:01:28.150
.

26

00:01:28.500  -->  00:01:31.700
Lastly some objects dot one two three.

27

00:01:31.800  -->  00:01:34.860
Setting that to be true that's problematic.

28

00:01:34.980  -->  00:01:38.770
We can't use the dot notation if we have a property starting with a number.

29

00:01:38.820  -->  00:01:40.730
So that's the only one that's an issue.

30

00:01:40.950  -->  00:01:46.430
Although again using underscore is not a great idea but it doesn't cause a problem.

31

00:01:47.820  -->  00:01:49.530
So here's the second exercise.

32

00:01:49.680  -->  00:01:56.280
Have a large nested object and I want you to write code to retrieve the string Malfoy right here from

33

00:01:56.280  -->  00:01:57.470
some object.

34

00:01:57.630  -->  00:01:59.840
And remember to go one layer at a time.

35

00:01:59.910  -->  00:02:04.060
So go ahead post the video and try and write the code to retrieve Malfoy.

36

00:02:04.840  -->  00:02:12.570
OK so the answer here is that we first need to access the friends array and to do that it's some object

37

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:18.420
friends and then we need to access the first object instead of the friends array which is right here

38

00:02:18.430  -->  00:02:18.900
.

39

00:02:19.560  -->  00:02:23.090
And then we need to access the name property out of that array.

40

00:02:23.400  -->  00:02:25.250
So let's type that solution.

41

00:02:25.350  -->  00:02:33.630
I'm going to just copy some object over and we're going to need to start by accessing the friends array

42

00:02:33.650  -->  00:02:33.770
.

43

00:02:33.870  -->  00:02:37.110
So Dot friends or we could use square brackets.

44

00:02:37.260  -->  00:02:42.040
That gives us an array with three different people each one with a name.

45

00:02:42.180  -->  00:02:43.580
We want the first one.

46

00:02:43.710  -->  00:02:46.890
So some object friends bracket zero.

47

00:02:47.040  -->  00:02:50.480
That gives us an object with name equal to Malfoy.

48

00:02:50.670  -->  00:02:53.190
And then we want dot name.

49

00:02:53.250  -->  00:02:55.920
And again we could use square brackets as well.

50

00:02:56.130  -->  00:02:57.480
So that's all we need to do there.

51

00:02:57.480  -->  00:03:04.440
The key to answering these is to go one step at a time burrow down or drill down to friends and then

52

00:03:04.440  -->  00:03:07.270
to the first object and then get name.

53

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:09.810
All right so that's it for this quick set of exercises.
