1

00:00:00,110  -->  00:00:00,530
All right.

2

00:00:00,530  -->  00:00:01,500
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:03,350
So let's start writing some code.

4

00:00:03,480  -->  00:00:07,290
And the first thing we're going to learn how to do is how to select elements.

5

00:00:07,290  -->  00:00:13,190
So just like with regular dominant relation or phonology Yes we need to select things and then manipulate

6

00:00:13,220  -->  00:00:13,310
.

7

00:00:13,380  -->  00:00:17,880
I know I'm a bit of a broken record there but it is a really important process select and then change

8

00:00:17,880  -->  00:00:18,300
things.

9

00:00:18,300  -->  00:00:23,790
This video is going to be mainly focused on selecting elements with J Query for two main objectives

10

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:24,230
here.

11

00:00:24,390  -->  00:00:30,600
The first one is learning how to select elements with the dollar sign function and then also using the

12

00:00:30,740  -->  00:00:33,500
C assessed method to style elements.

13

00:00:33,630  -->  00:00:38,160
So we're not just getting select things just print them out but to make it more visual We'll select

14

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:44,010
them and then change the background color and Jay query we can select everything that we want using

15

00:00:44,010  -->  00:00:45,210
just one function.

16

00:00:45,570  -->  00:00:46,800
The dollar sign.

17

00:00:46,920  -->  00:00:52,860
So unlike vanilla J.S. where we have document that get element by id query selector query selector all

18

00:00:52,920  -->  00:00:55,650
get elements of a class name get elements by tag name.

19

00:00:55,650  -->  00:01:00,660
There are so many different ways of selecting the dollar sign and Jay query will replace all of them

20

00:01:00,680  -->  00:01:00,840
.

21

00:01:00,990  -->  00:01:07,230
It basically works like queries selector all in that we give it a C Ss style selector.

22

00:01:07,320  -->  00:01:12,370
And then Jay query returns all the matching elements that match the selector that we give it.

23

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:18,360
So I have an example here if we wanted to select all of the image tags on the page it just looks like

24

00:01:18,360  -->  00:01:25,460
this if we wanted to select all the elements with class of scale we do dot scale.

25

00:01:25,620  -->  00:01:28,380
Remember this is set style selectors.

26

00:01:28,380  -->  00:01:33,840
So for an ID we need the arc to Thorpe for a class who need the dot and we can also do some more advanced

27

00:01:33,840  -->  00:01:39,000
things like this selecting all anchor tags that are inside of list elements.

28

00:01:39,360  -->  00:01:41,900
So I'll do a quick demo here of how this works.

29

00:01:42,060  -->  00:01:47,750
So we have our Jake Querrey demo aged him our page set up where I have the Cdn included.

30

00:01:48,300  -->  00:01:53,190
And it doesn't matter if we use the N word or if you want to use the downloaded copy it will work the

31

00:01:53,190  -->  00:01:54,180
same way.

32

00:01:54,180  -->  00:01:58,110
So we need that script here and then we need some content to play with.

33

00:01:58,110  -->  00:02:00,410
So I'll keep the H-1 S.J. core demo.

34

00:02:00,510  -->  00:02:05,970
I'll change these allies to make them a bit more unique so I'll fill it with some of my favorite animals

35

00:02:05,990  -->  00:02:06,270
.

36

00:02:06,480  -->  00:02:08,260
So end is for Newt.

37

00:02:08,520  -->  00:02:14,100
My five year old self's favorite part of the animal alphabet song will add in another one of my favorites

38

00:02:14,410  -->  00:02:15,510
album Monkey.

39

00:02:15,870  -->  00:02:19,050
And then lastly the pine martin.

40

00:02:19,680  -->  00:02:24,820
And if you've never seen the pine marten they are equally adorable and terrifying animal.

41

00:02:24,950  -->  00:02:27,190
So you can see pretty adorable here.

42

00:02:28,060  -->  00:02:32,690
But if you take a look at them in action they're crazy predators and pretty scary.

43

00:02:33,000  -->  00:02:33,270
OK.

44

00:02:33,300  -->  00:02:38,770
So some of my favorite animals in the list will save and let's open this up now.

45

00:02:39,720  -->  00:02:41,150
Make sure we're in the right directory.

46

00:02:41,200  -->  00:02:47,730
Jay quarried demo that each Chimo and what I'll do is move this out in its own window and we'll just

47

00:02:47,730  -->  00:02:53,190
go in the console make the font size a little bigger and let's use a query to select some of these things

48

00:02:53,190  -->  00:02:53,620
.

49

00:02:53,640  -->  00:02:56,100
So remember a dollar sign is a function.

50

00:02:56,520  -->  00:03:00,490
And if I just type dollar sign on it's own without the parentheses.

51

00:03:00,720  -->  00:03:06,930
That's just like me typing alert without parentheses or con. dot log without the parentheses doesn't

52

00:03:06,930  -->  00:03:08,700
really do anything except tell me.

53

00:03:08,940  -->  00:03:12,610
Yeah I know about that code but it doesn't actually execute it.

54

00:03:13,170  -->  00:03:16,860
Let's begin by selecting the only H-1 on the page to do that.

55

00:03:16,860  -->  00:03:24,550
We can use dollar sign and the s selector to select h ones is just H-1 and we hit enter.

56

00:03:24,600  -->  00:03:27,480
You can see it returns the J queery demo H-1.

57

00:03:27,630  -->  00:03:30,110
So also notice that it's inside of a list.

58

00:03:30,300  -->  00:03:36,480
So unlike query selector where it returns the first instance the dollar sign selector for.

59

00:03:36,480  -->  00:03:42,360
Query will return a list even if there's only one item which is actually useful and we'll see that in

60

00:03:42,360  -->  00:03:43,310
a little bit.

61

00:03:43,320  -->  00:03:51,570
So let's try selecting all the allies now so we can do something like Dollar Sign ally and we get three

62

00:03:51,570  -->  00:03:53,150
allies just like that.

63

00:03:53,490  -->  00:03:59,130
We can also select the body by typing body and to make things a little more interesting.

64

00:03:59,130  -->  00:04:08,550
Let's go back to our age e-mail and add in an I.D. to pine martin we'll call it adorable as the id and

65

00:04:08,550  -->  00:04:16,560
then we can also on our howler monkey will add an A tag howler monkey and it will just go to monkey

66

00:04:16,620  -->  00:04:20,430
dot com and this will just be monkey dot com.

67

00:04:20,730  -->  00:04:28,640
And if we refresh if I want to select that link I would use dollar sign and I could just do anchor tag

68

00:04:29,130  -->  00:04:30,550
and that will give it to me.

69

00:04:30,600  -->  00:04:34,740
I could also say anchor tag inside of an ally.

70

00:04:34,980  -->  00:04:40,040
I could also if I really wanted to say only the anchor tags inside of allies that are instead of a will

71

00:04:40,040  -->  00:04:40,770
.

72

00:04:41,100  -->  00:04:43,990
And in all cases so far those are identical.

73

00:04:44,160  -->  00:04:51,270
But if I add another anchor tag just at the bottom of the page Google dot com and I refresh.

74

00:04:51,810  -->  00:04:55,290
And now I do my dollar sign anchor tag.

75

00:04:55,290  -->  00:04:57,350
I get both anchor tags.

76

00:04:57,820  -->  00:05:05,370
If I do a dollar sign UL with an ally with an anchor tag inside of that it only gives me this anchor

77

00:05:05,370  -->  00:05:05,820
tag.

78

00:05:05,970  -->  00:05:13,660
Or they could've just shortened it to this here and there we go to select the item with the idea adorable

79

00:05:13,950  -->  00:05:19,700
it works just like queery select or all or query selector or C Ss for that matter where I need the Arctic

80

00:05:19,770  -->  00:05:27,890
or hash symbol Plus the ID name adorable and that gives me the pine marten ally.

81

00:05:27,940  -->  00:05:32,250
So we've seen how we select and it's not very exciting just to print things out to the console or just

82

00:05:32,250  -->  00:05:33,660
to see them returned here.

83

00:05:33,670  -->  00:05:38,530
But I actually want to do is introduce one method we're going to see a lot more methods in the next

84

00:05:38,520  -->  00:05:43,300
few videos but I'm going to show one right now that will help us make things visual and help us alter

85

00:05:43,300  -->  00:05:51,060
the styling so that method is called Dotsie SS and the way that it works is we type a selector dollar

86

00:05:51,060  -->  00:05:57,580
sign and some selector and then we can add Dotsie SS on the end of that and pass it in some properties

87

00:05:57,610  -->  00:06:00,440
and values to change.

88

00:06:00,450  -->  00:06:07,150
So here's an example I'm selecting something with the idea of special and then I'm running up CSSA on

89

00:06:07,140  -->  00:06:11,220
it and changing the border to be two pixel solid red.

90

00:06:11,500  -->  00:06:13,190
So let me demonstrate that.

91

00:06:13,300  -->  00:06:15,400
Let's do it to the H-1.

92

00:06:15,390  -->  00:06:21,390
So I select dollar sign H-1 Dotsie SS Just like this.

93

00:06:21,610  -->  00:06:30,380
And then instead of here let's change the color to be yellow just like that.

94

00:06:30,630  -->  00:06:31,480
And I hit enter.

95

00:06:31,600  -->  00:06:34,980
And you can see it changes to yellow which is awesome.

96

00:06:35,310  -->  00:06:39,420
So it's always good to keep in mind how you would do this without j Querrey.

97

00:06:39,630  -->  00:06:49,270
So we would do something like document that get and let's do document query selector H-1 dot and B don't

98

00:06:49,260  -->  00:06:54,840
have that C Ss So we need to do dot style dot color equals.

99

00:06:54,940  -->  00:06:56,700
And let's change it to orange.

100

00:06:57,690  -->  00:06:58,400
And there we go.

101

00:06:58,440  -->  00:07:04,110
We changed it to orange but this line right here is actually a lot more powerful and can do a lot more

102

00:07:04,380  -->  00:07:06,300
than we can do with this single line here.

103

00:07:06,550  -->  00:07:11,490
So let's suppose that I wanted to change multiple styles about this H-1 I wanted to change the color

104

00:07:11,680  -->  00:07:14,100
and the background color and the border.

105

00:07:14,110  -->  00:07:19,240
What I can do is define my styles in an object and pass an object in.

106

00:07:19,480  -->  00:07:24,250
So I don't have to just do a string Porter comma the value for Porter.

107

00:07:24,550  -->  00:07:29,920
I can define an object with multiple properties multiple key value pairs and pass that in and they will

108

00:07:29,910  -->  00:07:31,070
all be applied.

109

00:07:31,360  -->  00:07:32,500
So let's do that now.

110

00:07:32,760  -->  00:07:37,080
Let's define our styles and we don't have to make a separate object.

111

00:07:37,120  -->  00:07:38,250
I'll show you that.

112

00:07:38,350  -->  00:07:50,220
And instead of here will say color should be red background should be pink and we'll do border should

113

00:07:50,230  -->  00:07:56,340
be two pixels solid purple just like that.

114

00:07:56,740  -->  00:08:02,460
And if we hit Enter we now have our styles object and again that can be called anything.

115

00:08:02,740  -->  00:08:05,060
And then what we'll do is select the H-1.

116

00:08:05,310  -->  00:08:14,200
So dollar sign H-1 again gutsiest us and we just pass in our styles object and all of those styles are

117

00:08:14,190  -->  00:08:14,950
applied.

118

00:08:15,190  -->  00:08:19,720
So to do that without j query would require us to do three separate lines.

119

00:08:19,750  -->  00:08:26,830
You'd need to do document that querist let your H-1 style dark color is equal to red and then dot style

120

00:08:26,880  -->  00:08:32,400
dot background is equal to pink and then that style that border is equal to two pixel solid purple.

121

00:08:32,710  -->  00:08:35,580
Hopefully you can see already that with just a few lines.

122

00:08:35,640  -->  00:08:38,240
J Query is already proven to be pretty powerful.

123

00:08:38,520  -->  00:08:44,020
And while we can do everything without it it's definitely saving us some time and making our code cleaner

124

00:08:44,030  -->  00:08:44,370
.

125

00:08:44,710  -->  00:08:51,330
There's another feature of the dot CSSA method that makes it even more useful that I'll show now what

126

00:08:51,340  -->  00:08:57,570
we can do is actually style multiple elements at once rather than just selecting the first one and making

127

00:08:57,580  -->  00:08:58,160
it yellow.

128

00:08:58,260  -->  00:09:03,290
We could select all the ones or all allies and we just need one line to do that.

129

00:09:03,340  -->  00:09:04,110
So I'll show you that.

130

00:09:04,110  -->  00:09:06,430
Now let's make all the lies.

131

00:09:06,970  -->  00:09:09,580
So to do that I need to select allies.

132

00:09:09,730  -->  00:09:11,550
So just like that.

133

00:09:11,550  -->  00:09:12,650
And if I hit enter.

134

00:09:12,780  -->  00:09:19,120
You'll see that it gives me the three allies and then I need to chain on C Ss and I'll just give it

135

00:09:19,120  -->  00:09:28,410
a single property color and change it to be blue just like that and I'll hit enter and notice this one

136

00:09:28,410  -->  00:09:31,940
line changes all three allies.

137

00:09:32,350  -->  00:09:34,610
So definitely very powerful.

138

00:09:34,650  -->  00:09:41,990
All we do is select with our selector dollar sign ally and that gives us three allies and by doing Dotsie

139

00:09:42,000  -->  00:09:46,030
SS on an array here of ALWIS this list of allies.

140

00:09:46,240  -->  00:09:51,310
It actually will make them all blue and we don't even have to manually loop through like we would without

141

00:09:51,340  -->  00:09:52,320
a query.

142

00:09:52,360  -->  00:09:58,410
So just to remind you if I want to change all of them to be green without query I first need to select

143

00:09:58,480  -->  00:09:59,360
all of them.

144

00:09:59,500  -->  00:10:06,570
So var allies equals document that query selector all pass in the string ally.

145

00:10:06,790  -->  00:10:08,390
And then I need to loop through.

146

00:10:08,520  -->  00:10:15,350
So for var I equals zero is less than Elvises at length I plus plus.

147

00:10:16,260  -->  00:10:22,410
And then inside the loop we need to do allies I that style that color

148

00:10:25,170  -->  00:10:30,100
equals and we'll do green just like that and we'll hit enter.

149

00:10:30,390  -->  00:10:32,850
And you can see they all change to green.

150

00:10:32,860  -->  00:10:36,800
So again it's doable without a query but it's significantly more code.

151

00:10:36,900  -->  00:10:40,780
We need to select them all first and even just selecting them is painful.

152

00:10:40,770  -->  00:10:43,820
This is a lot longer than just a dollar sign.

153

00:10:43,870  -->  00:10:49,060
And then we also need to loop through manually with a for loop or a while loop and then change each

154

00:10:49,060  -->  00:10:53,450
one individually and then we're done with a query though.

155

00:10:53,560  -->  00:11:01,030
All we had to do to change back to blue is select all allies Dotsie SS and then pass in our property

156

00:11:01,090  -->  00:11:02,900
which is blue color blue.

157

00:11:03,420  -->  00:11:05,260
I'll demonstrate a few more examples here.

158

00:11:05,430  -->  00:11:13,710
Let's select all anchor tags just like this a tag that C Ss and will make their font size bigger so

159

00:11:13,710  -->  00:11:20,970
font size and it will be 40 pixels and there we go.

160

00:11:20,980  -->  00:11:27,460
We get big links I'll also show that we can define an object full of styles like we did earlier and

161

00:11:27,450  -->  00:11:31,140
we can use that to style multiple elements not just one.

162

00:11:31,240  -->  00:11:39,120
So we'll select all the lies and style them together and rather than just doing the SS and passing in

163

00:11:39,120  -->  00:11:44,890
a string like color we'll give it an object and just define it in place here.

164

00:11:45,550  -->  00:11:47,920
And we'll add in some space here to type.

165

00:11:48,420  -->  00:11:52,340
And the first thing we'll do is change the font size of all of them.

166

00:11:52,540  -->  00:12:00,300
So NCSA as the font size is font Dasch size or height and size in javascript and in J query we have

167

00:12:00,310  -->  00:12:01,300
to use camel case.

168

00:12:01,480  -->  00:12:09,540
So font size no space or no dash but we uppercase s member that's Kimbal case and we'll make them 10

169

00:12:09,820  -->  00:12:20,930
let's do yet 10 pixels and then we'll add in a border and this one will be three pixel dasht purple

170

00:12:20,930  -->  00:12:21,140
.

171

00:12:21,340  -->  00:12:23,610
Those dashed borders are always stunning.

172

00:12:23,980  -->  00:12:27,840
And then lastly add in the background color background.

173

00:12:28,140  -->  00:12:30,490
And let's just make up our own R.G. color.

174

00:12:30,660  -->  00:12:31,670
So R.G. B.

175

00:12:31,710  -->  00:12:33,540
And we'll do our G.P.A. actually.

176

00:12:33,690  -->  00:12:36,640
And the first one read will too.

177

00:12:37,070  -->  00:12:43,340
89 red 45 Green 20 blue.

178

00:12:43,480  -->  00:12:49,490
And then 0.5 Alpha which is the opacity or transparency channel.

179

00:12:49,620  -->  00:12:54,490
And if we hit enter you can see that all of those are applied at once.

180

00:12:54,630  -->  00:12:58,110
So our font size shrink We've got 10 pixels.

181

00:12:58,260  -->  00:13:05,910
We have these stunning borders around the allies that are three pixels dasht purple and then we have

182

00:13:05,910  -->  00:13:11,620
the background color which is whatever this color turned out to be it looks like sort of a light brownish

183

00:13:11,620  -->  00:13:13,060
color.

184

00:13:13,090  -->  00:13:13,360
All right.

185

00:13:13,360  -->  00:13:18,330
So hopefully you can see from that quick demonstration just two different things that we're doing selecting

186

00:13:18,340  -->  00:13:22,070
with dollar sign and that on its own is incredibly powerful.

187

00:13:22,090  -->  00:13:26,390
It basically works like queery Slichter and queery selector all combined.

188

00:13:26,640  -->  00:13:29,620
And it's a much shorter and easier to write syntax.

189

00:13:29,910  -->  00:13:36,270
And then there's the CSSA method which is also extremely powerful because we can change individual properties

190

00:13:36,270  -->  00:13:42,300
like we did here but we can also massas sign CSSA properties like we did right here where we pass in

191

00:13:42,310  -->  00:13:45,040
an object full of key value pairs.

192

00:13:45,100  -->  00:13:51,270
Probably the most important part of all of this is that when I select a collection like all allies like

193

00:13:51,280  -->  00:13:57,550
I did right here I don't have to manually loop through and apply something individually like I did up

194

00:13:57,550  -->  00:14:03,830
here where we had to loop through all the allies and change the color one at a time with J query.

195

00:14:03,930  -->  00:14:10,710
If I have a collection of elements it automatically loops over that and applies Dotsie assess to every

196

00:14:10,710  -->  00:14:12,990
single one.

197

00:14:12,990  -->  00:14:14,600
So it's extremely powerful.

198

00:14:14,770  -->  00:14:19,770
And that's why as a side note that's why it always returns an array here.

199

00:14:19,890  -->  00:14:25,260
Even if I just have one element with the ID adorable it always returns it in the list because all the

200

00:14:25,270  -->  00:14:28,370
logic behind the scenes involves looping over that list.

201

00:14:28,470  -->  00:14:31,860
So it will loop over this and it just happens that there's one item here.

202

00:14:31,890  -->  00:14:33,030
So it doesn't really loop.

203

00:14:33,040  -->  00:14:34,540
It just goes over one time.

204

00:14:34,890  -->  00:14:38,070
All right hopefully enjoyed that and are starting to see the power of equerry
