00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:01.200
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.410  -->  00:00:07.580
In this video we're going to add in authorization to the comment routes that we just added in so edit

3

00:00:07.650  -->  00:00:13.950
update and destroy the only one to use or to be able to actually edit or update something if that user

4

00:00:14.010  -->  00:00:16.710
owns the comment just like we did for campgrounds.

5

00:00:16.980  -->  00:00:22.950
We'll achieve that with basically the same code where we have a middleware think we called ours check

6

00:00:23.490  -->  00:00:29.070
campground ownership but ours will be called check comment ownership and then we also want to make sure

7

00:00:29.070  -->  00:00:34.620
that we hide and show those buttons so that we don't show a user a delete button that they actually

8

00:00:34.620  -->  00:00:35.620
can't click.

9

00:00:35.640  -->  00:00:37.820
They don't have permission to delete that comment.

10

00:00:38.250  -->  00:00:43.500
Which is also basically the same code that we used for comments or for campgrounds.

11

00:00:43.500  -->  00:00:48.930
And then lastly and this is the only thing that's really new is that I want us to refactor our middleware

12

00:00:48.930  -->  00:00:49.200
.

13

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:55.470
So basically just move all of our middleware out into a new file and require that file will begin by

14

00:00:55.470  -->  00:01:00.910
making sure that a user can't get to the edit route if he or she doesn't own that comment.

15

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:04.750
So let's go to the route instead of our comments here.

16

00:01:05.120  -->  00:01:06.840
And let's go to Edit.

17

00:01:07.680  -->  00:01:10.630
We want a middleware here that will do the checking for us.

18

00:01:10.740  -->  00:01:18.990
So check comments ownership just like we did in the last video or in the last campground video where

19

00:01:18.990  -->  00:01:24.870
we did check campground ownership and if we take a look at that code going to just copy the whole thing

20

00:01:24.870  -->  00:01:25.310
over.

21

00:01:25.320  -->  00:01:35.130
It's kind of long put it at the bottom with our other middle where we'll change that name check comments

22

00:01:35.160  -->  00:01:36.360
ownership.

23

00:01:36.510  -->  00:01:41.870
The first thing we do is check is the user log in is any user logged in.

24

00:01:42.510  -->  00:01:49.920
If not just redirect them back and will show a message eventually that says please sign it or you have

25

00:01:49.920  -->  00:01:51.220
to be signed to do that.

26

00:01:51.390  -->  00:01:55.560
And that's a different error than you not being the correct owner.

27

00:01:55.560  -->  00:01:57.830
So we don't want to just say you don't have permission to do that.

28

00:01:57.840  -->  00:02:04.620
Always we want to say sign in first and then if you do sign in and you still don't own it then we'll

29

00:02:04.620  -->  00:02:05.940
send a different message.

30

00:02:05.970  -->  00:02:09.500
For now it doesn't matter because we don't have those messages.

31

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:14.940
So if you are signed in we need to find the comment comment out fine by Friday.

32

00:02:15.060  -->  00:02:24.260
It's not request up tramstop ID request up tramstop comments Id change this to be found comment.

33

00:02:24.990  -->  00:02:27.690
If there's an error redirect back that's fine.

34

00:02:27.840  -->  00:02:31.700
Else let's change your comment to make it a little clearer.

35

00:02:31.770  -->  00:02:33.020
And I keep saying comment.

36

00:02:33.270  -->  00:02:38.460
I mean change the javascript comment not the actual comment model.

37

00:02:38.490  -->  00:02:47.840
Then we need to check if the found comment author that ID equals request that user ID.

38

00:02:47.850  -->  00:02:51.530
So let's take a look again at the model for comment.

39

00:02:51.570  -->  00:02:59.160
Remember we have an author and that author has an ID and it's a mongoose I.D. So we can't do triple

40

00:02:59.160  -->  00:03:00.970
equals just like with campground.

41

00:03:01.140  -->  00:03:07.170
So if found comment out author ID dot equals that special method we're comparing it to the logged in

42

00:03:07.180  -->  00:03:12.560
user's ID which is stored inside request that user thanks to passport.

43

00:03:12.630  -->  00:03:18.960
So if that's the case everything is good which means we can move on and run the route handler next.

44

00:03:19.290  -->  00:03:27.060
Otherwise redirect back and again the reason I separated all of this out even though it's redstart redirect

45

00:03:27.060  -->  00:03:32.940
back three different times so that we can specify a different error message once we get to that in just

46

00:03:32.940  -->  00:03:34.690
a few videos from now.

47

00:03:34.710  -->  00:03:37.350
So let's now make sure everything else is good.

48

00:03:37.350  -->  00:03:38.400
Check common ownership.

49

00:03:38.400  -->  00:03:40.530
We have that up here.

50

00:03:40.690  -->  00:03:41.920
We need to go to Edit route.

51

00:03:41.940  -->  00:03:44.770
We added that in check comment ownership.

52

00:03:44.770  -->  00:03:49.290
Great let's give it a shot and see what happens.

53

00:03:51.150  -->  00:03:52.470
Good.

54

00:03:53.070  -->  00:03:55.400
So everyone should be able to get here.

55

00:03:55.500  -->  00:04:00.210
I'm not logged in right now so if I click it it takes me back here.

56

00:04:00.210  -->  00:04:01.470
Perfect.

57

00:04:01.470  -->  00:04:13.890
Now if I do log in as Sirius Black who created that comment and I try that again at it it now works

58

00:04:13.890  -->  00:04:15.410
.

59

00:04:15.630  -->  00:04:18.220
Let's just add some expert stuff in here.

60

00:04:18.690  -->  00:04:21.820
Now that's not protected because that's the update route.

61

00:04:21.870  -->  00:04:26.970
So we actually just do the exact same thing which is why it's so nice that we moved it into a separate

62

00:04:26.970  -->  00:04:33.510
function because we could just have all of that code right here and then duplicated it back for update

63

00:04:33.540  -->  00:04:34.270
as well.

64

00:04:34.380  -->  00:04:36.560
Right here.

65

00:04:37.410  -->  00:04:38.720
And for destroy.

66

00:04:38.730  -->  00:04:41.590
But let's just leave it at that for now.

67

00:04:41.700  -->  00:04:44.790
Make sure that it works.

68

00:04:44.790  -->  00:04:53.580
So theoretically I could somehow end up sending an update request from postman or something like that

69

00:04:53.970  -->  00:04:55.940
from some other app.

70

00:04:55.980  -->  00:05:00.300
However you know a user would do that which is would be very rare but theoretically someone could do

71

00:05:00.300  -->  00:05:00.980
that.

72

00:05:01.530  -->  00:05:07.920
And without adding the check comment ownership to update it wouldn't be protected.

73

00:05:08.520  -->  00:05:12.260
But we won't notice anything different here if I try at it.

74

00:05:12.330  -->  00:05:18.400
Same problem if I log back in and you can just skip through this if you don't really care to see it

75

00:05:18.410  -->  00:05:18.840
.

76

00:05:20.460  -->  00:05:30.020
Not the most exciting part of this course watching me log in now if I edit update works fine.

77

00:05:30.060  -->  00:05:36.210
And if I had signed out at that point or if my data was wrong or something weird happened it would then

78

00:05:36.840  -->  00:05:40.610
redirect me back and eventually show a message.

79

00:05:40.870  -->  00:05:44.350
OK so that's update now if I do click on delete.

80

00:05:44.400  -->  00:05:45.570
When I'm not signed in

81

00:05:50.670  -->  00:05:56.330
I can delete that comment which is obviously not what we want to happen so let's fix that.

82

00:05:56.740  -->  00:05:59.080
Let's go to a page that does have comments.

83

00:05:59.150  -->  00:06:01.100
This one doesn't have one.

84

00:06:01.150  -->  00:06:08.400
Let me add a comment in once again not the most exciting.

85

00:06:08.410  -->  00:06:11.880
Oh and I typed a comment at the password incorrectly.

86

00:06:12.600  -->  00:06:13.720
Oh dear.

87

00:06:14.010  -->  00:06:16.130
Let's try that one more time.

88

00:06:16.980  -->  00:06:17.790
OK.

89

00:06:18.060  -->  00:06:19.610
Let's go to Rocky Mountain high.

90

00:06:19.740  -->  00:06:23.150
Add a comment in to me.

91

00:06:23.800  -->  00:06:24.530
OK.

92

00:06:25.260  -->  00:06:29.960
So I don't want a user to be able to delete this unless they're logged in.

93

00:06:29.960  -->  00:06:31.950
It's exactly the same.

94

00:06:31.950  -->  00:06:33.470
Super easy for us.

95

00:06:33.720  -->  00:06:38.410
Just find the destroy route add or middle Waren and that's all we need.

96

00:06:39.060  -->  00:06:44.160
So if we try it I just showed you that currently before we made that change.

97

00:06:44.160  -->  00:06:45.360
Anyone can delete.

98

00:06:45.570  -->  00:06:52.030
Now if I refresh I'm not logged in I clicked delete and it's still there.

99

00:06:52.410  -->  00:06:54.350
Refuses to delete.

100

00:06:54.360  -->  00:07:00.040
Great last big step is showing and hiding these buttons appropriately.

101

00:07:00.090  -->  00:07:03.410
So let me sign in or sign up as someone else.

102

00:07:03.690  -->  00:07:08.600
Let's sign up as Dumble door to door.

103

00:07:08.760  -->  00:07:11.520
Password is also password.

104

00:07:11.520  -->  00:07:16.080
Sign up.

105

00:07:16.110  -->  00:07:22.250
Let's added comments in as well.

106

00:07:22.590  -->  00:07:24.910
Now two different comments two different authors.

107

00:07:25.020  -->  00:07:29.570
If I'm signed in this double door I only want to see the delete buttons here.

108

00:07:29.580  -->  00:07:32.680
These should be hidden for me so to do that.

109

00:07:32.730  -->  00:07:37.520
Take a look at how he did it on the show page for campground delete and edit buttons.

110

00:07:37.560  -->  00:07:39.550
Which is right here.

111

00:07:39.600  -->  00:07:49.050
This single line IF current user and campground author data equals current user ID then we show this

112

00:07:49.800  -->  00:07:54.600
very very similar except for a few changes.

113

00:07:54.690  -->  00:07:59.680
First of which is it's not campgrounds at author dot.

114

00:08:00.630  -->  00:08:05.060
It's comments author and that's defined here in our foreach.

115

00:08:05.070  -->  00:08:13.410
So whatever this is in our case for each campground comments array call it comments display the author

116

00:08:13.520  -->  00:08:17.340
display the text and then check if there is a current user.

117

00:08:17.430  -->  00:08:22.950
And if that current user's ID is here which is stored.

118

00:08:22.950  -->  00:08:26.490
There's a lot of moving pieces here but I will review this briefly.

119

00:08:26.490  -->  00:08:36.260
This is coming from that one line that we added to Abdoulaye us up top that add in.

120

00:08:36.270  -->  00:08:39.240
Where are you right here.

121

00:08:39.240  -->  00:08:43.570
Current User to every single one of our templates.

122

00:08:43.680  -->  00:08:47.740
Current User equals request user and request users coming from passport.

123

00:08:47.760  -->  00:08:50.250
It has the user information so current user.

124

00:08:50.550  -->  00:08:56.220
If there is one we have to do that check if there is one because if we don't have this first part and

125

00:08:56.220  -->  00:09:02.700
all we have is this if there is no current user it will give us an error saying current user is undefined

126

00:09:02.720  -->  00:09:03.150
.

127

00:09:03.540  -->  00:09:06.420
OK so common that authored that ID.

128

00:09:06.420  -->  00:09:15.570
The last thing we need is to add in our closing bracket or a curly brace for the if statement.

129

00:09:15.990  -->  00:09:17.120
No equal sign.

130

00:09:17.490  -->  00:09:19.860
So this is all enclosed in that if statement.

131

00:09:20.190  -->  00:09:23.180
Let's give it a shot to start.

132

00:09:23.180  -->  00:09:28.540
If I were fresh it will log me out and we expect to see no buttons.

133

00:09:28.770  -->  00:09:37.410
Perfect seinen will do double door.

134

00:09:38.920  -->  00:09:42.410
Go back to Rocky Mountain High and we only see those buttons.

135

00:09:42.420  -->  00:09:43.110
Perfect.

136

00:09:43.230  -->  00:09:45.320
Make sure this still works.

137

00:09:46.160  -->  00:09:50.690
Looks good but still it also looks good.

138

00:09:50.700  -->  00:09:52.710
Now let's sign in as Sirius Black

139

00:09:52.710  -->  00:10:00.960
.

140

00:10:00.960  -->  00:10:04.440
Now we expect to see the buttons and we do.

141

00:10:04.530  -->  00:10:07.230
Perfect and I can also delete this now.

142

00:10:07.460  -->  00:10:09.750
Let's delete it.

143

00:10:09.960  -->  00:10:12.270
I want to leave that campground because campgrounds are precious.

144

00:10:12.270  -->  00:10:15.330
We need this takes a while to add a new one back in
