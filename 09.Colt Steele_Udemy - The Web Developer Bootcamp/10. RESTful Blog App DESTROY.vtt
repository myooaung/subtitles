00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:01.260
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.260  -->  00:00:06.870
So we have one more route to finish up which is our destroy route which is how we can delete a particular

3

00:00:06.870  -->  00:00:09.350
blog or in this case a dog.

4

00:00:09.720  -->  00:00:16.080
So it's a delete request that's the verb we have to use our underscore method with method override to

5

00:00:16.080  -->  00:00:17.050
make that work.

6

00:00:17.490  -->  00:00:22.650
And then we also need to have an ID in the path because we're deleting a particular thing.

7

00:00:22.830  -->  00:00:27.630
And typically your delete route or your destroy route will delete something and then redirect you somewhere

8

00:00:27.630  -->  00:00:28.390
else.

9

00:00:28.440  -->  00:00:33.900
Usually the index because there is no show page to redirect you to if you've just deleted the thing

10

00:00:34.080  -->  00:00:35.690
that you would redirect to.

11

00:00:35.700  -->  00:00:39.390
So let's go back and let's start by defining her route.

12

00:00:40.080  -->  00:00:43.930
So the last one I know it's been a little bit of a marathon.

13

00:00:44.070  -->  00:00:54.440
So we have our delete route and it should be an app out delete slash blog slash colon ID at our Colback

14

00:00:54.450  -->  00:01:06.590
in and both just do what we did with Update response that send the we destroy route.

15

00:01:07.170  -->  00:01:11.660
Let's say you have reached the Detroit route.

16

00:01:12.660  -->  00:01:15.890
Great save.

17

00:01:16.080  -->  00:01:21.570
And just like with the update or really with any of these routes this doesn't have to be a delete request

18

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:27.570
in order to delete something like I could make this a get request that's just blog slash ID slash delete

19

00:01:28.110  -->  00:01:30.580
or remove or whatever I want.

20

00:01:30.870  -->  00:01:36.870
It's just if we're following restful routing conventions and needs to be a delete request OK.

21

00:01:36.930  -->  00:01:41.920
So after that we blog session ID inside of here we're just sending back.

22

00:01:41.940  -->  00:01:43.660
You are free to distort.

23

00:01:43.980  -->  00:01:50.610
Now we need a way to hit that route so we can go to our show template and let's just do it underneath

24

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:56.830
the post here will have a button that just says delete.

25

00:01:57.060  -->  00:02:04.160
So we'll go back to show and just under here to make this work we need to add in a form actually.

26

00:02:04.170  -->  00:02:13.410
So we need another form just like we did with update and we can start simple method is post and that's

27

00:02:13.410  -->  00:02:16.470
because it has to be using method override.

28

00:02:16.470  -->  00:02:23.950
It needs to be a post request but then we need to send or action which is equal to you or else a site

29

00:02:23.970  -->  00:02:24.750
blog.

30

00:02:24.990  -->  00:02:26.670
And we need the ID there.

31

00:02:26.900  -->  00:02:30.890
And that needs to be added in with Ejaz tags logged out.

32

00:02:30.900  -->  00:02:37.890
Underscore Id remember blog is what we're passing in when we find it in the database using find by ID

33

00:02:37.890  -->  00:02:38.160
.

34

00:02:38.160  -->  00:02:39.860
So we're passing that through.

35

00:02:41.100  -->  00:02:47.970
But this isn't enough because making a post request to blog slash logged that ID is not going to be

36

00:02:47.970  -->  00:02:48.970
our daily route.

37

00:02:48.990  -->  00:02:53.690
We need to add an underscore method equals delete.

38

00:02:54.480  -->  00:02:58.890
I still think it's weird after years of doing this it's kind of annoying but it's just what you have

39

00:02:58.890  -->  00:02:59.260
to do.

40

00:02:59.340  -->  00:03:03.210
So under schwere method is delete then inside the form.

41

00:03:03.210  -->  00:03:05.700
All we need is a single button to submit the form.

42

00:03:06.060  -->  00:03:14.430
So I add in a button tag and our button will just say delete just delete and or add in a class here

43

00:03:14.610  -->  00:03:17.470
just to make it look a little nicer using semantic.

44

00:03:17.670  -->  00:03:23.910
We can just do a UI read basic button and you can pick your own color if you want or ensure you aren't

45

00:03:23.910  -->  00:03:25.380
one of the inverted ones.

46

00:03:25.380  -->  00:03:26.260
Or a custom color.

47

00:03:26.280  -->  00:03:29.480
But this is fine for me red basic button that says delete.

48

00:03:29.550  -->  00:03:32.860
It will submit this form sends a request.

49

00:03:32.880  -->  00:03:34.240
Technically a post request.

50

00:03:34.320  -->  00:03:39.870
But our method override sees this and it treats it as a delete request which will hopefully trigger

51

00:03:40.230  -->  00:03:40.670
this code.

52

00:03:40.670  -->  00:03:43.780
Here we should see you have reached the destroy route.

53

00:03:44.120  -->  00:03:48.120
OK let's give it a shot.

54

00:03:48.840  -->  00:03:51.180
So we have a button click.

55

00:03:51.450  -->  00:03:51.990
Great.

56

00:03:52.140  -->  00:03:55.170
I get the rest out send you freaks the destroy route.

57

00:03:55.610  -->  00:03:58.200
So the last thing we have to do is actually destroy it.

58

00:03:58.200  -->  00:04:00.750
Instead of that route.

59

00:04:00.780  -->  00:04:02.730
So again it's a two step process.

60

00:04:02.780  -->  00:04:05.010
There are two main things we do.

61

00:04:05.010  -->  00:04:09.780
Destroy the log and then redirect somewhere.

62

00:04:10.500  -->  00:04:11.600
So to destroy.

63

00:04:11.850  -->  00:04:14.660
We're fortunate there's another nice method.

64

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:24.300
Fine by id and remove and that needs an ID which again is request up harams that ID and then our callback

65

00:04:25.080  -->  00:04:29.760
which just takes the error because there is no data that will want to do anything with coming back.

66

00:04:29.760  -->  00:04:31.840
If we delete something it's gone.

67

00:04:32.130  -->  00:04:35.370
So we'll leave it at that and check if there's an error.

68

00:04:35.370  -->  00:04:39.900
If there is we'll handle it relatively poorly.

69

00:04:40.020  -->  00:04:41.490
We won't give any messages or anything.

70

00:04:41.490  -->  00:04:47.880
I'll just redirect to sashed Largs Again else will actually do the same thing.

71

00:04:48.450  -->  00:04:53.310
But I will leave this statement in here just because it's good practice to check for an error even if

72

00:04:53.310  -->  00:04:54.380
we're doing the same thing.

73

00:04:54.400  -->  00:04:56.310
There's identical outcomes.

74

00:04:56.760  -->  00:04:59.000
OK so let's see what happens.

75

00:04:59.050  -->  00:05:07.890
Now redirecting the slash blogs after we find by id and remove a particular blog Let's fire it up.

76

00:05:08.310  -->  00:05:13.500
Let's go back to the root path and let's find one that's worth reading.

77

00:05:13.500  -->  00:05:17.100
So I think one of these is missing a title.

78

00:05:17.430  -->  00:05:18.640
Yes this one here.

79

00:05:18.840  -->  00:05:25.870
So let's remove that quick undelete and hopefully.

80

00:05:25.930  -->  00:05:27.390
Yup there we go what's missing.

81

00:05:27.570  -->  00:05:28.800
So let's delete this one again.

82

00:05:28.810  -->  00:05:31.040
It has a gigantic image.

83

00:05:31.400  -->  00:05:32.910
We need to go to the show page.

84

00:05:33.060  -->  00:05:36.800
Read more and then click on that.

85

00:05:37.980  -->  00:05:40.220
And that's deleted as well.

86

00:05:40.260  -->  00:05:43.810
Now we're just back to these adorable bulldog's.

87

00:05:43.890  -->  00:05:46.810
All right so that's all there is to restful routes.

88

00:05:46.830  -->  00:05:47.330
It's a lot.

89

00:05:47.340  -->  00:05:52.740
I know this is something that when I had teachers in person when we have three months or six months

90

00:05:53.460  -->  00:05:56.510
we hit this hard for two plus weeks.

91

00:05:56.790  -->  00:06:02.460
I would have to build an app for dogs and then repeat the same thing for something equally boring like

92

00:06:02.460  -->  00:06:07.810
cats and users and friends and photos and you just get used to this pattern.

93

00:06:07.950  -->  00:06:12.510
And actually when the exercise is I really recommend you do that is not going to be all that fun or

94

00:06:12.510  -->  00:06:19.070
glamorous really is just to redo what we just did but with another thing.

95

00:06:19.080  -->  00:06:20.410
So not a blog.

96

00:06:20.550  -->  00:06:21.380
Maybe a dog.

97

00:06:21.390  -->  00:06:22.440
That's fine.

98

00:06:22.440  -->  00:06:23.940
Maybe you do it for a book.

99

00:06:24.000  -->  00:06:25.790
Maybe you do it for a movie it doesn't matter.

100

00:06:25.950  -->  00:06:29.550
But just something that you have all seven routes for.

101

00:06:29.580  -->  00:06:32.630
This is really important that you try and get comfortable with.

102

00:06:32.790  -->  00:06:38.250
We'll be using it all the time you know I'll be hitting it pretty hard and reiterating as we go.

103

00:06:38.520  -->  00:06:42.070
But if you wanted to start building your own apps and that's one of your goals.

104

00:06:42.510  -->  00:06:45.330
Memorize this type up the table from scratch.

105

00:06:45.330  -->  00:06:50.850
It's good practice to use a bootstrap table to the last small modification will make is to add an edit

106

00:06:50.880  -->  00:06:53.180
link to the show page.

107

00:06:53.220  -->  00:06:55.740
Right now we don't have a nice way of getting to it.

108

00:06:55.770  -->  00:06:57.360
So very simple.

109

00:06:57.360  -->  00:07:02.440
Just make another button just like we have with our delete.

110

00:07:02.580  -->  00:07:03.530
So I'll just copy that.

111

00:07:03.540  -->  00:07:06.450
Except it needs to be an anchor tag.

112

00:07:07.440  -->  00:07:11.760
Because we're not sending a form or not sending a post request just to get request.

113

00:07:11.820  -->  00:07:22.440
So a breath should be on just copy this blog's slash ID slash at it and this should just say at it and

114

00:07:22.440  -->  00:07:23.400
we're missing a quote.

115

00:07:23.430  -->  00:07:24.750
We have one too many quotes.

116

00:07:24.750  -->  00:07:25.520
There we go.

117

00:07:25.680  -->  00:07:31.320
Let's add in our class equal to and we'll do you.

118

00:07:31.730  -->  00:07:33.510
Let's do orange.

119

00:07:33.840  -->  00:07:42.930
Basic button save are fresh and we have are at it but you will notice that they're on different lines

120

00:07:42.930  -->  00:07:43.260
.

121

00:07:43.260  -->  00:07:49.120
The reason for that is that forms by default are not in line elements like an anchor tags.

122

00:07:49.260  -->  00:07:58.650
So if we inspect and select the form not the button but the form and I give it display in line.

123

00:07:58.650  -->  00:08:01.740
Notice that it jumps up like that which is probably what we want.

124

00:08:02.160  -->  00:08:08.070
So to do that there's no easy way as far as I know using semantic to do it without writing your own

125

00:08:08.100  -->  00:08:09.220
success.

126

00:08:09.240  -->  00:08:14.120
So what we'll do is just to find something in our CSSA file.

127

00:08:14.190  -->  00:08:20.780
So we open up after upsy assess and we'll just find an ID called Delete form.

128

00:08:21.030  -->  00:08:28.950
We'll just call it delete and this the styles for that will just be display in line.

129

00:08:28.950  -->  00:08:33.130
Now we just need to go over to our form which is right here.

130

00:08:33.300  -->  00:08:37.960
Just give it id equals the we and we should be good to go now.

131

00:08:38.070  -->  00:08:42.490
If I refresh it stays exactly the same.

132

00:08:42.720  -->  00:08:43.320
Perfect.

133

00:08:43.320  -->  00:08:47.280
So still month the most stylish not the most beautiful thing but it works for this.

134

00:08:47.340  -->  00:08:48.960
We're not going for anything crazy.

135

00:08:49.050  -->  00:08:49.440
Great.

136

00:08:49.470  -->  00:08:51.250
So the next video is optional.

137

00:08:51.390  -->  00:08:54.480
We're going to talk about styling the home page a bit.

138

00:08:54.660  -->  00:08:55.880
You guessed it it needs some work.

139

00:08:55.980  -->  00:09:01.290
And I'll talk about sanitizing the input that's coming from the user so that they can't do anything

140

00:09:01.290  -->  00:09:07.100
malicious they can't write a script tag that will run code when we display the post.

141

00:09:07.830  -->  00:09:08.320
OK.

142

00:09:08.390  -->  00:09:09.450
So in the next video
