1

00:00:00,080  -->  00:00:00,880
Well come back.

2

00:00:01,050  -->  00:00:02,870
So this video is going to be pretty short.

3

00:00:02,880  -->  00:00:06,000
We're just going to discuss how we make lists in HCM out.

4

00:00:06,210  -->  00:00:09,040
So how do we make numbered lists or bullet point analysts.

5

00:00:09,090  -->  00:00:10,530
How do we have nested busts.

6

00:00:10,530  -->  00:00:12,710
This is something that we do a lot on our Web sites.

7

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:16,200
It's all sorts of thing you know academic papers did a lot and they still do.

8

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:18,900
Which is why it was originally incorporated in each team.

9

00:00:19,320  -->  00:00:22,050
So there are two types of lists that we can define.

10

00:00:22,050  -->  00:00:26,690
One is an ordered list which would look something like this.

11

00:00:28,530  -->  00:00:34,730
And another is an unordered list which works the same way except we have bullet points here.

12

00:00:34,830  -->  00:00:38,450
So we'll start by talking about an ordered list and the tag for that.

13

00:00:38,460  -->  00:00:42,120
It's called an AOL stands for ordered list.

14

00:00:42,690  -->  00:00:46,170
And if we just do that and refresh this page nothing changes.

15

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:49,460
And that's because an ordered list on its own doesn't mean anything.

16

00:00:49,530  -->  00:00:56,880
We have to provide it with list elements or list items which is what Ally stands for every numbered

17

00:00:56,880  -->  00:01:00,540
point that we want every item in the list needs to be an ally tag.

18

00:01:00,750  -->  00:01:01,860
So we're going to make a list.

19

00:01:01,890  -->  00:01:10,770
Let's do something short let's say a list of colors so red she can copy this line.

20

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:15,660
Orange yellow.

21

00:01:15,660  -->  00:01:18,620
So this list is ordered.

22

00:01:18,750  -->  00:01:23,860
I refresh the page and you can see I get a list with numbers there.

23

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:27,360
And you can change this with CSSA you can change it to be Roman numerals.

24

00:01:27,360  -->  00:01:28,440
We'll talk about that.

25

00:01:28,510  -->  00:01:32,600
And another lesson what's important though is that it has an order.

26

00:01:33,210  -->  00:01:45,270
So if we copy this we do the exact same thing but we change it to be a u l and I refresh the page you'll

27

00:01:45,270  -->  00:01:50,570
see that I have a numbered list which is ordered and an unordered list with bullet points.

28

00:01:50,940  -->  00:01:52,740
So just by changing Oh well.

29

00:01:52,920  -->  00:02:00,900
Well I go from ordered to an ordered both of them require list items inside what we can do just to show

30

00:02:00,900  -->  00:02:05,710
you we can nest any of the other tags that we've seen like strong or emphasized.

31

00:02:05,730  -->  00:02:14,090
So let's make it red folded just like that.

32

00:02:14,580  -->  00:02:17,690
And you can see red is bolded.

33

00:02:17,730  -->  00:02:22,510
Likewise we can also nest other lists inside of a list.

34

00:02:22,590  -->  00:02:30,660
So let's say I wanted to have a list under yellow I wanted it to list a few shades of yellow inside

35

00:02:30,660  -->  00:02:32,310
this ally.

36

00:02:32,370  -->  00:02:39,870
I can actually add in another a much do and an ordered list and you'll see there.

37

00:02:39,900  -->  00:02:45,290
This is the first time I've certainly this can type the tag name and hit tab in autocomplete.

38

00:02:45,720  -->  00:02:52,440
So I have another well an unordered list inside of that I'm going to name my first shade of yellow which

39

00:02:52,440  -->  00:03:03,350
is sunflower and then another ally and another shade of yellow which will be banana.

40

00:03:03,360  -->  00:03:04,210
Let's take a look.

41

00:03:04,230  -->  00:03:08,720
You've got an ordered list with numbers one two three.

42

00:03:08,800  -->  00:03:16,410
And then inside of that third list item I have another bullet point first with two types of yellow and

43

00:03:16,410  -->  00:03:19,950
you'll see I end up at this nested list structure.

44

00:03:20,460  -->  00:03:27,420
So then of course under banana I could do another list something like let's do another.

45

00:03:27,420  -->  00:03:30,260
This time let's go back to an ordered list.

46

00:03:30,420  -->  00:03:31,330
Another lie.

47

00:03:31,350  -->  00:03:33,560
I'm really running out of ideas for bananas.

48

00:03:33,570  -->  00:03:36,450
Let's just do a frozen banana

49

00:03:39,720  -->  00:03:48,300
and non frozen banana and you can see we get a numbered list inside of a bullet point of least inside

50

00:03:48,300  -->  00:03:49,720
of a numbered list.

51

00:03:50,190  -->  00:03:50,610
OK.

52

00:03:50,670  -->  00:03:52,360
So that's what I want to show about lists.

53

00:03:52,380  -->  00:03:57,540
We can combine all of these together to make some interesting things we can build things I italicised

54

00:03:57,540  -->  00:04:01,110
them we can put a heading before a list so I could do something like

55

00:04:06,510  -->  00:04:09,960
my color list.

56

00:04:10,080  -->  00:04:10,710
Very exciting.

57

00:04:10,710  -->  00:04:12,330
I know we're getting there though.

58

00:04:12,390  -->  00:04:17,910
This is underlying everything that we do every Web site uses these types of elements behind the scenes

59

00:04:17,920  -->  00:04:18,070
.

60

00:04:18,210  -->  00:04:21,430
So even though these are not beautiful sites yet they're not very useful.

61

00:04:21,450  -->  00:04:22,710
It's really really important.

62

00:04:22,710  -->  00:04:26,880
So next we're going to do a quick little exercise I mean if you build something we're going to give

63

00:04:26,880  -->  00:04:31,280
you a little image how we construct it and then we'll meet back up afterwards.
