00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:05.490
Welcome back in this lesson which is part 3 of adding authentication to your camp we're going to focus

2

00:00:05.490  -->  00:00:11.520
on loggin will be writing the two in routes and then also the log and template with the form kids started

3

00:00:11.520  -->  00:00:12.230
here.

4

00:00:12.720  -->  00:00:15.840
So just like register log in needs to have two routes.

5

00:00:15.960  -->  00:00:20.790
This should be a bit of a review from the last unit where we covered in more detail but we need a GET

6

00:00:20.790  -->  00:00:25.260
request to show the form and then opposed to actually do the logging in.

7

00:00:25.260  -->  00:00:28.620
So let's start with the form and I'll add a comment here.

8

00:00:28.620  -->  00:00:31.830
Show log in form just like that.

9

00:00:32.250  -->  00:00:41.040
And then once you've an appetite get slashed log in our request response and the callback every go and

10

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:46.130
then will render the log in template that doesn't exist yet.

11

00:00:46.140  -->  00:00:49.920
Now let's create that touch views slash log in.

12

00:00:49.960  -->  00:00:50.320
E.J..

13

00:00:50.340  -->  00:00:52.200
Yes and now it's open that

14

00:00:55.020  -->  00:00:55.890
much to start with.

15

00:00:55.880  -->  00:01:02.660
And each one that just says log in and save a start the server.

16

00:01:03.420  -->  00:01:08.070
Let's go to our app and try and visit slash logon.

17

00:01:08.100  -->  00:01:08.910
There we go.

18

00:01:08.910  -->  00:01:09.770
Looks good.

19

00:01:10.010  -->  00:01:11.910
No lunch at the forum.

20

00:01:12.180  -->  00:01:18.690
So we need to have a form tag and let's start with our inputs and put type calls text and we could just

21

00:01:18.690  -->  00:01:20.260
steal this from the register form.

22

00:01:20.490  -->  00:01:23.070
But it's good practice to type it again from scratch.

23

00:01:23.070  -->  00:01:32.230
So input type goes text name equals username placeholder equals username as well.

24

00:01:33.180  -->  00:01:45.210
And then another one input type equals password name equals password placeholder equals password.

25

00:01:45.210  -->  00:01:50.430
And then rather than doing a button which I've been doing I'm just going to use an input type submit

26

00:01:50.640  -->  00:01:53.430
just to demonstrate that you can use either one.

27

00:01:53.440  -->  00:01:55.590
So input type submit.

28

00:01:56.580  -->  00:01:58.140
And then we need to give it a value.

29

00:01:58.590  -->  00:02:00.100
And that's what will actually show up.

30

00:02:00.150  -->  00:02:05.780
So value will just say log in but save Take a look at our form.

31

00:02:06.200  -->  00:02:06.770
OK.

32

00:02:06.960  -->  00:02:07.880
We have the form.

33

00:02:07.920  -->  00:02:13.680
It doesn't do anything right now because we need to give it an action and a method.

34

00:02:14.160  -->  00:02:20.490
And just like register on register we have a post request that we're making to slash register on the

35

00:02:20.490  -->  00:02:21.540
logon form.

36

00:02:21.540  -->  00:02:25.040
We're going to make a post request to slash logon.

37

00:02:25.620  -->  00:02:34.110
So action should be social logon and the method should be post and we'll save it to make sure that works

38

00:02:34.110  -->  00:02:34.640
.

39

00:02:35.010  -->  00:02:40.740
Then if I hit log in right now we'll get a little message that says can not post slash log in because

40

00:02:40.740  -->  00:02:42.750
we don't have a route for that.

41

00:02:42.750  -->  00:02:49.530
So I'll go back to actually yes and add in our log in route and this route will be responsible for handling

42

00:02:50.010  -->  00:02:51.970
log in logic.

43

00:02:52.380  -->  00:02:59.750
So amped up post slash log in at our callback.

44

00:02:59.790  -->  00:03:05.100
And then what we'll do is just do a simple read send log in.

45

00:03:05.190  -->  00:03:12.360
Logic happens here and we just want to make sure we see that and we do have to restart the server whenever

46

00:03:12.360  -->  00:03:15.420
we change or add a new route.

47

00:03:15.420  -->  00:03:18.140
Now let's refresh type anything.

48

00:03:18.240  -->  00:03:23.290
We actually don't even have to fill those out log in and we get log in logic happens here.

49

00:03:23.610  -->  00:03:24.300
All right.

50

00:03:24.420  -->  00:03:24.720
Great.

51

00:03:24.720  -->  00:03:29.700
So we have the routes that up correctly but I'm actually going to get rid of all this because if you

52

00:03:29.700  -->  00:03:34.300
remember back from the last unit the way that we can do log in is by using a middleware.

53

00:03:34.590  -->  00:03:35.690
And that's the passport.

54

00:03:35.720  -->  00:03:36.960
Authenticate middleware.

55

00:03:37.050  -->  00:03:42.400
So add that in here Khama passport dot authenticate.

56

00:03:42.780  -->  00:03:45.530
And then inside we need to provide local.

57

00:03:45.720  -->  00:03:51.600
And then after local as a second argument we provide an object and that object will take two things

58

00:03:51.660  -->  00:03:53.040
success.

59

00:03:53.040  -->  00:03:54.300
Redirect.

60

00:03:54.750  -->  00:04:03.580
And if a user successfully logs in let's redirect to slash campgrounds and a failure redirect and let's

61

00:04:03.580  -->  00:04:08.020
indent this now that we have enough text here.

62

00:04:08.910  -->  00:04:13.020
OK so success redirect and a failure redirect

63

00:04:16.370  -->  00:04:18.800
and it will redirect just back to slash logon.

64

00:04:18.840  -->  00:04:26.580
If it fails just like this there's a lot of tick in here and we still need a comma and then we should

65

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:27.750
be good to go.

66

00:04:27.750  -->  00:04:29.220
So let's walk through this again.

67

00:04:29.220  -->  00:04:35.010
It's a bit of review from before we haven't amped up post route to slash log in when a request comes

68

00:04:35.010  -->  00:04:36.170
in slash log in.

69

00:04:36.210  -->  00:04:37.580
This is going to run first.

70

00:04:37.620  -->  00:04:40.860
All of this and this is all just the second argument.

71

00:04:40.860  -->  00:04:47.430
So it really looks like this apt up post we have Slash log in then we have the middleware and then we

72

00:04:47.430  -->  00:04:49.280
have our callback.

73

00:04:49.980  -->  00:04:55.860
So the middleware goes from here down to there which is always a little confusing when you put things

74

00:04:55.860  -->  00:04:56.520
on new lines.

75

00:04:56.520  -->  00:05:02.100
But it's much better than just having one gigantic line not middleware we'll call authenticate method

76

00:05:02.580  -->  00:05:09.060
which we set up up here so much code to go through towards the top.

77

00:05:09.090  -->  00:05:10.170
Here we are.

78

00:05:10.500  -->  00:05:14.870
Passport don't use local strategy user or authenticate.

79

00:05:14.880  -->  00:05:22.020
So when we call user data things Kate or passport dot authenticate on a local strategy it will use the

80

00:05:22.020  -->  00:05:23.650
method that we didn't have to write.

81

00:05:23.670  -->  00:05:27.900
It was given to us for free by using the passport local mongoose package.

82

00:05:28.020  -->  00:05:33.390
But it's going to call that authenticate which will then take up body password request up by the username

83

00:05:33.570  -->  00:05:37.730
and then it will authenticate that password with what we have stored in the database for that user.

84

00:05:37.810  -->  00:05:41.050
And it takes care of all the complex logic that we don't have to worry about.

85

00:05:41.460  -->  00:05:47.670
And then if it works redirects such camp grounds if it doesn't work redirect to slash in and then we

86

00:05:47.670  -->  00:05:49.670
have this Colbeck here that really doesn't do anything.

87

00:05:49.670  -->  00:05:51.320
And we can get rid of that if we wanted to.

88

00:05:51.780  -->  00:05:55.670
But I just want to leave it there so that you are aware that this is a middleware.

89

00:05:56.070  -->  00:05:56.810
OK.

90

00:05:57.030  -->  00:05:59.210
So restart the server.

91

00:05:59.670  -->  00:06:02.730
Let's see what happens I'll get rid of this line.

92

00:06:03.050  -->  00:06:05.330
It's complaining about that.

93

00:06:05.370  -->  00:06:06.700
There we go.

94

00:06:07.560  -->  00:06:14.130
Let's refresh and let's plug in with that same account that they created last time Severus and password

95

00:06:14.280  -->  00:06:19.810
is password Nahit log in and I go to slash campgrounds.

96

00:06:19.860  -->  00:06:20.880
Great.

97

00:06:20.880  -->  00:06:22.430
Now let's go back.

98

00:06:22.500  -->  00:06:28.240
I'll reset the server again and let me try and read something that I know doesn't work.

99

00:06:29.070  -->  00:06:34.350
Hopefully we don't have an account with that password and I get back to the log in form because that's

100

00:06:34.350  -->  00:06:36.900
what I set as the failure redirect.

101

00:06:37.320  -->  00:06:40.470
OK so let me just reiterate this because it is an important concept.

102

00:06:40.470  -->  00:06:46.050
This is the same passport that authenticate that we're using instead of register as we're using instead

103

00:06:46.050  -->  00:06:46.710
of log.

104

00:06:46.710  -->  00:06:52.500
The difference is that instead of register we're doing other things before we run passport authenticate

105

00:06:52.830  -->  00:06:54.990
we're actually registering the user making a new user.

106

00:06:54.990  -->  00:07:02.400
And then if that works then we're logging the user in versus here on slash log in the user is presumed

107

00:07:02.400  -->  00:07:03.560
to exist already.

108

00:07:03.570  -->  00:07:07.210
So all we do is passport does authenticate which will log them in.

109

00:07:07.530  -->  00:07:09.630
OK so that's everything I want to get done.

110

00:07:09.900  -->  00:07:14.740
The log in logic with those two routes after I get log in APT up post log in.

111

00:07:14.940  -->  00:07:16.500
And then we also have the form here.

112

00:07:16.620  -->  00:07:18.650
Just a simple form just like register.

113

00:07:18.660  -->  00:07:22.870
The only difference is this right here where we're submitting the form to.

114

00:07:23.310  -->  00:07:23.750
Awesome.

115

00:07:23.760  -->  00:07:28.340
In the next video be working on logging out and also making our NAV bar a little bit better.
