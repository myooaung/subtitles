00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:01.060
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.260  -->  00:00:07.020
So we have another video about comments finishing up crud we're focusing on the D which is delete.

3

00:00:07.350  -->  00:00:13.530
So to delete a comment we need to add in our route and we also need to add in the button which is actually

4

00:00:13.530  -->  00:00:17.930
a form that will submit a request to that destroy route.

5

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:22.140
And this is pretty simple compared to edit and update only one route.

6

00:00:22.140  -->  00:00:23.980
You don't need a crazy complex form.

7

00:00:23.990  -->  00:00:28.860
You don't have to worry about a lot of the complications that we did with adding an update for campground

8

00:00:28.950  -->  00:00:31.550
and in particular comments.

9

00:00:31.590  -->  00:00:33.200
So the route that we need.

10

00:00:33.420  -->  00:00:36.830
Let's take a look at how we did it for campground to start.

11

00:00:37.260  -->  00:00:41.850
We scroll down slash ID and that's it.

12

00:00:41.850  -->  00:00:48.900
But remember our route is actually slash campground slash ID as a delete request so we can add that

13

00:00:48.900  -->  00:01:01.530
in campground destroy route is slash campgrounds slash ID as a delete request and our comments destroy

14

00:01:01.540  -->  00:01:04.300
route is nested so it's a little bit longer.

15

00:01:04.380  -->  00:01:13.500
It's slash campgrounds slash ID slash comments slash comments ID as a delete request.

16

00:01:13.500  -->  00:01:15.320
So we're falling a restful route here.

17

00:01:15.510  -->  00:01:17.770
Let's now go and implement this route.

18

00:01:18.360  -->  00:01:20.530
We'll begin by going to our comment genius.

19

00:01:20.880  -->  00:01:30.150
The routes file and we'll add in a comment that says comments destroy route.

20

00:01:31.290  -->  00:01:41.370
And then we need our router dot delete and the route is just comment ID and that's it because that other

21

00:01:41.370  -->  00:01:46.680
part has been prepended to it when we required it in the US and I've showed that a lot in last few videos

22

00:01:46.700  -->  00:01:46.840
.

23

00:01:46.980  -->  00:01:53.400
So I won't do that again but it's in the US where we require this file and then we need our request

24

00:01:53.400  -->  00:01:56.570
in response standard call back here.

25

00:01:57.120  -->  00:02:06.060
And what we'll do here eventually is find my ID and remove.

26

00:02:06.570  -->  00:02:08.840
But for now we're just going to rest.

27

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:17.430
And this is the destroy comments route and will save.

28

00:02:17.430  -->  00:02:19.640
Now let's try and hit this route.

29

00:02:19.920  -->  00:02:21.960
So we'll go to our show form.

30

00:02:22.210  -->  00:02:25.500
Let me start the server first.

31

00:02:25.500  -->  00:02:28.320
What we want is a button right here.

32

00:02:28.410  -->  00:02:29.120
Just look at it.

33

00:02:29.130  -->  00:02:34.050
But let's make it red and then click on it and it sends a delete request to that route.

34

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:39.630
But remember it's not actually a delete request it's a post request because we can't make a delete request

35

00:02:39.630  -->  00:02:43.050
from a form yet it's allegedly coming in the future.

36

00:02:43.050  -->  00:02:45.870
That's the whole method override thing that's why we're using it.

37

00:02:45.870  -->  00:02:50.320
We sent a post request with underscore method equal to to be.

38

00:02:51.030  -->  00:02:53.030
So let's do that now in our show.

39

00:02:53.030  -->  00:03:04.020
So it right below this button here this anchor tag will add in a form and it can't be just an anchor

40

00:03:04.020  -->  00:03:06.180
tag because that only makes you get requests.

41

00:03:06.180  -->  00:03:08.010
We needed a post.

42

00:03:08.040  -->  00:03:11.340
So action it's going to be long again.

43

00:03:11.350  -->  00:03:20.310
We can actually copy what we have above campground slash campground got ID slash comments slash comment

44

00:03:20.310  -->  00:03:23.630
ID so we can copy that whole thing in here.

45

00:03:24.510  -->  00:03:26.210
And we don't need slash edit.

46

00:03:26.460  -->  00:03:34.590
We don't need to slash anything after the ID except we do need method underscore method equals delete

47

00:03:35.460  -->  00:03:41.250
and then we also need method equals post.

48

00:03:41.260  -->  00:03:46.900
So yeah kind of nasty kind of long but thats just the name of the route here.

49

00:03:46.900  -->  00:03:49.270
Theres a lot of stuff involved in that route.

50

00:03:49.920  -->  00:03:50.850
OK.

51

00:03:51.330  -->  00:04:02.070
So inside the form all we need is an input type equals submit and then will give to a class of DTN ETN

52

00:04:02.520  -->  00:04:07.480
X s and BICI in danger.

53

00:04:07.500  -->  00:04:12.870
That should make it nice and red for us and then we can give it a value because it didn't do a button

54

00:04:12.870  -->  00:04:16.130
this time just to show you how to use an input type submit.

55

00:04:16.260  -->  00:04:22.470
You give it a value for the text on the actual button whereas if its a button element you have inner

56

00:04:22.480  -->  00:04:24.570
enraged him out the set but we dont have that here.

57

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:27.790
So value equals let's just say do we.

58

00:04:28.830  -->  00:04:31.310
OK let's refresh.

59

00:04:32.100  -->  00:04:38.490
So first thing I notice we have that same issue that we did with the campground where the delete button

60

00:04:38.490  -->  00:04:41.680
is in a form so that sent it to the next line.

61

00:04:41.970  -->  00:04:45.210
Luckily we already have that style sheet that we defined.

62

00:04:45.490  -->  00:04:54.120
If we go into public stylesheets main see assess we have this delete form to set display to in line

63

00:04:54.120  -->  00:04:54.590
.

64

00:04:54.750  -->  00:05:03.660
So if we try that now 9 specked we also set that form have display in line.

65

00:05:04.650  -->  00:05:07.840
You can see that the buttons behave the way that I want them to.

66

00:05:08.040  -->  00:05:08.960
So we'll do that.

67

00:05:08.960  -->  00:05:15.720
But with our CSSA file and we don't actually have to write anything new in our CSSA file just copy this

68

00:05:15.720  -->  00:05:23.900
ID and also assign it to this forum just like that.

69

00:05:23.970  -->  00:05:26.370
Now our form is nice and in line.

70

00:05:26.580  -->  00:05:30.300
The last thing that we need to do is actually implement our route.

71

00:05:30.420  -->  00:05:32.210
So let's see what happens.

72

00:05:32.880  -->  00:05:33.380
Good.

73

00:05:33.390  -->  00:05:36.060
We get this is the destroy common route.

74

00:05:36.060  -->  00:05:40.530
Now we actually need to destroy the comment so in comments yes.

75

00:05:40.590  -->  00:05:42.110
Get rid of us.

76

00:05:42.180  -->  00:05:51.650
We're going to have a comments fined by id and remove members of the ID goes first.

77

00:05:52.230  -->  00:05:58.100
So that's request harams dot comments ID.

78

00:05:58.140  -->  00:05:59.520
This one here.

79

00:06:00.650  -->  00:06:07.590
And just to hammer this home one more time this I.D. is what we're talking about.

80

00:06:07.590  -->  00:06:11.860
So we have the campground I.D. comment slash comment Id.

81

00:06:12.390  -->  00:06:13.580
OK.

82

00:06:14.580  -->  00:06:17.970
Next thing we'll do have a callback function error

83

00:06:20.700  -->  00:06:27.330
and then all that we can do in here is just check if there's an error just to arrest out redirect back

84

00:06:27.330  -->  00:06:29.500
again.

85

00:06:31.560  -->  00:06:38.070
And if there's not an error eventually will send a message and eventually I actually mean it just a

86

00:06:38.070  -->  00:06:42.490
few videos from now we're getting really close to this one but will send a message that says comment

87

00:06:42.490  -->  00:06:43.960
successfully removed.

88

00:06:44.130  -->  00:06:47.300
For now redstart redirect.

89

00:06:47.460  -->  00:06:51.560
And after we delete a comment it makes sense to go back to the show page.

90

00:06:51.630  -->  00:06:57.960
We could do redstart redirect back as well assuming that the user came from the show page which is the

91

00:06:57.960  -->  00:07:03.510
only place we'll have a delete button for a comment but technically someone could send that request

92

00:07:03.510  -->  00:07:07.650
from something like Postman and also just so you get more practice.

93

00:07:07.650  -->  00:07:10.350
I'm going to write the show page redirect from scratch.

94

00:07:10.350  -->  00:07:21.330
So slash campgrounds slash ID and that ID is request up harams dot Id not not comment Id But Id which

95

00:07:21.330  -->  00:07:23.410
is the campground ID.

96

00:07:23.410  -->  00:07:27.980
We have a lot of IDS going on but the first one on our route is for the campground.

97

00:07:28.020  -->  00:07:32.900
So this should send us back to the show page and we'll hopefully see that that comment was deleted.

98

00:07:33.480  -->  00:07:38.560
OK so let's give it a shot restart.

99

00:07:40.470  -->  00:07:43.380
I don't have to be logged in right now to do this.

100

00:07:43.500  -->  00:07:47.390
So if I click delete you can see it's gone.

101

00:07:47.400  -->  00:07:49.260
I do have to be logged in to add one.

102

00:07:49.320  -->  00:07:55.230
So let me log back in password.

103

00:07:56.850  -->  00:08:03.210
Let's add a new comment to this one.

104

00:08:03.210  -->  00:08:05.850
Make sure we can still edit it.

105

00:08:07.170  -->  00:08:09.550
Let's add one more.

106

00:08:10.050  -->  00:08:14.250
Very original comments and lots to eat one.

107

00:08:14.310  -->  00:08:14.930
Perfect.

108

00:08:14.940  -->  00:08:16.070
It's working.

109

00:08:16.290  -->  00:08:21.140
So that's all we need to do to mend steps defining the destroy route.

110

00:08:21.220  -->  00:08:27.900
We actually add in the logic find by id and remove and the other important step is adding that button

111

00:08:27.990  -->  00:08:35.130
which is actually a form because we have to send a post request which is actually disguised as a delete

112

00:08:35.130  -->  00:08:40.710
request instead of a route file so our forms in the post we added an underscore method equals delete

113

00:08:41.370  -->  00:08:49.230
method override is expecting that underscore method and that triggers our delete route here rather than

114

00:08:50.340  -->  00:08:54.490
raftered up posts which is what it would trigger otherwise without method override.

115

00:08:55.090  -->  00:08:55.830
OK.

116

00:08:56.100  -->  00:09:01.950
Next up we're going to go and add in the code for authorization so that you first of all have to be

117

00:09:01.950  -->  00:09:07.510
logged in to edit and delete something and it has to belong to you to edit and delete a comment.

118

00:09:07.590  -->  00:09:11.880
So you can't just arbitrarily go and delete all the comments on an application.

119

00:09:12.360  -->  00:09:12.720
OK.

120

00:09:12.750  -->  00:09:13.890
So we'll do that next video
