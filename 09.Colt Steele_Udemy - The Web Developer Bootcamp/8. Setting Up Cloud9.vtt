WEBVTT
1

00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:01.780
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.830  -->  00:00:07.320
So we're going to go ahead and get signed up for cloud nine and set up our initial environment so I'll

3

00:00:07.320  -->  00:00:12.930
click on sign up on the cloud 9 home page and then I'll fill out the information here.

4

00:00:13.230  -->  00:00:23.370
So I'll do learn with Colts and my e-mail here learned with Colts at gmail dot com and then I'll put

5

00:00:23.370  -->  00:00:27.370
in my password here and then we'll click on I'm not a robot.

6

00:00:28.530  -->  00:00:35.390
And then we need to select all images with pizza.

7

00:00:35.390  -->  00:00:37.120
I think that's it.

8

00:00:37.140  -->  00:00:38.240
There we go.

9

00:00:38.310  -->  00:00:39.260
Not a robot.

10

00:00:39.570  -->  00:00:43.480
And now we'll create our free account.

11

00:00:43.770  -->  00:00:48.510
The next thing you'll need to do is check your email and click on the verification email that they send

12

00:00:48.510  -->  00:00:49.840
you.

13

00:00:50.070  -->  00:00:53.780
And then once you've done that we can go to our dashboard.

14

00:00:53.940  -->  00:00:55.590
This is our dashboard here.

15

00:00:55.590  -->  00:01:01.790
We can upload a profile picture and we can also look at a demo project that they've given us.

16

00:01:01.920  -->  00:01:04.230
So I'm going to just look at that for now.

17

00:01:04.260  -->  00:01:06.920
We're not going to touch anything or we're not going to make anything new here.

18

00:01:06.950  -->  00:01:10.790
So now that it's floated Let's take a quick tour of some of the features.

19

00:01:11.220  -->  00:01:16.350
So they have a little read me file that explains a few things but the first thing I'll show is that

20

00:01:16.380  -->  00:01:19.750
on the left side we have a file tree.

21

00:01:19.770  -->  00:01:24.920
These are all the files and directories that we currently have on this demo project workspace.

22

00:01:25.260  -->  00:01:31.800
So if we wanted to you could click on Ruby and here's a ruby file and I can double click and that will

23

00:01:31.800  -->  00:01:36.390
open up the file here just like if I had dragged the file to Sublime Text.

24

00:01:36.540  -->  00:01:38.570
So this is one way to open a file.

25

00:01:38.730  -->  00:01:41.180
We'll also be learning how to do it from the command line.

26

00:01:41.250  -->  00:01:46.670
Later in the course which brings me to the next point which is the command line down here or the terminal

27

00:01:46.670  -->  00:01:54.530
is here so we can resize this window and this is our terminal where we'll type terminal commands.

28

00:01:54.810  -->  00:01:56.610
So one of them is clutter.

29

00:01:56.730  -->  00:01:59.600
And what that does is it just clears everything away.

30

00:01:59.730  -->  00:02:04.510
Just like clear does in the javascript console although this is not Javascript.

31

00:02:04.710  -->  00:02:06.700
So I can type commands in here.

32

00:02:07.050  -->  00:02:10.980
We'll be talking about some of the more important commands in the next few videos.

33

00:02:10.980  -->  00:02:17.160
But for now just know this is our terminal we can type terminal code in here start our server run our

34

00:02:17.160  -->  00:02:17.820
apps.

35

00:02:18.150  -->  00:02:20.480
And this is our file tree over here.

36

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:22.330
And this is our text editor.

37

00:02:22.470  -->  00:02:27.230
So this is sublime basically that's all we're going to do with the demo project.

38

00:02:27.300  -->  00:02:29.610
So let's close out of that.

39

00:02:29.700  -->  00:02:38.510
Now let's click on Create a new workspace and then we'll give our workspace a name so I'll do web dev

40

00:02:38.520  -->  00:02:38.910
.

41

00:02:39.540  -->  00:02:46.590
Boot camp just like that and we can give it a description if we want and we'll keep it public and then

42

00:02:46.590  -->  00:02:49.650
all that we'll do down here is select node.

43

00:02:49.950  -->  00:02:54.810
So this is a template which will give us all of the tools or almost all of the tools that we're going

44

00:02:54.810  -->  00:02:56.600
to use preinstalled.

45

00:02:56.790  -->  00:03:02.970
So when we click Create workspace it's going to take some space on a machine somewhere else a computer

46

00:03:03.030  -->  00:03:05.900
and the server and it's going to install node.

47

00:03:05.970  -->  00:03:11.430
It's going to install some other tools something called NPM that comes with node and we'll have it all

48

00:03:11.430  -->  00:03:13.870
ready for us in just a matter of seconds.

49

00:03:14.280  -->  00:03:16.020
So I'll click on Create workspace

50

00:03:20.580  -->  00:03:21.450
and there we go.

51

00:03:21.450  -->  00:03:25.440
We now have our own web development environment set up and that's it.

52

00:03:25.590  -->  00:03:28.600
And if we wanted to check that it works correctly.

53

00:03:28.740  -->  00:03:35.760
Let's open up the terminal and make it a little bit bigger and what we'll do is in here let's type a

54

00:03:35.760  -->  00:03:44.250
simple command node dash V and all that this will do is ask node which is one of the things that it

55

00:03:44.250  -->  00:03:45.840
should have installed for us.

56

00:03:45.870  -->  00:03:49.280
It will ask node what version it's currently on.

57

00:03:49.980  -->  00:03:56.940
We can do the same thing with another tool called NPM dash VI which is again asking for the version

58

00:03:56.940  -->  00:03:57.150
.

59

00:03:57.360  -->  00:04:02.600
And as long as we see something here then we're good if we saw something like.

60

00:04:02.610  -->  00:04:05.730
Command not found node or command not found.

61

00:04:05.730  -->  00:04:08.650
NPM then that would mean that they're not installed.

62

00:04:08.970  -->  00:04:14.370
But this shows that they are installed for us and that was you know a matter of one click two clicks

63

00:04:14.370  -->  00:04:15.060
maybe.

64

00:04:15.150  -->  00:04:20.030
And we waited a second or two for our environment to get set up and we're good to go now.

65

00:04:20.190  -->  00:04:22.470
So this is all we need to do actually.

66

00:04:22.500  -->  00:04:28.020
One more thing that will have us do so that we are all consistent in our folder structure is I'm going

67

00:04:28.020  -->  00:04:38.820
to go ahead and delete these folders here so we can right click click on delete and click on yes and

68

00:04:38.820  -->  00:04:42.290
we'll just delete all of them inside of webdav boot camp.

69

00:04:42.930  -->  00:04:49.350
So we'll delete again yes we'll delete this file package that Jason

70

00:04:53.220  -->  00:05:00.920
do that for the read me file just like that and then will also delete the server file.

71

00:05:00.960  -->  00:05:05.900
Don't worry we'll be creating a bunch of new files and folders for every lesson that we do.

72

00:05:06.300  -->  00:05:07.700
So that's all we needed to do.

73

00:05:07.710  -->  00:05:13.470
We now have everything set up that we need or almost everything will have to install a tool here or

74

00:05:13.470  -->  00:05:14.730
there as we progress.

75

00:05:14.790  -->  00:05:17.090
But we have everything we need to get started.
