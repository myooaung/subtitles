00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:01.650
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.660  -->  00:00:05.770
In this video we're going to work on the styling of our site right now.

3

00:00:05.850  -->  00:00:09.530
It's definitely nowhere near what it's supposed to look like at the end.

4

00:00:09.810  -->  00:00:12.960
So let's actually compare them side by side.

5

00:00:13.530  -->  00:00:14.840
Here's ours over here.

6

00:00:15.030  -->  00:00:21.280
So some of the big changes we need to make rounding the corners adding some spacing here up top.

7

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:23.260
Changing the styling of the buttons here.

8

00:00:23.490  -->  00:00:27.750
So these buttons don't really look like buttons until you hover over them and we get a hover effect

9

00:00:28.470  -->  00:00:32.370
our buttons are definitely hideous and we don't have any hover effect on them.

10

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:35.200
Also the position of them is a little bit wrong.

11

00:00:35.550  -->  00:00:43.130
As you can see if i guess here I get text but if I were fresh that tech space is already taken up versus

12

00:00:43.200  -->  00:00:48.310
on our version if I guess the text pushes everything away to the sides.

13

00:00:48.470  -->  00:00:51.480
Also there's an animation here.

14

00:00:51.510  -->  00:01:00.360
So when I click notice how they fade out slowly on ours when we click well if I click an incorrect one

15

00:01:01.170  -->  00:01:02.990
it just immediately is removed.

16

00:01:03.000  -->  00:01:05.790
So we want to add a transition to that.

17

00:01:05.790  -->  00:01:09.200
Also we have the H-1 up here that needs some work on ours.

18

00:01:09.390  -->  00:01:10.920
It needs to take up more space.

19

00:01:11.130  -->  00:01:12.930
We need to change the background color.

20

00:01:12.930  -->  00:01:14.520
We want to change the font.

21

00:01:14.910  -->  00:01:21.240
We need to make sure that the span of our color is formatted correctly so it's on its own line and it's

22

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:22.610
a larger font.

23

00:01:22.710  -->  00:01:25.910
Also we need to change the font for the entire body.

24

00:01:25.950  -->  00:01:28.020
So these are all the same font.

25

00:01:28.080  -->  00:01:32.970
And lastly you'll notice we have a little bit of space right here between the stripe and the end of

26

00:01:32.970  -->  00:01:37.470
the body and in the solution version there is no space at all.

27

00:01:38.030  -->  00:01:38.490
OK.

28

00:01:38.550  -->  00:01:41.580
Let's get started by first tackling this H-1.

29

00:01:41.990  -->  00:01:49.740
So we're going to go to my subline text and go to the H-1 and the first thing that will do is just align

30

00:01:49.740  -->  00:01:52.700
things in the middle as you can see in the solution.

31

00:01:52.890  -->  00:01:54.170
Things are aligned to center.

32

00:01:54.210  -->  00:02:03.070
So all we need to do is add text align center and save and refresh.

33

00:02:03.360  -->  00:02:06.520
Ok slight improvement.

34

00:02:06.540  -->  00:02:14.010
Next up let's change the background color so the color is going to be still blue but you'll notice that

35

00:02:14.010  -->  00:02:17.280
if I refresh the page right now it works just fine.

36

00:02:17.400  -->  00:02:23.010
But if I refresh again and then I win the game or I click on new colors.

37

00:02:23.010  -->  00:02:28.230
It goes back to black and that's because our javascript code is overwriting that we're setting it back

38

00:02:28.230  -->  00:02:31.970
to this dark gray blackish color in our javascript.

39

00:02:32.010  -->  00:02:37.320
We need to find the places where we're resetting it to this color which is 2 3 2 3 2 3.

40

00:02:37.320  -->  00:02:38.040
Here we go.

41

00:02:38.100  -->  00:02:40.820
We just want to change this to be still blue.

42

00:02:41.340  -->  00:02:44.690
And that's also when I refresh it starts it's still blue.

43

00:02:44.850  -->  00:02:45.970
I get new colors.

44

00:02:45.990  -->  00:02:47.870
It stays as still blue.

45

00:02:48.360  -->  00:02:48.810
OK.

46

00:02:48.870  -->  00:02:49.830
So that's that.

47

00:02:49.830  -->  00:02:54.430
Now let's get rid of all the black space on either side of our H-1.

48

00:02:54.870  -->  00:03:02.230
So in our H-1 we're going to get rid of all margin margin zero on top and bottom left and right.

49

00:03:02.250  -->  00:03:04.820
So notice what happens when to do that.

50

00:03:04.820  -->  00:03:10.590
That black space goes away on all sides except for this little bit of spacing on the left top and right

51

00:03:10.590  -->  00:03:10.720
.

52

00:03:10.830  -->  00:03:14.870
And that's not coming from or H-1 that's actually coming from the body.

53

00:03:14.940  -->  00:03:19.420
So to fix that we can go to the body and give it margin zero.

54

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:24.230
And to now pay attention to this little gap I'll refresh and that goes away.

55

00:03:24.390  -->  00:03:30.040
So our white stripe goes all the way to the side just like it does in this version here.

56

00:03:30.150  -->  00:03:30.970
OK.

57

00:03:31.080  -->  00:03:33.080
Next up let's focus on the fun.

58

00:03:33.450  -->  00:03:36.180
So the fun is going to be the same for all of our elements.

59

00:03:36.180  -->  00:03:41.690
The buttons and the H-1 and the span here it's all the same font slightly different font weights.

60

00:03:41.850  -->  00:03:46.660
And we're going to use just one of the built in fonts the system vaunts which is called Avenir.

61

00:03:46.920  -->  00:03:52.730
So that's going to be font family Avenir.

62

00:03:53.430  -->  00:03:56.440
That is a font that may not work on every system out there.

63

00:03:56.580  -->  00:04:03.930
So we're going to add in a another option which is Mont. Serat just like that.

64

00:04:04.740  -->  00:04:10.050
So we end up with this fun here which obviously doesn't look exactly the same.

65

00:04:10.170  -->  00:04:12.460
And that comes down to our font weight.

66

00:04:12.540  -->  00:04:16.040
So we need to change the weight of this font because it's an H1.

67

00:04:16.050  -->  00:04:21.520
The default is to make it bolded or to have like 700 or 800 or even 900 font weight.

68

00:04:21.600  -->  00:04:24.350
What we want to do is give it font weight normal.

69

00:04:24.420  -->  00:04:32.230
So when our H-1 can add font weight normal and save.

70

00:04:32.400  -->  00:04:33.400
Refresh.

71

00:04:33.710  -->  00:04:34.700
That's looking closer.

72

00:04:34.700  -->  00:04:37.550
Now there's a few other things we need to change.

73

00:04:37.590  -->  00:04:44.030
The first of which is that this is all uppercase and we can do that with R C S S using text transform

74

00:04:45.330  -->  00:04:52.580
uppercase and save So now look closer and will also want to make sure that our color is on its own line

75

00:04:52.700  -->  00:04:56.510
and that we style that span slightly differently to do that.

76

00:04:56.570  -->  00:05:00.950
We're going to go over here into our team and actually we're going to edit the aged him out a little

77

00:05:00.950  -->  00:05:01.340
bit.

78

00:05:01.700  -->  00:05:04.120
And this is the first way that we're going to make this work.

79

00:05:04.160  -->  00:05:09.350
We'll see another way of doing it with Pearcey SS But we're going to start by styling this where we

80

00:05:09.350  -->  00:05:12.590
have the great on one line and then to add a break.

81

00:05:12.590  -->  00:05:19.070
We can use a b r tag and actually this is not a great idea as far as style it's a little bit frowned

82

00:05:19.070  -->  00:05:24.080
upon but it's a quick and easy way to get started adding some returns and some line breaks and that's

83

00:05:24.080  -->  00:05:26.440
all that this tag does is it adds a line break.

84

00:05:26.620  -->  00:05:33.200
So we want one after the Great we want a break and then our span and then we want another break and

85

00:05:33.200  -->  00:05:37.970
then color game at the bottom and if we refresh Now you can see we're getting closer.

86

00:05:38.060  -->  00:05:41.280
Now we need to focus on making the span a lot larger.

87

00:05:41.660  -->  00:05:44.160
So this band has an idea of color display.

88

00:05:44.300  -->  00:05:49.730
So we're going to go over to R C S S and select color display just like this.

89

00:05:49.900  -->  00:05:58.200
Id color display and then we're going to say font size is 200 percent of the H-1 font size.

90

00:05:58.550  -->  00:06:01.860
And if we refresh we now get this much larger font size.

91

00:06:02.210  -->  00:06:03.630
And we're getting closer.

92

00:06:03.680  -->  00:06:05.210
We have our breaks in here.

93

00:06:05.330  -->  00:06:10.040
You also notice though that we have a lot more space between the lines than we do over here.

94

00:06:10.280  -->  00:06:12.970
So there's a few things that we can do to work on that.

95

00:06:12.980  -->  00:06:15.780
The first one is change the line height.

96

00:06:16.280  -->  00:06:21.580
So we'll give it a line height of 1.1 and save.

97

00:06:22.190  -->  00:06:27.040
And let's look at our version again and refresh and you can see that shrinks down a bit.

98

00:06:27.290  -->  00:06:30.440
But now we lost the space on the top and the bottom.

99

00:06:30.440  -->  00:06:32.190
We need a little bit of space there.

100

00:06:32.210  -->  00:06:35.050
So what we'll do is go in and add some padding.

101

00:06:35.450  -->  00:06:40.610
So we're going to add padding to the top and bottom only not the left and right and we want 20 pixels

102

00:06:40.610  -->  00:06:47.050
on the top and bottom so we can do that just like this padding 20 pixels and zero.

103

00:06:47.300  -->  00:06:54.980
We could also have done padding top 20 pixels and padding bottom but this is a nicer short way of doing

104

00:06:54.980  -->  00:06:58.590
it refresh and you can see we're almost there now.

105

00:06:58.880  -->  00:07:00.670
So our header looks fine.

106

00:07:00.880  -->  00:07:05.830
We have the correct font the correct font way it's all in uppercase the correct background color.

107

00:07:05.870  -->  00:07:11.240
Let's make sure as I play stays correct looks all good.

108

00:07:11.300  -->  00:07:14.800
The next thing we should tackle are the buttons on this nav bar.

109

00:07:15.130  -->  00:07:18.080
So we definitely have a long way to go to improve those.

110

00:07:18.080  -->  00:07:23.000
The first thing we want to do is get rid of the borders so we don't have this obvious border around

111

00:07:23.000  -->  00:07:23.840
the button.

112

00:07:23.870  -->  00:07:27.230
We also want to get rid of the background color.

113

00:07:27.320  -->  00:07:29.290
So there should be no background as you can see here.

114

00:07:29.330  -->  00:07:33.210
It's just wait until we hover or until we select one.

115

00:07:33.250  -->  00:07:37.790
Also we want to make sure the font family is the same as this font up here.

116

00:07:37.790  -->  00:07:39.230
So let's get started.

117

00:07:39.230  -->  00:07:48.620
And I'm going to select all buttons so button and we're just going to say border none and save.

118

00:07:48.800  -->  00:07:50.850
Pay attention to the buttons when I refresh.

119

00:07:51.170  -->  00:07:51.790
OK.

120

00:07:51.980  -->  00:07:53.520
So we now have no border.

121

00:07:53.720  -->  00:07:55.600
But we still have that background color.

122

00:07:55.850  -->  00:08:02.760
So now that same background none and save and refresh and we're getting closer.

123

00:08:02.950  -->  00:08:04.800
So now we have just plain text.

124

00:08:05.120  -->  00:08:09.520
And we'll start by making all that text uppercase like we have over here.

125

00:08:09.740  -->  00:08:16.330
So we use text transform again just copy that line over paste that in there and refresh.

126

00:08:16.400  -->  00:08:18.840
Now our buttons are all in uppercase.

127

00:08:18.920  -->  00:08:23.240
The next thing we want to do is make sure that the button goes all the way from the top to the bottom

128

00:08:23.260  -->  00:08:25.370
of the div stripe container.

129

00:08:25.400  -->  00:08:31.580
Right now it only takes up part of the space so we can do that by setting height to be 100 percent.

130

00:08:31.750  -->  00:08:37.490
And that means it will take up 100 percent of the containing element as you can see that gets us a lot

131

00:08:37.490  -->  00:08:38.900
closer.

132

00:08:38.930  -->  00:08:44.870
We just now need to change some colors change the font size the font weight and then change the hover

133

00:08:44.870  -->  00:08:47.540
effect which we don't have set up yet.

134

00:08:48.010  -->  00:08:54.050
The next thing that will do is make the font wait a little bit heavier and change the color to be still

135

00:08:54.050  -->  00:08:54.980
blue as well.

136

00:08:55.040  -->  00:09:02.350
So font weight will do seven hundred and then color will also be still blue.

137

00:09:02.650  -->  00:09:05.370
And let's check that out refresh.

138

00:09:06.020  -->  00:09:11.180
So it gets a little bit older and you can also see that the color has now changed to that still blue

139

00:09:11.240  -->  00:09:14.750
the same color we have back here.

140

00:09:14.760  -->  00:09:21.740
There's a really minor change that we can make which is to change the letter spacing to be one pixel

141

00:09:21.740  -->  00:09:21.810
.

142

00:09:21.830  -->  00:09:27.260
And if you pay attention when I refresh you can see things spaced out just a little bit between each

143

00:09:27.260  -->  00:09:28.390
letter.

144

00:09:29.090  -->  00:09:31.690
Leslie let's focus on the font size.

145

00:09:31.700  -->  00:09:33.690
They seem a little bit too small.

146

00:09:33.980  -->  00:09:39.340
So we're going to just use font size and set it to be inherit.

147

00:09:39.500  -->  00:09:44.750
And if I refresh you can see that they inherit the font size and we don't have to explicitly said it

148

00:09:44.750  -->  00:09:45.600
.

149

00:09:45.620  -->  00:09:47.120
So let's take a look now.

150

00:09:47.620  -->  00:09:51.380
One of the big differences is that they're currently spaced differently.

151

00:09:51.670  -->  00:09:55.490
As soon as the page is loaded we have the space here on our version.

152

00:09:55.490  -->  00:09:59.460
However we don't have that space until we click on a button.

153

00:09:59.480  -->  00:10:08.860
So what we need to do is actually style the span that's right here and that span is called message and

154

00:10:08.870  -->  00:10:14.480
we're going to want to go and give that some properties to make it take up that space and all we need

155

00:10:14.480  -->  00:10:17.220
to do is change one property actually.

156

00:10:17.360  -->  00:10:24.980
So we're going to select display our message which is this fan and we're going to change the display

157

00:10:24.980  -->  00:10:28.830
property to be in line.

158

00:10:28.830  -->  00:10:34.880
BLOCK So what that will do if I refresh you won't notice a big difference right away but that's because

159

00:10:34.880  -->  00:10:41.790
we also need to assign it a with you know give it a with of 20 percent and save and refresh.

160

00:10:42.230  -->  00:10:48.530
We now have this span even though it doesn't have anything in it that takes up 20 percent of this screen

161

00:10:48.530  -->  00:10:48.790
.

162

00:10:49.000  -->  00:10:52.920
So that pushes these elements to the side which is exactly what we want.

163

00:10:53.500  -->  00:10:55.690
Let's take a look and compare them.

164

00:10:55.700  -->  00:10:56.960
All right so that looks pretty close.

165

00:10:56.960  -->  00:11:03.340
Now what we'll work on next is getting the selected class to match the right color and having our hover

166

00:11:03.350  -->  00:11:05.450
effect as well.

167

00:11:05.450  -->  00:11:10.460
So that's going to be down in our button and we're going to add the hover effect first.

168

00:11:10.460  -->  00:11:15.970
So all we need to do is add in button Colan Huffer

169

00:11:18.920  -->  00:11:27.140
and we're going to change the font color to be white and the background color to be steel blue.

170

00:11:27.130  -->  00:11:31.370
So we're basically reversing the colors and we'll save and refresh.

171

00:11:31.630  -->  00:11:34.090
Now as I hover you can see I get that effect.

172

00:11:34.670  -->  00:11:35.550
Perfect.

173

00:11:35.600  -->  00:11:39.920
And our selected class that we have is going to look just the same.

174

00:11:39.950  -->  00:11:42.360
Just going to copy the styles.

175

00:11:42.530  -->  00:11:45.980
There is no difference when we're hovering over something versus when it's selected.

176

00:11:45.980  -->  00:11:47.260
They should look the same.

177

00:11:47.420  -->  00:11:52.790
So you can see that looks right and I hover and only while I hover.

178

00:11:52.850  -->  00:11:55.270
Does it get that blue background and white text color.

179

00:11:55.340  -->  00:11:57.410
And when I move it goes away.

180

00:11:57.680  -->  00:11:59.010
There is a slight difference.

181

00:11:59.300  -->  00:12:04.470
If I hover over the solution buttons notice that it fades in that color.

182

00:12:04.550  -->  00:12:08.390
It's not just an instant switch on my version.

183

00:12:08.650  -->  00:12:10.550
It just toggles instantly.

184

00:12:10.820  -->  00:12:16.440
We can fix that using a C Ss transition property inside the button selector.

185

00:12:16.670  -->  00:12:19.720
We're going to write transition and pass it.

186

00:12:19.720  -->  00:12:26.150
Two arguments are two values and the first one is what we want to transition and in our case we're just

187

00:12:26.140  -->  00:12:30.610
going to add it to every property and then the next one is how long we want it to take.

188

00:12:30.710  -->  00:12:34.390
So I'm going to exaggerate it at first with two seconds.

189

00:12:34.390  -->  00:12:41.210
So again the transition property is how we can tell CSX how to animate transitions between color changes

190

00:12:41.210  -->  00:12:43.790
or font size changes and properties.

191

00:12:43.790  -->  00:12:49.730
So what I said here is that any time property changes on any button which in our case will really just

192

00:12:49.730  -->  00:12:51.900
be color and background.

193

00:12:52.070  -->  00:12:57.680
So whenever the color changes and the background color changes it should take two seconds and you'll

194

00:12:57.680  -->  00:12:59.190
see when I refresh.

195

00:12:59.420  -->  00:13:00.410
And I hover.

196

00:13:00.560  -->  00:13:01.880
Oh that's still not working.

197

00:13:01.900  -->  00:13:04.750
I'm missing my s here 2.00 s.

198

00:13:04.850  -->  00:13:12.140
And now if I refresh and hover it takes two seconds to fade in and when I click to add the selected

199

00:13:12.130  -->  00:13:17.520
class it also takes two seconds and it takes two seconds to fade out when I leave.

200

00:13:17.750  -->  00:13:20.140
So two seconds is definitely too long.

201

00:13:20.560  -->  00:13:23.580
I think I'm aiming for about point three seconds.

202

00:13:23.750  -->  00:13:25.950
Let's test that out.

203

00:13:25.970  -->  00:13:26.630
There we go.

204

00:13:26.650  -->  00:13:28.990
It looks pretty good to me.

205

00:13:29.060  -->  00:13:35.570
The last big thing is getting the rounded corners on these squares the way that we get those rounded

206

00:13:35.570  -->  00:13:38.550
corners is using a property called Border radius.

207

00:13:38.690  -->  00:13:41.990
So I have the median docs open if you want to take a look.

208

00:13:42.130  -->  00:13:42.970
It's a good read.

209

00:13:43.100  -->  00:13:46.760
But they show you some examples on the different things you can do with board a radius.

210

00:13:46.900  -->  00:13:52.000
So what we're going to do is give it a slight border radius and these are squares here.

211

00:13:52.150  -->  00:13:54.340
And let's take a look at what we're aiming for.

212

00:13:54.350  -->  00:13:56.140
So those are what we want to get.

213

00:13:56.180  -->  00:13:58.810
So it was slight slight curve.

214

00:13:59.500  -->  00:14:06.740
Let's go up to our square class and assign a border radius and let's do something really exaggerated

215

00:14:06.740  -->  00:14:10.130
to start I'll show you what happens if we do 50 percent.

216

00:14:10.490  -->  00:14:13.850
We get circles and you might actually prefer to use circles.

217

00:14:13.850  -->  00:14:20.230
I was considering using them but in the end I preferred these rounded corner squares and the number

218

00:14:20.240  -->  00:14:22.780
that I used is 15 percent.

219

00:14:23.510  -->  00:14:25.590
And we'll just double check and compare those.

220

00:14:25.850  -->  00:14:27.060
OK so that looks good.

221

00:14:27.080  -->  00:14:32.900
Fifteen percent but if you wanted I'll show you what happens if we did something like 5 percent and

222

00:14:32.890  -->  00:14:33.770
refresh.

223

00:14:34.010  -->  00:14:36.160
We get very slightly rounded corners.

224

00:14:36.290  -->  00:14:43.430
So I'll go back to my 15 refresh and now we have our nice rounded corners but we also need to work on

225

00:14:43.420  -->  00:14:47.810
getting the animation effect because when I click on one of these.

226

00:14:47.810  -->  00:14:54.740
Notice how when the color changes it fades out just like the hover effect faded in and out.

227

00:14:54.740  -->  00:14:59.920
To achieve that we also need to use the transition property but in a slightly different way.

228

00:14:59.990  -->  00:15:06.170
So I'm going to go to square and the only thing that we want to transition is the background color or

229

00:15:06.160  -->  00:15:07.170
just background.

230

00:15:07.220  -->  00:15:12.470
And again let's do a long time like 2.0 seconds and see how that looks.

231

00:15:12.500  -->  00:15:16.160
So I'll refresh and I'll click on one of these.

232

00:15:16.250  -->  00:15:19.710
You can see it takes two whole seconds to fade out.

233

00:15:19.940  -->  00:15:21.940
So we don't want something to last that long.

234

00:15:22.120  -->  00:15:26.290
Probably go for zero point six maybe.

235

00:15:26.750  -->  00:15:27.970
Let's try that.

236

00:15:28.420  -->  00:15:28.850
OK.

237

00:15:28.850  -->  00:15:31.610
That seems reasonable.

238

00:15:32.500  -->  00:15:36.680
So you can see whenever that background changes it takes 0.6 seconds.

239

00:15:36.670  -->  00:15:42.460
What's different though is that when other properties change it doesn't animate them like our buttons

240

00:15:42.560  -->  00:15:46.710
where we said when any property changes it should take point three seconds.

241

00:15:46.900  -->  00:15:49.790
We're only targeting the background and that changes.

242

00:15:49.810  -->  00:15:52.450
It should take 0.6 seconds.

243

00:15:52.490  -->  00:15:58.010
One minor thing that we do want to be aware of is that the transition property won't work in all browsers

244

00:15:58.040  -->  00:16:02.140
the way that we have it written right now to be as browser friendly as possible.

245

00:16:02.140  -->  00:16:07.770
We actually need to add in two more properties which we won't notice any difference in functionality

246

00:16:08.600  -->  00:16:10.650
but there are just for browser support.

247

00:16:10.660  -->  00:16:19.460
So the first one is Web Kit Dasch transition and we'll just add the same exact value here just like

248

00:16:19.460  -->  00:16:20.250
that.

249

00:16:20.360  -->  00:16:26.550
And then we need another one which is this should be one dash Moz M. Ozy.

250

00:16:26.600  -->  00:16:30.070
So these are actually browser prefixes.

251

00:16:30.230  -->  00:16:36.020
So Web Kit is for Web Kit which is a an engine that browsers use like Safari.

252

00:16:36.200  -->  00:16:41.700
And then we have Moz and Mozy which is short form is Zilah which is what Firefox is built on.

253

00:16:42.050  -->  00:16:47.300
So these are just to add some more support because the transition property isn't built into every single

254

00:16:47.300  -->  00:16:48.650
browser yet.

255

00:16:48.640  -->  00:16:49.790
So we refresh.

256

00:16:50.060  -->  00:16:51.850
Nothing should seem different.

257

00:16:51.860  -->  00:16:56.660
Our game still works the same way and we still get the same animation and we should do the same thing

258

00:16:56.870  -->  00:17:05.210
down here when we have transitioned all just duplicate this and change that to be transitional and transition

259

00:17:05.200  -->  00:17:08.660
all 0.3 seconds for the MOOC transition.

260

00:17:08.650  -->  00:17:15.040
One last thing that we can fix here is the bit of spacing in between the stripe and the start of our

261

00:17:15.050  -->  00:17:15.630
grid.

262

00:17:15.800  -->  00:17:18.950
So you can see we have some more spacing here that we don't have here.

263

00:17:19.150  -->  00:17:25.740
And right now if we inspect we have an element that is around our grid.

264

00:17:26.140  -->  00:17:34.210
We have our squares and we have a div ID container and that container div goes around all 6 squares

265

00:17:34.220  -->  00:17:34.320
.

266

00:17:34.390  -->  00:17:40.400
So we can use that and just add some spacing to that container div we'll just add a margin to the top

267

00:17:40.390  -->  00:17:41.950
and bottom.

268

00:17:42.110  -->  00:17:44.540
So I think we have styled it already a little bit.

269

00:17:44.540  -->  00:17:45.550
Here we go.

270

00:17:45.590  -->  00:17:47.510
So we said margin is zero.

271

00:17:47.650  -->  00:17:54.770
And auto what we'll do instead is say margin is 20 pixels on the top and bottom and auto on the left

272

00:17:54.770  -->  00:17:57.020
and right which is how it is centered.

273

00:17:57.050  -->  00:18:01.820
So we want that to be auto on left and right but 20 pixels on top refresh.

274

00:18:02.330  -->  00:18:03.590
We have our spacing.

275

00:18:04.120  -->  00:18:05.940
OK so we're done with the styling for now.
