00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:01.290
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.290  -->  00:00:06.670
So this video is going to be a high level overview of how the assess works and what it does.

3

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:11.310
So we want to actually be writing any code until the next lesson and pretty much every lesson from there

4

00:00:11.310  -->  00:00:13.120
on out covering SEUS us.

5

00:00:13.500  -->  00:00:18.930
But what we are going to do is three important things we're going to define success and talk about the

6

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:21.870
role that it plays why you use it what it does.

7

00:00:21.870  -->  00:00:24.180
We're going to view some websites that have the.

8

00:00:24.210  -->  00:00:27.560
We're going to take the C S C S away and see how they change.

9

00:00:27.900  -->  00:00:32.490
And then we're going to define this general rule that will follow for every CSSA line that we write

10

00:00:32.490  -->  00:00:34.340
.

11

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:39.580
So let's go ahead and talk about what's the stance for cascading style sheets.

12

00:00:39.840  -->  00:00:43.670
So the cascading part we're actually going to come back to in a later video.

13

00:00:43.830  -->  00:00:46.690
But the style sheets is pretty self-explanatory.

14

00:00:46.710  -->  00:00:55.390
Remember that C Ss is often considered the adjectives or the skin where H M L would be the nouns.

15

00:00:55.590  -->  00:00:59.830
So Jim Ellis the structure we want in heading here and a bullet point here.

16

00:01:00.090  -->  00:01:07.740
We used to say make the headings purple and font size 50 pixels and move this down to the bottom and

17

00:01:07.740  -->  00:01:09.170
give it a border.

18

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:13.760
So we use it to describe how things should look so style sheets.

19

00:01:13.770  -->  00:01:19.410
The other part is the sheets part of it and what that means is that we're going to be writing these

20

00:01:19.530  -->  00:01:21.030
separately from each team.

21

00:01:21.110  -->  00:01:23.400
They are not inside HMO.

22

00:01:23.460  -->  00:01:27.590
They are separate documents that we then include in our HMO.

23

00:01:28.020  -->  00:01:31.510
So let's start by taking a look at some examples.

24

00:01:31.560  -->  00:01:35.430
There's a site that I really really like called CSX Zen garden

25

00:01:38.610  -->  00:01:44.490
and the whole point of this site is to show you the variety of things you can accomplish with Jesse

26

00:01:44.490  -->  00:01:45.220
s s.

27

00:01:45.300  -->  00:01:49.200
So if you take a look here we have some markup.

28

00:01:49.260  -->  00:01:52.120
Let's look at the HDMI file.

29

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:54.010
We can go ahead and open that up.

30

00:01:54.450  -->  00:01:58.780
So this is the core file that every single page NCEA says.

31

00:01:58.840  -->  00:02:00.300
Zen garden uses.

32

00:02:00.300  -->  00:02:02.130
So you can see it's pretty basic.

33

00:02:02.130  -->  00:02:04.280
We've got some headings.

34

00:02:04.280  -->  00:02:10.260
We've got some paragraphs some links some bullet points at the bottom and then the whole idea of this

35

00:02:10.260  -->  00:02:16.710
site is that contributors take this to email and write their own CSSA without changing the aged him

36

00:02:16.710  -->  00:02:17.580
out at all.

37

00:02:17.580  -->  00:02:23.360
So you only change to see assess the structure is the same and you end up with different results.

38

00:02:23.370  -->  00:02:25.550
So here's one.

39

00:02:25.720  -->  00:02:31.320
And on the right side you can check out a few others and there's there's a bunch of them on the site

40

00:02:31.350  -->  00:02:33.800
and actually you can contribute your own if you want it to.

41

00:02:34.080  -->  00:02:35.020
Well let's take a look.

42

00:02:35.250  -->  00:02:42.750
So this one is radically different total different lay out different color schemes fonts images.

43

00:02:42.750  -->  00:02:44.190
This one is also very different.

44

00:02:44.190  -->  00:02:47.840
It has this nice loading animation all done Roscius us.

45

00:02:48.240  -->  00:02:54.420
You can scroll down and we have this effect where our content scrolls but the background image is static

46

00:02:54.420  -->  00:02:56.050
.

47

00:02:56.130  -->  00:03:00.190
We have this one which is radically different as well.

48

00:03:01.020  -->  00:03:06.990
And we could spend all day on here and we just find one more which is my favorite which is a robot named

49

00:03:06.990  -->  00:03:08.820
Jimmy.

50

00:03:09.190  -->  00:03:13.510
We get this little robot that pops up in this spinning a starburst in the back.

51

00:03:13.620  -->  00:03:20.860
Also another scrolling effect so I'm showing this to you so that you can see how powerful CSSA is.

52

00:03:21.060  -->  00:03:23.330
It basically is the skin doctor.

53

00:03:23.370  -->  00:03:27.330
The additives for your structure it can change.

54

00:03:27.330  -->  00:03:35.020
You know aside from looking like this and it can change it to look like this.

55

00:03:35.070  -->  00:03:40.140
So hopefully that's enough to get you excited about learning C S s r h d m l side so far have been pretty

56

00:03:40.140  -->  00:03:40.690
bland.

57

00:03:40.770  -->  00:03:45.170
We haven't had any style besides the default black and white styles.

58

00:03:46.440  -->  00:03:51.660
So next up I want to talk about a general rule that every line of CSSA that we've write will follow

59

00:03:51.670  -->  00:03:51.880
.

60

00:03:52.050  -->  00:03:55.090
So this pattern here it looks like this.

61

00:03:55.230  -->  00:03:56.800
We select something.

62

00:03:57.270  -->  00:04:02.990
So we're going to talk a lot about what actually goes there but we'll select something like All h ones

63

00:04:03.300  -->  00:04:06.470
or every anchor tag inside of an ally.

64

00:04:06.540  -->  00:04:12.690
So we do something where we're selecting h tim l elements are referencing existing h t m l and then

65

00:04:12.690  -->  00:04:19.710
inside the curly braces we apply some styles and they follow this key value pair format where we have

66

00:04:19.710  -->  00:04:24.350
a property colon and then a corresponding value and then a semi-colon.

67

00:04:24.690  -->  00:04:30.090
So we can have one thing in here we can have 100 different properties that we're changing but they always

68

00:04:30.090  -->  00:04:33.770
follow this syntax property Colan value.

69

00:04:34.740  -->  00:04:36.510
So here's two examples.

70

00:04:36.540  -->  00:04:40.190
This first section is going to select all h ones.

71

00:04:40.260  -->  00:04:42.920
So again we're going to come back to you how these selectors work.

72

00:04:43.080  -->  00:04:49.350
But it's going to select all each ones on a page and then it's going to give them color of purple and

73

00:04:49.350  -->  00:04:57.000
font size of 56 and then this next one down here is going to select all image tags and give them border

74

00:04:57.000  -->  00:05:02.100
color red and border with of three pixels.

75

00:05:02.100  -->  00:05:06.350
So you know we're not always going to select all the ones in all image tags.

76

00:05:06.570  -->  00:05:10.860
We're going to have multiple videos on actually the nuances of selecting things sometimes we want to

77

00:05:10.860  -->  00:05:15.310
select tons of things sometimes we're doing one small element at a time.

78

00:05:15.450  -->  00:05:19.160
So there's a lot of options there but it always follows this format.

79

00:05:19.470  -->  00:05:26.250
We select something curly braces and then inside the curly braces we have key value pairs that are actually

80

00:05:26.250  -->  00:05:27.420
just properties that we're changing
