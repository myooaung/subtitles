00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:06.210
Welcome back in this unit I'm going to show you a few other components including jumbotron and bootstrap

2

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:07.420
forms and inputs.

3

00:00:07.530  -->  00:00:12.120
But before I do that I want to take a moment to address something that's really really important when

4

00:00:12.120  -->  00:00:14.520
we're learning new tools like this like bootstrap.

5

00:00:14.760  -->  00:00:19.620
And in my experience of teaching people to become web developers I've noticed a bootstrap is one of

6

00:00:19.620  -->  00:00:25.230
the first places where some of the students start to feel uneasy uncomfortable and they feel like they

7

00:00:25.230  -->  00:00:29.820
don't know if they're doing and then because we're suddenly including a bunch of code someone else wrote

8

00:00:29.820  -->  00:00:31.200
into our application.

9

00:00:31.200  -->  00:00:36.810
But if you take a look at the docs here they're really long they're comprehensive which is great but

10

00:00:36.810  -->  00:00:42.810
there's a lot here and I want you to frame this not as a manual that you have to read in order to understand

11

00:00:42.810  -->  00:00:43.550
everything.

12

00:00:43.560  -->  00:00:47.980
This is not like a how to guide that you have to finish before we use bootstrap.

13

00:00:48.300  -->  00:00:53.790
It's a reference where if you decide you need a form you look at the form section if you need a table

14

00:00:53.790  -->  00:00:53.820
.

15

00:00:53.850  -->  00:00:56.780
You'll hit the table section if you need a nav bar.

16

00:00:56.850  -->  00:01:01.920
You look at the NFR section but it's important that you treat the docs like that you will be using them

17

00:01:02.100  -->  00:01:08.310
non-stop coming back to here referencing individual bits of code copying their code segments checking

18

00:01:08.310  -->  00:01:12.810
out some demonstrations reading examples I've been using bootstrapped for years at this point.

19

00:01:12.930  -->  00:01:14.630
And I feel pretty good about most of it.

20

00:01:14.760  -->  00:01:18.220
But I leave the docs open when I'm working on anything with bootstrap.

21

00:01:18.330  -->  00:01:24.450
I'm constantly referencing the examples in one of the really early videos in this course I talked about

22

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:26.900
how to become a web developer.

23

00:01:27.060  -->  00:01:32.490
You're not becoming an expert in memorization and in knowing every bit of information.

24

00:01:32.730  -->  00:01:33.960
Yes you need to know things.

25

00:01:33.960  -->  00:01:38.700
Yes you have to understand and memorize some things but you're not becoming an expert or memorization

26

00:01:38.700  -->  00:01:39.210
.

27

00:01:39.210  -->  00:01:41.990
You're becoming an expert in accessing information.

28

00:01:42.120  -->  00:01:48.180
And some of that information you'll have memorized and a lot of it is going to be online in documentation

29

00:01:48.450  -->  00:01:52.410
or examples videos books all sorts of resources.

30

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:54.350
All right so to sum up the entire pep talk.

31

00:01:54.450  -->  00:01:58.890
Basically I just want you to keep in mind that yes there's a lot to bootstrap and you're going to see

32

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:01.430
20 30 percent of it and there's a lot more out there.

33

00:02:01.440  -->  00:02:03.210
But don't be intimidated by that.

34

00:02:03.240  -->  00:02:07.110
You should feel comfortable accessing the docs if you need to do something that I don't show you how

35

00:02:07.110  -->  00:02:07.800
to do.

36

00:02:07.860  -->  00:02:09.480
Open up the docs and look for it.

37

00:02:09.600  -->  00:02:13.760
And there's always great examples and explanations on get bootstrapped dotcom.

38

00:02:14.120  -->  00:02:19.130
OK so without further ado let's move on to talking about some of these important components and I'm

39

00:02:19.140  -->  00:02:22.110
going to start by showing you Jumbotron.

40

00:02:22.500  -->  00:02:28.170
So a Jumbotron according to the official docs is a lightweight flexible component that can optionally

41

00:02:28.170  -->  00:02:31.680
extend the entire viewport to showcase key content on your site.

42

00:02:31.680  -->  00:02:37.670
You can see an example of one right here and if we want to use a Jumbotron it's really really easy.

43

00:02:37.680  -->  00:02:43.680
All we need to do is write div class jumbotron and then whatever we put inside of that will be part

44

00:02:43.680  -->  00:02:44.750
of the Jumbotron.

45

00:02:44.970  -->  00:02:46.680
So let's try that.

46

00:02:47.190  -->  00:02:58.940
Just do it below are buttons will have a div with class Jumbotron jumbo tron and then inside if there

47

00:02:59.370  -->  00:03:09.630
let's do an H1 or H-1 will say this is a jumbotron and then add a button in there just like they have

48

00:03:09.630  -->  00:03:17.300
here and we'll add a paragraph as well in our paragraph will just be jibberish.

49

00:03:17.790  -->  00:03:19.420
Good enough for now.

50

00:03:20.310  -->  00:03:21.060
And a button

51

00:03:24.330  -->  00:03:28.460
and our button will just say hi there.

52

00:03:28.800  -->  00:03:29.250
OK.

53

00:03:29.250  -->  00:03:31.830
And then a button we have a few choices.

54

00:03:31.980  -->  00:03:39.680
We'll do a button success and I'll make it large and save.

55

00:03:39.940  -->  00:03:41.620
Let's take a look at what we get.

56

00:03:41.790  -->  00:03:47.400
And there's a Jumbotron you can see that it takes up the entire width of our browser window and that's

57

00:03:47.400  -->  00:03:48.740
not usually what we want.

58

00:03:49.050  -->  00:03:54.840
And what's happening is that the JumboTron is set up to take up 100 percent of whatever container it's

59

00:03:54.840  -->  00:03:55.510
inside of.

60

00:03:55.640  -->  00:03:57.740
In this case it's not outside of anything.

61

00:03:57.900  -->  00:04:02.550
But shortly I'll be showing you the grid system and bootstrap where we can control exactly how much

62

00:04:02.550  -->  00:04:07.620
you want this to take up of the screen if you want it to be centered and take up a third of the screen

63

00:04:07.620  -->  00:04:07.640
.

64

00:04:07.650  -->  00:04:12.180
Two thirds of the screen a quarter of the screen we have all these different choices we can make by

65

00:04:12.180  -->  00:04:14.150
using bootstraps grid system.

66

00:04:14.310  -->  00:04:21.480
For now I'm going to show you another element we cannot in which is a div with class equal to container

67

00:04:23.600  -->  00:04:25.140
and what container will do.

68

00:04:25.140  -->  00:04:31.800
If we just put stuff inside of div class container it gives it some spacing some padding around it and

69

00:04:31.800  -->  00:04:32.950
it centers things.

70

00:04:33.360  -->  00:04:35.130
So the container find inspect it

71

00:04:38.550  -->  00:04:46.750
takes up all this space here you can see but it has quite a bit of margin on it.

72

00:04:46.750  -->  00:04:50.860
So if we just want a quick improvement without having to use the grid system which we haven't talked

73

00:04:50.860  -->  00:04:55.990
about we can add div class container and now we get this nice looking Jumbotron.

74

00:04:55.990  -->  00:05:01.720
And if we move this code that we already have down into the containers well but we won't put it inside

75

00:05:01.720  -->  00:05:03.230
the Jumbotron.

76

00:05:03.310  -->  00:05:07.890
You'll see that it still is affected by that container.

77

00:05:08.020  -->  00:05:15.640
So outside the Jumbotron but inside the container save and refresh you can see it's also inside that

78

00:05:15.640  -->  00:05:18.120
container and it reflects that visually.

79

00:05:18.400  -->  00:05:22.320
OK let's head back to components and the next thing that I'll show you.

80

00:05:22.330  -->  00:05:23.950
We go to the top.

81

00:05:24.280  -->  00:05:28.760
We have to go over to see assess and I'll show you the forms and how those work.

82

00:05:28.990  -->  00:05:33.030
So click on forms and there's quite a few different types and different examples.

83

00:05:33.070  -->  00:05:35.710
And I'll just scroll through them first before we type anything.

84

00:05:35.980  -->  00:05:39.910
So here's a basic example of a bootstrap form.

85

00:05:39.910  -->  00:05:42.540
You can see the market that creates it.

86

00:05:42.760  -->  00:05:49.930
Then we have what's known as an inline form and we have another type of inline form and yet another

87

00:05:49.930  -->  00:05:55.320
one with different types of inputs and another type of form.

88

00:05:55.480  -->  00:05:59.140
And now this talks about all the different type of form controls the different types of inputs that

89

00:05:59.140  -->  00:06:00.420
are supported.

90

00:06:00.430  -->  00:06:03.280
So all of these color you are.

91

00:06:03.310  -->  00:06:13.450
Email number week time and so on text areas different checkboxes disabled checkboxes disabled radio

92

00:06:13.450  -->  00:06:24.940
buttons inline checkboxes inline radio buttons dropdown menus selects keep going down.

93

00:06:24.970  -->  00:06:26.780
We have other forum States.

94

00:06:26.780  -->  00:06:28.370
We have a focus state.

95

00:06:28.470  -->  00:06:30.910
You can see this highlighting around that blue.

96

00:06:31.060  -->  00:06:34.420
That's the default bootstrap focus styling.

97

00:06:34.420  -->  00:06:43.750
We can also disable inputs by adding in disabled and we've also got a few other things we can do but

98

00:06:43.780  -->  00:06:49.780
I'm going to go back up and really focus on the basic exampled start and I'll start by just copying

99

00:06:50.200  -->  00:06:54.610
this entire form over and then we'll dissect it bit by bit.

100

00:06:54.610  -->  00:06:59.200
So let's go back here and we'll just add this form after everything else.

101

00:06:59.200  -->  00:07:01.420
But I will do it inside the container.

102

00:07:01.420  -->  00:07:03.290
Let me make this full screen for a moment.

103

00:07:03.340  -->  00:07:08.580
We have our form and inside that form we've got quite a bit of content.

104

00:07:08.590  -->  00:07:11.900
Let's go back to the browser and take a look at what it looks like.

105

00:07:12.460  -->  00:07:17.170
And the first thing you'll probably notice is that our form goes all the way across this container.

106

00:07:17.230  -->  00:07:21.060
It takes up 100 percent of that with and that's something we'll be able to control.

107

00:07:21.100  -->  00:07:27.360
Once we talk about the bootstrap grid system and will easily be able to say this should go 50 percent

108

00:07:27.380  -->  00:07:28.470
the way across.

109

00:07:28.480  -->  00:07:32.920
So that's something we'll be able to easily change once we talk about the bootstrap grid system or we're

110

00:07:32.920  -->  00:07:34.090
not there just yet.

111

00:07:34.120  -->  00:07:35.510
So we're just going to go with it.

112

00:07:35.530  -->  00:07:37.080
It takes up 100 percent for now.

113

00:07:37.120  -->  00:07:39.670
It's a gigantic weird looking forum but that's fine.

114

00:07:39.820  -->  00:07:41.320
We love it how it is.

115

00:07:41.470  -->  00:07:45.290
So we'll go back to sublime and let's dissect this one piece at a time.

116

00:07:45.550  -->  00:07:48.730
So we have a forum tag inside of that forum tag.

117

00:07:48.910  -->  00:07:54.880
There is a div class form group and if you want to know more about what that does if you go back to

118

00:07:54.880  -->  00:08:01.840
the bootstrap docs and do a search for form group and you can see the rap labels and controls in form

119

00:08:01.840  -->  00:08:04.010
group for optimum spacing.

120

00:08:04.300  -->  00:08:11.140
So if we get rid of that form group class around this first one and we'll do it around the first and

121

00:08:11.140  -->  00:08:13.800
second one you'll see what we end up with.

122

00:08:13.870  -->  00:08:21.520
I'll save and refresh you see how the spacing changes here between those inputs.

123

00:08:22.150  -->  00:08:27.040
So we can go back and add that form group and this is really how you use it where you have an input

124

00:08:27.250  -->  00:08:30.640
and the label and you want them to be grouped together is formed.

125

00:08:30.940  -->  00:08:35.320
So pay attention right here just a little bit of space is added right there.

126

00:08:35.320  -->  00:08:40.330
It just adds a little bit of space right here which effectively groups these two together visually and

127

00:08:40.330  -->  00:08:43.660
then Grip's these together visually as well as these down here.

128

00:08:43.660  -->  00:08:45.390
So that's form group.

129

00:08:46.000  -->  00:08:47.860
And then the labels are just normal.

130

00:08:47.860  -->  00:08:54.610
We don't have to add anything fancy to label no Boucek class but the input there is a class form control

131

00:08:54.630  -->  00:08:54.960
.

132

00:08:55.300  -->  00:08:57.470
So let's see what happens when I get rid of it.

133

00:08:57.700  -->  00:09:03.670
So I'll just do it on the first and put the email input and go back and refresh.

134

00:09:03.670  -->  00:09:08.590
Notice that this completely changes back to a normal default browser input.

135

00:09:08.590  -->  00:09:10.050
So you don't get the rounded corners.

136

00:09:10.060  -->  00:09:12.800
We don't get the same padding and spacing of things.

137

00:09:13.000  -->  00:09:18.010
And we also don't get the same focus effect when I click we do get a blue outline but it's different

138

00:09:18.010  -->  00:09:19.010
than this one.

139

00:09:19.180  -->  00:09:23.860
The bootstrap outline is a little more subtle and those are just the immediately obvious visual changes

140

00:09:23.860  -->  00:09:28.750
between the two but there's actually some more important differences that you'll see once we get working

141

00:09:28.750  -->  00:09:33.430
with the grid system and the way that they behave and interact with other elements.

142

00:09:33.620  -->  00:09:36.170
Will go back and add form control again.

143

00:09:36.400  -->  00:09:45.880
So really if we wanted to distill this everything here boils down to form group and form control.

144

00:09:46.150  -->  00:09:49.840
Those two classes are really responsible for making things look good.

145

00:09:49.840  -->  00:09:55.680
Now there is this paragraph class help block and we can take a look at what we get from that.

146

00:09:55.690  -->  00:10:01.910
It's this text down here which just gives a little hint a pointer about part of your form and that stuff

147

00:10:01.910  -->  00:10:07.680
with the class help block and then we have our button down here which is just a regular Pucelle button

148

00:10:08.120  -->  00:10:13.570
or we have between a and b tend to fall and we could make it larger or smaller extra small change the

149

00:10:13.570  -->  00:10:16.080
color just like any other button.

150

00:10:16.090  -->  00:10:21.910
So already you can see how this is a little bit like Legos where we have a button Lego that we can add

151

00:10:21.910  -->  00:10:23.270
into a jumbotron.

152

00:10:23.320  -->  00:10:27.360
We can also just added on its own or we can add it instead of a form.

153

00:10:27.430  -->  00:10:31.840
It's just a little plug and play component that we can add in to different parts of our application

154

00:10:31.840  -->  00:10:32.470
.

155

00:10:32.500  -->  00:10:36.990
So let's go back and take a look at one other type of form which is the inline form.

156

00:10:37.450  -->  00:10:39.120
So this looks slightly different.

157

00:10:39.340  -->  00:10:44.800
If we just copy this code over and we take a look with the differences so I'll leave that first form

158

00:10:46.020  -->  00:10:53.860
and let's add a comment down here in line form and let's indent things properly.

159

00:10:54.880  -->  00:10:56.200
Looks good.

160

00:10:56.200  -->  00:10:58.360
Notice that everything is identical.

161

00:10:58.360  -->  00:11:04.290
We still have a form control on the inputs we have form group but there's one big difference.

162

00:11:04.360  -->  00:11:09.070
Everything is inside of a form with class form in line so that one line.

163

00:11:09.490  -->  00:11:11.550
Let's just show you what it looks like to start.

164

00:11:11.640  -->  00:11:15.450
I go back gives us this nice in line form here.

165

00:11:15.850  -->  00:11:24.870
And as soon as I get rid of that and save it now goes back to a regular form like we have here.

166

00:11:25.210  -->  00:11:29.330
So just one class contains all the styles that will control that.

167

00:11:29.470  -->  00:11:31.340
So we'll keep it as Form in line.

168

00:11:31.540  -->  00:11:34.270
And again the spacing is not ideal right now.

169

00:11:34.270  -->  00:11:37.130
That will be fixed when we talk about the grid system.

170

00:11:37.150  -->  00:11:40.090
There's plenty more we could talk about around bootstrap forms.

171

00:11:40.090  -->  00:11:46.060
We could probably do 30 45 minute lecture on just building complex forms bootstrap learning the ins

172

00:11:46.060  -->  00:11:51.640
and outs of all of these different pieces and different things that we can do validations custom sizing

173

00:11:51.970  -->  00:11:53.750
all sorts of different styles we can work with.

174

00:11:53.830  -->  00:11:55.120
But I'm not going to do that.

175

00:11:55.210  -->  00:11:56.880
We've covered the important basics.

176

00:11:56.940  -->  00:12:01.540
There's two types of forms are kind of the bread and butter of Boucek forms where we have the basic

177

00:12:01.600  -->  00:12:07.150
regular form and then an inline form and there will be a few other features in different aspects of

178

00:12:07.150  -->  00:12:09.730
bootstrap that we do use around the forms.

179

00:12:09.910  -->  00:12:14.680
But rather than spend time right now and bog you down on all the ins and outs and the small details

180

00:12:14.680  -->  00:12:19.540
of PRICHEP forms I'll just throw in those little pieces when we need them when we're actually using

181

00:12:19.540  -->  00:12:20.310
bootstrap.

182

00:12:20.530  -->  00:12:27.280
So the two takeaways here about forms would be two classes that are really important form control and

183

00:12:27.280  -->  00:12:33.480
form group form control makes the inputs bootstrap refined form group just add some nice spacing.

184

00:12:33.550  -->  00:12:40.660
So whatever you put in said a form group gets some nice spacing and then single class form dash in line

185

00:12:40.660  -->  00:12:40.910
.

186

00:12:40.960  -->  00:12:44.160
If you wrap a form in that the entire form goes in line.

187

00:12:44.520  -->  00:12:46.570
And then we also talked about Jumbotron.

188

00:12:46.900  -->  00:12:50.020
Very simple class equals Jumbotron.

189

00:12:50.110  -->  00:12:51.650
So you can see a peer.

190

00:12:51.970  -->  00:12:54.230
And then we put everything inside of a container.

191

00:12:54.460  -->  00:12:59.140
And if we get rid of that container to show you what happens.

192

00:12:59.880  -->  00:13:04.950
Refresh all that spacing that nice margin goes away.

193

00:13:05.200  -->  00:13:11.500
So containers nice way just to get a quick bit of spacing on your app make things look relatively nice

194

00:13:11.520  -->  00:13:11.820
.

195

00:13:12.140  -->  00:13:17.620
OK so before I end this video I'll spend 10 seconds showing you a site that we're going to build an

196

00:13:17.620  -->  00:13:23.680
application that has a full back end database connected using node and express and Mongo and mongoose

197

00:13:23.680  -->  00:13:28.780
and a bunch of technologies and we use bootstrap to prototype the interface to make it look relatively

198

00:13:28.780  -->  00:13:33.160
good pretty quickly and you can see we have a Jumbotron right here.

199

00:13:33.160  -->  00:13:37.820
We're using some of the buttons we're using the grid system that I'll explain later.

200

00:13:37.960  -->  00:13:40.950
And then if I go to log in can see we have a form.

201

00:13:41.260  -->  00:13:46.360
So these are form controls that I've styled using the grid system so that it doesn't take up the entire

202

00:13:46.360  -->  00:13:47.610
width of the screen.

203

00:13:47.680  -->  00:13:50.070
Rather it only takes up this little middle section.

204

00:13:50.170  -->  00:13:52.700
So we'll see that once we talk about the grid system.

205

00:13:52.950  -->  00:13:57.490
But I just want to show you that this is a real application and it's something we'll use bootstrap on

206

00:13:57.610  -->  00:14:00.460
to help us prototype and get things looking decent pretty quickly
