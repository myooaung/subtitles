00:00:00,410  -->  00:00:06,720
We'll come back in this lesson and demonstrate the bootstrap grid system and the grid system is probably

2

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:11,310
the number one reason that people use bootstrap the forms nap hours.

3

00:00:11,310  -->  00:00:16,500
The buttons are nice stylistic changes we can make with bootstrap but the bootstrap grid system will

4

00:00:16,500  -->  00:00:19,290
act as the skeleton of our entire application.

5

00:00:19,440  -->  00:00:23,980
It's a really easy way for us to add structure and lay out to our application.

6

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:27,480
So let me show you a few examples of what you can do with the grid system.

7

00:00:27,480  -->  00:00:33,990
I have a few sites open from Bootstrap ex-beau the first one here is a product page for a water pitcher

8

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:36,140
and scroll down.

9

00:00:36,240  -->  00:00:37,530
Notice the lay out here.

10

00:00:37,560  -->  00:00:46,740
We have three items side by side and then also notice as they change size here they scale down and then

11

00:00:46,890  -->  00:00:50,310
when I hit tablet size they stack on top of each other.

12

00:00:51,090  -->  00:00:56,940
So that's the bootstrap grid system at work as is this right here where we have another similar effect

13

00:00:56,940  -->  00:00:57,270
.

14

00:00:57,270  -->  00:01:02,100
They scale and then they stack on tablet and mobile size.

15

00:01:02,880  -->  00:01:04,110
Here's another example.

16

00:01:04,140  -->  00:01:10,440
This is Icelandic musician and Olafur Arnolds and this is scroll down on this site.

17

00:01:10,560  -->  00:01:19,260
We have some content that's built with the grid system here that you can see similar layout but it's

18

00:01:19,260  -->  00:01:23,150
not just that this is built with a grid system as well.

19

00:01:23,160  -->  00:01:25,210
This here this content.

20

00:01:26,100  -->  00:01:28,350
These tour dates here.

21

00:01:28,350  -->  00:01:33,930
Basically using the grid system we can say that we want some content to take up 100 percent of the screen

22

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:39,870
then we can also use it to say that we want each one of these to take up 25 percent of the width of

23

00:01:39,870  -->  00:01:46,620
the screen until we hit the mobile side or the tablet size for each take up 50 now and then when we

24

00:01:46,620  -->  00:01:49,220
hit Mobile they each take up 100 percent.

25

00:01:49,860  -->  00:01:50,850
Same thing done here.

26

00:01:50,850  -->  00:01:56,660
It lets us divide that with the screen into pieces and pick how many pieces we want.

27

00:01:56,790  -->  00:02:00,660
Each of our own elements to takeup and here's the last one we've seen already.

28

00:02:00,660  -->  00:02:05,670
It's called creative Tim desert scroll down here similar content.

29

00:02:05,680  -->  00:02:09,530
Here is the grid system and here as well.

30

00:02:09,570  -->  00:02:11,430
So this is all done with the grid system.

31

00:02:11,430  -->  00:02:15,590
All of this so really important very exciting stuff.

32

00:02:15,760  -->  00:02:20,640
It helps us lay things out so easily compared to what we'd have to do without bootstrap.

33

00:02:20,670  -->  00:02:25,660
So we'll be using bootstraps grid system and pretty much every application we make using bootstrap.

34

00:02:25,890  -->  00:02:27,500
And let me show you one of them.

35

00:02:27,540  -->  00:02:33,940
This is our yo camp application and notice that we have a grid of campgrounds for across.

36

00:02:33,960  -->  00:02:39,750
And as I resize the screen notice that they scale and then we go to two across and then down to Mobile

37

00:02:39,750  -->  00:02:40,050
.

38

00:02:40,050  -->  00:02:44,480
We go to one across and it's a really nice easy to use mobile layout.

39

00:02:44,760  -->  00:02:47,840
So that's just one place where we'll use a grid system.

40

00:02:47,850  -->  00:02:54,060
Now let's get started in writing some code using the grid system so full screen this window and go back

41

00:02:54,060  -->  00:02:57,800
to get bootstrapped dotcom under the Assessed tab.

42

00:02:58,050  -->  00:03:00,850
You can click on grid system.

43

00:03:00,850  -->  00:03:05,670
There's quite a bit to the grid system but I'm going to start by just pointing out a single number here

44

00:03:06,130  -->  00:03:07,300
12.

45

00:03:07,470  -->  00:03:09,890
This is really important to how the grid system works.

46

00:03:09,900  -->  00:03:15,930
So every container and bootstrap can be divided into 12 different columns and then using the grid system

47

00:03:16,230  -->  00:03:21,150
we can pick how many of those 12 units each element should take up.

48

00:03:21,150  -->  00:03:27,050
So in this case it looks like they have something taking up about 10 out of 12 units.

49

00:03:27,060  -->  00:03:33,420
And then over here two out of 12 units or might be nine and 3 but they have some ratio where they have

50

00:03:33,420  -->  00:03:40,320
more out of those 12 on the left side and then a small fraction out of the 12 on the right side.

51

00:03:40,770  -->  00:03:46,510
So if we go back to camp here this is our container right here.

52

00:03:46,890  -->  00:03:51,670
And each one of these out of 12 units each one takes up three units.

53

00:03:51,810  -->  00:03:56,850
So we end up with four equal columns and then we shrink it down right here.

54

00:03:56,880  -->  00:04:00,040
Now they each take up six units out of 12.

55

00:04:00,240  -->  00:04:02,840
So again that number 12 very important.

56

00:04:02,850  -->  00:04:03,660
Now let's go in right.

57

00:04:03,660  -->  00:04:05,130
Our very first grid.

58

00:04:05,250  -->  00:04:12,710
So I have a file made grid does h t m l it's empty except for the bootstraps the SS file and to start

59

00:04:12,870  -->  00:04:14,640
we need to define a container.

60

00:04:14,860  -->  00:04:18,180
Anytime we use a Boucek grid it needs to be inside of a container.

61

00:04:18,210  -->  00:04:22,230
So class equals container.

62

00:04:22,290  -->  00:04:28,950
And the first thing we need to do is to find another div with class equal to row instead of each row

63

00:04:28,950  -->  00:04:29,190
.

64

00:04:29,220  -->  00:04:31,100
We have 12 units to pick from.

65

00:04:31,350  -->  00:04:37,110
So what we're going to start by doing is just doing a 50 50 split we'll have 1 div that takes up 6 out

66

00:04:37,110  -->  00:04:40,730
of 12 and then another div that takes up 6 out of 12.

67

00:04:41,070  -->  00:04:42,050
So let's do that now.

68

00:04:42,120  -->  00:04:48,060
We'll add a div and then I'll also add my second division and right now it's just two devices are empty

69

00:04:48,060  -->  00:04:48,330
.

70

00:04:48,330  -->  00:04:49,430
You're not going to work.

71

00:04:49,650  -->  00:04:57,000
But what I'll do is add a class to the first one and this will look a little bit weird column A large

72

00:04:57,670  -->  00:05:00,300
six and we'll do the same thing here.

73

00:05:00,300  -->  00:05:03,520
Class equals column large six.

74

00:05:03,630  -->  00:05:05,200
Then we'll add some content in here.

75

00:05:05,210  -->  00:05:10,880
They will just say column large six.

76

00:05:10,950  -->  00:05:12,140
Same thing here.

77

00:05:12,210  -->  00:05:18,950
And as I do that let's save and we won't actually see very much we don't see the grid itself.

78

00:05:19,020  -->  00:05:24,300
So to make that clearer I'll define a class here instead of a style tag.

79

00:05:24,300  -->  00:05:26,670
What I'll do is define a class.

80

00:05:26,730  -->  00:05:31,350
I'll just call it pink and I'll apply this class to or two divs so we can see them.

81

00:05:31,490  -->  00:05:32,820
So right now they're just white.

82

00:05:32,820  -->  00:05:33,660
No border.

83

00:05:33,750  -->  00:05:34,840
Just a little bit of text.

84

00:05:35,010  -->  00:05:36,050
But if we add this in.

85

00:05:36,180  -->  00:05:37,010
So pink.

86

00:05:37,140  -->  00:05:45,660
And then we want background to be pink and we'll do a purple border one pixel solid purple and then

87

00:05:45,660  -->  00:05:49,950
we'll apply the pink class to these two divs.

88

00:05:49,950  -->  00:05:52,660
Each one takes up six units.

89

00:05:52,680  -->  00:05:54,570
Now we go back and refresh.

90

00:05:54,900  -->  00:05:55,580
There we go.

91

00:05:55,800  -->  00:05:59,640
You can see we have two divs that take up exactly half of the container.

92

00:05:59,670  -->  00:06:01,930
The container starts here and here.

93

00:06:02,460  -->  00:06:04,530
And we've divided into two.

94

00:06:04,620  -->  00:06:10,110
So now we can go back and play around a little bit more and let's try adding in a third column.

95

00:06:10,410  -->  00:06:16,150
And this time will make the middle column eight units and then the left and right will be two.

96

00:06:16,170  -->  00:06:21,270
So end up and I'll change these numbers here.

97

00:06:21,280  -->  00:06:22,200
There we go.

98

00:06:22,200  -->  00:06:27,960
We'll end up with a nice centered column in the middle and then two smaller columns on the left and

99

00:06:27,960  -->  00:06:30,900
right that we could use for a side bar or something.

100

00:06:30,900  -->  00:06:34,860
So that's a very basic concept underlying all of the bootstrap grid system.

101

00:06:34,920  -->  00:06:40,290
We have 12 units going across whatever container we're working inside of and we can designate those

102

00:06:40,290  -->  00:06:42,210
12 units in any way that we want.

103

00:06:42,240  -->  00:06:49,830
So we could do 12 individual columns each one column large one and we could do that 12 times just like

104

00:06:49,830  -->  00:06:52,170
this.

105

00:06:52,290  -->  00:06:53,600
Make sure I don't lose count.

106

00:06:54,090  -->  00:06:54,670
There we go.

107

00:06:54,690  -->  00:06:56,620
And then we'll get rid of these two for now.

108

00:06:56,820  -->  00:07:01,630
And if I were fresh you'll see in one row we have 12 evenly sized columns.

109

00:07:01,650  -->  00:07:07,570
Each one takes up one unit and then I'll also show you we can add other rows.

110

00:07:07,740  -->  00:07:14,390
So let's do that now div class equals row and it will just go below this first row that we have.

111

00:07:14,730  -->  00:07:18,870
So inside of this one let's do div.

112

00:07:19,020  -->  00:07:23,350
Class equals column Dasch large and let's do four.

113

00:07:23,370  -->  00:07:27,280
So we'll split it up to three evenly sized units.

114

00:07:27,360  -->  00:07:36,260
So column arge for her go just like that.

115

00:07:36,420  -->  00:07:44,190
And let's go take a look now and you can see we didn't apply the pink class but we have three evenly

116

00:07:44,190  -->  00:07:49,260
sized columns that fall below the 12 evenly sized columns were created.

117

00:07:49,470  -->  00:07:53,240
So we could add in the pink class just to make it easier to see what's happening.

118

00:07:53,940  -->  00:07:54,800
And there we go.

119

00:07:55,140  -->  00:07:57,350
So this is just a simple example.

120

00:07:57,420  -->  00:08:01,470
You wouldn't actually have these pink boxes most likely on our site.

121

00:08:01,710  -->  00:08:08,730
But as you can see here we have a grid where we have rows and each row has four columns going across

122

00:08:08,730  -->  00:08:08,760
.

123

00:08:08,760  -->  00:08:15,830
Each one is three units wide or here on this creative Tim site.

124

00:08:15,900  -->  00:08:19,830
We have three columns going across each one is four units wide.

125

00:08:20,070  -->  00:08:20,900
Same thing here.

126

00:08:20,900  -->  00:08:23,860
Three columns going across here.

127

00:08:23,910  -->  00:08:24,960
We have four columns.

128

00:08:24,960  -->  00:08:26,840
Each one has three units wide.

129

00:08:27,390  -->  00:08:30,650
So that's the very very basics of the grid in the next video.

130

00:08:30,660  -->  00:08:35,850
We'll talk about how to make the grid responsive and have different layouts at different sizes.

131

00:08:35,850  -->  00:08:38,230
Right now we've been working with column large one.

132

00:08:38,250  -->  00:08:43,050
I have explained with a large means and there are three other sizes and we'll see those in the next

133

00:08:43,050  -->  00:08:49,080
video and we'll also see how we can write nested grids where we can add another row inside of any of

134

00:08:49,080  -->  00:08:52,290
these columns and split that into further 12 pieces.
