1

00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:01,380
Welcome back.

2

00:00:01,380  -->  00:00:04,380
So in this video we're going to focus on the front end.

3

00:00:04,620  -->  00:00:08,790
We're going to learn about each TMLC assessed in javascript on a high level we're not going to actually

4

00:00:08,790  -->  00:00:12,530
write any code yet but we will be seeing code for the first time.

5

00:00:13,140  -->  00:00:17,900
So there's two big things you want to know which is what's different between front and back end.

6

00:00:18,040  -->  00:00:23,970
And then also what's the difference between H.M.S. SS and Javascript and what are their respective roles

7

00:00:23,980  -->  00:00:24,500
.

8

00:00:25,080  -->  00:00:28,740
So let's start by discussing Front-End versus bacot.

9

00:00:28,860  -->  00:00:35,610
So when I go to a you know let's say Go to Facebook I hit Facebook dot com I hit enter.

10

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:43,050
And if you'll remember back to the video on how the web works I create a HTP request asking for Facebook

11

00:00:43,050  -->  00:00:50,850
dot com and that goes to Facebook server or eventually Facebook then decides what page to send me back

12

00:00:50,870  -->  00:00:51,050
.

13

00:00:51,210  -->  00:00:56,760
So in the case of Facebook it needs to figure out what images what stories how many likes they have

14

00:00:56,760  -->  00:01:02,400
what friends I have what posts are at the top of all my settings high profile pictures all the stuff

15

00:01:02,400  -->  00:01:03,790
that pertains to me.

16

00:01:04,110  -->  00:01:10,200
And then it sends it back to me sends me h tim elsea says in javascript my browser displays that for

17

00:01:10,200  -->  00:01:10,870
me.

18

00:01:11,370  -->  00:01:16,980
So this diagram here kind of just explains the difference between front and the back end where everything

19

00:01:16,980  -->  00:01:21,650
that I get back in that I see in the browser is just H.M.S. Yes.

20

00:01:21,720  -->  00:01:24,190
And javascript just the tip of the iceberg.

21

00:01:24,270  -->  00:01:28,910
But it is what my browser sees it is the front end or the client side.

22

00:01:29,250  -->  00:01:31,960
It is constructed by the backend.

23

00:01:32,370  -->  00:01:34,360
Everything else that happens all the logic.

24

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:40,680
Figuring out if I'm logged in figuring out who my friends are what photos I have what posts I've posted

25

00:01:40,680  -->  00:01:42,000
how many likes they have.

26

00:01:42,000  -->  00:01:45,970
All of that comes from the backend or the server side logic.

27

00:01:46,200  -->  00:01:48,000
So you can see there's a lot more here.

28

00:01:48,030  -->  00:01:50,820
The technology is there's so many choices on the front end there's not.

29

00:01:50,850  -->  00:01:58,010
It's always HTML CSS and javascript on the back end you've got different languages like Python ph P

30

00:01:58,020  -->  00:02:01,180
Ruby javascript actually which is what we're going to use.

31

00:02:01,350  -->  00:02:06,570
There's different databases you've got postgrads and Mongo and couch D.B and Mya's.

32

00:02:06,570  -->  00:02:09,320
Q Well and sequel Lightener's there's so many choices.

33

00:02:09,390  -->  00:02:11,010
So it's a little intimidating.

34

00:02:11,040  -->  00:02:15,060
We're going to definitely talk a lot more about the back end when we get to that unit.

35

00:02:15,060  -->  00:02:20,940
But for now just remember that the back end is what constructs the H to melt and the C S that is sent

36

00:02:20,940  -->  00:02:21,770
back.

37

00:02:21,780  -->  00:02:27,200
So let's take an example here what my favorite restaurant in San Francisco is called lazy bear.

38

00:02:27,390  -->  00:02:28,890
Here's the restaurant page.

39

00:02:29,100  -->  00:02:31,580
This page is always the same.

40

00:02:31,620  -->  00:02:32,810
I mean it could be changed.

41

00:02:32,820  -->  00:02:34,790
But in order for it to be changed.

42

00:02:34,920  -->  00:02:38,600
The developer has to go into the H.T. amount and manually change it.

43

00:02:38,610  -->  00:02:44,490
So basically I refresh the page every time I get the same homepage I get the same frequently asked questions

44

00:02:44,730  -->  00:02:46,540
the same contact us page.

45

00:02:46,580  -->  00:02:48,650
That's not a bad thing but it doesn't need to change.

46

00:02:48,660  -->  00:02:50,580
It's just a restaurant a page.

47

00:02:50,610  -->  00:02:55,520
However the Yelp page for lazy bear is dynamic.

48

00:02:55,530  -->  00:03:01,110
It does change so any time a new review is written it's going to show up here every time and let's say

49

00:03:01,170  -->  00:03:05,070
in this case let's rate it 5 stars.

50

00:03:05,070  -->  00:03:06,590
I read a review.

51

00:03:07,170  -->  00:03:11,840
Well you probably reject my review but if I wrote a review it would show up here.

52

00:03:11,880  -->  00:03:17,000
Things are dynamic they're happening at all times so I could say oh that was a useful review.

53

00:03:17,190  -->  00:03:18,700
That was a funny review.

54

00:03:19,140  -->  00:03:23,510
And those votes that I've added are stored in a database.

55

00:03:23,520  -->  00:03:27,060
Something is happening I'm interacting with this and it is persisting.

56

00:03:27,060  -->  00:03:32,010
So if I refresh the page now it's different not very different.

57

00:03:32,100  -->  00:03:36,350
But whereas before I didn't think this was funny now it remembers.

58

00:03:36,350  -->  00:03:37,740
I thought it was funny.

59

00:03:37,740  -->  00:03:44,250
So basically the point is when I go to this page I ask for this you Arel Yelp doesn't just always send

60

00:03:44,250  -->  00:03:45,650
the exact same thing back.

61

00:03:45,840  -->  00:03:49,060
It's going to figure out OK is the user logged in.

62

00:03:49,290  -->  00:03:52,600
If so we want to put his profile picture up here.

63

00:03:52,710  -->  00:03:53,980
Has he voted on anything.

64

00:03:54,000  -->  00:03:54,470
Yes.

65

00:03:54,510  -->  00:03:57,990
OK let's make sure that you know we highlight it correctly.

66

00:03:58,000  -->  00:03:59,260
Change the color.

67

00:03:59,310  -->  00:04:01,530
Don't let him vote again and so on.

68

00:04:01,530  -->  00:04:05,420
And then that constructs to him elsea says and Javascript and it sends it back.

69

00:04:05,430  -->  00:04:10,150
So another example of a page that is definitely dynamic is Google News.

70

00:04:10,620  -->  00:04:15,330
Every time I refresh I mean almost every five minutes something changes on here whether it's the weather

71

00:04:15,330  -->  00:04:17,780
over here NFL scores.

72

00:04:17,820  -->  00:04:19,260
I mean these are live updating.

73

00:04:19,290  -->  00:04:23,190
Maybe it's the new story there's breaking news something changes.

74

00:04:23,190  -->  00:04:25,590
This is very very different every time.

75

00:04:25,620  -->  00:04:28,840
However this is always the same.

76

00:04:29,130  -->  00:04:31,020
So again the difference is two things.

77

00:04:31,020  -->  00:04:34,530
One is static page versus a dynamic page.

78

00:04:34,530  -->  00:04:36,650
Both of them are web pages.

79

00:04:36,660  -->  00:04:39,920
Both of them are TMLC s s and Javascript coming back.

80

00:04:40,110  -->  00:04:46,770
One is going to change based off of some sort of server side code something on the back end.

81

00:04:47,340  -->  00:04:49,600
So I also like this analogy of a restaurant.

82

00:04:49,740  -->  00:04:52,350
So if you magically go to a restaurant you sit down.

83

00:04:52,380  -->  00:04:58,230
Let's say you order a steak when you order that steak you're making a request that goes back to the

84

00:04:58,230  -->  00:05:01,060
kitchen the kitchen prepares everything for you.

85

00:05:01,080  -->  00:05:02,350
That's sort of the back end.

86

00:05:02,460  -->  00:05:05,710
It decides what ingredients to get how long to cook them.

87

00:05:05,970  -->  00:05:11,430
Everything on a plate and then a waiter or waitress comes and brings that to your table.

88

00:05:11,430  -->  00:05:12,480
So it's very similar.

89

00:05:12,480  -->  00:05:16,880
You make a request the chef or the kitchen is the server.

90

00:05:17,070  -->  00:05:22,530
This part of the iceberg that is concocting everything cooking it putting it together and then finally

91

00:05:22,530  -->  00:05:26,040
it is sent back to your table which is you on the client side.

92

00:05:27,290  -->  00:05:29,840
So now let's break down those three pieces aged him.

93

00:05:29,940  -->  00:05:31,610
Says in Javascript.

94

00:05:32,390  -->  00:05:35,310
So we're going to go into a lot of detail on each of those components.

95

00:05:35,330  -->  00:05:39,420
There are separate sections and units but HDMI will start there.

96

00:05:39,530  -->  00:05:43,760
Stands for hypertext markup language basically.

97

00:05:43,760  -->  00:05:44,870
Imagine that.

98

00:05:44,880  -->  00:05:47,900
And this is what actually happened in the early days of the Internet.

99

00:05:47,960  -->  00:05:53,610
There was no standardized way to send information and to send documents.

100

00:05:53,720  -->  00:05:59,810
So initially you know the Internet was used to send to communicate between universities and colleges

101

00:05:59,820  -->  00:06:01,510
and also as a military tool.

102

00:06:01,520  -->  00:06:06,040
So let's just say I wanted to send a I wanted to send this to a friend.

103

00:06:06,560  -->  00:06:10,160
I need to say OK this is bolded.

104

00:06:10,250  -->  00:06:12,170
These are little bullet points.

105

00:06:12,260  -->  00:06:14,770
I've got some text and quotes around this.

106

00:06:14,770  -->  00:06:19,240
I need a way to break that down and describe it to send to somebody else.

107

00:06:19,580  -->  00:06:28,230
And the solution was HMO so HMO is it's actually the easiest thing that we're going to learn not to

108

00:06:28,220  -->  00:06:35,390
say that it's insane easy but it is very simple in that we just describe what we want and what you write

109

00:06:35,390  -->  00:06:36,450
is what you get.

110

00:06:36,440  -->  00:06:39,800
So HMO is often referred to as the noun's of a web page.

111

00:06:39,810  -->  00:06:40,830
It's the structure.

112

00:06:40,820  -->  00:06:48,360
Some people say the skeleton basically say put an image here put a bullet point here put a heading here

113

00:06:48,360  -->  00:06:50,570
put a slightly smaller heading just below that.

114

00:06:50,570  -->  00:06:58,350
It allows you to describe the structure of a page CSSA on the other hand it's how we describe the style

115

00:06:58,340  -->  00:07:04,720
of a page I need HVM how to use the assess CSSA on its own doesn't really do anything at all.

116

00:07:04,740  -->  00:07:10,540
Every single web page has HMO some web pages don't have C S S Some don't have javascript.

117

00:07:10,540  -->  00:07:11,620
It's not mandatory.

118

00:07:11,700  -->  00:07:18,350
H Tim L is so c s s cascading style sheets will learn exactly where that name comes from and a little

119

00:07:18,360  -->  00:07:18,990
bit.

120

00:07:19,010  -->  00:07:26,030
Basically it's styles existing HMO so you can say things like make all those bullet points green.

121

00:07:26,150  -->  00:07:32,980
Give the first image a yellow border give the last image a big pink border with dashes through it.

122

00:07:33,000  -->  00:07:39,110
It's often considered the adjectives of a web page or some people would say the skin to the H.T. a male

123

00:07:39,360  -->  00:07:44,000
skeleton and the last piece here is javascript.

124

00:07:44,000  -->  00:07:49,170
Javascript is probably its definitely the most complex thing out of these three.

125

00:07:49,380  -->  00:07:52,940
It's how we add Bahjat and interactivity to a page.

126

00:07:53,210  -->  00:07:58,940
So with us and Javascript we can make a beautiful looking site but it's not going to do anything really

127

00:07:58,940  -->  00:08:02,830
we can do simple animations but we can load data from somewhere else.

128

00:08:02,830  -->  00:08:08,150
You can't make things interactive we can't add logic or have a game with javascript we can use some

129

00:08:08,150  -->  00:08:13,650
of the example I have here or do some math change color when the user clicks load.

130

00:08:13,640  -->  00:08:15,900
New data from Twitter get the current weather.

131

00:08:15,890  -->  00:08:17,640
The current NFL scores.

132

00:08:17,730  -->  00:08:25,730
If h tim L is the nouns C Ss is the adjectives then javascript is the verbs are the actions on a page

133

00:08:25,740  -->  00:08:26,230
.

134

00:08:26,330  -->  00:08:33,400
So I have this all wrapped up nicely in a code and so code pen is a wonderful sight.

135

00:08:33,410  -->  00:08:39,160
We're not going to use a whole lot but because we haven't really started writing H-2 him LCS and Javascript

136

00:08:39,160  -->  00:08:39,460
.

137

00:08:39,620  -->  00:08:45,090
I'm going to use this as an example and what this does it lets you just write simple pages in the browser

138

00:08:45,290  -->  00:08:50,330
so we don't have to use of line text we just write it in the browser and I can share it with you very

139

00:08:50,340  -->  00:08:51,260
easily.

140

00:08:51,260  -->  00:08:54,900
I have three sections h TMLC SS and Javascript.

141

00:08:54,980  -->  00:08:58,100
Again the code itself is not what's important here.

142

00:08:58,130  -->  00:08:59,650
It is the concepts.

143

00:09:00,050  -->  00:09:06,710
So let's take a look and I'm going to actually get rid of my C-s us.

144

00:09:06,870  -->  00:09:11,280
I'm going to get rid of my jobs and you'll see what we're left with.

145

00:09:11,270  -->  00:09:14,490
Plain black and white structural material.

146

00:09:14,510  -->  00:09:21,890
I'm specifying my content so these are my words and I'm wrapping that content in specific structural

147

00:09:21,890  -->  00:09:24,270
elements so in H1.

148

00:09:24,530  -->  00:09:26,530
And again this is one of those times.

149

00:09:26,580  -->  00:09:28,730
Don't worry about the specific syntax.

150

00:09:28,910  -->  00:09:32,920
We have so many videos ahead that are going to go into detail and each one of these.

151

00:09:33,050  -->  00:09:36,910
But basically this is saying make big text right here.

152

00:09:36,980  -->  00:09:43,010
This is saying make a list and make it individual list item that says Make me a bullet point and another

153

00:09:43,010  -->  00:09:47,510
one that says make me another bullet point and then make a button that says Make me a button here.

154

00:09:47,540  -->  00:09:50,950
As you can see so on it's own that is just the structure.

155

00:09:50,960  -->  00:09:54,110
So now let's go at or see us back in.

156

00:09:54,120  -->  00:09:55,970
You can see what I'm doing here I'm saying.

157

00:09:56,120  -->  00:10:03,750
Make the H-1 which is here make it purple so we can change that to be green and it changes to green

158

00:10:04,490  -->  00:10:12,830
and I'm also saying make the button have a border have a background color and a text color of white

159

00:10:13,700  -->  00:10:17,730
so we can change that to be green text color.

160

00:10:17,780  -->  00:10:20,020
It's hard to see what that changes the green.

161

00:10:20,120  -->  00:10:26,970
I can give it a much bigger border 20 pixels she could see there so that there are adjectives and the

162

00:10:26,960  -->  00:10:31,610
last piece is our Javascript.

163

00:10:31,970  -->  00:10:35,420
So without javascript that button does nothing.

164

00:10:35,450  -->  00:10:41,180
Now what we've done is written javascript that says when the user clicks the button.

165

00:10:41,340  -->  00:10:50,030
Pick a random color and change the background color here to that random color so that I can click and

166

00:10:50,030  -->  00:10:51,640
I get a random color.

167

00:10:52,460  -->  00:10:57,800
So if I got rid of this javascript and I tried to do that again nothing happens because I don't have

168

00:10:57,810  -->  00:10:58,440
any verbs.

169

00:10:58,430  -->  00:11:00,410
It's just nouns and additives.

170

00:11:00,450  -->  00:11:05,840
Just the structural skeleton and a little bit of skin on top as I add my javascript in I can add the

171

00:11:05,850  -->  00:11:06,520
logic.

172

00:11:06,840  -->  00:11:08,300
So javascript really important.

173

00:11:08,370  -->  00:11:14,100
This isn't exactly what you would do most likely on a real production site but you would have maybe

174

00:11:14,100  -->  00:11:16,110
a game you might make mine sweeper.

175

00:11:16,130  -->  00:11:19,800
This might be Facebook chat it might be a form to sign up for a page.

176

00:11:19,860  -->  00:11:22,080
You use javascript to make it interactive.

177

00:11:22,280  -->  00:11:25,510
So again I encourage you to play around on code pen.

178

00:11:25,640  -->  00:11:28,340
You have to link to this and explore a little bit.

179

00:11:28,350  -->  00:11:30,280
There's no rush to move edge the next video.

180

00:11:30,290  -->  00:11:32,960
Try changing some of these colors if you want.

181

00:11:32,960  -->  00:11:34,590
Try changing some of this.

182

00:11:34,640  -->  00:11:36,190
Don't focus on the code.

183

00:11:36,290  -->  00:11:40,020
It's just fun to play around with but there's no pressure to understand any of this.

184

00:11:40,040  -->  00:11:46,060
Aside from a very high level overview of what HDMI does what C S does and what javascript does.

185

00:11:46,340  -->  00:11:46,630
Right
