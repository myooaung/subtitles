1

00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:00,660
All right.

2

00:00:00,650  -->  00:00:01,490
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,680  -->  00:00:06,210
And this video we're going to start by tackling some of the basic functionality of our list.

4

00:00:06,210  -->  00:00:11,400
We're going to start nice and easy by adding the quick listeners to the allies so that when we click

5

00:00:11,730  -->  00:00:16,380
we get a little strikethrough effect that you can see here and they grea out.

6

00:00:16,890  -->  00:00:20,750
And before we do that I'm actually going to change our background a little bit here.

7

00:00:21,000  -->  00:00:22,910
I'm going to get rid of that background.

8

00:00:23,190  -->  00:00:25,020
And then I'm going to add a border instead.

9

00:00:25,200  -->  00:00:33,630
So our border will be two pixel solid gray just a small change but it will make it so that it's easier

10

00:00:33,630  -->  00:00:35,800
to see when we turn these gray.

11

00:00:35,880  -->  00:00:39,170
If we had a great background then it would just totally blend in.

12

00:00:39,490  -->  00:00:40,180
OK.

13

00:00:40,200  -->  00:00:47,370
So what we want to happen is when we click on an ally the text inside the eye is gray and we add a strikethrough

14

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:48,190
effect.

15

00:00:48,570  -->  00:00:50,930
So let's go to our javascript file.

16

00:00:51,210  -->  00:01:00,780
Let's start by adding a simple comment where we can check off specific to Dewes by clicking and then

17

00:01:00,780  -->  00:01:01,820
let's make that work.

18

00:01:02,010  -->  00:01:04,540
So we need to select all the allies.

19

00:01:04,830  -->  00:01:11,020
So all we need to do is ally instead of the dollar sign and then we'll do a click.

20

00:01:12,150  -->  00:01:18,360
And when we click here is the function that we want to run the callback function and we'll start with

21

00:01:18,360  -->  00:01:28,050
just a nice alert clicked ally and go back and make sure that when we refresh and click on an ally it

22

00:01:28,050  -->  00:01:32,520
tells us that we clicked an ally but nowhere else does that happen.

23

00:01:32,550  -->  00:01:34,260
Great.

24

00:01:34,260  -->  00:01:39,930
Next up let's work on changing the individual ally that we clicked on and changing its color color and

25

00:01:39,930  -->  00:01:47,050
the strikethrough or the text decoration effect rather than alerting what we want to do is use the dot

26

00:01:47,150  -->  00:01:54,270
CSSA method and with that see SS We're going to want to work with the color property and turn the color

27

00:01:54,290  -->  00:01:59,210
gray and the text decoration property and make that line through.

28

00:01:59,690  -->  00:02:01,210
Let's start with the color.

29

00:02:01,380  -->  00:02:05,090
So it would look like color gray just like that.

30

00:02:05,370  -->  00:02:09,610
And then we have to decide what are we applying that to what are we selecting.

31

00:02:09,990  -->  00:02:15,180
And this is not what we want to do if we just select a lie and do gutsiest us.

32

00:02:15,210  -->  00:02:20,670
Now when I click they all turn gray and I know it's a little bit difficult to see if I make that something

33

00:02:20,670  -->  00:02:24,000
more obvious like red when I click.

34

00:02:24,060  -->  00:02:29,880
They all turn red which is not what we want what we want instead is only the one that was clicked.

35

00:02:30,150  -->  00:02:34,410
And that's where the key word this comes in with the J Querrey wrapper.

36

00:02:34,410  -->  00:02:40,260
This refers to the specific lie that was clicked and we want to change only that one SEUS us so that

37

00:02:40,260  -->  00:02:41,460
its color is gray.

38

00:02:41,760  -->  00:02:43,510
And we'll test that out.

39

00:02:43,560  -->  00:02:47,740
Now I click on the individual ally and it turns gray.

40

00:02:47,910  -->  00:02:51,000
Of course it doesn't turn back to black when I click again.

41

00:02:51,030  -->  00:02:53,790
We don't have that functionality.

42

00:02:53,790  -->  00:02:59,370
Now let's get the strikethrough with a line through effect so we can do another line like this.

43

00:02:59,370  -->  00:03:15,300
This does SEUS us and then text decoration colon or comma line dash through and save and go back missing

44

00:03:15,330  -->  00:03:18,200
a Prentis see here.

45

00:03:20,070  -->  00:03:27,940
Now when we click we get a strikethrough effect there and the color changes to be gray.

46

00:03:29,610  -->  00:03:32,200
But of course there's always an easier way of doing that.

47

00:03:32,220  -->  00:03:38,280
So rather than doing it on two separate lines you might have remembered how we could define object with

48

00:03:38,280  -->  00:03:43,100
key value pairs and just do one single this CSSA call.

49

00:03:43,290  -->  00:03:52,880
So we had add an object in here just like that and we need to add in color gray comma.

50

00:03:53,280  -->  00:03:59,110
And this is a little tricky if we do text Dasch decoration in the object and set that to be line through

51

00:03:59,120  -->  00:03:59,300
.

52

00:03:59,580  -->  00:04:05,520
And I save and refresh you see nothing happens.

53

00:04:05,530  -->  00:04:10,530
They actually get an error because in javascript You can't have property names that have hyphens in

54

00:04:10,530  -->  00:04:11,240
them.

55

00:04:11,760  -->  00:04:19,410
So if we are using the syntax where we define an object we need to use text declaration camel case which

56

00:04:19,410  -->  00:04:20,890
is always a little bit tricky.

57

00:04:20,940  -->  00:04:27,360
And if we are fresh Now you can see that it finds that text decoration so CSSA property and it applies

58

00:04:27,360  -->  00:04:30,290
the line through and the gray color.

59

00:04:30,510  -->  00:04:35,510
The next thing you might want to do is turn it back to black and get rid of the line through one click

60

00:04:35,520  -->  00:04:36,540
again.

61

00:04:37,460  -->  00:04:39,800
To do that we'll use a simple IF statement.

62

00:04:39,900  -->  00:04:45,600
So we'll check if Ally is gray then we will turn it black

63

00:04:48,510  -->  00:04:49,020
else

64

00:04:51,670  -->  00:04:53,780
turn it gray.

65

00:04:53,920  -->  00:05:00,820
So to check if the lie is gray we can do if and we can use this stuff.

66

00:05:00,890  -->  00:05:13,150
SS And if we just do it like this so if to check if an ally is gray we can actually use this dot C Ss

67

00:05:13,870  -->  00:05:19,230
and ask it for color without providing another value and that will retrieve the current color.

68

00:05:19,620  -->  00:05:28,370
So we'll have an if statement if this does see a sense of color is equal to gray.

69

00:05:29,410  -->  00:05:39,120
Let's just do a concert log is currently gray and that's all due to start.

70

00:05:39,490  -->  00:05:41,790
So let's clean this up a little bit

71

00:05:47,310  -->  00:05:51,150
and we don't have or else yet so we'll just leave it how it is and go back.

72

00:05:51,310  -->  00:05:58,170
So if we refresh and we open up the console and I click on one of these it doesn't tell us anything

73

00:05:58,180  -->  00:06:00,030
yet because it's not gray.

74

00:06:00,190  -->  00:06:03,230
But now if I click again it still doesn't work.

75

00:06:03,270  -->  00:06:05,420
And the reason for that is a little bit tricky.

76

00:06:05,470  -->  00:06:06,930
If we go back here.

77

00:06:07,180  -->  00:06:12,820
Let's take a look at what this does CSSA color is outside of the if statement.

78

00:06:12,910  -->  00:06:15,400
So we'll do a console that log.

79

00:06:15,690  -->  00:06:19,760
This starts the SS color and refresh the page.

80

00:06:20,250  -->  00:06:25,230
And when I click you'll see that it starts out as R.G. 000.

81

00:06:25,440  -->  00:06:31,750
And if I click again we're setting the color to be gray and we think that it's gray right now if we

82

00:06:31,750  -->  00:06:33,270
inspected.

83

00:06:33,750  -->  00:06:40,100
It says that color is gray but when I click again it's actually the R.G. version.

84

00:06:40,320  -->  00:06:45,550
So when we're comparing to check if the color is equal to Gray that's not going to work.

85

00:06:45,670  -->  00:06:49,820
We need to compare it to R.G. be 1 2 8 1 2 8 1 2 8.

86

00:06:50,310  -->  00:06:57,840
And now if we try this and refresh we should see when I click the first time nothing I click again.

87

00:06:58,090  -->  00:07:00,730
It now says it is currently gray.

88

00:07:01,150  -->  00:07:01,460
OK.

89

00:07:01,480  -->  00:07:02,710
So we can use that.

90

00:07:03,030  -->  00:07:05,710
So instead of just printing it is currently Gray.

91

00:07:05,920  -->  00:07:08,070
What we want to do is turn it black.

92

00:07:08,130  -->  00:07:15,950
So we'll do a this that see us color and we'll just go back to black.

93

00:07:16,120  -->  00:07:16,930
Just like that.

94

00:07:17,110  -->  00:07:20,670
And then we can handle the text decoration in just a second.

95

00:07:20,980  -->  00:07:24,240
So we refresh and we click and we get gray.

96

00:07:24,420  -->  00:07:26,660
And if I click again it still won't work.

97

00:07:26,840  -->  00:07:29,650
And that's because we're just overwriting it at the end here.

98

00:07:29,710  -->  00:07:31,870
We're turning it gray every time.

99

00:07:31,960  -->  00:07:39,210
So we want to move that into our else so we'll add an else statement here and we'll do this only if

100

00:07:39,270  -->  00:07:41,060
it's not currently Gray.

101

00:07:41,740  -->  00:07:42,220
All right.

102

00:07:42,390  -->  00:07:43,260
So we should be good.

103

00:07:43,260  -->  00:07:50,400
Now we just move this comment here clean things up a little bit and refresh.

104

00:07:50,640  -->  00:07:54,490
We click it turns gray cook again it goes back to black.

105

00:07:54,550  -->  00:07:58,110
We still have the line through but at least the color is changing.

106

00:07:58,420  -->  00:08:05,870
So to get rid of the line through all we need to do is basically copy this or redo an object.

107

00:08:06,780  -->  00:08:10,460
And rather than setting color to be gray we'll make it black.

108

00:08:10,840  -->  00:08:15,560
And rather than text decoration to line through we'll set it to be none.

109

00:08:15,900  -->  00:08:23,950
And now if we were fresh and real quick we're toggling that done on and off where we have the gray and

110

00:08:23,950  -->  00:08:25,390
the line through.

111

00:08:26,010  -->  00:08:31,260
Hopefully as we're going through this you're seeing that it's sort of a lot of work to do this checking

112

00:08:31,260  -->  00:08:31,560
.

113

00:08:31,650  -->  00:08:33,230
Is it currently Gray.

114

00:08:33,250  -->  00:08:39,580
RGV 128 128 128 if it is then we'll make it black and remove the text decoration.

115

00:08:39,700  -->  00:08:41,310
Otherwise do this.

116

00:08:41,490  -->  00:08:46,020
There's a much easier way that we don't have to actually do any of this logic.

117

00:08:46,450  -->  00:08:54,460
What we can do is create a class so we'll create a class in our C Ss and we'll call it completed or

118

00:08:54,460  -->  00:08:59,630
just completed and it will have color is gray.

119

00:08:59,800  -->  00:09:00,890
We don't need those quotes.

120

00:09:01,000  -->  00:09:08,980
We're not in javascript and text decoration will be a line through and save and then are to do that

121

00:09:09,000  -->  00:09:09,070
.

122

00:09:09,140  -->  00:09:20,310
Yes we can actually replace all of this code and it deleted all and all we want to do is this dot toggle

123

00:09:20,320  -->  00:09:20,890
class

124

00:09:23,700  -->  00:09:27,240
completed single line.

125

00:09:27,490  -->  00:09:33,960
So when we click on an ally we're going to toggled the class on the slide that we clicked on the class

126

00:09:33,970  -->  00:09:40,510
completed and that will make it gray and give it a line through effect and it will keep track of if

127

00:09:40,500  -->  00:09:43,980
it needs to remove it or added automatically.

128

00:09:44,380  -->  00:09:48,240
So you can see here it looks exactly the same as it did before.

129

00:09:48,370  -->  00:09:54,700
But we only had to write one line of code rather than 10 or so lines and the next video will talk about

130

00:09:54,690  -->  00:09:57,490
how we can get the X to actually to lead it to do
