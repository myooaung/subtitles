00:00:01.650  -->  00:00:04.440
So this video is going to be extremely short.

2

00:00:04.440  -->  00:00:07.450
It's just an introduction to your first real exercise.

3

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:12.770
I have created here in the browser a nice simple web page.

4

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:18.360
So it just contains some of the notes that I might have taken on the last few lessons about Internet

5

00:00:18.360  -->  00:00:19.210
basics.

6

00:00:19.240  -->  00:00:22.540
On each team how the different tags the boiler plate.

7

00:00:22.860  -->  00:00:28.630
So what I'd like you to do is recreate this yourself so from scratch make a new file save it make sure

8

00:00:28.630  -->  00:00:34.290
it ends NHT M-L and add the correct markup along with the correct boilerplate that we don't actually

9

00:00:34.290  -->  00:00:34.980
see here.

10

00:00:35.100  -->  00:00:38.880
So all the stuff behind the scenes the dark type the head the body so on.

11

00:00:39.120  -->  00:00:43.310
Also make sure this matches appear everything should match.

12

00:00:43.320  -->  00:00:48.900
I'll give you a short hint because you may not be sure exactly what size heading these are.

13

00:00:48.900  -->  00:00:50.250
This is an age too.

14

00:00:50.270  -->  00:00:55.530
That's not you know hugely important but that's needed to also go over some of these things here so

15

00:00:55.530  -->  00:00:57.800
we've got you know bullet points.

16

00:00:57.960  -->  00:00:59.690
We've got Bouldon here.

17

00:00:59.760  -->  00:01:04.140
We've got bullet point placed inside of a bullet point at worst.

18

00:01:04.230  -->  00:01:08.290
We've got a numeric list ordered list inside of a bullet point.

19

00:01:08.490  -->  00:01:11.650
Another numeric list inside of one.

20

00:01:12.180  -->  00:01:16.460
And we've got some italicised text and some bolded text here as well.

21

00:01:16.530  -->  00:01:21.210
So go ahead take your time make new file start from scratch watch some of the previous videos if you

22

00:01:21.210  -->  00:01:22.740
need to recreate this
