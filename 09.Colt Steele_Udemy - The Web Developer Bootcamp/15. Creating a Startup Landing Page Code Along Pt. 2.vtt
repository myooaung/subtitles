00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:07.080
Now let's change the text color of the H-1 and the age 3 right now is that dark default bootstrap color

2

00:00:08.000  -->  00:00:20.160
will go in here and we could do H-1 color white and H-3 color white and refresh.

3

00:00:20.550  -->  00:00:22.790
And we get white text just like that.

4

00:00:22.950  -->  00:00:29.820
But we can also do though is combine these two because they're identical and do H-1 comma H-3 and that

5

00:00:29.820  -->  00:00:31.660
will make both of those white.

6

00:00:32.010  -->  00:00:34.750
Whenever we have a comma it just selects different groups.

7

00:00:34.770  -->  00:00:40.820
So all the twins all age threes and it looks exactly the same.

8

00:00:41.400  -->  00:00:50.340
But we can even simplify this more and just assign everything in the body to be color white.

9

00:00:50.340  -->  00:00:55.350
And you might think there would be a problem might change or button might change or nav bar but remember

10

00:00:55.350  -->  00:00:56.790
that those are more specific.

11

00:00:56.790  -->  00:01:02.760
We have classes from Bootstrap that are doing that versus these are just plain H-1 and H-3 they don't

12

00:01:02.760  -->  00:01:08.130
have any classes or IDs and they're easier to override with their own styles by setting the body color

13

00:01:08.190  -->  00:01:14.780
to white the H1 and the age three inherited that color and everything else did as well.

14

00:01:14.850  -->  00:01:16.030
It was just overridden.

15

00:01:16.050  -->  00:01:21.730
So if we inspected let's say this button and we take a look.

16

00:01:22.650  -->  00:01:30.860
When we select it and you see that color is set to this color is 3 3 3 by the class Button default.

17

00:01:30.990  -->  00:01:38.460
But if we keep scrolling down you'll see that the body right here set color to white and it just happens

18

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:40.520
to be crossed off.

19

00:01:40.650  -->  00:01:41.390
All right.

20

00:01:41.970  -->  00:01:44.900
So again that said both of them to be white.

21

00:01:44.910  -->  00:01:46.980
Now let's work on the font size.

22

00:01:47.160  -->  00:01:48.870
So are H-1.

23

00:01:48.930  -->  00:01:51.490
We want it to be folded which it's currently not.

24

00:01:51.690  -->  00:01:58.260
So that needs to be bold and I want it to be 5 cms which is five times bigger remember than the parent

25

00:01:58.290  -->  00:02:03.600
element so we'll select each one and we'll give it a font weight

26

00:02:06.540  -->  00:02:11.570
of 700 which is how we use the bold refresh.

27

00:02:11.970  -->  00:02:12.860
You can see it bold.

28

00:02:12.890  -->  00:02:21.100
Now let's also make it much larger so font size 5 E-M.

29

00:02:21.270  -->  00:02:24.480
Now go back and there we go.

30

00:02:24.680  -->  00:02:25.880
So that's looking closer.

31

00:02:25.880  -->  00:02:32.230
Now this ratio between the H1 and the H-3 looks exactly the same.

32

00:02:32.250  -->  00:02:37.200
We don't need to do anything to the H-3 must now get the image to behave the way that we want it to

33

00:02:37.220  -->  00:02:37.590
.

34

00:02:37.980  -->  00:02:41.460
And to do that I'm going to show you something that we haven't seen before.

35

00:02:41.730  -->  00:02:48.470
I'm going to move the dark to the right side and if I inspect the aged him out element or the body they'll

36

00:02:48.480  -->  00:02:52.190
see that both of them stop before the end of the page.

37

00:02:52.200  -->  00:02:53.280
So about right here.

38

00:02:53.430  -->  00:02:55.500
That's the end of the age to my document.

39

00:02:55.500  -->  00:03:02.520
So when I tell my image to cover the body and I said it's background size to cover and background position

40

00:03:02.520  -->  00:03:09.180
to be center it takes into account the size of the body and when the body ends right here it behaves

41

00:03:09.180  -->  00:03:09.860
differently.

42

00:03:10.080  -->  00:03:16.920
What we'll do to fix this is give the HTL element a height of 100 percent which means take up 100 percent

43

00:03:17.280  -->  00:03:22.420
of the container which is just the entire document window.

44

00:03:23.150  -->  00:03:30.450
Male height 100 percent and we'll go back.

45

00:03:30.840  -->  00:03:33.580
Let's make it full screen now and refresh.

46

00:03:33.950  -->  00:03:37.630
And our image works the way that we expect it to and I shrink down.

47

00:03:37.860  -->  00:03:40.260
And that looks good to me too.

48

00:03:40.260  -->  00:03:43.300
Now we have two main things left to focus on.

49

00:03:43.430  -->  00:03:45.470
The first one is the H.R..

50

00:03:45.540  -->  00:03:50.540
It's way too wide for us supposed to be a lot smaller.

51

00:03:51.180  -->  00:03:54.010
And then I also want to focus on the font here.

52

00:03:54.570  -->  00:04:01.170
Well start picking the artwork and all we want to do is give it a with of 400 pixels.

53

00:04:01.170  -->  00:04:12.410
So in our C Ss We'll select h do it at the bottom with is 400 pixels.

54

00:04:12.450  -->  00:04:13.550
There we go.

55

00:04:13.560  -->  00:04:18.330
Another thing that I'll do that's a little bit sneaky that you may not have noticed as I'm going to

56

00:04:18.330  -->  00:04:23.460
go in here and give it a Forder on top.

57

00:04:23.460  -->  00:04:26.150
One pixel solid.

58

00:04:26.250  -->  00:04:31.620
Then they have a color here which is f 8 8 8.

59

00:04:32.220  -->  00:04:41.920
And then a border bottom as well which is one pixel solid and this will be a transparent color.

60

00:04:41.960  -->  00:04:46.610
Zero zero zero zero point two.

61

00:04:46.830  -->  00:04:49.530
So this won't give it the effect of a shadow.

62

00:04:49.990  -->  00:04:50.800
So pay attention.

63

00:04:50.820  -->  00:04:52.720
It's really hard to see.

64

00:04:52.830  -->  00:04:58.560
I don't even know if I will pick up on the screen cast but what we have is a border and then right below

65

00:04:58.560  -->  00:05:05.970
the border a light gray line that makes it look like there's a slight shadow it shows up a little bit

66

00:05:05.970  -->  00:05:08.490
better over the lighter colors.

67

00:05:08.900  -->  00:05:09.140
OK.

68

00:05:09.150  -->  00:05:13.770
So you can't see that enough if trust me or you can get rid of the background image and it'll be easier

69

00:05:13.770  -->  00:05:15.050
to see there as well.

70

00:05:16.050  -->  00:05:20.690
Next let's focus on the icons which I used fun awesome for.

71

00:05:20.690  -->  00:05:21.510
So I have it open.

72

00:05:21.500  -->  00:05:21.780
Fun.

73

00:05:21.780  -->  00:05:22.320
Awesome.

74

00:05:22.350  -->  00:05:23.180
I know.

75

00:05:23.570  -->  00:05:25.980
And we'll just get the CD in here as well.

76

00:05:26.370  -->  00:05:30.970
If you click on get started there's a CDN that you could just copy there.

77

00:05:30.990  -->  00:05:39.390
Put that in our application and also just do that up top save and then we'll take a look at the actual

78

00:05:39.380  -->  00:05:40.370
icons.

79

00:05:40.980  -->  00:05:45.030
And the first one that we know that we used is a PA.

80

00:05:45.930  -->  00:05:51.310
And to do it all we need is high class ECOs F A F A dash PA.

81

00:05:51.660  -->  00:05:53.630
So I put that inside the button.

82

00:05:54.030  -->  00:05:59.350
So if we go to the button right before I get started I added that in.

83

00:05:59.430  -->  00:06:04.590
Now if we go back and refresh you can see if we have a little button there and we have a palm print

84

00:06:05.120  -->  00:06:08.820
next we have two icons here for sign up and log in.

85

00:06:09.500  -->  00:06:11.760
And those two I remember what they are.

86

00:06:11.790  -->  00:06:19.550
I'm just going to do that here next to sign up after we write up know you want to add in another icon

87

00:06:19.560  -->  00:06:19.750
.

88

00:06:19.860  -->  00:06:29.180
Except this time class is not F-8 PA but F.A. dash user dash Plus which gives us that icon with the

89

00:06:29.190  -->  00:06:34.880
plus sign and log in is the same thing without the plus.

90

00:06:34.920  -->  00:06:40.160
So a dash user and we have those two icons.

91

00:06:40.250  -->  00:06:44.840
There's one other thing that I did that you may not have noticed which is the text shadow.

92

00:06:45.030  -->  00:06:52.650
So there's a shadow around all the text here and see it there can see it over here.

93

00:06:52.640  -->  00:07:01.350
It's around the H-1 and the H-3 and tech shadow is something we can set with the SS text dash shadow

94

00:07:01.370  -->  00:07:01.630
.

95

00:07:02.060  -->  00:07:04.010
And there's kind of a lot of pieces to it.

96

00:07:04.130  -->  00:07:08.040
So you can see here we're sitting the offset X the offset y.

97

00:07:08.120  -->  00:07:11.680
So how far away from the words should the shadow go.

98

00:07:11.810  -->  00:07:16.240
Then we're also setting the radius of that blurs So basically how thick should it be.

99

00:07:16.500  -->  00:07:21.430
And then the color and the shadow that I'm using is a little bit complicated.

100

00:07:21.480  -->  00:07:26.930
There's a lot of pieces so I'm going to go and type it one piece at a time in the CSSA file.

101

00:07:26.970  -->  00:07:34.620
So inside of the content div will add text dash shadow and then the first one will do.

102

00:07:34.620  -->  00:07:44.250
Zero pixels 4 pixels 3 pixels and I'll make it really obvious to start by making it red and if I refresh

103

00:07:45.500  -->  00:07:48.210
there's the shadow that we're adding first.

104

00:07:48.260  -->  00:07:57.860
Now go and add the second one with a comma and indent a little bit and then we want 0 pixels 8 pixels

105

00:07:59.910  -->  00:08:06.460
13 pixels and then onto orange here and take a look at that one.

106

00:08:07.350  -->  00:08:13.890
You can see we have this more blurred one underneath it's bright orange and then there's a third shadow

107

00:08:15.480  -->  00:08:23.810
which is 0 pixels which remember this first number is the X offset and then the y offset 18 pixels and

108

00:08:23.820  -->  00:08:27.540
then 23 pixels is the radius and we'll make this one yellow

109

00:08:32.120  -->  00:08:35.490
and we can see we have the bright red titre shadow.

110

00:08:35.490  -->  00:08:37.730
And then the orange one that's a little bit further away.

111

00:08:37.830  -->  00:08:41.670
And then the yellow one that is a lot more blurred and a lot wider.

112

00:08:41.700  -->  00:08:43.650
So we want to change those colors.

113

00:08:43.640  -->  00:08:45.370
We don't want to be working with that.

114

00:08:45.450  -->  00:08:48.160
So the colors are a little bit less exciting.

115

00:08:48.210  -->  00:08:49.900
The first one.

116

00:08:50.160  -->  00:08:54.740
Zero zero zero zero 0.4.

117

00:08:54.770  -->  00:09:01.550
Next one very similar instead of 0.4 0.1.

118

00:09:01.910  -->  00:09:06.210
And then one more that's also 0.1.

119

00:09:06.210  -->  00:09:10.870
So using R.G. B-A we're just setting different shades of gray.

120

00:09:11.970  -->  00:09:12.560
And there we go.

121

00:09:12.600  -->  00:09:16.510
So much less exciting but hopefully you can still see it here.

122

00:09:16.560  -->  00:09:21.010
It's a lot more subtle but it just adds a little bit of depth to the page.

123

00:09:21.060  -->  00:09:21.330
Great.

124

00:09:21.330  -->  00:09:22.830
So that's all we need to do.

125

00:09:23.250  -->  00:09:26.040
Let me go back and just wrap a few things up.

126

00:09:26.040  -->  00:09:31.200
The big point I want to make here is that we can use bootstrap and rely on it but we're not relying

127

00:09:31.200  -->  00:09:32.300
on all of its styles.

128

00:09:32.340  -->  00:09:36.540
So yes we kept the nav bar the same although in the last video I showed you how you could change the

129

00:09:36.540  -->  00:09:40.760
nav bar color but we changed the fonts we added background images.

130

00:09:40.770  -->  00:09:45.960
So we really just use bootstrap as the underlying foundation and then we add in all the styles on top

131

00:09:46.430  -->  00:09:47.730
and it didn't take much.

132

00:09:47.850  -->  00:09:52.540
But I think we made something that looks relatively respectable with just a few lines of code.

133

00:09:52.640  -->  00:09:56.580
And let's be honest half of all fat this one text Shadowline right there.

134

00:09:56.750  -->  00:09:57.310
Awesome.

135

00:09:57.440  -->  00:10:00.230
So we made the site looks relatively good.

136

00:10:00.270  -->  00:10:01.900
We're done with bootstrap for now.

137

00:10:01.980  -->  00:10:05.460
We're then moving on to Javascript in the next unit which is really exciting.

138

00:10:05.690  -->  00:10:10.680
We will be moving away from creating sites and things that look nice for a little bit just so that we

139

00:10:10.670  -->  00:10:12.670
can focus purely on Javascript.

140

00:10:12.810  -->  00:10:16.910
But then we'll bring everything back together and make some beautiful sites that actually do things

141

00:10:17.040  -->  00:10:18.560
that don't just look nice.

142

00:10:18.570  -->  00:10:22.160
So that's coming up soon hopefully enjoyed bootstrap enjoyed this unit.

143

00:10:22.350  -->  00:10:25.900
And as always I recommend that you download the code if you have any questions.

144

00:10:25.890  -->  00:10:27.950
It's in the description of this video.

145

00:10:27.960  -->  00:10:29.060
All right I'll see the next unit
