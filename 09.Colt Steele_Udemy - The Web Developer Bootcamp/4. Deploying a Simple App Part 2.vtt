WEBVTT
1

00:00:00.500  -->  00:00:06.860
OK so the very first thing we're going to do is go over to Heroku dot com.

2

00:00:07.440  -->  00:00:11.010
H e r o k you dot com.

3

00:00:11.010  -->  00:00:13.870
And we're going to sign up.

4

00:00:14.230  -->  00:00:21.880
So I'm going to sign up with my name e-mail.

5

00:00:21.930  -->  00:00:28.110
You do need to put a real e-mail here and you should anyways because for one thing they send that e-mail

6

00:00:28.110  -->  00:00:33.870
confirmation so you have to check that e-mail but more importantly you'll get updates about if there

7

00:00:33.870  -->  00:00:40.100
is for some reason some freak accident Heroku servers get hit by a lightning bolt or something.

8

00:00:40.110  -->  00:00:43.050
You'll get updates about what's happening.

9

00:00:43.560  -->  00:00:44.520
So our company name.

10

00:00:44.520  -->  00:00:48.420
I'll just say Web Dev Bootcamp.

11

00:00:48.420  -->  00:00:49.470
You don't have to put anything.

12

00:00:49.470  -->  00:00:57.210
It's not really going to make a difference but let's put no J.S. create free account then go check your

13

00:00:57.210  -->  00:00:59.780
email and confirm your account.

14

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:00.330
All right.

15

00:01:00.540  -->  00:01:05.970
So once you do that it will ask you so you click the link and you are asked to create a password confirm

16

00:01:05.970  -->  00:01:06.990
the password.

17

00:01:07.200  -->  00:01:12.610
And then once you finish creating your account it should take you to your Heroku dashboard.

18

00:01:13.140  -->  00:01:17.760
And this is going to be a place where you'll be able to see the apps that you have deployed.

19

00:01:18.150  -->  00:01:22.860
You'll be able to turn them on and off set you are else.

20

00:01:23.090  -->  00:01:28.050
And any sort of other things you need to configure and the permission in security issues.

21

00:01:28.050  -->  00:01:31.700
This is your home base for any apps you have to put on her.

22

00:01:31.710  -->  00:01:32.430
OK.

23

00:01:33.060  -->  00:01:35.750
So we're actually going to navigate away from this for now.

24

00:01:35.850  -->  00:01:38.290
But if you do want to poke around take a look.

25

00:01:38.370  -->  00:01:40.160
They have some good getting started guys.

26

00:01:40.230  -->  00:01:45.930
So if you click on the getting started with Noad guide it will show you the steps that were going to

27

00:01:45.930  -->  00:01:47.440
go through here.

28

00:01:47.490  -->  00:01:49.520
And so I will reference this.

29

00:01:49.530  -->  00:01:52.730
But you can also just watch this video to see what you need to do.

30

00:01:53.070  -->  00:01:58.530
So the very first thing that it talks about here is installing downloading and installing the Heroku

31

00:01:58.770  -->  00:02:02.390
toolbelt for Mac or whatever machine that you're using.

32

00:02:02.400  -->  00:02:06.230
We actually don't have to use this because we're using Cloud 9.

33

00:02:06.390  -->  00:02:08.260
So it comes preinstalled.

34

00:02:08.340  -->  00:02:08.680
Sorry.

35

00:02:08.700  -->  00:02:09.510
We do need to use it.

36

00:02:09.510  -->  00:02:10.550
We don't have to download it.

37

00:02:10.560  -->  00:02:11.830
Excuse me.

38

00:02:12.030  -->  00:02:13.670
It comes pre-installed for us.

39

00:02:13.890  -->  00:02:20.550
So if you go to cloud 9 what we can actually do is make sure we're in the right directory and we stop

40

00:02:20.550  -->  00:02:21.700
our server.

41

00:02:22.260  -->  00:02:23.440
Great.

42

00:02:23.670  -->  00:02:33.600
If you just type the word Heroku you'll see that we get some output anything other than commed not found

43

00:02:33.900  -->  00:02:38.520
means that we have Heroku installed and that just comes with Cloud 9 for free.

44

00:02:38.520  -->  00:02:45.360
If you're doing this on a machine or you're not using Cloud 9 you can of course download the correct

45

00:02:45.360  -->  00:02:47.790
version and follow the instructions.

46

00:02:47.820  -->  00:02:53.760
So the first thing we want to do is follow what it said which is Heroku log it and this will prompt

47

00:02:53.760  -->  00:02:55.320
you for your e-mail

48

00:02:58.770  -->  00:03:00.850
that you signed up for Heroku with.

49

00:03:00.850  -->  00:03:07.140
So it has to match and it will also prime prompt you for your password and it will look like you're

50

00:03:07.140  -->  00:03:08.970
not typing just hides it.

51

00:03:09.180  -->  00:03:11.060
So don't be concerned.

52

00:03:11.070  -->  00:03:11.930
There we go.

53

00:03:11.970  -->  00:03:14.820
We want to see authentication successful.

54

00:03:15.240  -->  00:03:19.060
So what we've done now is basically okayed this machine.

55

00:03:19.080  -->  00:03:27.900
This cloud nine workspace to work with to add integrate to basically transfer stuff to Heroku our Heroku

56

00:03:27.960  -->  00:03:33.870
space on her servers because remember that's all that we're doing is we're going to be sending this

57

00:03:33.870  -->  00:03:38.410
application and copying it over to Heroku machines.

58

00:03:38.580  -->  00:03:41.910
So of course we don't want to let anyone do that to to our account.

59

00:03:41.910  -->  00:03:47.510
We only want machines that we've signed in on that we've authenticated to be able to do that.

60

00:03:47.860  -->  00:03:48.180
OK.

61

00:03:48.180  -->  00:03:49.590
So that's the first step.

62

00:03:49.590  -->  00:03:54.830
The next thing we need to do is actually make sure that we're using get in this directory.

63

00:03:55.050  -->  00:04:00.300
So in the directory the top level directory of our project is is important.

64

00:04:00.300  -->  00:04:06.030
You don't do it where you have other projects you're not doing it in this folder but in the directory

65

00:04:06.030  -->  00:04:08.040
where your app JSE is in your package.

66

00:04:08.070  -->  00:04:15.080
Jason we want to run get status and in my case I'm going to see not a good repository.

67

00:04:15.270  -->  00:04:18.620
So we want to make it a get repository get in it.

68

00:04:18.900  -->  00:04:27.570
We use good to tell to determine what to send over to Heroku and in our case we're going to send the

69

00:04:27.570  -->  00:04:29.530
entire application.

70

00:04:29.550  -->  00:04:37.830
So once we initialize a repository we're going to go ahead and add the files that we want to send over

71

00:04:37.830  -->  00:04:39.640
to her OK with it.

72

00:04:39.690  -->  00:04:40.860
So that's everything.

73

00:04:41.190  -->  00:04:49.050
So we're just going to do one at a time get ADD Yes it add package that Jason and get add views that

74

00:04:49.050  -->  00:04:50.760
whole directory will do.

75

00:04:50.760  -->  00:04:52.140
Get commit.

76

00:04:52.860  -->  00:05:01.010
And we'll just say initial comment great if you go back to the instructions you'll see a few things

77

00:05:01.010  -->  00:05:01.410
.

78

00:05:01.760  -->  00:05:04.180
Once you install the toolbelt you can click.

79

00:05:04.190  -->  00:05:09.550
I have installed it in this example this tutorial they give you a demo app.

80

00:05:09.710  -->  00:05:13.700
We already have one so you can just say I cloned the app source code.

81

00:05:13.700  -->  00:05:18.550
The next thing that it tells you to do is run a command called Heroku create.

82

00:05:18.890  -->  00:05:20.880
So we can go ahead and do that.

83

00:05:21.110  -->  00:05:27.650
And what that will do is actually make space on Heroku make a new application generate a u r l for you

84

00:05:28.340  -->  00:05:32.140
in a sushi area with this current and get repository.

85

00:05:32.150  -->  00:05:33.580
So I'm going to run that right now.

86

00:05:33.680  -->  00:05:35.140
Heroku create

87

00:05:39.800  -->  00:05:45.500
and you can see first this wouldn't work if I wasn't logged into if I didn't run Heroku log in it would

88

00:05:45.500  -->  00:05:51.560
ask me to authenticate first but you can see that it makes me a new application and it gives it a random

89

00:05:51.560  -->  00:05:52.010
name.

90

00:05:52.040  -->  00:05:57.080
Heroku is pretty famous for these peaceful Zen nature ish names.

91

00:05:57.090  -->  00:06:02.580
They come up with so nameless at all here with this random number.

92

00:06:02.780  -->  00:06:07.580
It also gives you this you know where your application will be deployed to.

93

00:06:07.850  -->  00:06:09.490
You can change this.

94

00:06:09.530  -->  00:06:17.240
You can look at the Roku docs you can specify your own Heroku app dot com domain if you want.

95

00:06:17.240  -->  00:06:22.070
So if you wanted to check if this demo application.

96

00:06:22.070  -->  00:06:27.590
One two three dot Heroku app dot com is available you can do that but you can also of course have your

97

00:06:27.590  -->  00:06:28.400
own domain.

98

00:06:28.490  -->  00:06:33.200
So if you own Salli dot com or clouds are awesome.

99

00:06:33.290  -->  00:06:37.740
I know you can deploy an app that is deployed to Roku.

100

00:06:37.780  -->  00:06:41.960
You can set it up so that it works with your domain but you wouldn't do that just yet.

101

00:06:42.080  -->  00:06:47.680
So you still create this application here you get this random Hoku you are now if we visit that right

102

00:06:47.690  -->  00:06:48.140
now

103

00:06:50.990  -->  00:06:53.630
we just get this default welcome to your new app.

104

00:06:53.620  -->  00:06:56.340
We don't have any code associated with this app yet.

105

00:06:56.390  -->  00:07:01.370
Heroku just knows that we want to make an app that we have an empty app there.

106

00:07:01.370  -->  00:07:06.720
One other thing that happened is that it added a remote to our Get repository called Heroku.

107

00:07:06.950  -->  00:07:15.290
So if you take a look at Get remote's dash B you'll see here it added a remote called Heroku that we

108

00:07:15.290  -->  00:07:16.590
can push code to.

109

00:07:16.630  -->  00:07:17.850
So this is really important.

110

00:07:17.900  -->  00:07:21.260
This is how you basically transfer the code.

111

00:07:21.250  -->  00:07:24.850
This is how I'm going to tell Heroku Here's the code I want you to run.

112

00:07:24.860  -->  00:07:27.910
So when I push to Heroku I'll run a command.

113

00:07:27.950  -->  00:07:32.250
Get push Heroku master.

114

00:07:32.360  -->  00:07:37.420
So that's going to push whatever code I have added and committed on the master ranch over to Heroku

115

00:07:37.480  -->  00:07:37.890
.

116

00:07:38.240  -->  00:07:39.880
So in this case that's everything.

117

00:07:39.920  -->  00:07:42.840
Again sometimes you don't want to push every single thing.

118

00:07:42.860  -->  00:07:48.260
Maybe there's some new code that you don't want to send over to your production server but in this case

119

00:07:48.740  -->  00:07:49.940
we want everything over.

120

00:07:49.970  -->  00:07:51.600
The app is working the way we want.

121

00:07:51.680  -->  00:07:53.300
So we're just going to push everything.

122

00:07:53.300  -->  00:07:59.540
So get push Heroku master before I do that you'll see in a tutorial.

123

00:07:59.540  -->  00:08:00.590
It also tells how to do that.

124

00:08:00.590  -->  00:08:05.380
So if you get lost if your prefer watching or reading the tutorial you can follow that.

125

00:08:05.380  -->  00:08:07.390
We're doing exactly the same step.

126

00:08:07.580  -->  00:08:12.110
So get push Heroku M. OK so we can hit enter.

127

00:08:12.230  -->  00:08:16.700
I'll warn you that there is one thing that we haven't done that's going to cause a small problem but

128

00:08:16.700  -->  00:08:21.930
I did it on purpose because I want to show you the process of debugging Heroku.

129

00:08:22.160  -->  00:08:23.210
So I'm going to hit enter though

130

00:08:26.760  -->  00:08:30.890
and it takes a little bit usually especially with larger apps.

131

00:08:31.220  -->  00:08:32.590
A lot of stuff is happening here.

132

00:08:32.600  -->  00:08:35.880
Usually this doesn't happen when you just push to get hub.

133

00:08:35.930  -->  00:08:38.190
So this is all Heroku magic.

134

00:08:38.620  -->  00:08:41.570
You can go back and read a bunch of stuff about what's happening.

135

00:08:41.830  -->  00:08:49.880
Let's see it detected that it's a node app it installed some of the important dependencies or the Pineries

136

00:08:50.090  -->  00:08:54.470
then install the dependencies express and Ejay us because of that package that Jaison.

137

00:08:54.620  -->  00:09:02.530
And these are all the things that express depends on then built the application and then launched it

138

00:09:02.560  -->  00:09:03.130
.

139

00:09:03.710  -->  00:09:07.740
So says this application has been deployed to Iraq.

140

00:09:07.790  -->  00:09:14.080
So if we visit that you URL refresh we would hope to see our app.

141

00:09:14.160  -->  00:09:17.270
However all that we see is application error.

142

00:09:17.270  -->  00:09:21.910
So this is a really common screen when you're debugging Heroku when you're starting out when you're

143

00:09:22.150  -->  00:09:24.100
pushing a new app up there.

144

00:09:24.110  -->  00:09:28.190
What happens when you have an error with your code or something doesn't work.

145

00:09:28.280  -->  00:09:34.660
Is that on the Heroku side of things or on the web interface all that you see is error.

146

00:09:34.930  -->  00:09:40.030
They don't put the specific error message in the details there because you wouldn't want to expose that

147

00:09:40.040  -->  00:09:41.490
to your users obviously.

148

00:09:41.780  -->  00:09:43.690
So they keep things as hidden as possible.

149

00:09:43.700  -->  00:09:45.930
They just say application error.

150

00:09:46.340  -->  00:09:52.220
But then what happens is that you can view the issues you can view the error messages in the logs in

151

00:09:52.220  -->  00:09:53.600
your command line.

152

00:09:54.350  -->  00:10:03.450
So to do that we just type Heroku logs and we get a lot of stuff here if we scroll up we'll see there's

153

00:10:03.460  -->  00:10:07.600
an error and the error happened right here.

154

00:10:07.840  -->  00:10:15.790
Starting process with command NPM start and then it turns out we don't have an NPM start command missing

155

00:10:15.790  -->  00:10:21.490
script start and then that causes all of our errors and things to crash.

156

00:10:21.490  -->  00:10:30.270
So again I did it on purpose to show you one Heroku logs how you could go ahead and take a look because

157

00:10:30.320  -->  00:10:34.870
it it hides the actual error message from you here but that doesn't mean you can't see it.

158

00:10:34.870  -->  00:10:37.960
And this is a pretty common screen if your app is crashing.

159

00:10:38.110  -->  00:10:40.340
Heroku logs and the important command.

160

00:10:40.690  -->  00:10:45.440
But what the arrow is saying is that we didn't have a start script.

161

00:10:45.460  -->  00:10:52.420
So with that start script does is it tells Heroku it tells the server what code to run to start her

162

00:10:52.420  -->  00:10:53.330
application.

163

00:10:53.590  -->  00:10:56.970
So it basically does what we've been doing to start our server.

164

00:10:56.980  -->  00:10:59.010
We've been running node apps.

165

00:10:59.110  -->  00:11:03.940
Yes but we're unable to do that because the code is not running here anymore.

166

00:11:04.090  -->  00:11:05.560
We're not running it on this workspace.

167

00:11:05.560  -->  00:11:06.220
That's the point.

168

00:11:06.220  -->  00:11:07.630
It's on Heroku.

169

00:11:08.410  -->  00:11:10.970
So we give it a start script.

170

00:11:11.020  -->  00:11:16.480
So we open up the package stage a song and it goes inside of scripts.

171

00:11:16.480  -->  00:11:19.150
This is not something that you're expected to know.

172

00:11:19.190  -->  00:11:26.410
This is new start colon and then node after J.S..

173

00:11:26.530  -->  00:11:34.510
So what Heroku will do is when we push code to Heroku it's going to first run NPM install install all

174

00:11:34.510  -->  00:11:36.760
the dependencies every time we push.

175

00:11:36.790  -->  00:11:43.150
So we might upgrade to a new version of express if we add and commit and then get push Heroku master

176

00:11:43.360  -->  00:11:50.920
that will automatically run NPM install on Heroku get the new version and then it runs NPM start which

177

00:11:50.920  -->  00:11:52.120
will run this right here.

178

00:11:52.190  -->  00:11:53.240
Node apt.

179

00:11:53.350  -->  00:11:55.180
Yes.

180

00:11:55.210  -->  00:12:03.640
So we can't just do get push Heroku master because right now our get Master ranch is unchanged.

181

00:12:03.700  -->  00:12:06.490
We haven't added and committed that change we just made.

182

00:12:06.790  -->  00:12:08.380
So if you type get status

183

00:12:11.110  -->  00:12:13.370
you can see on Branch maß.

184

00:12:13.390  -->  00:12:16.270
Oh well I didn't save the file so that would do it.

185

00:12:16.270  -->  00:12:20.700
Now if I take it status you'll see modified package that Jason.

186

00:12:21.400  -->  00:12:30.820
So we want to add that get commit and all that will right here is add start script.

187

00:12:30.880  -->  00:12:36.700
Now all we need to do is get push Roku master and we're good to go.

188

00:12:36.700  -->  00:12:37.830
So get push.

189

00:12:37.840  -->  00:12:43.520
Her master will start that entire process over where it takes our code takes a text at Jason.

190

00:12:43.590  -->  00:12:49.260
It installs these dependencies and then it runs NPM start which we didn't have specified last time.

191

00:12:49.300  -->  00:12:52.050
So the app crashed.

192

00:12:52.450  -->  00:12:55.350
oops! meant to hit Enter over here.

193

00:12:55.520  -->  00:12:57.360
It will take a little bit.

194

00:12:57.770  -->  00:13:08.800
It's pushing it up to Heroku it's installing things installing dependencies and see launching verifying

195

00:13:08.800  -->  00:13:09.740
that deploy.

196

00:13:09.920  -->  00:13:12.600
OK let's try refreshing now.

197

00:13:13.540  -->  00:13:14.740
And there we go.

198

00:13:15.100  -->  00:13:22.690
So we have an application running nameless and I told 6 4 4 9 8 dot Roku at dotcom I can click on the

199

00:13:22.700  -->  00:13:25.430
routes go back and forth.

200

00:13:25.570  -->  00:13:26.800
Awesome.

201

00:13:26.800  -->  00:13:31.810
The last thing that I'll show is on the Heroku dashboard if you go back to your dashboard.

202

00:13:32.650  -->  00:13:36.270
We'll now have our application showing up right here.

203

00:13:36.390  -->  00:13:38.310
Oh it's going to make me log in first.

204

00:13:38.320  -->  00:13:41.180
So once you log in hopefully you won't have to.

205

00:13:41.200  -->  00:13:43.150
But once I log in we'll see what I'm looking for.

206

00:13:43.150  -->  00:13:45.670
And as you can see our new app is here.

207

00:13:46.390  -->  00:13:54.580
You can click on it view information about it anything about how long it's been up how many people have

208

00:13:54.580  -->  00:13:56.430
accessed it how often.

209

00:13:56.680  -->  00:14:01.600
Who has permission to deploy and mess with this who is an owner contributor.

210

00:14:01.780  -->  00:14:02.740
All sorts of different things.

211

00:14:02.740  -->  00:14:04.420
I'm not going to go into all of this.

212

00:14:04.430  -->  00:14:09.970
I mean you can see all the different times we've pushed or deployed when we initialized it when we first

213

00:14:09.970  -->  00:14:11.770
released the app.

214

00:14:11.770  -->  00:14:17.420
And then this is also where you would come to set things up or configure things like custom domains

215

00:14:17.620  -->  00:14:19.630
or you can add add ons.

216

00:14:19.900  -->  00:14:24.790
The one thing Paul mentioned here is that we're using the free Heroku plan right now.

217

00:14:24.790  -->  00:14:31.060
There's no credit card associated where they make their money though is once you start having more users

218

00:14:31.150  -->  00:14:34.180
you're going to upgrade and what you do is click here.

219

00:14:34.210  -->  00:14:40.450
Upgrade to hobby and see you can click on hobby or you can go to a professional so you can see hobby

220

00:14:40.480  -->  00:14:42.200
starts at 7 bucks a month.

221

00:14:42.220  -->  00:14:43.530
So definitely worth it.

222

00:14:43.540  -->  00:14:48.250
If you are going to have if you're going to start having more people for you and your applications but

223

00:14:48.340  -->  00:14:54.250
even free works just fine for like a portfolio project or something you're going to send out to companies

224

00:14:54.580  -->  00:14:58.980
as long as you're not expecting you know thousands thousands of hits a day.

225

00:14:59.620  -->  00:15:00.280
OK.

226

00:15:00.760  -->  00:15:02.990
So that's all there is to Heroku here.

227

00:15:03.040  -->  00:15:04.600
I want to recap that though.

228

00:15:04.840  -->  00:15:10.560
So let's go back and go through this process one more time of updating our application.

229

00:15:10.570  -->  00:15:16.450
I want to update the home page so that it has an image on it that say and I happen to have an image

230

00:15:16.450  -->  00:15:17.740
here.

231

00:15:18.460  -->  00:15:19.930
It's kind of large I didn't think about that.

232

00:15:19.930  -->  00:15:24.440
This is an image I took recently but I'm learning some photography on the side.

233

00:15:24.790  -->  00:15:32.990
So feel free to use whatever image you want of course source equals gigantic source.

234

00:15:33.460  -->  00:15:35.180
Let's test it out locally.

235

00:15:35.320  -->  00:15:38.190
So node app Julius

236

00:15:41.290  -->  00:15:42.430
refresh.

237

00:15:43.210  -->  00:15:43.960
Wow.

238

00:15:44.240  -->  00:15:45.620
And get to image.

239

00:15:45.670  -->  00:15:47.240
That's fine though.

240

00:15:47.980  -->  00:15:54.490
So that's working fine locally on Heroku though that change is not taken effect at all and that's because

241

00:15:54.550  -->  00:15:56.150
they're not inherently linked.

242

00:15:56.200  -->  00:16:00.420
We have to choose what we want to push to Heroku And and that's really the point.

243

00:16:00.430  -->  00:16:05.590
We have a workspace to play around with to make mistakes to try new things and then if we want to incorporate

244

00:16:05.620  -->  00:16:09.740
and incorporate them into the real app I can then push them to Heroku.

245

00:16:09.940  -->  00:16:13.030
But Heroku should always be the last stable build.

246

00:16:13.030  -->  00:16:16.590
The last thing that works before you went and messed something up.

247

00:16:17.140  -->  00:16:31.060
OK so all I need to do is get status need to add that change commit add image of bridge and then get

248

00:16:31.600  -->  00:16:34.310
push Heroku master.

249

00:16:34.810  -->  00:16:37.650
So that workflow is really common.

250

00:16:37.720  -->  00:16:42.190
The first thing that we did that this isn't really part of the workflow but the first thing was make

251

00:16:42.190  -->  00:16:48.970
sure you're in a get repository then Heroku create then once you create then what you're going to do

252

00:16:49.360  -->  00:16:55.660
is make sure you add and commit everything that you want to go over to Heroku and then get push Heroku

253

00:16:55.660  -->  00:17:01.870
master and then any time you change or update it same process get ad get commit get push Heroku master

254

00:17:03.610  -->  00:17:09.360
refresh on our Heroku app and there we go or change is taking place.

255

00:17:09.370  -->  00:17:09.870
Awesome.

256

00:17:09.970  -->  00:17:10.520
All right.

257

00:17:10.600  -->  00:17:16.240
So in the next video we're going to see how to deploy a more complex substantial app with a database

258

00:17:16.300  -->  00:17:18.560
which is a little bit of a headache.

259

00:17:18.570  -->  00:17:19.070
Unfortunately
