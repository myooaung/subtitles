00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:04.860
So in this video we're going to learn about two tools that we're going to use for the rest of this course

2

00:00:04.860  -->  00:00:05.580
.

3

00:00:05.640  -->  00:00:10.680
So when we make Web sites when we're developing web applications we need a place to write our code which

4

00:00:10.680  -->  00:00:15.120
should be a text editor and we need a place to view our code which would be a web browser.

5

00:00:15.390  -->  00:00:16.960
So we use web browsers all the time.

6

00:00:16.980  -->  00:00:21.810
It's how you view the Internet as how you're probably watching this course right now and you're probably

7

00:00:21.810  -->  00:00:25.360
using your favorite web browser or the one that came with your machine.

8

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:29.570
It might be Safari or chrome or Firefox or Internet Explorer.

9

00:00:29.700  -->  00:00:33.670
There's a bunch of Web browsers out there and they all do basically the same thing.

10

00:00:33.720  -->  00:00:36.000
They let you via web sites.

11

00:00:36.000  -->  00:00:40.560
However we're going to use Google Chrome in this course for two main reasons.

12

00:00:40.680  -->  00:00:46.950
One is that we just want to have a standardized browser so that if I do something I show a shortcut

13

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:52.540
I show the developer tools I do something with one of the menus that you can replicate it yourself.

14

00:00:52.800  -->  00:00:57.060
And the other reason is that Google Chrome is used by a lot of developers.

15

00:00:57.180  -->  00:01:02.280
So as I mentioned you can use any of the browsers but generally most developers are using Google Chrome

16

00:01:02.280  -->  00:01:03.920
or Mozilla Firefox.

17

00:01:03.990  -->  00:01:07.980
Both of them are solid offerings especially with their developer tools which we're going to learn a

18

00:01:07.980  -->  00:01:09.960
lot more about as we move forward.

19

00:01:09.960  -->  00:01:15.240
But basically dev tools are tools that are made for developers so things that you may have never seen

20

00:01:15.240  -->  00:01:17.670
before because you have been a developer.

21

00:01:17.910  -->  00:01:22.230
But as soon as you start this course we're going to be using a lot of the tools that chrome gives us

22

00:01:22.230  -->  00:01:25.680
that are a little bit hidden that help us make Web sites.

23

00:01:25.950  -->  00:01:29.600
So go to Google Chrome website Google dot com slash chrome.

24

00:01:29.730  -->  00:01:34.230
It's in the description as well and download the version for your computer.

25

00:01:34.230  -->  00:01:38.450
So for me this can be a Mac for some of you that might be a PC.

26

00:01:38.510  -->  00:01:42.010
You can click on download another platform and choose the correct platform.

27

00:01:42.060  -->  00:01:46.980
Download that and drag it somewhere or install it in a folder that you'll know how to find it again

28

00:01:47.010  -->  00:01:47.320
.

29

00:01:47.910  -->  00:01:51.190
I would personally recommend using Chrome a lot if you're not used to it.

30

00:01:51.360  -->  00:01:57.000
Use it to do your regular internet browsing try and make that browser that you develop in the same browser

31

00:01:57.000  -->  00:01:59.370
that you actually use to browse the web.

32

00:01:59.370  -->  00:02:03.620
There's no reason to use Safari for some things and chrome for others.

33

00:02:03.690  -->  00:02:06.110
The other tool that we need is a text editor.

34

00:02:06.390  -->  00:02:09.760
So this is a really important tool it's where we're going to write our code.

35

00:02:09.810  -->  00:02:14.790
Technically we could use any text editor out there so you could write code in Microsoft Word.

36

00:02:14.790  -->  00:02:16.250
You could do it in a Google doc.

37

00:02:16.440  -->  00:02:20.610
You could do it in a five hundred dollar professional code editor.

38

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:22.130
There's all sorts of different platforms.

39

00:02:22.140  -->  00:02:28.020
And honestly every developer has his or her own opinions and his or her own set up that they swear by

40

00:02:28.040  -->  00:02:28.450
.

41

00:02:28.860  -->  00:02:35.250
Personally I prefer teaching with Sublime Text which is a free text editor has a free trial that goes

42

00:02:35.250  -->  00:02:36.080
on forever.

43

00:02:36.080  -->  00:02:37.760
I definitely recommend paying for it.

44

00:02:37.950  -->  00:02:40.350
If you end up doing this professionally.

45

00:02:40.470  -->  00:02:42.900
But the point is the trial is that anyone can use it.

46

00:02:42.930  -->  00:02:44.430
It's an open platform.

47

00:02:44.520  -->  00:02:46.570
It has lots and lots of people using it.

48

00:02:46.710  -->  00:02:53.310
And as I mentioned it's free so sublime text dot com and click on download here we're going to do Version

49

00:02:53.310  -->  00:02:53.940
2.

50

00:02:53.970  -->  00:02:56.970
There's also subline text 3 which is in beta.

51

00:02:56.970  -->  00:02:58.650
It's been in beta for a really long time.

52

00:02:58.650  -->  00:02:59.540
It's pretty stable.

53

00:02:59.550  -->  00:03:02.470
So if you want to use subcontext three go ahead.

54

00:03:02.750  -->  00:03:03.110
Great.

55

00:03:03.320  -->  00:03:04.650
So we'll go ahead and download this.

56

00:03:04.650  -->  00:03:07.110
Click on the correct version.

57

00:03:07.290  -->  00:03:08.460
Get that downloading.

58

00:03:08.550  -->  00:03:11.090
And those two tools are going to be really really important.
