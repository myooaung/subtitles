1

00:00:01,240  -->  00:00:04,800
OK so let's go ahead and create this blog from scratch.

2

00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:06,620
So feel free to follow along here.

3

00:00:06,630  -->  00:00:11,530
I'm going to go from creating a new file all the way up to finishing this blog here.

4

00:00:12,000  -->  00:00:13,880
So the first thing that we'll want to do.

5

00:00:14,070  -->  00:00:18,540
I'm going to keep the solution open just so that I can reference it and make sure we have color correct

6

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:19,750
and font sizes.

7

00:00:20,040  -->  00:00:25,690
But the first thing that we really want to do is get our files set up so I have two files a blog that

8

00:00:25,730  -->  00:00:33,870
HMO and it has nothing in it so far except the title blog and it's linked to a style sheet called Blog

9

00:00:33,970  -->  00:00:35,990
Dotsie SS That's empty.

10

00:00:36,030  -->  00:00:38,760
So this is just you know the two files that we're going to need.

11

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:41,170
And now let's go ahead and fill them in.

12

00:00:41,790  -->  00:00:44,950
So we have to decide when are doing something like this.

13

00:00:44,970  -->  00:00:46,540
Where do we start.

14

00:00:46,560  -->  00:00:52,440
And I think the best solution is to start with some of this markup in our age G-mail and styling some

15

00:00:52,440  -->  00:00:57,060
of it but we don't have to get everything their perfect word for word before we actually style things

16

00:00:57,070  -->  00:00:57,420
.

17

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:04,290
So I would start by you putting a paragraph or two and one of these headers in our body.

18

00:01:04,290  -->  00:01:11,700
And to do that this is Lorem Ipsum text except it's bacon ipsum which is just add bacon ipsum dot com

19

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:14,130
.

20

00:01:14,130  -->  00:01:17,340
Click on give me bacon and just copy one of the paragraphs.

21

00:01:17,610  -->  00:01:24,000
I'm just going to use what I have here but the words aren't so important as long as they are words there

22

00:01:24,010  -->  00:01:24,330
.

23

00:01:24,660  -->  00:01:26,840
So if you want to use bacon ipsum go ahead.

24

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:32,550
But if you don't if you object to bacon you can pick any other ipsum or just make up your own words

25

00:01:32,550  -->  00:01:34,520
or actually put your own blog post there.

26

00:01:34,560  -->  00:01:35,810
That would be ideal.

27

00:01:36,030  -->  00:01:41,400
And then I'm going to also just put one of the headings here and one note it might make sense to make

28

00:01:41,400  -->  00:01:44,070
these an H1 both of them.

29

00:01:44,070  -->  00:01:49,800
But generally the rule is you want to have one H-1 on the page it should be the biggest thing on your

30

00:01:49,800  -->  00:01:50,820
page.

31

00:01:50,850  -->  00:01:55,420
So because we have multiple of each are multiple headings here multiple article titles.

32

00:01:55,500  -->  00:02:00,840
I'm going to go with H-2 but at the end of the day it doesn't matter at all because we're going to style

33

00:02:01,200  -->  00:02:05,760
everything about it we're going to change the font size we're going to change the color and all of the

34

00:02:05,760  -->  00:02:11,090
things that would be set by making it an H1 versus nature to those differences will be eliminated anyways

35

00:02:11,100  -->  00:02:11,360
.

36

00:02:11,640  -->  00:02:19,830
So I'm going to go with H-2 and I'm just going to say this is my first article not the most creative

37

00:02:19,830  -->  00:02:22,210
title but save it.

38

00:02:22,410  -->  00:02:24,220
And let's just preview it to start.

39

00:02:24,630  -->  00:02:27,300
So open it up.

40

00:02:27,360  -->  00:02:27,870
OK.

41

00:02:27,930  -->  00:02:30,090
So there's our blog so far.

42

00:02:30,960  -->  00:02:33,100
So we have a bunch of decisions to make.

43

00:02:33,120  -->  00:02:38,620
The first place that I might start is in getting this body to have this border.

44

00:02:39,180  -->  00:02:42,110
So I did provide the colors in the last video.

45

00:02:42,120  -->  00:02:47,850
I'm just going to copy this color here and I'm going to give the body of water so I will select the

46

00:02:47,850  -->  00:02:56,240
body and then all we have to do is say border and it's 20 pixels solid this gray color.

47

00:02:56,370  -->  00:02:57,930
And let's check that out.

48

00:02:58,560  -->  00:02:59,090
OK.

49

00:02:59,220  -->  00:03:04,410
So it doesn't quite look the way that we would want it to look but it's getting there we have the border

50

00:03:04,430  -->  00:03:05,120
.

51

00:03:05,580  -->  00:03:08,350
Let's make it full size so we can really compare.

52

00:03:09,120  -->  00:03:13,740
So another thing that you'll notice is that our border there is one problem which is it goes all the

53

00:03:13,740  -->  00:03:16,390
way the whole body takes up the entire page.

54

00:03:16,560  -->  00:03:19,500
Versus here the body only takes up part of the page.

55

00:03:19,560  -->  00:03:21,890
And then there's spacing on either side.

56

00:03:21,930  -->  00:03:27,180
Then there's also the spacing on the inside that we don't have because our words in our text go right

57

00:03:27,180  -->  00:03:28,550
up against the border.

58

00:03:28,590  -->  00:03:31,820
So let's start by solving that problem and to fix that.

59

00:03:31,860  -->  00:03:33,520
Of course you need padding.

60

00:03:33,630  -->  00:03:35,930
So this is 20 pixels padding on all sides.

61

00:03:35,970  -->  00:03:40,430
You can see there's padding at the bottom and the left and the right as well.

62

00:03:40,470  -->  00:03:50,560
So in the body we're just going to assign padding 20 pixels on all four sides and we get this OK.

63

00:03:50,580  -->  00:03:52,510
So that's a little bit closer.

64

00:03:52,530  -->  00:03:58,230
The next thing that we should work on is getting the width correct and it's not just a matter of getting

65

00:03:58,230  -->  00:04:07,350
the width to be the right size when it's full screen but also as it shrinks down you'll see that it

66

00:04:07,350  -->  00:04:14,730
stays this is 700 pixels it stays at 700 pixels for a while and then it shrinks and shrinks and scales

67

00:04:14,730  -->  00:04:15,360
.

68

00:04:15,360  -->  00:04:17,730
So we want to make sure we can get that to happen.

69

00:04:17,820  -->  00:04:19,660
So we're going to use a little bit of a trick.

70

00:04:19,830  -->  00:04:24,220
And then the one other thing you want to do is make sure that it's centered right now.

71

00:04:24,360  -->  00:04:25,330
Well we can't really tell.

72

00:04:25,350  -->  00:04:28,210
But it's not centered it's going to be on the left side.

73

00:04:28,230  -->  00:04:30,850
So let's go ahead and add the within first.

74

00:04:31,700  -->  00:04:41,310
So let's say with 700 pixels and save and this is what I was talking about it on the left and we want

75

00:04:41,310  -->  00:04:47,250
to center in the middle and to do that we can use the auto or the margin auto trick that I had talked

76

00:04:47,250  -->  00:04:49,660
about in the box model video.

77

00:04:50,100  -->  00:04:54,920
So we're going to set a margin and we're going to just use the short cut.

78

00:04:55,050  -->  00:05:01,190
So we're going to do zero pixels up top and bottom and then Otto on the left and right.

79

00:05:01,230  -->  00:05:03,900
Remember when we just do two here rather than four.

80

00:05:04,020  -->  00:05:06,640
This is top and bottom and this is left and right.

81

00:05:07,230  -->  00:05:14,100
So that centers it for us automatically but then you'll notice by giving it a zero top and bottom it's

82

00:05:14,100  -->  00:05:15,740
now right up against the top.

83

00:05:16,020  -->  00:05:17,870
And this one here is not.

84

00:05:17,880  -->  00:05:18,720
We have some space.

85

00:05:18,720  -->  00:05:20,950
There's 20 pixels right there.

86

00:05:21,210  -->  00:05:22,630
So that's a simple fix.

87

00:05:22,770  -->  00:05:26,350
Just the same line change that back to 20 P x.

88

00:05:26,370  -->  00:05:27,490
We do need the x.

89

00:05:27,510  -->  00:05:30,580
We didn't before because when it's zero you can just leave it at zero.

90

00:05:30,720  -->  00:05:33,970
But when there's a number we need the next.

91

00:05:33,990  -->  00:05:36,110
OK so that's looking pretty close.

92

00:05:36,120  -->  00:05:46,440
The only thing is that as we shrink we want this to stay 700 pixels until it can no longer say 700 pixels

93

00:05:46,440  -->  00:05:46,470
.

94

00:05:46,470  -->  00:05:52,440
And we want it to shrink down and it's pretty easy to do that actually all that we want to do is change

95

00:05:52,440  -->  00:05:59,400
this to be max width and then we're going to assign it a percentage with.

96

00:05:59,700  -->  00:06:03,760
And what this says is make it 80 percent when you need to.

97

00:06:03,900  -->  00:06:07,540
But at a maximum make it 700 pixels.

98

00:06:07,620  -->  00:06:09,780
So I'll show you what that looks like when you refresh.

99

00:06:09,780  -->  00:06:16,410
Nothing changes because it's added to maximum seven hundred pixels so it checks if 80 percent would

100

00:06:16,410  -->  00:06:19,180
be more than 700 pixels which it would in this case.

101

00:06:19,200  -->  00:06:27,840
So it stays at 700 still stays at 700 until right here where it starts to shrink.

102

00:06:27,840  -->  00:06:31,250
That's where 80 percent now is less than 700 pixels.

103

00:06:31,770  -->  00:06:32,030
OK.

104

00:06:32,040  -->  00:06:35,370
So now we have our basic body set up.

105

00:06:35,370  -->  00:06:39,330
The next thing that I'd like to do here is get our Funt going.

106

00:06:39,330  -->  00:06:49,300
So again if we go to the notes that I have from the last video the font is called Source sense pro.

107

00:06:49,320  -->  00:06:54,370
So let's go ahead and head over to Google phos and look for source sends Pro.

108

00:06:54,540  -->  00:07:00,540
So I have it open here but again it's just Google dot com slash fonts and just do a search for a source

109

00:07:01,530  -->  00:07:06,860
sends pro right here add to collection use.

110

00:07:07,140  -->  00:07:09,990
And now we have a choice which font weights do we want.

111

00:07:10,250  -->  00:07:15,540
And I actually didn't tell you this in the original video but this is just the normal font face of the

112

00:07:15,540  -->  00:07:17,390
font weight 400.

113

00:07:17,520  -->  00:07:19,220
And this is a heavier weight.

114

00:07:19,230  -->  00:07:20,050
It's folded.

115

00:07:20,100  -->  00:07:22,090
So we're going to want both of those.

116

00:07:22,440  -->  00:07:26,970
So normal in bold 400 700 and that's it.

117

00:07:26,970  -->  00:07:29,700
We go down here and copy this link.

118

00:07:29,700  -->  00:07:37,180
We can get rid of Google fonts now and we're going to go to our HMO and just paste that link in.

119

00:07:37,950  -->  00:07:41,530
And now we have the ability to use source sense.

120

00:07:42,180  -->  00:07:51,100
So let's assign it to both paragraphs and age twos and we also want it to be on these dates.

121

00:07:51,270  -->  00:07:58,620
So what we could do is select paragraph and say font family source sense pro and we could do the same

122

00:07:58,620  -->  00:08:00,290
thing for H-1.

123

00:08:00,990  -->  00:08:03,640
But that's not a really good use of our success.

124

00:08:03,780  -->  00:08:07,950
Our code is going to be a little bit repetitive every element that we want to use it on.

125

00:08:07,950  -->  00:08:10,230
We would have to go and add this in.

126

00:08:10,770  -->  00:08:15,140
So what we do instead is just apply it to the body.

127

00:08:15,690  -->  00:08:19,420
And by playing into the body everything inside of it will inherit it.

128

00:08:19,470  -->  00:08:30,360
So font family source and pro and save refresh and there we go we ever H-1 using it or H-2 and we have

129

00:08:30,360  -->  00:08:32,100
a paragraph.

130

00:08:32,810  -->  00:08:34,560
So that's looking pretty good so far.
