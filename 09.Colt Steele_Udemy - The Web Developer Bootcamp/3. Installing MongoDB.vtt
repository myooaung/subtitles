00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:00.630
All right.

2

00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:01.530
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01.590  -->  00:00:06.510
In this lesson I'm going to introduce you to Mongo D-B which is the main database that we'll use through

4

00:00:06.510  -->  00:00:07.650
most of the course.

5

00:00:07.950  -->  00:00:11.800
And by the end of the video Our goal is to have Mongo T-P installed.

6

00:00:11.810  -->  00:00:16.860
So let's start by talking about what is Mongo D-B what type of database is it and why are we using it

7

00:00:16.860  -->  00:00:17.460
.

8

00:00:17.460  -->  00:00:25.170
I briefly mentioned this in the last video but Mongo DP is a no sequel or non-relational database so

9

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:29.960
our data will look like this where it basically looks like javascript objects and arrays.

10

00:00:30.060  -->  00:00:32.780
Key value pairs that we store in the database.

11

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:35.550
And that means that it's very flexible and dynamic.

12

00:00:35.700  -->  00:00:37.640
But that's not really why we're using it.

13

00:00:37.740  -->  00:00:43.590
Because to be honest with you the stuff that we're going to be doing is doable in any of the databases

14

00:00:43.680  -->  00:00:47.970
that I could have picked from and this is one of those decisions that I made where I could have gone

15

00:00:47.970  -->  00:00:54.480
either way we could have learned post-grads we could've learned Majeski Well we could have learned Mongo

16

00:00:55.140  -->  00:01:00.720
and the main reason that I decided on Mangu is that it's the most popular database right now with node

17

00:01:00.890  -->  00:01:02.200
with Express.

18

00:01:02.200  -->  00:01:07.440
There's a pretty popular stack that you might have heard of called the mean stack and that stands for

19

00:01:07.440  -->  00:01:11.280
Mongo express angular and Noad.

20

00:01:11.280  -->  00:01:14.290
So we're going to do the men stack for now.

21

00:01:14.390  -->  00:01:15.280
No angular.

22

00:01:15.540  -->  00:01:19.260
So that's Mongo Express and node and we have these two down.

23

00:01:19.320  -->  00:01:23.880
Now we need to learn about Mongo and the other reason I decided on Mongo is that it has really good

24

00:01:23.880  -->  00:01:27.150
tools right now for us to use it instead of an express app.

25

00:01:27.180  -->  00:01:32.400
So just to reiterate there were a few options of databases that we could have picked from by picking

26

00:01:32.400  -->  00:01:33.100
Mongo.

27

00:01:33.150  -->  00:01:37.610
I am not saying that you should always use Mongo that it's the best thing in the world.

28

00:01:37.650  -->  00:01:43.590
In fact it got so popular so quickly that there's been a backlash against it from a small part of the

29

00:01:43.590  -->  00:01:45.570
community in the last few years.

30

00:01:45.660  -->  00:01:47.990
And then there's been a backlash against that backlash.

31

00:01:48.060  -->  00:01:49.840
But it is somewhat controversial.

32

00:01:49.860  -->  00:01:54.870
Lots of companies are using it and it's very quickly becoming one of the most popular databases.

33

00:01:54.870  -->  00:02:00.720
It's currently the most popular no sequel database and it's the third or fourth most popular database

34

00:02:00.720  -->  00:02:01.630
in general.

35

00:02:01.980  -->  00:02:07.800
OK so before we move on to installing it let me show you the Mangu D-B home page so it's Mangu D-B dot

36

00:02:07.830  -->  00:02:08.760
org.

37

00:02:08.760  -->  00:02:10.380
You can read the docs here.

38

00:02:10.650  -->  00:02:14.700
That will explain some of the methods some of the syntax that you need to know.

39

00:02:14.710  -->  00:02:20.760
There's this university tab where they offer online courses and you can watch some of these if you're

40

00:02:20.760  -->  00:02:22.650
interested but you don't need this.

41

00:02:22.650  -->  00:02:24.190
You have another online course.

42

00:02:24.300  -->  00:02:26.370
So let's get back to installing it now.

43

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:32.850
And what we need to do is install Mongo in our cloud nine instance and cloud nine.

44

00:02:32.850  -->  00:02:36.220
Fortunately for us has a nice set of instructions.

45

00:02:36.390  -->  00:02:37.880
So I'm going to walk you through it.

46

00:02:38.070  -->  00:02:42.600
What we need to do is run three simple commands but they are important commands.

47

00:02:42.660  -->  00:02:47.400
So I'm going to ask you to watch me do it first before you follow along.

48

00:02:47.670  -->  00:02:50.330
So this will be 30 seconds of me running commands.

49

00:02:50.550  -->  00:02:51.740
And then you should do it on your own.

50

00:02:51.750  -->  00:02:56.550
But I just want you to pay attention pretty closely because these are important what we need to do first

51

00:02:56.910  -->  00:02:59.710
is make a directory and we're going to call it data.

52

00:02:59.850  -->  00:03:03.030
And that's where Mangu is going to store all of its information.

53

00:03:03.240  -->  00:03:05.920
So we need to make the directory so you can see here.

54

00:03:06.420  -->  00:03:12.180
And then we need to tell Mangu that that data directory is where it should store all the data and when

55

00:03:12.180  -->  00:03:16.080
to tell it where that directory is which is what this command does.

56

00:03:16.350  -->  00:03:18.560
You don't need to worry about what exactly it does.

57

00:03:18.570  -->  00:03:20.270
You can read more here.

58

00:03:20.880  -->  00:03:26.700
But again it just is telling Mangu to use our new data directory and then we have to run this third

59

00:03:26.700  -->  00:03:32.040
command here which will help change some of the permissions and settings so that things work smoothly

60

00:03:32.030  -->  00:03:32.540
.

61

00:03:32.610  -->  00:03:38.550
So I'm going to go ahead and run that however I'm going to move into a new directory and the directory

62

00:03:38.550  -->  00:03:45.000
I'm going to go into is actually outside of this main web dev boot camp directory.

63

00:03:45.000  -->  00:03:53.010
So right now if I in my terminal can see I'm on the workspace I'm actually going to see one more level

64

00:03:53.010  -->  00:03:59.580
out or now I see my workspace and I don't have to do this I can install this data directory anywhere

65

00:03:59.880  -->  00:04:04.770
but I'm going to put it outside just so that you don't accidentally deleted we don't accidently mess

66

00:04:04.770  -->  00:04:06.220
with it at any point.

67

00:04:06.310  -->  00:04:12.090
So we're going to do that now and make directory data makes this a little bit bigger.

68

00:04:13.440  -->  00:04:19.710
And our clear everything and make sure we see the data directory and then I'm going to copy this line

69

00:04:21.420  -->  00:04:28.850
and paste that in and hit enter and then the very last thing is running.

70

00:04:28.850  -->  00:04:32.480
This line here just like that.

71

00:04:32.850  -->  00:04:34.050
OK.

72

00:04:34.190  -->  00:04:39.060
Now if we go back to the instructions you can see that we've finished the three commands that we needed

73

00:04:39.060  -->  00:04:40.150
to run.

74

00:04:40.380  -->  00:04:42.330
And now we have Mongo installed.

75

00:04:42.450  -->  00:04:48.750
So all we have left to do is actually start Mongo and we to start what is called the Mongo deman which

76

00:04:48.750  -->  00:04:53.430
is basically a process that is going to start Mongo and we're going to keep it running in the background

77

00:04:53.490  -->  00:04:55.670
for the rest of the course.

78

00:04:56.280  -->  00:05:03.150
And the command to do that looks like this dot slash Hmong God which is Mongo demon.

79

00:05:03.270  -->  00:05:05.100
So we'll go back.

80

00:05:05.100  -->  00:05:09.060
We need to run this in the directory where we see Man-God.

81

00:05:09.060  -->  00:05:13.700
It's the same directory where we installed data and then we'll just paste that commanded.

82

00:05:14.430  -->  00:05:16.540
And you should see a bunch of text.

83

00:05:17.010  -->  00:05:19.910
And this is the Mongo server that's now started.

84

00:05:20.070  -->  00:05:23.390
So it's a process that we started with this command right here.

85

00:05:23.760  -->  00:05:25.860
And then what we'll do is we'll leave this running.

86

00:05:25.860  -->  00:05:29.700
So I'm actually going to leave this tab open and make a new tab.

87

00:05:29.850  -->  00:05:35.280
You can do that here plus sign new terminal and this is where we'll work inside of it for most of the

88

00:05:35.280  -->  00:05:35.890
course.

89

00:05:35.940  -->  00:05:40.440
We won't touch this because we want our database to always be running so that we can always connect

90

00:05:40.440  -->  00:05:41.570
to it.

91

00:05:41.580  -->  00:05:42.980
So let's try it now.

92

00:05:43.130  -->  00:05:47.540
There's a simple test we can type the word Mongo and hit enter.

93

00:05:48.300  -->  00:05:53.140
And if our prompts changes which it does that means that everything's working just fine.

94

00:05:53.480  -->  00:05:59.250
And what we just did here by typing Mangu and hitting enter is we opened up the Mongo D.B shell or the

95

00:05:59.250  -->  00:06:05.460
Mongo console which is a place we can go to interact with our data to debug things just like the javascript

96

00:06:05.460  -->  00:06:08.910
console is a place we can debug but it's not where we actually work.

97

00:06:08.910  -->  00:06:10.690
Most of the time.

98

00:06:10.950  -->  00:06:12.590
So that's all we'll do for now.

99

00:06:12.600  -->  00:06:16.870
Make sure you have this Mongo daemon running in the background at all times.

100

00:06:16.920  -->  00:06:20.070
If it ever stops it gets accidently stopped it.

101

00:06:20.070  -->  00:06:22.140
I can just run that command again.

102

00:06:22.410  -->  00:06:26.470
But I do need to make sure I'm in the right directory where we created that data folder.

103

00:06:26.580  -->  00:06:30.620
So leave this running open up a new tab and that's it for now.

104

00:06:30.630  -->  00:06:34.890
In the next lesson I'm going to show you how you can start writing some Mongo code to interact with

105

00:06:34.890  -->  00:06:37.890
the database add things and remove them.

106

00:06:37.890  -->  00:06:39.040
Read them back out.

107

00:06:39.060  -->  00:06:40.410
All that fun stuff.

108

00:06:40.440  -->  00:06:41.390
All right I'll see you then.
