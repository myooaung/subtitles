00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:05,730
Welcome back in this unit I'm going to introduce a new tool called Bootstrap and I'm on the bootstrap

2

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:08,110
home page get bootstrapped dotcom.

3

00:00:08,330  -->  00:00:12,570
And I just want to take a few minutes in this intro video to explain what bootstrap is and why we're

4

00:00:12,570  -->  00:00:13,180
using it.

5

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:17,100
And then also to show you a few examples of sites that use bootstrap.

6

00:00:17,100  -->  00:00:20,350
So let's begin just by reading the official bootstrap blurb.

7

00:00:20,610  -->  00:00:26,550
Bootstrap is the most popular TMLC SS in javascript framework for developing responsive mobile first

8

00:00:26,550  -->  00:00:28,310
projects on the Web.

9

00:00:28,710  -->  00:00:30,460
Let's break that down a little bit.

10

00:00:30,480  -->  00:00:32,540
Bootstrap is extremely popular.

11

00:00:32,580  -->  00:00:37,830
In fact it's the most starred and forked repository on get hub which basically means that it has the

12

00:00:37,830  -->  00:00:43,410
most people using it the most people favor adding it on get help and all that bootstrap is is actually

13

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:47,550
a single file of success and a single file of javascript.

14

00:00:47,550  -->  00:00:52,080
Now there's a lot of C S S and a lot of javascript in those files but they're just two files and we

15

00:00:52,080  -->  00:00:54,180
can include them in our own application.

16

00:00:54,180  -->  00:00:59,280
Basically we take someone else's code and from Bootstrap we added into our own application and it helps

17

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:04,320
us make good looking sites that are responsive and it helps us make them fast without having to write

18

00:01:04,320  -->  00:01:05,950
a ton of our own code.

19

00:01:05,970  -->  00:01:08,760
There are two main reasons that I'm showing it to you in this course.

20

00:01:08,760  -->  00:01:10,890
The first is that it's very popular.

21

00:01:10,890  -->  00:01:11,850
Lots of places use it.

22

00:01:11,850  -->  00:01:15,560
Lots of companies lots of developers use it and it's just worth knowing.

23

00:01:15,690  -->  00:01:20,250
But the second is that it's going to help us make good looking Web sites pretty quickly in this course

24

00:01:20,250  -->  00:01:20,640
.

25

00:01:20,640  -->  00:01:25,080
So when we're learning back and stuff when we're focusing on Node and express and Mongo and mongoose

26

00:01:25,250  -->  00:01:30,750
and knee deep and all of this complex back and logic we can still make something that looks good without

27

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:36,480
having to devote an hour or two hour video to styling something we can plug bootstrap in and we can

28

00:01:36,480  -->  00:01:40,020
get things going in 10 15 minutes and we'll look pretty good.

29

00:01:40,020  -->  00:01:45,360
The next thing I'll do is give you a quick tour of the docks but bootstrap has famously good documentation

30

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:50,840
lots of good examples and they actually use bootstrap on this website which makes sense.

31

00:01:51,060  -->  00:01:57,090
So let's start by clicking on C Ss and that's it mentioned bootstrap is just a single CSSA file a single

32

00:01:57,090  -->  00:02:00,250
javascript file inside that CSSA file.

33

00:02:00,300  -->  00:02:02,560
There's a bunch of stuff that we get for free.

34

00:02:02,610  -->  00:02:05,420
So let's take a look at Buttons.

35

00:02:05,460  -->  00:02:10,890
So if we want to make a button and we have bootstrapped included in our application we can add this

36

00:02:10,890  -->  00:02:16,680
class to class is actually Beati and PTEN default and we get these buttons.

37

00:02:17,010  -->  00:02:18,840
We can do different colors.

38

00:02:19,470  -->  00:02:21,260
Let's take a look at forms.

39

00:02:21,360  -->  00:02:22,870
We get nice inputs here.

40

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:29,310
And it's also really important to note everything is responsive on the site so you can see we get things

41

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:31,890
that respond to the width of the screen.

42

00:02:32,250  -->  00:02:34,060
We also have different types of forms.

43

00:02:34,080  -->  00:02:35,680
You can combine the different pieces.

44

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:38,330
So here they're using a button with a form.

45

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:43,230
So it's like Lego pieces bootstrap and a lot of ways it's just have been of Lego pieces that you can

46

00:02:43,230  -->  00:02:46,660
put together and add to your site as you see fit.

47

00:02:46,740  -->  00:02:48,690
We'll be going over most of these components.

48

00:02:48,720  -->  00:02:53,800
Most of these big pieces once we start working with it and writing bootstrap code ourself.

49

00:02:54,270  -->  00:03:00,420
So for now we'll move on and when to show you the next tab which is components components contain some

50

00:03:00,420  -->  00:03:05,750
of the bigger pieces of bootstrap that we can use and that includes things like nav bars.

51

00:03:05,940  -->  00:03:11,520
And this is probably one of the most popular aspects of bootstrap that lots and lots of sites use as

52

00:03:11,520  -->  00:03:13,680
you can see with a little bit of code.

53

00:03:13,710  -->  00:03:18,450
It does look like a lot but I assure you it's a lot less than it would be if we were writing an NAV

54

00:03:18,450  -->  00:03:19,680
bar from scratch.

55

00:03:19,680  -->  00:03:26,880
And this comes with drop downs form and there are multiple types of bars different colors some that

56

00:03:26,880  -->  00:03:30,660
are fixed to the top of the page some that will scroll.

57

00:03:30,690  -->  00:03:36,200
There's other components like the Jumbotron which is a way of showcasing some content on your Web site

58

00:03:37,110  -->  00:03:38,390
progress bars.

59

00:03:38,670  -->  00:03:40,330
And these all come with bootstrap.

60

00:03:40,680  -->  00:03:45,750
So you might be wondering right now if bootstrap comes to all these pieces and they're already pre styled

61

00:03:46,040  -->  00:03:48,970
what every site that uses bootstrap looked the same.

62

00:03:49,320  -->  00:03:50,760
And the answer is yes and no.

63

00:03:50,760  -->  00:03:53,240
It depends on how the site uses bootstrap.

64

00:03:53,760  -->  00:03:58,440
I would argue that a company or a project that uses bootstrap well makes it hard to tell that they're

65

00:03:58,440  -->  00:04:03,390
actually using bootstrap because they use those main components and then you can go in and write your

66

00:04:03,390  -->  00:04:04,490
own styles on top.

67

00:04:04,500  -->  00:04:07,860
Change the colors change the fonts change some of the hover effects.

68

00:04:07,920  -->  00:04:13,290
You don't have to use the exact same colors and everything that come with bootstrap but that doesn't

69

00:04:13,290  -->  00:04:17,670
mean that there's anything inherently bad in using the built in Bootstrap styles either.

70

00:04:17,670  -->  00:04:19,080
And we'll definitely be doing both.

71

00:04:19,200  -->  00:04:23,580
So when we're making a site and a focus is not really on the front end we just want to make something

72

00:04:23,580  -->  00:04:25,290
that looks presentable quickly.

73

00:04:25,290  -->  00:04:30,310
Basically prototype front end will use bootstrap and we won't really modify many pieces.

74

00:04:30,780  -->  00:04:34,530
But then if we're working on something a little larger something that we don't want to look like we

75

00:04:34,530  -->  00:04:39,930
use bootstrap without changing anything at all then we'll go in and add some of our own styles basically

76

00:04:39,930  -->  00:04:42,580
add a coat of spray paint on top of bootstrap.

77

00:04:42,600  -->  00:04:47,250
The next thing I want to do is show you some of the sites that are built with bootstrap and Buddh trip

78

00:04:47,250  -->  00:04:50,740
actually has an official Web site where they showcase some of those sites.

79

00:04:50,970  -->  00:04:54,330
If you click on Expo I have it open already.

80

00:04:54,330  -->  00:04:59,730
You can see that they showcase beautiful and inspiring uses a bootstrap so we can open some of these

81

00:04:59,970  -->  00:05:01,890
to open them and new tabs.

82

00:05:02,270  -->  00:05:03,870
And these are just the most recent ones.

83

00:05:03,870  -->  00:05:05,390
There's hundreds on this site.

84

00:05:05,420  -->  00:05:11,400
You can see tons and tons of them and you can keep scrolling and scrolling and then we can go to a few

85

00:05:11,400  -->  00:05:14,660
older and there there's so many different sites that are using it.

86

00:05:15,000  -->  00:05:17,050
And they don't really all look the same.

87

00:05:17,610  -->  00:05:20,190
Yes maybe a lot of them have a nav bar.

88

00:05:20,190  -->  00:05:25,470
Maybe a lot of them have this full screen large image layout but that's more of a design trend than

89

00:05:25,470  -->  00:05:28,450
something that bootstrapped it purely responsible for.

90

00:05:28,980  -->  00:05:30,890
So let's take a look at some of these.

91

00:05:30,930  -->  00:05:36,400
This one is creative Tim which is a company that makes Web site templates actually.

92

00:05:36,630  -->  00:05:40,330
And you can see we have this nice grid of images.

93

00:05:40,500  -->  00:05:41,600
It's very responsive.

94

00:05:41,610  -->  00:05:46,710
If I shrink this down we get our little nav bar here.

95

00:05:46,920  -->  00:05:52,660
So this is a bootstrap component the way that everything is laid out in this grid.

96

00:05:52,890  -->  00:05:57,960
Bootstrap is partially responsible for that but you can also see that they're not using the default

97

00:05:58,010  -->  00:05:59,540
built in Bootstrap buttons.

98

00:05:59,580  -->  00:06:00,710
They've changed them.

99

00:06:00,780  -->  00:06:01,960
Things look different.

100

00:06:02,190  -->  00:06:06,130
So I think this is a really nice use of bootstrap that's a really nice looking site.

101

00:06:06,180  -->  00:06:12,170
It works well and it uses bootstrap but it doesn't rely on bootstrap 100 percent.

102

00:06:13,080  -->  00:06:15,120
Let's take a look at one or two more.

103

00:06:15,480  -->  00:06:19,640
So this one is called Indicus or indices something like that.

104

00:06:19,710  -->  00:06:24,200
Apparently they design and build digital products that people enjoy using.

105

00:06:24,240  -->  00:06:25,520
So let's scroll down here.

106

00:06:25,680  -->  00:06:26,980
Take a look at what we have.

107

00:06:27,270  -->  00:06:31,950
So there's some content that's probably built with the bootstrap grid system which helps organize and

108

00:06:31,950  -->  00:06:37,500
lay things out lay out as I've mentioned before is notoriously difficult in Pearcey SS.

109

00:06:37,560  -->  00:06:42,420
It's getting better but bootstrap is really really useful to help us lay things out on our application

110

00:06:42,420  -->  00:06:42,910
.

111

00:06:43,260  -->  00:06:49,380
And we have a little footer bar there's a nav bar up here so it's really fun to go to bootstrap Expo

112

00:06:49,610  -->  00:06:54,620
take some time to explore some of the projects that used to bootstrap and see how they use it and all

113

00:06:54,640  -->  00:06:59,970
the different ways that companies are modifying it adding in their own fonts their own colors and really

114

00:06:59,970  -->  00:07:05,160
figure out what are the core components that lots and lots of sites are using and why decide to use

115

00:07:05,170  -->  00:07:05,930
bootstrap.

116

00:07:06,170  -->  00:07:10,950
And in my opinion it really comes down to the grid system which we'll be devoting a video in this unit

117

00:07:10,950  -->  00:07:14,970
to and the nav bars and the responsiveness of everything.

118

00:07:15,420  -->  00:07:15,710
OK.

119

00:07:15,720  -->  00:07:20,230
So to wrap up I'm going to show you a simple site that we'll be making.

120

00:07:20,280  -->  00:07:23,110
This is our startup called heavy petting.

121

00:07:23,190  -->  00:07:28,200
It helps you find your perfect feline soulmate and it uses bootstrap.

122

00:07:28,200  -->  00:07:33,610
You can see we have a nav bar up here just like that we have sign up Morgan buttons.

123

00:07:33,630  -->  00:07:39,970
We get these little icons then we have our text here and the little tag line and then our button.

124

00:07:40,290  -->  00:07:46,880
And then as I resize things everything is responsive you can see things are moving around shifting around

125

00:07:46,890  -->  00:07:47,060
.

126

00:07:47,190  -->  00:07:52,660
And most importantly we get that little hamburger and we have a mobile friendly nav bar.

127

00:07:52,710  -->  00:07:57,780
So at the end of this unit we'll be working on creating this fake startup landing page that matches

128

00:07:57,960  -->  00:08:00,540
people and pets in romantic relationships
