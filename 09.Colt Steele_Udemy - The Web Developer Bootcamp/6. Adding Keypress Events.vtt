00:00:00.440  -->  00:00:00.840
OK.

2

00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:01.770
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01.770  -->  00:00:07.420
So as I mentioned in this video will actually start working on a pet attack clone here.

4

00:00:07.430  -->  00:00:13.220
So the first thing we want to do is figure out how to add a circle which we've actually already seen

5

00:00:13.680  -->  00:00:21.570
but we want to do a few things at a Circle when the user hits any key actually in my case I'm only doing

6

00:00:21.570  -->  00:00:23.520
it for her kids.

7

00:00:23.750  -->  00:00:25.730
It works the same way for any other key.

8

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:32.080
So when a user hits the key at a circle and then we also need to figure out the animation of that circle

9

00:00:32.090  -->  00:00:32.270
.

10

00:00:32.610  -->  00:00:36.200
And lastly we want to add that circle to a random coordinate.

11

00:00:36.330  -->  00:00:41.890
So to start we'll just hit a key and add a circle to the middle of the screen.

12

00:00:42.570  -->  00:00:50.610
So let's go to the paper japes docs and take a look at interaction and look at keyboard interaction

13

00:00:50.620  -->  00:00:51.070
.

14

00:00:51.690  -->  00:00:58.290
And I know it seems like well I didn't know where to look here but the first time I came here it took

15

00:00:58.290  -->  00:01:05.580
me a lot longer to find that I just went through most of these and searched for keyboard basically trying

16

00:01:05.580  -->  00:01:11.820
to say that most likely if I was doing this again by myself and I hadn't prepared for this video it

17

00:01:11.820  -->  00:01:16.920
would've taken me a lot longer to find that I might've done a search anyway so that's scroll down and

18

00:01:16.920  -->  00:01:18.810
just look at some of the examples.

19

00:01:18.840  -->  00:01:26.190
This first one quick here to focus and then press some keys and it tells you what key was pressed and

20

00:01:26.190  -->  00:01:27.910
when it was released as well.

21

00:01:28.350  -->  00:01:32.860
So right now I'm pressing K and then releasing it.

22

00:01:33.150  -->  00:01:38.450
And if you look at the code it's really easy just on key down and Anchia up.

23

00:01:38.520  -->  00:01:43.530
So it's not there's no document on at event listener there's no Jay queery event listeners behind the

24

00:01:43.530  -->  00:01:46.670
scenes there are documented at event listeners happening.

25

00:01:46.920  -->  00:01:52.680
But for paper script we just have to write this super simple line so we can take that actually just

26

00:01:52.680  -->  00:01:57.210
copy this will do key down for our app.

27

00:01:57.360  -->  00:01:59.070
We want the sound to play immediately.

28

00:01:59.070  -->  00:02:06.240
So as I press the key not when I am released thinking that's a little bit slower it's sort of like a

29

00:02:06.240  -->  00:02:12.090
piano that when you hit a piano or the noise the sound that is generated is generated right when you

30

00:02:12.090  -->  00:02:14.880
press the key or right afterwards not when you release.

31

00:02:15.240  -->  00:02:16.290
So Will do key down.

32

00:02:16.290  -->  00:02:21.440
I copied that and we'll start by just making a new circle so we need this code.

33

00:02:21.630  -->  00:02:24.310
But we just want one so we don't need the loops anymore.

34

00:02:24.390  -->  00:02:30.870
Get rid of that and we'll make that new circle on key down.

35

00:02:32.220  -->  00:02:38.430
So this process is pretty realistic where you're taking different pieces and you're just kind of fitting

36

00:02:38.430  -->  00:02:39.360
them together.

37

00:02:39.810  -->  00:02:42.440
So I found this in the docs on key down.

38

00:02:42.840  -->  00:02:43.730
You can get rid of that.

39

00:02:43.860  -->  00:02:49.940
And I found this in the docs as well and we do need to change this X and Y aren't defined.

40

00:02:50.010  -->  00:02:55.410
So let's just do it at 100 comma 100 and let's make Phil color orange.

41

00:02:55.740  -->  00:02:58.380
So on down run this code.

42

00:02:59.280  -->  00:03:04.410
And again it's very different than what we've seen or we have documented an event listener.

43

00:03:04.410  -->  00:03:07.260
And then we would have to add in some element.

44

00:03:07.410  -->  00:03:19.470
So we'd have to do like document dot query selector some element like a div dot add event listener and

45

00:03:19.470  -->  00:03:23.300
then we'd have to tell it click or key press or key up.

46

00:03:23.400  -->  00:03:25.160
It's a lot more code.

47

00:03:25.290  -->  00:03:28.950
This is done for us with Paperchase really simple.

48

00:03:29.010  -->  00:03:32.070
So on key down let's see what happens.

49

00:03:32.310  -->  00:03:37.650
I'm going to press the key and we end up with a circle and every time I press 1 I do get another circle

50

00:03:37.650  -->  00:03:37.710
.

51

00:03:37.710  -->  00:03:39.210
You just can't see it.

52

00:03:39.690  -->  00:03:45.270
So now let's work on this so that we are adding a circle to a random place on the screen.

53

00:03:45.720  -->  00:03:52.140
And the way that we do that actually took me a little bit of work to find that we could do it ourselves

54

00:03:52.380  -->  00:04:01.120
where we generate two numbers basically from zero all the way up until the maximum width of our screen

55

00:04:01.800  -->  00:04:06.170
and then the other number from zero up until the maximum height of our screen.

56

00:04:06.570  -->  00:04:12.270
And that's not too much work but we do have to figure out the width and height and the dimensions which

57

00:04:12.270  -->  00:04:19.180
if you go to Paperchase and if we look at where you reference.

58

00:04:20.010  -->  00:04:23.220
And then when that's open look in view.

59

00:04:23.550  -->  00:04:27.080
And again I just found this a few days ago I took a little bit.

60

00:04:27.090  -->  00:04:35.040
But if we look at you and we look at bounds and or maybe it's size the size of the visible area and

61

00:04:35.040  -->  00:04:36.390
project coordinates.

62

00:04:36.390  -->  00:04:46.860
So if we did something like consul that log view size which again I just found here and refresh the

63

00:04:46.860  -->  00:04:56.240
page and see what we get we get height and width so we can take that height and width.

64

00:04:56.380  -->  00:05:05.290
So you're not size dot height and then cancel that log you that size start with and we could use that

65

00:05:06.030  -->  00:05:09.370
refresh and I prosequi.

66

00:05:10.020  -->  00:05:16.880
Currently the view that size is six hundred ninety two by seven hundred.

67

00:05:17.100  -->  00:05:20.700
But if I resize it you'll see that changes next time.

68

00:05:20.730  -->  00:05:21.930
Persecutee.

69

00:05:22.240  -->  00:05:26.430
So we can use that to generate those two points that we need.

70

00:05:26.640  -->  00:05:32.770
But the other thing that we can do is there's actually a built in method that I found that will make

71

00:05:32.760  -->  00:05:38.570
us a random points so I'll show you that as well.

72

00:05:38.580  -->  00:05:46.890
So rather than having to do math at random which gives us something between 1 0 and 1 non-inclusive

73

00:05:47.150  -->  00:05:50.340
and then we have to multiply that and shift it up or down.

74

00:05:50.380  -->  00:05:51.960
It's kind of kind of a pain.

75

00:05:52.170  -->  00:05:58.500
So what we'll do instead is use this nice paper J S way that I found looks like this.

76

00:05:58.500  -->  00:06:07.680
So I'll make a maximum points so the maximum point that we can add a circle to is going to be new point

77

00:06:08.340  -->  00:06:10.170
view dot size.

78

00:06:10.560  -->  00:06:15.700
And then we want with comma that size dot height.

79

00:06:15.720  -->  00:06:19.400
So x and y are maximum X or maximum y.

80

00:06:20.160  -->  00:06:25.740
So that makes our max points and I'll show you if we do a constant alt log Max point

81

00:06:30.900  -->  00:06:31.560
there we go

82

00:06:34.440  -->  00:06:42.450
and let's actually add our circle to max point.

83

00:06:42.720  -->  00:06:47.720
So instead of making a new point here at 100 Kamo 100 we'll just give it Max point.

84

00:06:47.940  -->  00:06:48.510
OK.

85

00:06:48.900  -->  00:06:54.350
So let's try that out now and get rid of those to refresh the page.

86

00:06:54.510  -->  00:06:55.870
I hit a key.

87

00:06:55.950  -->  00:06:58.580
See we get one right down here in the bottom right corner.

88

00:06:58.590  -->  00:07:06.390
And if I resize and do it again and I hit a key we now get our maximum point right here.

89

00:07:06.390  -->  00:07:14.250
So this is nice because as that window changes as the the visible area on this canvas changes our maximum

90

00:07:14.250  -->  00:07:19.890
point changes so we're not always generating a random number between you know our screen dimensions

91

00:07:20.010  -->  00:07:25.540
or even the window size because as soon as the visible area it's not even the entire window but just

92

00:07:25.530  -->  00:07:29.940
the visible area on the canvas changes our maximum point changes.

93

00:07:30.250  -->  00:07:32.740
OK so we have that.

94

00:07:33.150  -->  00:07:39.540
Now what we want to do is take that maximum point and we're going to generate a random point.

95

00:07:39.660  -->  00:07:46.810
So we'll just call it random point and there's a method point dot random and that will give us a random

96

00:07:46.800  -->  00:07:53.090
point between 0 and 1 non-inclusive just like mascot Rande except with one line.

97

00:07:53.130  -->  00:07:54.960
We get a point object.

98

00:07:55.480  -->  00:07:56.520
So it's basically doing this.

99

00:07:56.520  -->  00:08:07.470
New points math dot random comma math dot random and then we want to take that make another variable

100

00:08:07.590  -->  00:08:19.060
that we'll call just point and it's equal to max points times random point just like that.

101

00:08:19.120  -->  00:08:21.970
So we're multiplying those two points together.

102

00:08:22.650  -->  00:08:32.310
It's kind of a lot of weird math but basically we're generating a point between 0 0 and 1 1 but technically

103

00:08:32.310  -->  00:08:36.770
it would be point 9 9 9 9 and so on.

104

00:08:36.880  -->  00:08:45.640
So let's say we generate a point as point five point five then the next thing that we do is we have

105

00:08:45.630  -->  00:08:50.500
our max point which will always be the very maximum that we could make.

106

00:08:50.550  -->  00:09:01.530
So something like 12 80 by 720 or whatever our window size is 600 by 300 and then we multiply them together

107

00:09:01.870  -->  00:09:08.980
and we end up with a new point that is in this case 300 comma 150.

108

00:09:09.000  -->  00:09:15.000
So this is how we can generate a max or a random point that exists on the viewable area.

109

00:09:15.010  -->  00:09:17.550
Are they currently visible area of the canvas.

110

00:09:17.830  -->  00:09:23.660
OK so now let's just change this so that it goes to points.

111

00:09:24.900  -->  00:09:26.960
Let's take a look now refresh.

112

00:09:26.980  -->  00:09:29.780
Hit any key and we end up with random circles.

113

00:09:29.790  -->  00:09:31.750
Every time you press a key.

114

00:09:32.340  -->  00:09:33.670
Whoops.

115

00:09:34.140  -->  00:09:38.650
And if I resize the window let's make it halfway across.

116

00:09:39.720  -->  00:09:42.970
Every time I press the key we still see it.

117

00:09:43.000  -->  00:09:47.730
So it's not generating points over here anymore which is nice.

118

00:09:47.760  -->  00:09:56.290
So that if the window happens to resize the user doesn't have to refresh to get new a new visible area

119

00:09:56.380  -->  00:09:59.030
to get kind of calculated numbers.

120

00:09:59.350  -->  00:09:59.850
Okay great.

121

00:09:59.860  -->  00:10:04.770
So that's how we generate a circle which you already see in but it's how we generate a circle when the

122

00:10:04.770  -->  00:10:06.870
user hits a key any key.

123

00:10:07.200  -->  00:10:11.000
And we talked about how to make a random point in the next video.

124

00:10:11.080  -->  00:10:16.740
We'll see how we can do some simple animations by first changing the colors of these points and having

125

00:10:16.750  -->  00:10:19.060
them fade to different hues different colors.

126

00:10:19.170  -->  00:10:21.450
And then also by shrinking them down.

127

00:10:21.580  -->  00:10:25.220
So we'll see that the next video and then we'll go back and add in sound.

128

00:10:25.330  -->  00:10:26.040
In the last video
