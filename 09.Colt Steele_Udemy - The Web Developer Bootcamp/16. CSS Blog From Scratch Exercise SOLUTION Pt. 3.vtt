00:00:00.780  -->  00:00:06.390
So next up let's go ahead and just duplicate this markup which is all I did here.

2

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:12.690
I did use slightly different words slightly different bacon ipsum between these paragraphs.

3

00:00:12.810  -->  00:00:19.310
So I'll just copy these two over into the h t m l But again that's not the focus here.

4

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:26.340
So what we want again make sure let's just take this from scratch so it's div class equals posts.

5

00:00:26.850  -->  00:00:32.880
And some of you might be wondering why I even bothered putting div a div with class equals post around

6

00:00:32.880  -->  00:00:33.870
everything.

7

00:00:33.900  -->  00:00:35.710
This would work fine without that.

8

00:00:35.820  -->  00:00:37.880
It's really just about grouping things together.

9

00:00:38.100  -->  00:00:42.810
I'd rather than having one giant mess where one blog post bleeds into another.

10

00:00:42.810  -->  00:00:48.570
I like to have things contained a little bit so that I know this is one post and it ends right here

11

00:00:49.020  -->  00:00:52.910
so it's more just about in my opinion keeping the code a little bit clean.

12

00:00:53.340  -->  00:01:05.530
So then we wanted to have a div called date or classical date and that date is December 11 2015.

13

00:01:05.820  -->  00:01:07.750
Save that.

14

00:01:07.830  -->  00:01:12.640
Then we had an H2 and that H-2.

15

00:01:12.720  -->  00:01:18.510
This is another article which is another terrible article.

16

00:01:18.840  -->  00:01:19.950
Don't recommend that you read it.

17

00:01:19.950  -->  00:01:21.490
It's just about bacon.

18

00:01:21.780  -->  00:01:25.500
So I'm just going to go ahead and copy this quote again.

19

00:01:25.830  -->  00:01:26.990
Which is a paragraph.

20

00:01:27.060  -->  00:01:30.490
Class equals quote paste that in.

21

00:01:30.630  -->  00:01:32.870
And then we have two more paragraphs here.

22

00:01:33.130  -->  00:01:40.800
One and finally the last bit of markup that we need.

23

00:01:40.800  -->  00:01:42.000
The second paragraph.

24

00:01:42.000  -->  00:01:43.950
There we go.

25

00:01:44.640  -->  00:01:49.000
So let's see how this looks.

26

00:01:49.080  -->  00:01:54.910
So one thing I'm noticing is that we have a little less spacing between the posts here.

27

00:01:54.960  -->  00:01:56.760
So this one just runs into this.

28

00:01:56.760  -->  00:02:02.670
The date December 11th we definitely want a little spacing there as we can see in the left part of that

29

00:02:02.670  -->  00:02:05.220
could be because the HRR that we're missing.

30

00:02:05.220  -->  00:02:09.020
Although I think what we need to do is just add in some margin between the blog posts.

31

00:02:09.150  -->  00:02:11.780
So let's start by getting this h r in.

32

00:02:12.570  -->  00:02:15.690
So we haven't actually seen the H R element really in practice.

33

00:02:15.690  -->  00:02:19.410
It's a very simple one to use just looks like this.

34

00:02:19.410  -->  00:02:24.810
It's actually self-closing doesn't take anything it's it doesn't have any closing tag or any inner content

35

00:02:24.960  -->  00:02:27.540
just a char horizontal rule.

36

00:02:27.540  -->  00:02:30.200
If we refresh what you'll see.

37

00:02:30.210  -->  00:02:35.940
So that gives us this line going across and that ordinarily is fine.

38

00:02:35.940  -->  00:02:40.830
Most people though like to style these a little bit so this one is really faint.

39

00:02:40.950  -->  00:02:46.710
I don't know if you can tell but it's basically getting a little thicker and then trailing off on the

40

00:02:46.710  -->  00:02:52.310
edges and there are some great resources and things on line that you can use to style any char.

41

00:02:52.410  -->  00:02:57.960
And the reason they added this in here is that I wanted to force you to look something up and to try

42

00:02:58.530  -->  00:03:00.840
to find some styles that you didn't write yourself.

43

00:03:00.840  -->  00:03:04.830
So I'm going to show you exactly what I would do to find some H R styles.

44

00:03:04.830  -->  00:03:09.170
I would just Google HDR style and see what we get.

45

00:03:09.390  -->  00:03:13.320
And you can see I've actually clicked on two of them before.

46

00:03:13.890  -->  00:03:20.280
So we've got simple styles for each jars and you can see there's a few options here.

47

00:03:20.460  -->  00:03:23.290
So they think this is the one that I went with right here.

48

00:03:23.550  -->  00:03:25.980
But let's just try one like this.

49

00:03:25.980  -->  00:03:31.440
Click on code and all we have to do is copy these.

50

00:03:31.440  -->  00:03:36.780
These are two styles and copy this down and we don't.

51

00:03:36.900  -->  00:03:41.970
I don't want to think that you need to understand every line here because this is some some stuff that

52

00:03:42.180  -->  00:03:45.460
is pretty advanced and kind of hacky as you can see this person says.

53

00:03:45.480  -->  00:03:50.280
Not really supposed to work but does the only thing that we want to do is make sure that these are going

54

00:03:50.280  -->  00:03:56.910
to be selecting our H R and so what this is doing is letting HRO with class of style 7 which we don't

55

00:03:56.910  -->  00:03:57.600
have.

56

00:03:57.870  -->  00:03:59.760
So let's just select a char

57

00:04:04.020  -->  00:04:06.670
and let's just see what this looks like.

58

00:04:06.690  -->  00:04:08.120
Refresh the page.

59

00:04:08.150  -->  00:04:09.270
OK so there we go.

60

00:04:09.360  -->  00:04:11.400
So I personally don't care for that one.

61

00:04:11.430  -->  00:04:14.700
I'm going to use this one here that kind of trails off.

62

00:04:14.700  -->  00:04:17.240
Feel free to do whatever you'd like and play around with it.

63

00:04:17.610  -->  00:04:23.280
But again the point was that I wanted you to try and find something external that you didn't write and

64

00:04:23.280  -->  00:04:25.420
I want to show you that it's totally fine to do that.

65

00:04:25.560  -->  00:04:27.100
So I'm just copying this in.

66

00:04:27.270  -->  00:04:29.220
I didn't write this.

67

00:04:29.500  -->  00:04:34.520
Need to get rid of these styles here and put this in.

68

00:04:35.400  -->  00:04:42.870
So all they're doing is looks it looks like they're setting a border on the HRO so no border height

69

00:04:43.200  -->  00:04:46.370
which is just one pixel and then this background image which is a gradient.

70

00:04:46.550  -->  00:04:48.870
And so that's how they get that gradient effect.

71

00:04:48.870  -->  00:04:51.970
So if we refresh Now there you go.

72

00:04:52.110  -->  00:04:55.710
We have this nice gradient effect here and if we wanted to.

73

00:04:55.710  -->  00:04:59.530
I actually prefer this one so I'm just going to go ahead and keep this one.

74

00:04:59.760  -->  00:05:00.350
Over this.

75

00:05:00.350  -->  00:05:05.380
I might change the color a little bit so that it's a lighter gray but let's just keep that for now.

76

00:05:05.580  -->  00:05:11.250
But we still have this problem which is our our next blog post is starting too soon and we need to add

77

00:05:11.250  -->  00:05:13.090
some space there.

78

00:05:13.410  -->  00:05:17.940
So all that we need to do is add a little bit of a margin.

79

00:05:18.360  -->  00:05:25.680
So this is actually a nice a nice coincidence that we have this blog post wrapper around every post

80

00:05:25.950  -->  00:05:31.090
because we can just add a margin to the bottom of each post so that will add space here.

81

00:05:32.220  -->  00:05:34.210
So all we need to do is select.

82

00:05:34.230  -->  00:05:36.560
Let me just show you the class post.

83

00:05:36.630  -->  00:05:37.810
That's one post.

84

00:05:38.160  -->  00:05:39.580
So then we're just going here.

85

00:05:39.670  -->  00:05:50.370
It's like post margin and let's do 20 pixels and not just margin.

86

00:05:50.490  -->  00:05:59.600
Let's just do it on the bottom so only March and bottom refresh and that's looking pretty close.

87

00:06:00.210  -->  00:06:06.000
So the last little issue here is that we have a little bit more space over here than we do here and

88

00:06:06.000  -->  00:06:13.050
that's because this or that we added is actually outside of the post class so it's not being affected

89

00:06:13.050  -->  00:06:15.140
by that margin that we added in.

90

00:06:15.150  -->  00:06:19.490
So if we did that we just move the A char.

91

00:06:19.500  -->  00:06:20.160
Where is that.

92

00:06:20.160  -->  00:06:25.510
Here we go to the bottom of the post and we are fresh.

93

00:06:25.590  -->  00:06:27.960
You can see if we get the spacing that we want it.

94

00:06:28.600  -->  00:06:36.210
OK so if we wanted to experiment and get this exact one we would just go back to that H.R. styles and

95

00:06:36.300  -->  00:06:37.730
try some of the other ones.

96

00:06:37.890  -->  00:06:41.970
But what I really want to show again is that we can incorporate other styles in.

97

00:06:42.010  -->  00:06:46.770
We don't really have to know exactly how they work although it's a good idea to be curious and to try

98

00:06:46.770  -->  00:06:48.080
and figure it out.

99

00:06:48.930  -->  00:06:53.790
So hopefully you enjoyed making this project to nice simple minimal blog and for now.

100

00:06:53.790  -->  00:06:56.430
Obviously it doesn't actually function as a blog.

101

00:06:56.430  -->  00:07:01.390
There are no comments we can't add in a new post with any sort of interface.

102

00:07:01.470  -->  00:07:06.600
We have to actually edit the aged him out ourself but when we get to javascript and when in particular

103

00:07:06.600  -->  00:07:11.670
and we get to the back end and we have a database and we have a server going in a framework called Express

104

00:07:12.050  -->  00:07:17.610
we actually going to take this blog and turn it into a real blog where we can add a post using a form

105

00:07:17.970  -->  00:07:20.840
we can comment and we can do some other things like vote.

106

00:07:21.060  -->  00:07:22.410
So that's going to be really exciting.

107

00:07:22.410  -->  00:07:24.350
We'll use this assess it.

108

00:07:24.360  -->  00:07:28.540
It's relatively nice looking for relatively few lines.

109

00:07:29.040  -->  00:07:31.200
OK I'll see you when we cover javascript
