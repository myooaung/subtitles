00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:01.520
All right.

2

00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:07.050
So in the next few videos we're going to focus on each team all forms so forms are how we get input

3

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:14.010
from a user whether it's to sign up for a page to comment on a photo to upload a photo to pick a color

4

00:00:14.010  -->  00:00:14.910
to pick a date.

5

00:00:14.940  -->  00:00:19.650
There's so many different things to do with forms and it's actually relatively simple and edged him

6

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:19.840
out.

7

00:00:19.840  -->  00:00:23.450
There's just two important elements that we're going to learn about here.

8

00:00:24.270  -->  00:00:30.840
So we're going to focus on the form tag the input tag the label tag and then we're also going to finish

9

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:36.600
up by learning about validations for our data how do we make sure someone fills in part of reform.

10

00:00:36.600  -->  00:00:41.860
Someone cannot leave our password blank or email blank or something like that.

11

00:00:41.910  -->  00:00:46.900
So to start let's just take a quick survey of some of the forms you encounter in day to day life.

12

00:00:46.980  -->  00:00:51.330
So I have some images here from sites like Twitter Facebook Google.

13

00:00:51.690  -->  00:00:54.280
Let's take a look and break some of these down.

14

00:00:54.300  -->  00:00:57.420
So here's the log in form for Facebook.

15

00:00:57.600  -->  00:01:03.530
We have a place where we can type some text in the text and put another input where we type passwords

16

00:01:03.530  -->  00:01:04.050
in.

17

00:01:04.140  -->  00:01:07.920
Most likely when you type your password there it's dotted down so you don't actually see the password

18

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:08.190
.

19

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:09.990
And then a checkbox.

20

00:01:10.260  -->  00:01:14.500
And when we click this button it submits this entire thing.

21

00:01:14.640  -->  00:01:16.160
So it groups these together.

22

00:01:16.290  -->  00:01:20.370
We don't have one button for email one button for password one button for the check box.

23

00:01:20.370  -->  00:01:22.110
It all goes at once.

24

00:01:22.110  -->  00:01:23.910
Same thing here when we sign up.

25

00:01:23.910  -->  00:01:29.560
We've got more inputs five different text inputs three different dropdown menus.

26

00:01:29.580  -->  00:01:33.790
These are called select tags and then two things called radio buttons.

27

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:39.900
And then finally a sign up button that it's going to take all of this and send it somewhere for Facebook

28

00:01:39.900  -->  00:01:40.760
to use.

29

00:01:41.100  -->  00:01:48.210
So what we're going to learn today is the foreign tag and these forms are going to be a little bit dumb

30

00:01:48.210  -->  00:01:48.450
.

31

00:01:48.450  -->  00:01:51.730
They're not going to actually do anything.

32

00:01:51.870  -->  00:01:53.940
We need to actually have a backend set up.

33

00:01:53.950  -->  00:01:58.050
We need a database we need some logic and some back end code to do anything with the form.

34

00:01:58.050  -->  00:02:02.450
So for now they're just going to look like this will be able to recreate this.

35

00:02:02.640  -->  00:02:08.340
But when you click sign up or you click log in or you search on google our forums are actually going

36

00:02:08.340  -->  00:02:09.790
to do any of that logic.

37

00:02:10.110  -->  00:02:13.550
They're just going to be the front end user facing part of things.

38

00:02:13.950  -->  00:02:15.780
So the first thing is the forum tag.

39

00:02:16.080  -->  00:02:22.920
So the forum tag is basically a shell or a container for all of these different types of inputs.

40

00:02:22.920  -->  00:02:26.710
So this is one forum tag around all of this.

41

00:02:26.910  -->  00:02:30.570
This might be one form tag around all of these and so on.

42

00:02:30.570  -->  00:02:36.030
Here's another form tag by just making a forum tag you don't actually see anything on the page.

43

00:02:36.240  -->  00:02:38.270
We'll see that in just a second.

44

00:02:38.280  -->  00:02:41.630
Basically it's just a container and we put all of our different inputs in there.

45

00:02:41.640  -->  00:02:47.540
So checkboxes and buttons and dropped on menus and colored pictures all go inside of a formed egg.

46

00:02:48.090  -->  00:02:52.320
So there are two important attributes will be spending some more time with this when we get to backend

47

00:02:52.360  -->  00:02:52.560
.

48

00:02:52.770  -->  00:02:58.410
So try not to get hung up on exactly how this works but a form is going to send a request somewhere

49

00:02:58.410  -->  00:03:01.980
it sends data from the form to a server somewhere.

50

00:03:02.040  -->  00:03:06.840
So the first part action is going to specify where to send the data.

51

00:03:07.320  -->  00:03:08.550
Is it going to Google.

52

00:03:08.580  -->  00:03:13.830
Is he going to sign up page is it going to are sign out we're going to learn a lot more about how we

53

00:03:13.830  -->  00:03:16.570
actually do that on the back end section of this class.

54

00:03:16.800  -->  00:03:21.180
And then the second part is what type of HSDPA request to send.

55

00:03:21.780  -->  00:03:25.230
So we could send a get request or we could send a post request.

56

00:03:25.800  -->  00:03:28.930
And again this is another thing we're going to spend a lot lot more time on.

57

00:03:29.130  -->  00:03:35.220
But the simple generalized version we make a get request when we're doing something like searching or

58

00:03:35.220  -->  00:03:41.280
retrieving data we're trying to get information and we make a post request when we're sending data that

59

00:03:41.280  -->  00:03:45.770
we want to be added to a database posted to a server.

60

00:03:45.780  -->  00:03:52.440
So in these examples this here when you search on Google you hit enter or you click and search that's

61

00:03:52.440  -->  00:03:54.070
going to make a request.

62

00:03:54.180  -->  00:03:56.160
It's not actually adding anything to the database.

63

00:03:56.160  -->  00:03:57.770
It's not changing anything.

64

00:03:57.840  -->  00:04:00.630
It's purely just getting data back searching.

65

00:04:00.710  -->  00:04:03.070
It's getting data it's a get request.

66

00:04:03.450  -->  00:04:08.420
These here though to sign up for Facebook or sign up for Twitter.

67

00:04:08.460  -->  00:04:14.040
Those are going to be post requests when you typed in data and you click sign up it takes your data

68

00:04:14.340  -->  00:04:17.370
and actually adds it to Twitter's database.

69

00:04:17.370  -->  00:04:21.860
So again we're going to actually work on that quite a bit later in this class.

70

00:04:21.990  -->  00:04:26.440
So for now just be familiar with action and method and the fact that they exist.

71

00:04:26.640  -->  00:04:30.480
So the input tag is what actually goes inside of our forms.

72

00:04:30.600  -->  00:04:37.020
It's what's going to create the different inputs that we see here a text input a password input a radio

73

00:04:37.020  -->  00:04:38.120
button.

74

00:04:38.190  -->  00:04:40.020
It doesn't actually create a dropdown menu.

75

00:04:40.020  -->  00:04:45.360
So we'll talk about that in the later exercise but it creates all sorts of different inputs for user

76

00:04:45.360  -->  00:04:46.580
input.

77

00:04:46.620  -->  00:04:48.840
So I have a few examples here.

78

00:04:48.900  -->  00:04:53.130
They're all exactly the same except for this type attribute.

79

00:04:53.310  -->  00:04:57.210
So if type equals text we get a text box type equals date.

80

00:04:57.290  -->  00:04:59.970
You get this little date picker type equals color.

81

00:05:00.270  -->  00:05:04.230
You get a color picker Eiffel's file we get a file picker type Pickle's checkbox.

82

00:05:04.260  -->  00:05:05.680
We get a checkbox.

83

00:05:05.850  -->  00:05:11.110
So I'm actually going to pull up endian and search for input.

84

00:05:11.110  -->  00:05:18.660
And as I do that you'll see as I scroll down to attributes under type there's a list of all the possible

85

00:05:18.660  -->  00:05:20.970
types that we can specify.

86

00:05:21.550  -->  00:05:23.440
And there's about 30 or 40 of them here.

87

00:05:23.790  -->  00:05:27.800
And to be honest there's a lot on here that you probably will never need to use.

88

00:05:28.110  -->  00:05:30.810
But there are a few that you use all the time.

89

00:05:30.810  -->  00:05:32.660
And so we're going to really focus on those.

90

00:05:32.700  -->  00:05:40.410
Those are things like text email password date button submit then some of the other ones like color

91

00:05:40.410  -->  00:05:40.750
.

92

00:05:41.040  -->  00:05:43.830
You may not use very often at all.

93

00:05:43.830  -->  00:05:46.120
I definitely wish we had more chances to do color pictures.

94

00:05:46.130  -->  00:05:50.910
It's my favorite of the inputs but I want you to be aware that there's a lot of different choices here

95

00:05:50.910  -->  00:05:53.820
.

96

00:05:53.820  -->  00:05:59.060
So then to make a form we just take a form tag and we fill it with some input tags.

97

00:05:59.160  -->  00:06:00.960
So here's a really simple example.

98

00:06:00.960  -->  00:06:02.230
We have two inputs.

99

00:06:02.360  -->  00:06:06.830
Equals text type Pickle's password and it makes us this nice form here.

100

00:06:07.140  -->  00:06:12.190
And you can see as we fill out this first type equals text it just looks like regular text.

101

00:06:12.280  -->  00:06:17.550
And as we fill out the type equals password it gives just those dotted the hidden password fields.
