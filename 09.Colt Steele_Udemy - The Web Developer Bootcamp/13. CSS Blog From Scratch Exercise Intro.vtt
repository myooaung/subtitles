00:00:00.730  -->  00:00:05.820
All right so it's time for another exercise and that's you can see here we're going to build a simple

2

00:00:05.880  -->  00:00:07.450
minimalist blog site.

3

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:12.930
And this exercise is really going to focus on pretty much everything we've covered but it's really going

4

00:00:12.930  -->  00:00:19.110
to hit on a lot of the box model things so padding and margin and borders as well as type polygraphy

5

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:21.920
getting a new Google font and a few other things.

6

00:00:22.080  -->  00:00:25.050
So we're going to build this I'm going to give you a few instructions.

7

00:00:25.050  -->  00:00:30.120
If you do want to attempt it on your own first and then we're going to go over it as always starting

8

00:00:30.120  -->  00:00:31.890
from scratch in the next video.

9

00:00:32.430  -->  00:00:34.020
So I'll give you some hints.

10

00:00:34.020  -->  00:00:37.200
The first thing you'll probably notice is this gray box.

11

00:00:37.860  -->  00:00:44.850
And that's actually a border that's around the body so the body has this 20 pixel border that goes all

12

00:00:44.850  -->  00:00:45.470
the way around it.

13

00:00:45.480  -->  00:00:50.670
And so that means that the body has an explicit with that it's not going all the way across the screen

14

00:00:50.700  -->  00:00:52.900
but it goes from here to there.

15

00:00:53.310  -->  00:00:57.790
So another thing that I'll mention here are some of the colors.

16

00:00:58.440  -->  00:01:00.730
So you don't have to guess the colors.

17

00:01:00.750  -->  00:01:05.370
It would be a good exercise for you to actually use a color picker and try and find this out on your

18

00:01:05.370  -->  00:01:05.920
own.

19

00:01:06.270  -->  00:01:11.640
But because I'm not sure how how the quality will be carried over through video and that will change

20

00:01:11.640  -->  00:01:12.450
some things.

21

00:01:12.480  -->  00:01:16.340
I'm just going to give you the colors so I have them typed up here.

22

00:01:16.560  -->  00:01:21.510
You can refer back to these or you can feel free to use your own colors but the border color around

23

00:01:21.510  -->  00:01:24.500
the body here is this shade of gray.

24

00:01:24.630  -->  00:01:28.720
The date color this blue and this is this shade of blue here.

25

00:01:28.920  -->  00:01:34.300
And then the heading color for the blog titles is this shade of bluish gray.

26

00:01:34.740  -->  00:01:40.160
And then one other thing is that you'll need to have a font included here and this font.

27

00:01:40.380  -->  00:01:43.410
I definitely would not expect you just to guess off the top of your head.

28

00:01:43.410  -->  00:01:50.280
It's called Source sense pro and it's available on Google fonts so you'll have to go on Google fonts

29

00:01:50.280  -->  00:01:50.520
.

30

00:01:50.730  -->  00:01:51.950
Download it.

31

00:01:51.950  -->  00:01:52.600
Include it.

32

00:01:52.600  -->  00:01:56.830
We have to download it but include it correctly in your aged him out or your CSSA file.

33

00:01:57.180  -->  00:02:00.760
So a few other things this blockquote right here.

34

00:02:01.170  -->  00:02:04.650
This effect is just a left border that's been turned on.

35

00:02:04.800  -->  00:02:07.580
So it's the same gray color as we have here it's just thinner.

36

00:02:07.680  -->  00:02:09.410
So that's aleft border.

37

00:02:09.570  -->  00:02:14.190
One thing I need to pay attention attention to is making sure these are all aligned exactly the same

38

00:02:14.190  -->  00:02:15.060
.

39

00:02:15.060  -->  00:02:19.410
Notice there's a little margin or padding or something here.

40

00:02:19.410  -->  00:02:25.410
The next thing that I'll point out here is that the date is in all caps.

41

00:02:25.560  -->  00:02:27.600
So there's a way to do that with your success.

42

00:02:27.660  -->  00:02:28.730
Make it uppercase.

43

00:02:29.070  -->  00:02:33.720
And also that there's a little bit of letter spacing here.

44

00:02:33.720  -->  00:02:37.790
So this is not in the normal letter spacing they're spaced a little further apart.

45

00:02:38.400  -->  00:02:41.900
And then one last thing in between the posts.

46

00:02:41.910  -->  00:02:47.370
There's this line and this is an H R element stands for a horizontal rule.

47

00:02:47.370  -->  00:02:53.100
And so you can add an H R in and as far as styling this to get this thin line that kind of shrinks down

48

00:02:53.100  -->  00:02:53.590
.

49

00:02:53.820  -->  00:02:54.910
I found something online.

50

00:02:54.930  -->  00:02:56.560
I'm just going to show it to you in the next video.

51

00:02:56.670  -->  00:03:03.030
But just research our styles and there are so many great articles and code pens that you can just copy

52

00:03:03.030  -->  00:03:03.950
one of.

53

00:03:04.020  -->  00:03:08.490
So I don't expect you to get this just right other than that.

54

00:03:08.640  -->  00:03:11.580
Feel free to use any text that you want.

55

00:03:11.670  -->  00:03:15.720
I used I think this is bacon ipsum but put any text you want.

56

00:03:15.720  -->  00:03:20.460
Feel free to have more than two posts and then also go crazy with colors and fonts and make it your

57

00:03:20.460  -->  00:03:20.990
own.

58

00:03:21.330  -->  00:03:22.730
OK so I'll see you in the next video.

59

00:03:22.740  -->  00:03:23.960
We'll start from scratch.
