00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,850
Welcome back in the previous lecture I mentioned that we can actually visualize tokenization with the

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,690
built in display see that comes with Spacey.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,560
Let's go ahead and show you how it works by jumping back to the notebook or we left off last time.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:19,790
OK.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,080
Here we are at the notebook where we left off last time.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,940
Well we're going to do is say from Spacey import and we're going to say this.

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,790
Blazey it's just a funny pun on display.

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,850
So the Spacey is the actual built in visualizer.

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,050
It's really cool.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,240
And what's awesome is you can run it both inside the notebook if you're using Jupiter notebook or you

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,680
can create a little server if you're running stuff outside of Jupiter using just the normal Python script.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:56,320
First let's create a document that we want to visualize will say a.p and then say Apple is going to

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:06,180
build a UK factory for and let's do six million.

14
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:12,170
Now that we have that document the next we're going to call is displacer remember its display of facey

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,280
there and then we're going to say render and then we pass in the documents.

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,340
There's also different style parameters you can do.

17
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,210
So I'll put in some defaults here and then we'll kind of look for the documentation to see what else

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,440
we can provide.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,050
The one parameter we are going to make sure we say right now is because I'm using an open notebook also

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,340
Jupiter is the true.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:41,880
And then there's an options dictionary comparison and I'll say distance is 110.

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,510
So if you run that you should see inside of your notebook this display.

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,470
So notice here we're able to see Apple is a proper noun is is a verb.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,460
And you can see also the syntactic display over here of the arrows.

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,570
So again lots information that we're now able to show this optional distance argument is the distance

26
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,590
between the tokens.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,470
So you can make this a little smaller.

28
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,350
Let's go ahead to make it 50 and run that again and I can see everything is a lot closer together.

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,830
So depending on how long your actual document is you may want to experiment with the size to make the

30
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,160
distance larger or smaller.

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,090
Now you can also visualize the entity recognizer.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,650
So let me show you how to do that.

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:33,400
Let's create another document will say and LP Pasadena could string saying something like over the last

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,550
quarter.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:45,880
Apple sold nearly 20000 iPods for the profits of I don't know let's go ahead and they say $6 million

36
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,320
again.

37
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,960
There we go.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,770
So we have that string noticed that we have Flip's Let's make shall we say Apple correctly.

39
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,740
Laura SPEEs So we have apples we have iPods we have 20000.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
And then we have six million.

41
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:06,920
Let's go ahead and run that through display see the render pass in that document.

42
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,570
But now for the style We're going to say E and T.

43
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,910
So again the original style was the eppi for syntactic dependency.

44
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:23,060
Here we're saying E.A. for entity and since we're using Jupiter we'll say Jupiter is true.

45
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,190
So run that and this is a different type of display.

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,160
What it's going to do is it's going to attempt to find every entity that it can.

47
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,020
Inside this document and it's going to highlight it.

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,730
So over the last quarter and then so here we see the highlight and we also see the type of events titas.

49
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:47,060
So the last quarter is that date Apple is an organization nearly 20000 that's some sort of cardinal

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,510
entity i-Pods.

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,510
It's smart enough to understand that that's a product and then a for profit of six million it understands

52
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,270
its money.

53
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,360
So Spacey is smart enough to do this all on its own which is really amazing.

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,430
Finally if you are creating visualizations outside of Jupiter maybe you're just running this in some

55
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,810
postscript.

56
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,290
Let's show you an example of how you can work with that.

57
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,310
You simply say a.p and we'll say this is a sentence

58
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:24,370
you say display C and instead of saying render inside the notebook you can say serve and then pass in

59
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,620
the document and then pass in whatever style you want.

60
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,200
I'm going to pass on style as syntactic dependency.

61
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,760
So if you read that you may get something that says hey your firewall is blocking it.

62
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,410
Go ahead and allow access and then you'll notice it's serving on port 5000.

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:56,860
So we're going to have to do is inside your browser you're going to go to 6:59 dot 0 0 1 Colan 5000.

64
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,510
Essentially your local IP address at port five thousand if you're on that night should see here the

65
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,670
actual visualization and this will work.

66
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,070
Even if you're running a shop by a script so it would just run this code inside it that postscript and

67
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,440
will report back that it's running.

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,470
Essentially this little mini server with this visualization.

69
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,360
And before we finished off this lecture I want to also talk about this options dictionary that we mentioned

70
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
above here.

71
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,490
So this option's dictionary it's basically a bunch of styling calls you can make.

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,570
You can check out the link we have in the notebook for the documentation link on visualizing the dependencies

73
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,970
so you can visualize the Pennsy parse or visualize and see the recognition and so on.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,060
There's a lot of options you can do here and you can do things like coloring.

75
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,490
You can do background colors.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,150
You can do zoom in zoom out all that stuff.

77
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,050
So essentially you have this options dictionary and you can provide the colors you want the different

78
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,790
fonts you want the background color you want and so on.

79
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,980
And here's a table of all the options you can provide for a list of even more options.

80
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,500
You can check out this place the API documentation simply by clicking on this link.

81
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,750
You can check out all these different options.

82
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,630
OK.

83
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,570
I hope you have fun.

84
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,330
And I would encourage you to passen your own sentences or own strings and play around and see how you

85
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,780
can visualize it.

86
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,900
We'll see you at the next lecture where we talk about stemming.
