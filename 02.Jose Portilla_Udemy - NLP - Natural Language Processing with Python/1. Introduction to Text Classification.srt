Welcome everyone to the section on tax classification.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,690
Our goals for this section are to first understand the machine learning basics and understand classification

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,200
metrics.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,210
Since we're going to need to understand how we can actually evaluate our tax classification models.

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,460
After that we'll learn how to do things like text feature extraction and we'll familiarize ourselves

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,280
with psychic learn in Python to perform tax classification on real datasets.

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,810
Keep in mind we're gonna start off with quite a few quote unquote theory lectures and that means we're

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,340
not going to be coding anything until we have a solid understanding of machine learning classification

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,740
a text feature extraction concepts.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,180
So you'll see quite a few lectures first that are only slides before we actually jump into the python

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,020
code.

12
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,910
With that being said let's get started.
