Hello everyone and welcome to the course overview lecture.

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.480
I have one favor to ask you and that you please do not skip this lecture we cover a lot of really important

3
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.550
things and then make it as quick as possible.

4
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.410
But again please don't skip this lecture even if you've taken other courses of mine before.

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.960
All right.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.260
So in this lecture and I quickly cover useful tips for going through the course how to get help during

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.980
the course.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.880
Advice on how to approach the course where to find the course books and how to use the student chat

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.630
channel.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.410
Let's get going.

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.110
So first off a couple of useful tips you can use the video player settings to speed up or slow down

12
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.720
the videos you can use the U to me app to download videos of course lectures and you can make sure to

13
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.810
use our Q and A or question answer forums answers lots of previous discussion.

14
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.270
Already available there now let's talk about how to actually get the notes for this course.

15
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.770
The notes are linked as a zip file as a resource.

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.630
In this lecture.

17
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.040
So all you need to do is download that zip file unzip it and you should see all the course notebooks

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.760
there.

19
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.270
There is also a pop up link that should have popped up as you're viewing this lecture.

20
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.080
Or you can go to your course dashboard page and then just go to course curriculum and see the resource

21
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.110
links there.

22
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.230
That same ZIP file is also a resource in the fake Q lecture.

23
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.630
Now let's talk about getting help during the course.

24
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.040
If you're experiencing any platform level issues please e-mail support at to me dot com.

25
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.060
Platform level issues include things like video playback.

26
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.780
If you have blurry video certification issues if you have questions on maybe change your name and your

27
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.300
certification or if you have issues with payments or enrollment in the course I don't actually control

28
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.880
any of that.

29
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.880
That's you to meet platform level.

30
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.500
So you're going to need to email support.

31
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.850
You don't mean they'll come and they'll be happy to help you out.

32
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.540
I can actually help you with that.

33
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.520
Now it's talk about getting help on the actual course content now for getting help during the course

34
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.120
content.

35
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.740
I would really recommend that you double check against the course books.

36
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.950
Also I would recommend that a really fast way to get help especially for really common issues is a quick

37
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.920
Google search or the stack overflow search of your error.

38
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.890
That almost always pops up the first link which is a solution to the problem.

39
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.680
Then if you still can't find your solution you can search the question the answer forms inside the course

40
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.280
and you can also check out the Q lectures.

41
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.180
If you still have trouble finding the solution please submit a new question in the question answer forums

42
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.740
including details on what you've tried as well as a screenshot of your error or code.

43
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.690
Please include as much detail as possible so that we can help you out.

44
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.270
Before posting the question and answer forums please confirm that you are using our provided environment

45
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.220
and that you have tried running our provided notebooks without any edits to them.

46
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.930
The way we've designed this course if you're running our provided notebooks in our provided environment

47
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.480
you should never encounter any errors or issues so please confirm those two things and write that you've

48
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.650
confirmed those two things.

49
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.360
When posting into the question answer forums it's going to save you a lot of time from simple typos.

50
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.470
So again simple typos can cause errors.

51
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.150
The two steps above will guarantee that you'll avoid any of those types of issues.

52
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.790
Please keep in mind for the course question answer forums.

53
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.280
We cannot help you if your personal natural language processing projects outside of the Course material.

54
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.680
However we do have a discourse chat channel that's a great place to share your questions on your personal

55
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.770
projects so please keep the question answer forums related to the course material and questions stemming

56
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.550
directly from the course content for your own personal or work projects.

57
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.720
Have those discussions in art this quartet channel you can use the link in the automated welcome message

58
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.520
to join our Dischord server.

59
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.040
The automated welcome message also includes a link to a YouTube video describing how to use and log

60
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.660
into the chat server.

61
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.970
The best way to approach the course in my opinion is to review the notebooks along with video.

62
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.580
The notebooks contain code use in every lecture and are organized in the same order that they appear

63
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.350
during the course and the video usually contains explanatory concepts that can't really be shown through

64
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.720
code.

65
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.210
So we'll have some theory videos as well so I encourage you to use both of those resources.

66
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.210
OK that's it for the course overview lecture.

67
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.810
Thank you so much for watching it all.

68
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.640
And let's get on the course.
