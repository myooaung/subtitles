Welcome back everyone to this section of the course on deep learning for natural language processing

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,460
our goals for this section are to understand a basic overview of deep learning.

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,450
Then we'll move on to understanding specific types of neural networks such as recurrent known networks

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,560
or r and n and Ellis Tim a long short term memory unit which is going to be useful when using it to

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,930
generate text from source corpus.

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,670
So later on in this section of course we're going to actually read in source material such as the Moby

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,090
Dick novel and then use our neural networks to generate brand new text in the same style as the original

8
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,440
source Corpus.

9
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,310
Then we'll also learn how to create q and a chat box with Python and recurrent neural networks.

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,460
There's a lot to learn so let's get started.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,530
I'll see you in the next lecture.
