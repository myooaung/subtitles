00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,240
Welcome back to this lecture on visualizing names and see recognition.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,670
Let's review how to visualize any are with Spacey and the spicy.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,380
Let's head over to Jupiter notebook.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,540
OK here I am at a Jupiter notebook and I've imported Spacey as well as loaded up the English library

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,540
and I said from Spacey import this Blazey.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,610
Next we're going to do is create a document that we actually want to visualize.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
We'll say.

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:44,810
And here we're going to say over the last quarter Apple sold nearly 20000 units or let's say 20000 iPods

9
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,740
for a profit of $6 million.

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:59,140
Next we're going to do is after we define that document we'll call display see and we will render the

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,600
doc and then Style say E.A. for entity.

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,720
And since I'm using Jupiter I'm going to say Jupiter is true and he can see space to the best of its

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,730
ability is going to highlight and color the Anstey's it finds.

14
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:20,220
So find the date and see in organization money i-Pods his product cardinal for some sort of amount nearly

15
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,150
20000 and so on.

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,350
So you can see already the power that displace has to highlight entities.

17
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,510
Now let's imagine you want to have multiple lines and you want to view them line by line.

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,000
So for example we're going to create one more line inside of the documents.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,660
In fact we're going to pass in another string.

20
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,560
So inside these princes go ahead and create a new stream and we'll say something like.

21
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:53,560
By contrast Sony only sold well say eight thousand music players.

22
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,370
And let's say Walkmen music players

23
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,100
OK.

24
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,570
So if you actually call read they're now in the documents it'll show everything as kind of one giant

25
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,830
long string but maybe you only want to do this line by line the way you do that is just separate out

26
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:17,890
into sentence segmentation by saying For sent in docked that sense and then you're going to call display

27
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:26,710
C render individually on each of those by saying an LP sent that DXi pass and the text of each individual

28
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,200
sentence segmentation.

29
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:36,110
Again make sure you say style lips style is equal to E.A..

30
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,730
And since I'm running this in Jupiter I will say Jupiter is true and you can see it gives you a little

31
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,650
more spacing between the lines.

32
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,590
It's not too different between rendering everything versus this.

33
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,050
You can see that each new line is left in that TD instead of.

34
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,150
By contrast is this essentially a continuation.

35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,220
OK.

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,650
Now you can also have different options.

37
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,570
Remember there's an options dictionary.

38
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,910
You can actually choose options for things like coloring or customized effects and more importantly

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,100
you can choose options to only display or highlight certain entities.

40
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:17,460
So maybe you're only really interested in product entities where you can do is say options and under

41
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,990
A.S. key you can pasan a list of what you're interested in.

42
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,590
So maybe we're only interested in product entities then we're going to render this will render the whole

43
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:37,960
thing recopy And this this and pace it down here and then we'll say options is equal to options.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,200
Run that and then it will only highlight the entities that you said here.

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,280
And if you want to add another one like organization you simply just add to this list of options and

46
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,660
then it's going to highlight that.

47
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,220
So that way maybe you're not interested in it.

48
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,180
Entities don't want those highlighted.

49
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,000
You can easily filter out whatever you want.

50
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,680
Then as always there's things like different colors so you can actually choose different colors for

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,700
different entities.

52
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,560
There's the default colors but if you really want to choose your own all you need to do is create an

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,870
other dictionary.

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:15,290
Called colors and then we're going to do is choose an entity and then you're going to pass in a color

55
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,030
that you want.

56
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,870
So for example you can say that you want this entity to be red.

57
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:27,320
Then once you've done that you need to do is inside your options state a color is key and set equal

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,040
to or set its value equal to this colour's dictionary.

59
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,290
So if you run this you'll let us now that organizations have been read.

60
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,000
And as always you can pass in your own custom hex codes in case you want a color that isn't simple.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,890
So for example I can pass on this hex code color and it'll create something that looks like that.

62
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,410
You can also customize these even more so you can actually add linear gradients or radial gradients.

63
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,740
So let me show you example of that X is going to copy and paste these from the notes we provide.

64
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,730
So there's a radial gradient.

65
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,520
See all you need to do is choose the tag and then say radial dash gradient and choose two colors either

66
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,690
hex codes or string color codes.

67
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,420
And if you run that what's going to happen is going to radial gradient.

68
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,640
The inside is going to start yellow and then the outside is going to go to green.

69
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,220
So for example we could say from yellow inside to outside red and you get something that looks like

70
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,740
that.

71
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,400
You can then also do a linear gradient.

72
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,910
So you just called the linear gradient function and then choose a start middle and end color.

73
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,400
Let me copy and paste that.

74
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,430
So here we're going to choose linear ash gradient and you can choose an actual degree and then a start

75
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,120
and stop color.

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,660
So you can run that and it's going to start at kind of this darker purple and go to this pink again.

77
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,800
You can just pass and string codes here if you want.

78
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,040
You can say go from maybe orange red.

79
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,320
Run that it can see it going from orange to red and you can change these to 180 degrees if you want

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,440
it to go from top to bottom or so on or you can even choose if you really want like a 45 degree to have

81
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,860
it go from one corner to the other.

82
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,860
It's really up to you.

83
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,790
Usually you won't need to customize color effects that often unless you have a very specific style that

84
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,590
you're looking for.

85
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:20,320
Finally we've showed you how to render everything inside of the Juber notebook but maybe you're running

86
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,550
a dot PI script.

87
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:29,330
As always you can simply call the splays see serve pass in the document passen style is equal to E.A..

88
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,150
And if you want.

89
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,110
You can still passen options and then notice I'm not saying you Brezik that true it's that I'm just

90
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,040
saying this.

91
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,310
And when you run that you should see it being served.

92
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,920
So you just need to go to 6:59 point 0.01 at whatever port it's telling you.

93
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,150
So in my case it's a port 5000 you copy and paste that and then you'll see the being rendered at that

94
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,230
location.

95
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,910
All right.

96
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,780
So that's really it for rendering the most important thing to note here I believe is not really the

97
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:05,840
coloring but the fact that you get to choose and filter based off what you want so you can always have

98
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,510
this ants and then choose specific entities you want to highlight.

99
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,060
Thinks elsea at the next lecture.
