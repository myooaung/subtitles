Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.010
It's now time to test your skills so we went over in the section of the course by going through an assessment

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.480
and this lecture will have an overview of the assessment questions and the next lecture will go over

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.550
the solutions.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.960
Let's get started by checking out the assessment notebook.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.690
OK here we have the assessment notebook for this assessment.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.740
We're going to be using a short story the tale of Peter Rabbit from 1982.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.900
It's in the public domain and we here we have a cell that you can run for standard imports such a Speccy.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.040
Loading up this library and importing displays.

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.660
First we want you to create a doc file or dock object from the file.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.730
Peter Rabbit TSC it's nifty.

12
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.280
Text Files folder.

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.560
Then for every token in the third sentence print the token text the speech tag the fine grained tag

14
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.540
and the description of the fine green tag and see if you can format it nicely so it looks something

15
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.440
like this.

16
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.950
Next we wanted to provide a frequency list of parts of speech tags from the entire document.

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:07.370
So remember there's a way to actually count the frequency of each part of speech after that for a challenge.

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.220
We asked what percentage of all the tokens are nouns and the id attribute for noun is 91 and you should

19
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.020
get around 14 percent.

20
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.790
The next task is to display the dependency parts for the third sentence.

21
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.230
And really what that is is it's using display C to render with the style the E.P..

22
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.910
So keep in mind this is not actually what it should look like.

23
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
Instead he should be performing the visualization of it.

24
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.380
Essentially that visualization for syntactic dependencies.

25
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.360
Next we wanted to show the first two named entities from the Tale of Peter Rabbit.

26
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.300
So what are those first two named entities.

27
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.400
They should be these two the tale of Peter Rabbit.

28
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.330
It's a work of art.

29
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.620
And Beatrix Potter which is a person seven is how many sentences are actually contained in the Tale

30
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.430
of Peter Rabbit.

31
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.920
Remember we talked about sentence segmentation.

32
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.440
And as a challenge how many sentences actually contained named entities.

33
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.260
And another challenge problem is to display the named entity visualization for the indexed one list

34
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.150
of sentences from the previous problem and it should look something like this a work of art a person

35
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.300
and then a date.

36
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.950
OK.

37
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.340
Best of luck on the assessment.

38
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.390
We're going to go over the solutions in the next lecture.

39
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.000
We'll see either.
