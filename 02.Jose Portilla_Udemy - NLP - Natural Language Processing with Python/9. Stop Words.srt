00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:13,380
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on stop it's words like and the appear so frequently in text that

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,720
they really don't require tagging as thoroughly as unique nouns verbs and modifiers.

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,910
We call these words stop words and they can be filtered from the text to be processed.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,880
Spacey holds a built in list of some around hundred and five English Stop words so against upwards just

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,850
the really common words that don't really give you any additional information.

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,100
And sometimes they can actually hurt your natural language processing.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,780
So a really common use case when you're working with the pipeline in natural language processing is

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,330
to remove stop words.

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,500
So we're going to show you how to remove Stoppard's with Spacey and we'll also show you how to add in

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,600
your own special stoppers in case maybe you're dealing with a unique dataset where you have an acronym

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,960
that gets used too much and you want to add that as a stop word.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,330
So let's go ahead and show you how to do all that with Spacey.

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,040
OK here I am at the notebook.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,590
I've imported Spacey and I have loaded up the English core web small language and what we can do here

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,420
is directly off this and opii object.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:19,260
I can print out a.p dots defaults dot and then you can passen stop underscore words.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,660
And if you run that it's going to give you this set.

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,860
So notice it's not a dictionary it's actually a set of all the Stoppard's that are built into spaces.

19
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,940
So again these are really common stop words and really common English words that typically don't give

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,960
you too much more information.

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:43,300
So the length of the actual object if you look at the length of and all the defaults stop words is 300

22
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:49,520
in five words and you can easily check if a word is a stop word by simply calling an LP vocab.

23
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,070
So I can say a.p the vocab and then I can pasan any word I'm interested in.

24
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:04,380
So for example let's use a really common word like is is going to return back this lexia object which

25
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,860
carries a lot of information.

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,140
And you can simply call is stop attribute and it's going to say true is is a stop word Let's go ahead

27
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,800
Adam more unique word like mystery.

28
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,350
Run that.

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
And that's false.

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,560
This is a unique enough word.

31
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,560
It's not that common.

32
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,660
So it is not a Stop word.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,190
Now there may be times when you wish to add a stop word to the default set.

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,760
We just saw here above.

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:35,120
Perhaps you're working with text data like text messages and you see a lot of people using BT W for.

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,290
By the way.

37
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,130
So maybe you want that to be considered a stop word for your particular dataset.

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:51,500
So we can do this is all you need to do is call an LP defaults stop words and then you say ADD and you

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:03:00,340
add in the stop where they are interested in such as PTW then the next step is to manually grab again

40
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:11,380
an LP vocab passen be T.W. and say is underscore stop and set it equal to true.

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,910
You can go ahead and run that.

42
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,060
And if you actually check the length of an LP defaults.

43
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,760
Stop words you'll notice it's now 3 0 6.

44
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:27,370
So we went ahead and added beat W to our vocabulary of stop words and if you actually now check and

45
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:34,960
LP vocab for W and you ask is it actually a stop or it's going to return back.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,320
True it is a Stop word or remember PTW was not in our original list here or original set of stop words.

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,470
If you want to remove a stop word so maybe you see a stop word here that you actually want to take into

48
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:54,010
account maybe via or someone or third These are actually important words to you and you wanted to remove

49
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,190
them from the set.

50
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:06,320
You apply a similar process we do hear you say LP defaults stop words and then you call remove any passing

51
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,230
whatever word you want to remove.

52
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,140
So maybe you want to remove beyond because that's technically a stop word in this original appear.

53
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,530
So I want to remove beyond and then what you end up doing is you call vocab

54
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,040
beyond.

55
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,700
And you say is stop and you said equal to false.

56
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,460
Essentially doing the reverse of what we just did for adding a stop word and now when you call in LP

57
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,650
vocab and ask for beyond and you ask is it a stop word.

58
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,130
It's going to return back false and that's really it.

59
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,880
Now you should be able to access bases defaults of Stoppard's and add or remove stop words as needed.

60
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,860
Coming up next we're going to talk about vocabulary and matching with Spacey.

61
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,960
We'll see at the next lecture.
