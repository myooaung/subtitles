Welcome back to the section on topic modeling.

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.640
So our goals for this section are first off to understand what topic modeling is and how it's actually

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.980
a version of unsupervised machine learning.

4
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.020
Then we'll learn about latents Thursley allocation and implement LDK then we'll understand non-negative

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.210
matrix factorization for top modeling and then later on show you how to implement an M.F. with sikat

6
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.790
learn.

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.780
Afterwards we'll learn how to apply both of these to a project dataset.

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.970
OK let's get started by learning about top modeling I at the next lecture.
