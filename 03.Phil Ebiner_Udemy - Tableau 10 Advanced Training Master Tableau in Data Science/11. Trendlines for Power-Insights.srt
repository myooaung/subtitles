00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,430
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:07,430  -->  00:00:09,950
Tableau. Today is finally the day when we

3

00:00:09,950  -->  00:00:09,960

4

00:00:09,960  -->  00:00:12,770
get to derive insights from our analysis.

5

00:00:12,770  -->  00:00:12,780

6

00:00:12,780  -->  00:00:15,980
What a journey we learned so many new

7

00:00:15,980  -->  00:00:15,990

8

00:00:15,990  -->  00:00:19,310
techniques and skills in relation to

9

00:00:19,310  -->  00:00:19,320

10

00:00:19,320  -->  00:00:22,550
table calculations in order to get to

11

00:00:22,550  -->  00:00:22,560

12

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:25,040
this stage and what do we have in front

13

00:00:25,040  -->  00:00:25,050

14

00:00:25,050  -->  00:00:25,880
of us here?

15

00:00:25,880  -->  00:00:25,890

16

00:00:25,890  -->  00:00:27,320
Well we have the five machines that

17

00:00:27,320  -->  00:00:27,330

18

00:00:27,330  -->  00:00:30,259
we're analyzing and we've got the

19

00:00:30,259  -->  00:00:30,269

20

00:00:30,269  -->  00:00:32,510
average idle capacity expressed in

21

00:00:32,510  -->  00:00:32,520

22

00:00:32,520  -->  00:00:35,870
percentage of the nominal capacity for

23

00:00:35,870  -->  00:00:35,880

24

00:00:35,880  -->  00:00:38,060
every machine and the average is taken

25

00:00:38,060  -->  00:00:38,070

26

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:40,639
for the eight hours preceding to the

27

00:00:40,639  -->  00:00:40,649

28

00:00:40,649  -->  00:00:44,090
hour visualized on this timeline and as

29

00:00:44,090  -->  00:00:44,100

30

00:00:44,100  -->  00:00:47,270
per the criteria in the assignment what

31

00:00:47,270  -->  00:00:47,280

32

00:00:47,280  -->  00:00:49,430
we're looking for is times when the

33

00:00:49,430  -->  00:00:49,440

34

00:00:49,440  -->  00:00:53,060
average spikes over the 10% line.

35

00:00:53,060  -->  00:00:53,070

36

00:00:53,070  -->  00:00:55,340
So as you can see here we're looking for

37

00:00:55,340  -->  00:00:55,350

38

00:00:55,350  -->  00:00:58,130
situations like that which tell us that

39

00:00:58,130  -->  00:00:58,140

40

00:00:58,140  -->  00:01:01,430
the machine has been underperforming for

41

00:01:01,430  -->  00:01:01,440

42

00:01:01,440  -->  00:01:04,399
a substantial period of time and perhaps

43

00:01:04,399  -->  00:01:04,409

44

00:01:04,409  -->  00:01:08,330
that it requires maintenance so these,

45

00:01:08,330  -->  00:01:08,340

46

00:01:08,340  -->  00:01:11,810
these are the observations that we need

47

00:01:11,810  -->  00:01:11,820

48

00:01:11,820  -->  00:01:15,020
to report to the management or to the

49

00:01:15,020  -->  00:01:15,030

50

00:01:15,030  -->  00:01:16,999
client. So let's go ahead and proceed

51

00:01:16,999  -->  00:01:17,009

52

00:01:17,009  -->  00:01:19,670
with this analysis at first glance you

53

00:01:19,670  -->  00:01:19,680

54

00:01:19,680  -->  00:01:21,380
can see right away that this machine

55

00:01:21,380  -->  00:01:21,390

56

00:01:21,390  -->  00:01:24,350
definitely needs to be red flagged, it does

57

00:01:24,350  -->  00:01:24,360

58

00:01:24,360  -->  00:01:28,789
have times and quite often times when the

59

00:01:28,789  -->  00:01:28,799

60

00:01:28,799  -->  00:01:30,950
average spikes above the 10% line.

61

00:01:30,950  -->  00:01:30,960

62

00:01:30,960  -->  00:01:34,100
This machine looks good looks like it's

63

00:01:34,100  -->  00:01:34,110

64

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:36,260
always under the 10% line. This

65

00:01:36,260  -->  00:01:36,270

66

00:01:36,270  -->  00:01:38,060
machine looks good, this machine looks

67

00:01:38,060  -->  00:01:38,070

68

00:01:38,070  -->  00:01:40,580
good and then this machine has a spike over

69

00:01:40,580  -->  00:01:40,590

70

00:01:40,590  -->  00:01:43,670
here. So that's what you would probably

71

00:01:43,670  -->  00:01:43,680

72

00:01:43,680  -->  00:01:47,389
report off the bat or off, if you're

73

00:01:47,389  -->  00:01:47,399

74

00:01:47,399  -->  00:01:50,240
told to give an inside very quickly but

75

00:01:50,240  -->  00:01:50,250

76

00:01:50,250  -->  00:01:51,530
because we have a bit more time we're

77

00:01:51,530  -->  00:01:51,540

78

00:01:51,540  -->  00:01:53,120
going to go over and above and we're

79

00:01:53,120  -->  00:01:53,130

80

00:01:53,130  -->  00:01:55,190
going to investigate exactly what's

81

00:01:55,190  -->  00:01:55,200

82

00:01:55,200  -->  00:01:56,060
going on.

83

00:01:56,060  -->  00:01:56,070

84

00:01:56,070  -->  00:01:57,980
So first thing that you notice is that

85

00:01:57,980  -->  00:01:57,990

86

00:01:57,990  -->  00:02:01,880
this looks very different to this, right?

87

00:02:01,880  -->  00:02:01,890

88

00:02:01,890  -->  00:02:05,090
So this spike is not just a spike it's

89

00:02:05,090  -->  00:02:05,100

90

00:02:05,100  -->  00:02:07,819
actually a plateau up over here or why

91

00:02:07,819  -->  00:02:07,829

92

00:02:07,829  -->  00:02:08,809
does that happen?

93

00:02:08,809  -->  00:02:08,819

94

00:02:08,819  -->  00:02:09,570
What, what

95

00:02:09,570  -->  00:02:09,580

96

00:02:09,580  -->  00:02:12,000
can the data tell us about this? What

97

00:02:12,000  -->  00:02:12,010

98

00:02:12,010  -->  00:02:13,860
else can we see from here? Is there

99

00:02:13,860  -->  00:02:13,870

100

00:02:13,870  -->  00:02:16,050
anything else we can tell the client or

101

00:02:16,050  -->  00:02:16,060

102

00:02:16,060  -->  00:02:18,090
the management in relation to the

103

00:02:18,090  -->  00:02:18,100

104

00:02:18,100  -->  00:02:21,480
specific spike that might change their

105

00:02:21,480  -->  00:02:21,490

106

00:02:21,490  -->  00:02:23,850
opinion about servicing this machine?

107

00:02:23,850  -->  00:02:23,860

108

00:02:23,860  -->  00:02:26,490
Well what we can see here is very

109

00:02:26,490  -->  00:02:26,500

110

00:02:26,500  -->  00:02:28,800
similar to what we can see here, right?

111

00:02:28,800  -->  00:02:28,810

112

00:02:28,810  -->  00:02:31,590
How does that happen? Why, why are they

113

00:02:31,590  -->  00:02:31,600

114

00:02:31,600  -->  00:02:35,100
and why do they happen at the same time?

115

00:02:35,100  -->  00:02:35,110

116

00:02:35,110  -->  00:02:37,680
So basically what this means is that the

117

00:02:37,680  -->  00:02:37,690

118

00:02:37,690  -->  00:02:40,170
idle capacity here is 0. Meaning that

119

00:02:40,170  -->  00:02:40,180

120

00:02:40,180  -->  00:02:41,610
this machine was working at full

121

00:02:41,610  -->  00:02:41,620

122

00:02:41,620  -->  00:02:45,330
capacity while this machine had to work

123

00:02:45,330  -->  00:02:45,340

124

00:02:45,340  -->  00:02:48,420
at a lower capacity. Interesting,

125

00:02:48,420  -->  00:02:48,430

126

00:02:48,430  -->  00:02:51,480
ok so how about we go and investigate and this

127

00:02:51,480  -->  00:02:51,490

128

00:02:51,490  -->  00:02:54,449
is where you'll see that domain

129

00:02:54,449  -->  00:02:54,459

130

00:02:54,459  -->  00:02:55,650
knowledge or knowledge about the

131

00:02:55,650  -->  00:02:55,660

132

00:02:55,660  -->  00:02:58,710
business which we developed in the first

133

00:02:58,710  -->  00:02:58,720

134

00:02:58,720  -->  00:03:00,900
tutorial of this section is important,

135

00:03:00,900  -->  00:03:00,910

136

00:03:00,910  -->  00:03:03,750
right? So what can we tell about these

137

00:03:03,750  -->  00:03:03,760

138

00:03:03,760  -->  00:03:04,920
two machines?

139

00:03:04,920  -->  00:03:04,930

140

00:03:04,930  -->  00:03:11,310
Let's go ahead and bring up an image so

141

00:03:11,310  -->  00:03:11,320

142

00:03:11,320  -->  00:03:16,199
there's our map right and if I zoom into

143

00:03:16,199  -->  00:03:16,209

144

00:03:16,209  -->  00:03:21,479
the stockyard you'll see that here these

145

00:03:21,479  -->  00:03:21,489

146

00:03:21,489  -->  00:03:22,949
machines which machines are we looking

147

00:03:22,949  -->  00:03:22,959

148

00:03:22,959  -->  00:03:23,640
at?

149

00:03:23,640  -->  00:03:23,650

150

00:03:23,650  -->  00:03:27,150
We're looking at RL2 and SR6.

151

00:03:27,150  -->  00:03:27,160

152

00:03:27,160  -->  00:03:27,660
You'll see that these machines RL2

153

00:03:27,660  -->  00:03:32,520
and SR6 they actually

154

00:03:32,520  -->  00:03:32,530

155

00:03:32,530  -->  00:03:36,390
work on one line right so it's not like

156

00:03:36,390  -->  00:03:36,400

157

00:03:36,400  -->  00:03:37,800
this one works here in this one actually

158

00:03:37,800  -->  00:03:37,810

159

00:03:37,810  -->  00:03:40,380
they actually work on one line and so

160

00:03:40,380  -->  00:03:40,390

161

00:03:40,390  -->  00:03:41,880
what can happen two machines that work

162

00:03:41,880  -->  00:03:41,890

163

00:03:41,890  -->  00:03:44,370
on one line very logically is that

164

00:03:44,370  -->  00:03:44,380

165

00:03:44,380  -->  00:03:48,240
sometimes they might end up in conflict

166

00:03:48,240  -->  00:03:48,250

167

00:03:48,250  -->  00:03:49,680
especially when they're when they come

168

00:03:49,680  -->  00:03:49,690

169

00:03:49,690  -->  00:03:52,530
to this bit in the middle here when they

170

00:03:52,530  -->  00:03:52,540

171

00:03:52,540  -->  00:03:56,310
come to service or coal here so reclaim

172

00:03:56,310  -->  00:03:56,320

173

00:03:56,320  -->  00:03:57,330
coal in this case they were both

174

00:03:57,330  -->  00:03:57,340

175

00:03:57,340  -->  00:03:59,009
reclaiming call because let's not forget

176

00:03:59,009  -->  00:03:59,019

177

00:03:59,019  -->  00:04:01,229
this is a reclaimer. This is a stacker

178

00:04:01,229  -->  00:04:01,239

179

00:04:01,239  -->  00:04:03,210
reclaimer can also stack coal, so when they

180

00:04:03,210  -->  00:04:03,220

181

00:04:03,220  -->  00:04:05,400
get come to work on the coal here in the

182

00:04:05,400  -->  00:04:05,410

183

00:04:05,410  -->  00:04:07,229
middle there might be a conflict they

184

00:04:07,229  -->  00:04:07,239

185

00:04:07,239  -->  00:04:12,270
might not be able to share or might both

186

00:04:12,270  -->  00:04:12,280

187

00:04:12,280  -->  00:04:14,970
not be able to reach the stack that they

188

00:04:14,970  -->  00:04:14,980

189

00:04:14,980  -->  00:04:18,360
need to at the same time and looks like

190

00:04:18,360  -->  00:04:18,370

191

00:04:18,370  -->  00:04:21,099
that's exactly what happened. Looks like

192

00:04:21,099  -->  00:04:21,109

193

00:04:21,109  -->  00:04:24,820
this machine there was a decision made

194

00:04:24,820  -->  00:04:24,830

195

00:04:24,830  -->  00:04:27,100
for this machine to go ahead and work at

196

00:04:27,100  -->  00:04:27,110

197

00:04:27,110  -->  00:04:30,399
full capacity while this machine had to

198

00:04:30,399  -->  00:04:30,409

199

00:04:30,409  -->  00:04:32,770
sacrifice some of its capacity so maybe

200

00:04:32,770  -->  00:04:32,780

201

00:04:32,780  -->  00:04:36,369
work on a different pile of coal

202

00:04:36,369  -->  00:04:36,379

203

00:04:36,379  -->  00:04:38,800
or maybe leave some room for this other

204

00:04:38,800  -->  00:04:38,810

205

00:04:38,810  -->  00:04:41,200
machine because this doesn't look like

206

00:04:41,200  -->  00:04:41,210

207

00:04:41,210  -->  00:04:44,409
it was a random period of time when this

208

00:04:44,409  -->  00:04:44,419

209

00:04:44,419  -->  00:04:45,850
happened this looks like it was planned

210

00:04:45,850  -->  00:04:45,860

211

00:04:45,860  -->  00:04:48,520
this was a planned sacrifice of capacity

212

00:04:48,520  -->  00:04:48,530

213

00:04:48,530  -->  00:04:49,929
how this machine to achieve higher

214

00:04:49,929  -->  00:04:49,939

215

00:04:49,939  -->  00:04:51,700
capacity on this machine with this

216

00:04:51,700  -->  00:04:51,710

217

00:04:51,710  -->  00:04:54,909
machine and we can also confirm that by

218

00:04:54,909  -->  00:04:54,919

219

00:04:54,919  -->  00:04:56,890
looking not at the average but just look at

220

00:04:56,890  -->  00:04:56,900

221

00:04:56,900  -->  00:04:59,080
the idle capacity. So let's for a moment

222

00:04:59,080  -->  00:04:59,090

223

00:04:59,090  -->  00:05:03,490
duplicate this tab and here I'm going to

224

00:05:03,490  -->  00:05:03,500

225

00:05:03,500  -->  00:05:04,869
instead of doing the moving average, I'm

226

00:05:04,869  -->  00:05:04,879

227

00:05:04,879  -->  00:05:06,459
going to just look at the idle capacity

228

00:05:06,459  -->  00:05:06,469

229

00:05:06,469  -->  00:05:09,490
pause and so everywhere it spikes but

230

00:05:09,490  -->  00:05:09,500

231

00:05:09,500  -->  00:05:12,909
here you can see that not only does the

232

00:05:12,909  -->  00:05:12,919

233

00:05:12,919  -->  00:05:15,730
average plateau but also the actual idle

234

00:05:15,730  -->  00:05:15,740

235

00:05:15,740  -->  00:05:17,709
capacity plateaus for both of these

236

00:05:17,709  -->  00:05:17,719

237

00:05:17,719  -->  00:05:19,899
machines right? So you can even look at

238

00:05:19,899  -->  00:05:19,909

239

00:05:19,909  -->  00:05:21,700
the good tons and you'll see that you

240

00:05:21,700  -->  00:05:21,710

241

00:05:21,710  -->  00:05:23,980
see the same situation here. So it's not

242

00:05:23,980  -->  00:05:23,990

243

00:05:23,990  -->  00:05:27,100
cause just by the average it is an

244

00:05:27,100  -->  00:05:27,110

245

00:05:27,110  -->  00:05:29,769
actual observation in the data set so

246

00:05:29,769  -->  00:05:29,779

247

00:05:29,779  -->  00:05:32,350
let's delete this sheet so that is

248

00:05:32,350  -->  00:05:32,360

249

00:05:32,360  -->  00:05:33,700
something that you would include in your

250

00:05:33,700  -->  00:05:33,710

251

00:05:33,710  -->  00:05:35,499
report of course because your assignment

252

00:05:35,499  -->  00:05:35,509

253

00:05:35,509  -->  00:05:37,779
tells you to you would definitely report

254

00:05:37,779  -->  00:05:37,789

255

00:05:37,789  -->  00:05:39,820
this machine but you would also say that

256

00:05:39,820  -->  00:05:39,830

257

00:05:39,830  -->  00:05:42,249
by the looks of it this was a planned

258

00:05:42,249  -->  00:05:42,259

259

00:05:42,259  -->  00:05:45,579
sacrifice of capacity in order to assist

260

00:05:45,579  -->  00:05:45,589

261

00:05:45,589  -->  00:05:48,459
this machine. So kind of cross

262

00:05:48,459  -->  00:05:48,469

263

00:05:48,469  -->  00:05:50,439
a correlation here between the two

264

00:05:50,439  -->  00:05:50,449

265

00:05:50,449  -->  00:05:51,249
machines.

266

00:05:51,249  -->  00:05:51,259

267

00:05:51,259  -->  00:05:54,760
Good, good to see good to observe this as

268

00:05:54,760  -->  00:05:54,770

269

00:05:54,770  -->  00:05:56,050
you can take as you can imagine you

270

00:05:56,050  -->  00:05:56,060

271

00:05:56,060  -->  00:05:59,559
can't just see this from excel from just

272

00:05:59,559  -->  00:05:59,569

273

00:05:59,569  -->  00:06:01,570
lots and lots of numbers but you can see

274

00:06:01,570  -->  00:06:01,580

275

00:06:01,580  -->  00:06:03,040
it when it's visually represented like

276

00:06:03,040  -->  00:06:03,050

277

00:06:03,050  -->  00:06:04,779
this. So that's one of the first things

278

00:06:04,779  -->  00:06:04,789

279

00:06:04,789  -->  00:06:08,200
that we want to mention about the data

280

00:06:08,200  -->  00:06:08,210

281

00:06:08,210  -->  00:06:09,429
something that's you know

282

00:06:09,429  -->  00:06:09,439

283

00:06:09,439  -->  00:06:10,749
we're going over and above.

284

00:06:10,749  -->  00:06:10,759

285

00:06:10,759  -->  00:06:12,129
Now let's move on to the second thing,

286

00:06:12,129  -->  00:06:12,139

287

00:06:12,139  -->  00:06:14,529
and the second thing is even more

288

00:06:14,529  -->  00:06:14,539

289

00:06:14,539  -->  00:06:16,059
interesting than that.

290

00:06:16,059  -->  00:06:16,069

291

00:06:16,069  -->  00:06:17,290
The second thing is we're going to add

292

00:06:17,290  -->  00:06:17,300

293

00:06:17,300  -->  00:06:19,300
trend lines, now we haven't talked about

294

00:06:19,300  -->  00:06:19,310

295

00:06:19,310  -->  00:06:21,820
trend lines yet but it's going to it's a

296

00:06:21,820  -->  00:06:21,830

297

00:06:21,830  -->  00:06:23,829
very good time to introduce them now.

298

00:06:23,829  -->  00:06:23,839

299

00:06:23,839  -->  00:06:25,689
What we're going to do is we're going to

300

00:06:25,689  -->  00:06:25,699

301

00:06:25,699  -->  00:06:27,610
right click the chart and all going to

302

00:06:27,610  -->  00:06:27,620

303

00:06:27,620  -->  00:06:30,430
do is select trend lines show trend

304

00:06:30,430  -->  00:06:30,440

305

00:06:30,440  -->  00:06:31,519
lines

306

00:06:31,519  -->  00:06:31,529

307

00:06:31,529  -->  00:06:33,769
and what this brings up is Tableau

308

00:06:33,769  -->  00:06:33,779

309

00:06:33,779  -->  00:06:35,989
automatically fits a trendline and

310

00:06:35,989  -->  00:06:35,999

311

00:06:35,999  -->  00:06:39,679
basically a linear regression line to

312

00:06:39,679  -->  00:06:39,689

313

00:06:39,689  -->  00:06:42,919
your data and to tell you what where

314

00:06:42,919  -->  00:06:42,929

315

00:06:42,929  -->  00:06:45,949
this whole trend is going what each

316

00:06:45,949  -->  00:06:45,959

317

00:06:45,959  -->  00:06:49,909
one of these charts is looking like. So

318

00:06:49,909  -->  00:06:49,919

319

00:06:49,919  -->  00:06:52,639
I'm going to right click and edit trend

320

00:06:52,639  -->  00:06:52,649

321

00:06:52,649  -->  00:06:54,649
lines and I don't want the confidence

322

00:06:54,649  -->  00:06:54,659

323

00:06:54,659  -->  00:06:56,149
bands you can see here that it's

324

00:06:56,149  -->  00:06:56,159

325

00:06:56,159  -->  00:06:57,739
actually showing you not one single line

326

00:06:57,739  -->  00:06:57,749

327

00:06:57,749  -->  00:06:59,749
but showing confidence line so let's get

328

00:06:59,749  -->  00:06:59,759

329

00:06:59,759  -->  00:07:01,699
rid of the confidence bands we don't

330

00:07:01,699  -->  00:07:01,709

331

00:07:01,709  -->  00:07:06,439
need them and we click OK and right away

332

00:07:06,439  -->  00:07:06,449

333

00:07:06,449  -->  00:07:07,819
what is this trend lines, what are these

334

00:07:07,819  -->  00:07:07,829

335

00:07:07,829  -->  00:07:10,009
trend lines telling us? Well if you look at

336

00:07:10,009  -->  00:07:10,019

337

00:07:10,019  -->  00:07:11,599
the orange machine you can see that the

338

00:07:11,599  -->  00:07:11,609

339

00:07:11,609  -->  00:07:13,159
trend lines pretty flat and if you put

340

00:07:13,159  -->  00:07:13,169

341

00:07:13,169  -->  00:07:15,229
your mouse over, it it will tell you

342

00:07:15,229  -->  00:07:15,239

343

00:07:15,239  -->  00:07:17,509
quite a few things. It tell you the

344

00:07:17,509  -->  00:07:17,519

345

00:07:17,519  -->  00:07:20,569
trend line formula so the coefficient

346

00:07:20,569  -->  00:07:20,579

347

00:07:20,579  -->  00:07:24,259
times hour what what is basically telling

348

00:07:24,259  -->  00:07:24,269

349

00:07:24,269  -->  00:07:26,569
is, it's telling you

350

00:07:26,569  -->  00:07:26,579

351

00:07:26,579  -->  00:07:29,929
whoops, so let's do that again. It's

352

00:07:29,929  -->  00:07:29,939

353

00:07:29,939  -->  00:07:33,859
telling you a linear formula. A linear

354

00:07:33,859  -->  00:07:33,869

355

00:07:33,869  -->  00:07:36,109
regression formula here,

356

00:07:36,109  -->  00:07:36,119

357

00:07:36,119  -->  00:07:39,499
so what's the coefficient for our hours

358

00:07:39,499  -->  00:07:39,509

359

00:07:39,509  -->  00:07:43,850
are x-axis and what is the constant so

360

00:07:43,850  -->  00:07:43,860

361

00:07:43,860  -->  00:07:45,529
where does the line cross the vertical

362

00:07:45,529  -->  00:07:45,539

363

00:07:45,539  -->  00:07:48,739
axis? There's got a p-value here and we're

364

00:07:48,739  -->  00:07:48,749

365

00:07:48,749  -->  00:07:50,479
not going to talk about p-values too much.

366

00:07:50,479  -->  00:07:50,489

367

00:07:50,489  -->  00:07:54,949
It's a more advanced statistics

368

00:07:54,949  -->  00:07:54,959

369

00:07:54,959  -->  00:07:57,139
topic but we're going to say is that

370

00:07:57,139  -->  00:07:57,149

371

00:07:57,149  -->  00:08:00,199
just look out for p-values and

372

00:08:00,199  -->  00:08:00,209

373

00:08:00,209  -->  00:08:04,879
compare them to 0.05 so if your p-value

374

00:08:04,879  -->  00:08:04,889

375

00:08:04,889  -->  00:08:07,489
is less than 0.05 like in this case the

376

00:08:07,489  -->  00:08:07,499

377

00:08:07,499  -->  00:08:10,339
trendline is pretty, like the

378

00:08:10,339  -->  00:08:10,349

379

00:08:10,349  -->  00:08:12,169
result of statistical significant. In

380

00:08:12,169  -->  00:08:12,179

381

00:08:12,179  -->  00:08:13,639
this case, it's a statistically

382

00:08:13,639  -->  00:08:13,649

383

00:08:13,649  -->  00:08:17,329
significant result and basically even if

384

00:08:17,329  -->  00:08:17,339

385

00:08:17,339  -->  00:08:19,159
I look at the formula you can say that

386

00:08:19,159  -->  00:08:19,169

387

00:08:19,169  -->  00:08:21,589
this trend lines pretty flat if anything

388

00:08:21,589  -->  00:08:21,599

389

00:08:21,599  -->  00:08:24,289
it's actually going down means that if

390

00:08:24,289  -->  00:08:24,299

391

00:08:24,299  -->  00:08:26,509
everything else is held constant

392

00:08:26,509  -->  00:08:26,519

393

00:08:26,519  -->  00:08:28,189
everything's progress the way they're

394

00:08:28,189  -->  00:08:28,199

395

00:08:28,199  -->  00:08:31,159
progressing now then by the looks of it

396

00:08:31,159  -->  00:08:31,169

397

00:08:31,169  -->  00:08:34,669
this average is not going to start

398

00:08:34,669  -->  00:08:34,679

399

00:08:34,679  -->  00:08:36,980
increasing at all of a sudden. Here on

400

00:08:36,980  -->  00:08:36,990

401

00:08:36,990  -->  00:08:38,059
the other hand, you can see that the

402

00:08:38,059  -->  00:08:38,069

403

00:08:38,069  -->  00:08:40,249
trend line is sloping upwards and if I

404

00:08:40,249  -->  00:08:40,259

405

00:08:40,259  -->  00:08:42,319
click on the trendline the p-value is

406

00:08:42,319  -->  00:08:42,329

407

00:08:42,329  -->  00:08:43,300
less than

408

00:08:43,300  -->  00:08:43,310

409

00:08:43,310  -->  00:08:48,370
0.0001 so it's definitely, definitely

410

00:08:48,370  -->  00:08:48,380

411

00:08:48,380  -->  00:08:50,950
passes the test statistically

412

00:08:50,950  -->  00:08:50,960

413

00:08:50,960  -->  00:08:53,170
significant result and this upward

414

00:08:53,170  -->  00:08:53,180

415

00:08:53,180  -->  00:08:55,960
sloping trendline what it's doing is

416

00:08:55,960  -->  00:08:55,970

417

00:08:55,970  -->  00:08:58,720
it's telling us that if things continue

418

00:08:58,720  -->  00:08:58,730

419

00:08:58,730  -->  00:09:01,090
their continuing now, they're

420

00:09:01,090  -->  00:09:01,100

421

00:09:01,100  -->  00:09:04,510
happening now then this average or this

422

00:09:04,510  -->  00:09:04,520

423

00:09:04,520  -->  00:09:06,490
chart for this average will continue

424

00:09:06,490  -->  00:09:06,500

425

00:09:06,500  -->  00:09:08,860
increasing and you can actually see that

426

00:09:08,860  -->  00:09:08,870

427

00:09:08,870  -->  00:09:11,110
here you can see that cut is it is

428

00:09:11,110  -->  00:09:11,120

429

00:09:11,120  -->  00:09:13,930
slowly increasing and what that means is

430

00:09:13,930  -->  00:09:13,940

431

00:09:13,940  -->  00:09:16,060
it will keep getting close and close to

432

00:09:16,060  -->  00:09:16,070

433

00:09:16,070  -->  00:09:17,380
ten percent line so the machine will

434

00:09:17,380  -->  00:09:17,390

435

00:09:17,390  -->  00:09:20,290
just keep the will underperform more and

436

00:09:20,290  -->  00:09:20,300

437

00:09:20,300  -->  00:09:23,019
more and more. Then for the green chart

438

00:09:23,019  -->  00:09:23,029

439

00:09:23,029  -->  00:09:24,820
here you can see that the trend line is

440

00:09:24,820  -->  00:09:24,830

441

00:09:24,830  -->  00:09:28,720
pretty flat but we can't it doesn't even

442

00:09:28,720  -->  00:09:28,730

443

00:09:28,730  -->  00:09:30,280
tell us anything just because we can see

444

00:09:30,280  -->  00:09:30,290

445

00:09:30,290  -->  00:09:33,040
here that the p-value is quite high, it's

446

00:09:33,040  -->  00:09:33,050

447

00:09:33,050  -->  00:09:35,470
nowhere near 0.05 so that means this is

448

00:09:35,470  -->  00:09:35,480

449

00:09:35,480  -->  00:09:37,660
not a statistically significant result

450

00:09:37,660  -->  00:09:37,670

451

00:09:37,670  -->  00:09:39,579
so we shouldn't take into account. So

452

00:09:39,579  -->  00:09:39,589

453

00:09:39,589  -->  00:09:40,990
basically we can't add in information

454

00:09:40,990  -->  00:09:41,000

455

00:09:41,000  -->  00:09:43,210
based on this trend line here and then

456

00:09:43,210  -->  00:09:43,220

457

00:09:43,220  -->  00:09:44,680
we're looking at the red chart this is

458

00:09:44,680  -->  00:09:44,690

459

00:09:44,690  -->  00:09:46,540
an interesting bid. We can see that even

460

00:09:46,540  -->  00:09:46,550

461

00:09:46,550  -->  00:09:48,460
though we're not reporting this machine

462

00:09:48,460  -->  00:09:48,470

463

00:09:48,470  -->  00:09:50,680
hasn't spike the moving average hasn't

464

00:09:50,680  -->  00:09:50,690

465

00:09:50,690  -->  00:09:52,690
spiked anywhere above the 10-percent

466

00:09:52,690  -->  00:09:52,700

467

00:09:52,700  -->  00:09:54,400
line so this machine is good to go,

468

00:09:54,400  -->  00:09:54,410

469

00:09:54,410  -->  00:09:55,990
what you can see from the trendline is

470

00:09:55,990  -->  00:09:56,000

471

00:09:56,000  -->  00:09:59,470
it is drastically very quickly

472

00:09:59,470  -->  00:09:59,480

473

00:09:59,480  -->  00:10:03,070
approaching a ten percent mark. In fact,

474

00:10:03,070  -->  00:10:03,080

475

00:10:03,080  -->  00:10:05,170
it is definitely statistically

476

00:10:05,170  -->  00:10:05,180

477

00:10:05,180  -->  00:10:06,910
significant result based on the p-value

478

00:10:06,910  -->  00:10:06,920

479

00:10:06,920  -->  00:10:08,800
but also you can see from the formula

480

00:10:08,800  -->  00:10:08,810

481

00:10:08,810  -->  00:10:12,730
that the coefficient here is 0.0012

482

00:10:12,730  -->  00:10:12,740

483

00:10:12,740  -->  00:10:14,740
times hour of daytime plus some constant.

484

00:10:14,740  -->  00:10:14,750

485

00:10:14,750  -->  00:10:17,980
So what this means is that every for,

486

00:10:17,980  -->  00:10:17,990

487

00:10:17,990  -->  00:10:19,900
with every hour that this machine will

488

00:10:19,900  -->  00:10:19,910

489

00:10:19,910  -->  00:10:21,670
work if everything else continues the

490

00:10:21,670  -->  00:10:21,680

491

00:10:21,680  -->  00:10:24,160
same way it is now, with every hour that

492

00:10:24,160  -->  00:10:24,170

493

00:10:24,170  -->  00:10:27,220
this machine operates the idle capacity

494

00:10:27,220  -->  00:10:27,230

495

00:10:27,230  -->  00:10:30,220
the moving average of the idle capacity

496

00:10:30,220  -->  00:10:30,230

497

00:10:30,230  -->  00:10:33,670
in expressing percentage, in percentages

498

00:10:33,670  -->  00:10:33,680

499

00:10:33,680  -->  00:10:39,760
will increase by 0.12 or  0.13 percentages.

500

00:10:39,760  -->  00:10:39,770

501

00:10:39,770  -->  00:10:41,920
So for every hour,

502

00:10:41,920  -->  00:10:41,930

503

00:10:41,930  -->  00:10:43,900
this machine's idle moving

504

00:10:43,900  -->  00:10:43,910

505

00:10:43,910  -->  00:10:46,030
average idle capacity is increasing by

506

00:10:46,030  -->  00:10:46,040

507

00:10:46,040  -->  00:10:51,970
0.1 percent, so approximately in 10 hours

508

00:10:51,970  -->  00:10:51,980

509

00:10:51,980  -->  00:10:54,579
every 10 hours this moving average will

510

00:10:54,579  -->  00:10:54,589

511

00:10:54,589  -->  00:10:55,960
increase by 1%

512

00:10:55,960  -->  00:10:55,970

513

00:10:55,970  -->  00:10:58,660
like in the long run of course is going

514

00:10:58,660  -->  00:10:58,670

515

00:10:58,670  -->  00:11:00,189
to have its ups and downs going to have

516

00:11:00,189  -->  00:11:00,199

517

00:11:00,199  -->  00:11:02,470
the fluctuations but in the long run is

518

00:11:02,470  -->  00:11:02,480

519

00:11:02,480  -->  00:11:03,999
going to keep increasing at that rate

520

00:11:03,999  -->  00:11:04,009

521

00:11:04,009  -->  00:11:06,249
and that what that means is that within

522

00:11:06,249  -->  00:11:06,259

523

00:11:06,259  -->  00:11:08,949
a couple of days but literally within a

524

00:11:08,949  -->  00:11:08,959

525

00:11:08,959  -->  00:11:11,379
couple of days this line will be crossed

526

00:11:11,379  -->  00:11:11,389

527

00:11:11,389  -->  00:11:12,610
so even though we're performing this

528

00:11:12,610  -->  00:11:12,620

529

00:11:12,620  -->  00:11:14,379
analysis for September we can already

530

00:11:14,379  -->  00:11:14,389

531

00:11:14,389  -->  00:11:16,569
say what's going to happen in the future

532

00:11:16,569  -->  00:11:16,579

533

00:11:16,579  -->  00:11:19,240
and that is very powerful. That is

534

00:11:19,240  -->  00:11:19,250

535

00:11:19,250  -->  00:11:21,699
extremely powerful so we're not only

536

00:11:21,699  -->  00:11:21,709

537

00:11:21,709  -->  00:11:23,889
reporting on the analysis that we were

538

00:11:23,889  -->  00:11:23,899

539

00:11:23,899  -->  00:11:28,119
contracted to do that is fighting

540

00:11:28,119  -->  00:11:28,129

541

00:11:28,129  -->  00:11:29,350
machines that require maintenance

542

00:11:29,350  -->  00:11:29,360

543

00:11:29,360  -->  00:11:34,210
according to the criteria specified by

544

00:11:34,210  -->  00:11:34,220

545

00:11:34,220  -->  00:11:36,400
the company we're actually going above

546

00:11:36,400  -->  00:11:36,410

547

00:11:36,410  -->  00:11:38,710
and beyond we're saying that this

548

00:11:38,710  -->  00:11:38,720

549

00:11:38,720  -->  00:11:40,449
machine looks like this machine will

550

00:11:40,449  -->  00:11:40,459

551

00:11:40,459  -->  00:11:43,449
require maintenance soon sometime in

552

00:11:43,449  -->  00:11:43,459

553

00:11:43,459  -->  00:11:45,400
October it will cross this line if

554

00:11:45,400  -->  00:11:45,410

555

00:11:45,410  -->  00:11:47,019
everything else continues the same way

556

00:11:47,019  -->  00:11:47,029

557

00:11:47,029  -->  00:11:50,319
it is happening right now and what that

558

00:11:50,319  -->  00:11:50,329

559

00:11:50,329  -->  00:11:52,840
we can help the company of course they

560

00:11:52,840  -->  00:11:52,850

561

00:11:52,850  -->  00:11:54,610
can choose to ignore this inside but

562

00:11:54,610  -->  00:11:54,620

563

00:11:54,620  -->  00:11:56,019
another had its better to have the

564

00:11:56,019  -->  00:11:56,029

565

00:11:56,029  -->  00:11:57,460
inside and ignore it then not to have it

566

00:11:57,460  -->  00:11:57,470

567

00:11:57,470  -->  00:11:59,590
all right? So what they can do is they

568

00:11:59,590  -->  00:11:59,600

569

00:11:59,600  -->  00:12:03,429
can say okay well instead of revisiting

570

00:12:03,429  -->  00:12:03,439

571

00:12:03,439  -->  00:12:05,049
this machine at the end of the month

572

00:12:05,049  -->  00:12:05,059

573

00:12:05,059  -->  00:12:07,869
because perhaps they're only conducting

574

00:12:07,869  -->  00:12:07,879

575

00:12:07,879  -->  00:12:10,059
this in type of analysis once a month if,

576

00:12:10,059  -->  00:12:10,069

577

00:12:10,069  -->  00:12:13,720
if ..if they're lucky so if they're likely

578

00:12:13,720  -->  00:12:13,730

579

00:12:13,730  -->  00:12:15,549
conducting this analysis once a month

580

00:12:15,549  -->  00:12:15,559

581

00:12:15,559  -->  00:12:17,860
the end of every month and only at the

582

00:12:17,860  -->  00:12:17,870

583

00:12:17,870  -->  00:12:19,389
end of October will they pick up this

584

00:12:19,389  -->  00:12:19,399

585

00:12:19,399  -->  00:12:21,100
machine cross this line at the start of

586

00:12:21,100  -->  00:12:21,110

587

00:12:21,110  -->  00:12:23,290
October. Instead from your insight what they

588

00:12:23,290  -->  00:12:23,300

589

00:12:23,300  -->  00:12:25,210
can say okay we're going to do some

590

00:12:25,210  -->  00:12:25,220

591

00:12:25,220  -->  00:12:27,249
preventive maintenance right now we're

592

00:12:27,249  -->  00:12:27,259

593

00:12:27,259  -->  00:12:28,929
going to look into this machine right

594

00:12:28,929  -->  00:12:28,939

595

00:12:28,939  -->  00:12:30,369
now or they can say we're going to visit

596

00:12:30,369  -->  00:12:30,379

597

00:12:30,379  -->  00:12:32,710
the specific machine after the first

598

00:12:32,710  -->  00:12:32,720

599

00:12:32,720  -->  00:12:34,509
week of October and see if that

600

00:12:34,509  -->  00:12:34,519

601

00:12:34,519  -->  00:12:37,030
line it did cross the 10% mark and

602

00:12:37,030  -->  00:12:37,040

603

00:12:37,040  -->  00:12:40,210
that is extremely powerful. That is just

604

00:12:40,210  -->  00:12:40,220

605

00:12:40,220  -->  00:12:41,679
by looking at the data we don't like

606

00:12:41,679  -->  00:12:41,689

607

00:12:41,689  -->  00:12:43,900
you and I we don't know anything about

608

00:12:43,900  -->  00:12:43,910

609

00:12:43,910  -->  00:12:46,990
these reclaimers and stackers and so on

610

00:12:46,990  -->  00:12:47,000

611

00:12:47,000  -->  00:12:48,639
but just by looking at the data and

612

00:12:48,639  -->  00:12:48,649

613

00:12:48,649  -->  00:12:50,829
adding a trendline, we're able to tell

614

00:12:50,829  -->  00:12:50,839

615

00:12:50,839  -->  00:12:52,509
that something's going to happen to this

616

00:12:52,509  -->  00:12:52,519

617

00:12:52,519  -->  00:12:55,420
reclaimer or SR4A machine

618

00:12:55,420  -->  00:12:55,430

619

00:12:55,430  -->  00:12:58,269
Sacker Reclaimer 4A and if you look at

620

00:12:58,269  -->  00:12:58,279

621

00:12:58,279  -->  00:13:00,429
the trend line this one is it is

622

00:13:00,429  -->  00:13:00,439

623

00:13:00,439  -->  00:13:02,920
increasing but it's not as steep as

624

00:13:02,920  -->  00:13:02,930

625

00:13:02,930  -->  00:13:05,139
this one. This trend line is pretty steep

626

00:13:05,139  -->  00:13:05,149

627

00:13:05,149  -->  00:13:07,540
and that means that something's wrong

628

00:13:07,540  -->  00:13:07,550

629

00:13:07,550  -->  00:13:09,769
with the machine, maybe the oil's old, maybe

630

00:13:09,769  -->  00:13:09,779

631

00:13:09,779  -->  00:13:11,569
some nuts and bolts fell out but

632

00:13:11,569  -->  00:13:11,579

633

00:13:11,579  -->  00:13:14,569
something is going on there and we can

634

00:13:14,569  -->  00:13:14,579

635

00:13:14,579  -->  00:13:17,749
see it turning into a disaster very soon

636

00:13:17,749  -->  00:13:17,759

637

00:13:17,759  -->  00:13:20,509
so you guys better get up and do

638

00:13:20,509  -->  00:13:20,519

639

00:13:20,519  -->  00:13:21,739
something about it.

640

00:13:21,739  -->  00:13:21,749

641

00:13:21,749  -->  00:13:24,559
So that's the power of data and the

642

00:13:24,559  -->  00:13:24,569

643

00:13:24,569  -->  00:13:26,900
every time I form analysis something

644

00:13:26,900  -->  00:13:26,910

645

00:13:26,910  -->  00:13:28,489
like this I, you should be proud of

646

00:13:28,489  -->  00:13:28,499

647

00:13:28,499  -->  00:13:29,780
yourselves right now it's

648

00:13:29,780  -->  00:13:29,790

649

00:13:29,790  -->  00:13:31,790
incredible what we can see and every

650

00:13:31,790  -->  00:13:31,800

651

00:13:31,800  -->  00:13:33,590
time I just like this I just have this

652

00:13:33,590  -->  00:13:33,600

653

00:13:33,600  -->  00:13:35,569
smile on my face because it is

654

00:13:35,569  -->  00:13:35,579

655

00:13:35,579  -->  00:13:37,639
impossible to see something like this

656

00:13:37,639  -->  00:13:37,649

657

00:13:37,649  -->  00:13:41,239
like coming without looking at the

658

00:13:41,239  -->  00:13:41,249

659

00:13:41,249  -->  00:13:42,980
data you can't just look at the

660

00:13:42,980  -->  00:13:42,990

661

00:13:42,990  -->  00:13:44,660
machine and say that our something's

662

00:13:44,660  -->  00:13:44,670

663

00:13:44,670  -->  00:13:47,749
wrong with it, it's, it's only the data

664

00:13:47,749  -->  00:13:47,759

665

00:13:47,759  -->  00:13:50,119
can tell you something like this it's, it's

666

00:13:50,119  -->  00:13:50,129

667

00:13:50,129  -->  00:13:54,049
incredible what data science and data

668

00:13:54,049  -->  00:13:54,059

669

00:13:54,059  -->  00:13:56,210
visualization can help you achieve. So

670

00:13:56,210  -->  00:13:56,220

671

00:13:56,220  -->  00:13:57,559
there we go that those are power

672

00:13:57,559  -->  00:13:57,569

673

00:13:57,569  -->  00:14:00,860
insights we report on what we see, we

674

00:14:00,860  -->  00:14:00,870
