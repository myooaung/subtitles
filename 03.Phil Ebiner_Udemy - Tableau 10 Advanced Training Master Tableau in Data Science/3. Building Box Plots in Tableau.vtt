00:00:03.200  -->  00:00:07.660
Hello this is Kirill  and welcome back to

2

00:00:07.660  -->  00:00:07.670

3

00:00:07.670  -->  00:00:09.970
the advanced course on Tableau and before

4

00:00:09.970  -->  00:00:09.980

5

00:00:09.980  -->  00:00:11.499
we proceed with today's tutorial I

6

00:00:11.499  -->  00:00:11.509

7

00:00:11.509  -->  00:00:13.659
thought it would be nice to pause for a

8

00:00:13.659  -->  00:00:13.669

9

00:00:13.669  -->  00:00:16.209
second and take a step back to really

10

00:00:16.209  -->  00:00:16.219

11

00:00:16.219  -->  00:00:18.370
appreciate all the wonderful things that

12

00:00:18.370  -->  00:00:18.380

13

00:00:18.380  -->  00:00:21.580
we have created so far. So here on the

14

00:00:21.580  -->  00:00:21.590

15

00:00:21.590  -->  00:00:23.410
screen you can see all of the visuals

16

00:00:23.410  -->  00:00:23.420

17

00:00:23.420  -->  00:00:26.470
that we've created to date in the basic

18

00:00:26.470  -->  00:00:26.480

19

00:00:26.480  -->  00:00:28.180
tableau course and in the advanced Tableau

20

00:00:28.180  -->  00:00:28.190

21

00:00:28.190  -->  00:00:30.130
course and even though we can only

22

00:00:30.130  -->  00:00:30.140

23

00:00:30.140  -->  00:00:32.560
just see a small snippet or preview of

24

00:00:32.560  -->  00:00:32.570

25

00:00:32.570  -->  00:00:34.720
each single visual they already look

26

00:00:34.720  -->  00:00:34.730

27

00:00:34.730  -->  00:00:38.740
pretty amazing just on this one page and

28

00:00:38.740  -->  00:00:38.750

29

00:00:38.750  -->  00:00:40.720
if you think about it even more than

30

00:00:40.720  -->  00:00:40.730

31

00:00:40.730  -->  00:00:43.360
every single one of these visuals is a

32

00:00:43.360  -->  00:00:43.370

33

00:00:43.370  -->  00:00:45.760
separate data set a separate piece of

34

00:00:45.760  -->  00:00:45.770

35

00:00:45.770  -->  00:00:48.069
analysis but most importantly separate

36

00:00:48.069  -->  00:00:48.079

37

00:00:48.079  -->  00:00:51.700
story which we were able to convey to

38

00:00:51.700  -->  00:00:51.710

39

00:00:51.710  -->  00:00:54.400
our audience and personally I think that

40

00:00:54.400  -->  00:00:54.410

41

00:00:54.410  -->  00:00:57.100
that is just simply amazing it's is

42

00:00:57.100  -->  00:00:57.110

43

00:00:57.110  -->  00:00:58.750
pretty incredible all the work we've

44

00:00:58.750  -->  00:00:58.760

45

00:00:58.760  -->  00:01:01.690
done so far and I really want you guys

46

00:01:01.690  -->  00:01:01.700

47

00:01:01.700  -->  00:01:03.790
to be proud of yourselves

48

00:01:03.790  -->  00:01:03.800

49

00:01:03.800  -->  00:01:05.620
you're definitely doing great job and I

50

00:01:05.620  -->  00:01:05.630

51

00:01:05.630  -->  00:01:07.149
hope you're learning a lot because at

52

00:01:07.149  -->  00:01:07.159

53

00:01:07.159  -->  00:01:08.590
the end of the day you'll be using all

54

00:01:08.590  -->  00:01:08.600

55

00:01:08.600  -->  00:01:10.749
this knowledge to deliver your own

56

00:01:10.749  -->  00:01:10.759

57

00:01:10.759  -->  00:01:13.419
projects and delivery own insights and

58

00:01:13.419  -->  00:01:13.429

59

00:01:13.429  -->  00:01:16.029
hopefully make the world a bit of a

60

00:01:16.029  -->  00:01:16.039

61

00:01:16.039  -->  00:01:16.899
better place.

62

00:01:16.899  -->  00:01:16.909

63

00:01:16.909  -->  00:01:18.550
So those are things that we've done so

64

00:01:18.550  -->  00:01:18.560

65

00:01:18.560  -->  00:01:20.260
far and ahead of us we've got more

66

00:01:20.260  -->  00:01:20.270

67

00:01:20.270  -->  00:01:21.609
interesting adventures.

68

00:01:21.609  -->  00:01:21.619

69

00:01:21.619  -->  00:01:24.160
Let's jump straight back into it. Today

70

00:01:24.160  -->  00:01:24.170

71

00:01:24.170  -->  00:01:26.469
we're talking about box plots. In fact

72

00:01:26.469  -->  00:01:26.479

73

00:01:26.479  -->  00:01:27.969
we're going to create our very first box

74

00:01:27.969  -->  00:01:27.979

75

00:01:27.979  -->  00:01:30.069
plot and in order to do that we're going

76

00:01:30.069  -->  00:01:30.079

77

00:01:30.079  -->  00:01:31.599
to obviously need to connect to the data

78

00:01:31.599  -->  00:01:31.609

79

00:01:31.609  -->  00:01:33.190
set first, so let's go ahead and select

80

00:01:33.190  -->  00:01:33.200

81

00:01:33.200  -->  00:01:37.539
text file and now let's select the

82

00:01:37.539  -->  00:01:37.549

83

00:01:37.549  -->  00:01:39.190
competitor research file which we

84

00:01:39.190  -->  00:01:39.200

85

00:01:39.200  -->  00:01:40.599
downloaded for this section.

86

00:01:40.599  -->  00:01:40.609

87

00:01:40.609  -->  00:01:42.940
Let's open that up, what we can see here

88

00:01:42.940  -->  00:01:42.950

89

00:01:42.950  -->  00:01:45.730
is a table that consists of intelligence

90

00:01:45.730  -->  00:01:45.740

91

00:01:45.740  -->  00:01:49.599
gathered on 30 of our competitors and

92

00:01:49.599  -->  00:01:49.609

93

00:01:49.609  -->  00:01:51.789
when I say intelligent I don't mean

94

00:01:51.789  -->  00:01:51.799

95

00:01:51.799  -->  00:01:54.669
corporate espionage in any way.

96

00:01:54.669  -->  00:01:54.679

97

00:01:54.679  -->  00:01:56.559
All that means is that an analyst from

98

00:01:56.559  -->  00:01:56.569

99

00:01:56.569  -->  00:02:00.159
our company did some research accessed

100

00:02:00.159  -->  00:02:00.169

101

00:02:00.169  -->  00:02:01.929
annual statements of these companies

102

00:02:01.929  -->  00:02:01.939

103

00:02:01.939  -->  00:02:03.819
which are available online and found out

104

00:02:03.819  -->  00:02:03.829

105

00:02:03.829  -->  00:02:06.550
their net profit margins which are

106

00:02:06.550  -->  00:02:06.560

107

00:02:06.560  -->  00:02:08.499
illustrated here for the previous

108

00:02:08.499  -->  00:02:08.509

109

00:02:08.509  -->  00:02:11.199
financial year and these companies they

110

00:02:11.199  -->  00:02:11.209

111

00:02:11.209  -->  00:02:12.530
all operate in a

112

00:02:12.530  -->  00:02:12.540

113

00:02:12.540  -->  00:02:14.600
four states in the four major state so

114

00:02:14.600  -->  00:02:14.610

115

00:02:14.610  -->  00:02:16.309
Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria

116

00:02:16.309  -->  00:02:16.319

117

00:02:16.319  -->  00:02:19.459
New South Whales so the same standards as

118

00:02:19.459  -->  00:02:19.469

119

00:02:19.469  -->  00:02:22.220
New South Wales and Queensland, Western

120

00:02:22.220  -->  00:02:22.230

121

00:02:22.230  -->  00:02:23.990
Australia, Victoria those are the states that we

122

00:02:23.990  -->  00:02:24.000

123

00:02:24.000  -->  00:02:26.149
are analyzing for a potential expansion.

124

00:02:26.149  -->  00:02:26.159

125

00:02:26.159  -->  00:02:29.240
Now we want to visualize this data

126

00:02:29.240  -->  00:02:29.250

127

00:02:29.250  -->  00:02:31.610
so that we can get some insights from it

128

00:02:31.610  -->  00:02:31.620

129

00:02:31.620  -->  00:02:33.979
how can we proceed with that? Well first

130

00:02:33.979  -->  00:02:33.989

131

00:02:33.989  -->  00:02:35.030
of all we can see right away that this

132

00:02:35.030  -->  00:02:35.040

133

00:02:35.040  -->  00:02:36.470
is not the best format for the data.

134

00:02:36.470  -->  00:02:36.480

135

00:02:36.480  -->  00:02:39.470
We know that we would rather have these

136

00:02:39.470  -->  00:02:39.480

137

00:02:39.480  -->  00:02:41.869
states as a separate column rather than

138

00:02:41.869  -->  00:02:41.879

139

00:02:41.879  -->  00:02:44.660
having them as names of columns and

140

00:02:44.660  -->  00:02:44.670

141

00:02:44.670  -->  00:02:46.550
we've already talked about pivoting

142

00:02:46.550  -->  00:02:46.560

143

00:02:46.560  -->  00:02:49.280
data previously in the base course on

144

00:02:49.280  -->  00:02:49.290

145

00:02:49.290  -->  00:02:51.890
Tableau. Well in this section we're going

146

00:02:51.890  -->  00:02:51.900

147

00:02:51.900  -->  00:02:54.860
to really expand on data preparation and

148

00:02:54.860  -->  00:02:54.870

149

00:02:54.870  -->  00:02:57.050
we'll learn some advanced techniques but

150

00:02:57.050  -->  00:02:57.060

151

00:02:57.060  -->  00:02:59.270
for now we're just going to refresh our

152

00:02:59.270  -->  00:02:59.280

153

00:02:59.280  -->  00:03:01.039
knowledge and will create a simple pivot.

154

00:03:01.039  -->  00:03:01.049

155

00:03:01.049  -->  00:03:02.780
So all we have to do is select these

156

00:03:02.780  -->  00:03:02.790

157

00:03:02.790  -->  00:03:04.610
four columns, click the drop-down over

158

00:03:04.610  -->  00:03:04.620

159

00:03:04.620  -->  00:03:07.729
here and pivot the data. What that gives us

160

00:03:07.729  -->  00:03:07.739

161

00:03:07.739  -->  00:03:11.360
is now the state is in its own column

162

00:03:11.360  -->  00:03:11.370

163

00:03:11.370  -->  00:03:12.920
and then we've got the pivoted values

164

00:03:12.920  -->  00:03:12.930

165

00:03:12.930  -->  00:03:16.369
over here, so much more machine friendly

166

00:03:16.369  -->  00:03:16.379

167

00:03:16.379  -->  00:03:17.030
format.

168

00:03:17.030  -->  00:03:17.040

169

00:03:17.040  -->  00:03:18.349
Let's go ahead and rename these fields

170

00:03:18.349  -->  00:03:18.359

171

00:03:18.359  -->  00:03:20.360
will just click the drop-down and say

172

00:03:20.360  -->  00:03:20.370

173

00:03:20.370  -->  00:03:23.990
rename to state and this one we're going

174

00:03:23.990  -->  00:03:24.000

175

00:03:24.000  -->  00:03:28.369
to rename to net profit margin.

176

00:03:28.369  -->  00:03:28.379

177

00:03:28.379  -->  00:03:31.550
Alright that's good, now let's proceed to

178

00:03:31.550  -->  00:03:31.560

179

00:03:31.560  -->  00:03:34.399
our sheet. Now what do we want to

180

00:03:34.399  -->  00:03:34.409

181

00:03:34.409  -->  00:03:36.379
visualize? Well what we want to see is

182

00:03:36.379  -->  00:03:36.389

183

00:03:36.389  -->  00:03:38.000
how these companies performing in

184

00:03:38.000  -->  00:03:38.010

185

00:03:38.010  -->  00:03:39.020
different states.

186

00:03:39.020  -->  00:03:39.030

187

00:03:39.030  -->  00:03:40.789
These are comparable companies to our

188

00:03:40.789  -->  00:03:40.799

189

00:03:40.799  -->  00:03:42.199
company and maybe that'll give us some

190

00:03:42.199  -->  00:03:42.209

191

00:03:42.209  -->  00:03:42.920
insights.

192

00:03:42.920  -->  00:03:42.930

193

00:03:42.930  -->  00:03:44.780
So let's go ahead and drag state into

194

00:03:44.780  -->  00:03:44.790

195

00:03:44.790  -->  00:03:47.240
columns now let's take their profit

196

00:03:47.240  -->  00:03:47.250

197

00:03:47.250  -->  00:03:49.640
margin and drag it into rows now of

198

00:03:49.640  -->  00:03:49.650

199

00:03:49.650  -->  00:03:51.800
course summing a net profit margin

200

00:03:51.800  -->  00:03:51.810

201

00:03:51.810  -->  00:03:54.830
makes absolutely no sense if anything

202

00:03:54.830  -->  00:03:54.840

203

00:03:54.840  -->  00:03:56.750
would want to get the average of the net

204

00:03:56.750  -->  00:03:56.760

205

00:03:56.760  -->  00:03:59.330
profit margin but what we're going to do

206

00:03:59.330  -->  00:03:59.340

207

00:03:59.340  -->  00:04:00.800
is we're actually going to disaggregate

208

00:04:00.800  -->  00:04:00.810

209

00:04:00.810  -->  00:04:03.140
this data and plot every single company

210

00:04:03.140  -->  00:04:03.150

211

00:04:03.150  -->  00:04:05.719
separately. So to disaggregate data were

212

00:04:05.719  -->  00:04:05.729

213

00:04:05.729  -->  00:04:07.159
you know how to do this we just go to

214

00:04:07.159  -->  00:04:07.169

215

00:04:07.169  -->  00:04:09.740
analysis and we uncheck this aggregate

216

00:04:09.740  -->  00:04:09.750

217

00:04:09.750  -->  00:04:13.099
measures option. Once that's unchecked, as

218

00:04:13.099  -->  00:04:13.109

219

00:04:13.109  -->  00:04:14.839
you can see we've got an interesting

220

00:04:14.839  -->  00:04:14.849

221

00:04:14.849  -->  00:04:17.899
chart over here to make it look better

222

00:04:17.899  -->  00:04:17.909

223

00:04:17.909  -->  00:04:19.849
before we proceed which is going to

224

00:04:19.849  -->  00:04:19.859

225

00:04:19.859  -->  00:04:22.279
change this to a circle and we're going

226

00:04:22.279  -->  00:04:22.289

227

00:04:22.289  -->  00:04:24.529
to reduce the size so it looks a bit

228

00:04:24.529  -->  00:04:24.539

229

00:04:24.539  -->  00:04:25.320
better

230

00:04:25.320  -->  00:04:25.330

231

00:04:25.330  -->  00:04:27.270
and one more thing that we are going to

232

00:04:27.270  -->  00:04:27.280

233

00:04:27.280  -->  00:04:29.010
do here is we're going to take state

234

00:04:29.010  -->  00:04:29.020

235

00:04:29.020  -->  00:04:31.559
hold down control and drag it into color. In

236

00:04:31.559  -->  00:04:31.569

237

00:04:31.569  -->  00:04:33.450
fact, I might make it a bit bigger so

238

00:04:33.450  -->  00:04:33.460

239

00:04:33.460  -->  00:04:36.480
there we go something like that and finally

240

00:04:36.480  -->  00:04:36.490

241

00:04:36.490  -->  00:04:39.119
I'm also going to format this and make

242

00:04:39.119  -->  00:04:39.129

243

00:04:39.129  -->  00:04:40.439
it a 10.

244

00:04:40.439  -->  00:04:40.449

245

00:04:40.449  -->  00:04:45.209
Perhaps as good and now what we also

246

00:04:45.209  -->  00:04:45.219

247

00:04:45.219  -->  00:04:48.540
want to do is change this to a

248

00:04:48.540  -->  00:04:48.550

249

00:04:48.550  -->  00:04:50.040
percentage because we know that our

250

00:04:50.040  -->  00:04:50.050

251

00:04:50.050  -->  00:04:52.529
data is stored in terms of

252

00:04:52.529  -->  00:04:52.539

253

00:04:52.539  -->  00:04:54.209
percentages.

254

00:04:54.209  -->  00:04:54.219

255

00:04:54.219  -->  00:04:56.610
There we go so what do we see here well

256

00:04:56.610  -->  00:04:56.620

257

00:04:56.620  -->  00:04:58.469
we see every single state separately and

258

00:04:58.469  -->  00:04:58.479

259

00:04:58.479  -->  00:05:01.020
we can see how every single one of these

260

00:05:01.020  -->  00:05:01.030

261

00:05:01.030  -->  00:05:03.390
companies is performing in terms of net

262

00:05:03.390  -->  00:05:03.400

263

00:05:03.400  -->  00:05:04.950
profit margin in each one of these

264

00:05:04.950  -->  00:05:04.960

265

00:05:04.960  -->  00:05:07.260
states and as you can imagine since

266

00:05:07.260  -->  00:05:07.270

267

00:05:07.270  -->  00:05:09.390
there are 30 competitors and their 40

268

00:05:09.390  -->  00:05:09.400

269

00:05:09.400  -->  00:05:10.709
states they should be a hundred and

270

00:05:10.709  -->  00:05:10.719

271

00:05:10.719  -->  00:05:13.320
twenty marks over here in total. If we go

272

00:05:13.320  -->  00:05:13.330

273

00:05:13.330  -->  00:05:15.180
down to the bottom, you'll see that

274

00:05:15.180  -->  00:05:15.190

275

00:05:15.190  -->  00:05:16.830
there's a hundred twenty marks which is

276

00:05:16.830  -->  00:05:16.840

277

00:05:16.840  -->  00:05:20.939
correct. Now how can we drive inside from

278

00:05:20.939  -->  00:05:20.949

279

00:05:20.949  -->  00:05:23.369
here right away? You can kind of see sum

280

00:05:23.369  -->  00:05:23.379

281

00:05:23.379  -->  00:05:26.010
things from here that perhaps by

282

00:05:26.010  -->  00:05:26.020

283

00:05:26.020  -->  00:05:27.749
New South Wales you've got like the

284

00:05:27.749  -->  00:05:27.759

285

00:05:27.759  -->  00:05:31.050
highest maximum and kill D I wasn't

286

00:05:31.050  -->  00:05:31.060

287

00:05:31.060  -->  00:05:33.600
ready but those are just insights that

288

00:05:33.600  -->  00:05:33.610

289

00:05:33.610  -->  00:05:36.959
are very very low-level insights we want

290

00:05:36.959  -->  00:05:36.969

291

00:05:36.969  -->  00:05:40.200
to get into detail and we want to

292

00:05:40.200  -->  00:05:40.210

293

00:05:40.210  -->  00:05:41.490
understand exactly one some

294

00:05:41.490  -->  00:05:41.500

295

00:05:41.500  -->  00:05:43.740
statistically significant insights which

296

00:05:43.740  -->  00:05:43.750

297

00:05:43.750  -->  00:05:46.829
we can rely upon. Now in order to do that,

298

00:05:46.829  -->  00:05:46.839

299

00:05:46.839  -->  00:05:48.240
we're going to perform some analytics.

300

00:05:48.240  -->  00:05:48.250

301

00:05:48.250  -->  00:05:50.459
We're going to create a box plot and the

302

00:05:50.459  -->  00:05:50.469

303

00:05:50.469  -->  00:05:52.379
plan is that we today we're going to

304

00:05:52.379  -->  00:05:52.389

305

00:05:52.389  -->  00:05:54.059
create the box plot and in the next

306

00:05:54.059  -->  00:05:54.069

307

00:05:54.069  -->  00:05:56.339
tutorial we will learn how to analyze

308

00:05:56.339  -->  00:05:56.349

309

00:05:56.349  -->  00:05:58.829
the box plot and how to derive insights

310

00:05:58.829  -->  00:05:58.839

311

00:05:58.839  -->  00:06:01.350
from it. So to create a box plot, we're

312

00:06:01.350  -->  00:06:01.360

313

00:06:01.360  -->  00:06:04.140
going to go to analytics over here and

314

00:06:04.140  -->  00:06:04.150

315

00:06:04.150  -->  00:06:06.420
we're going to take box plot and we'll

316

00:06:06.420  -->  00:06:06.430

317

00:06:06.430  -->  00:06:08.610
just drag it onto the chart as you can

318

00:06:08.610  -->  00:06:08.620

319

00:06:08.620  -->  00:06:10.769
see this window appears which says add a

320

00:06:10.769  -->  00:06:10.779

321

00:06:10.779  -->  00:06:12.659
box plot and you only have one option

322

00:06:12.659  -->  00:06:12.669

323

00:06:12.669  -->  00:06:14.640
here cell so let's drag that into there

324

00:06:14.640  -->  00:06:14.650

325

00:06:14.650  -->  00:06:16.469
and there you go

326

00:06:16.469  -->  00:06:16.479

327

00:06:16.479  -->  00:06:19.559
our box plots have been created for us.

328

00:06:19.559  -->  00:06:19.569

329

00:06:19.569  -->  00:06:23.909
Now what I wanted to mention in this

330

00:06:23.909  -->  00:06:23.919

331

00:06:23.919  -->  00:06:25.860
tutorial as well is that this analytics

332

00:06:25.860  -->  00:06:25.870

333

00:06:25.870  -->  00:06:28.709
pane is actually new in Tableau nine. It

334

00:06:28.709  -->  00:06:28.719

335

00:06:28.719  -->  00:06:30.510
was introduced in version 9 of the

336

00:06:30.510  -->  00:06:30.520

337

00:06:30.520  -->  00:06:32.700
software and it's got some very

338

00:06:32.700  -->  00:06:32.710

339

00:06:32.710  -->  00:06:35.159
interesting and powerful features which

340

00:06:35.159  -->  00:06:35.169

341

00:06:35.169  -->  00:06:37.559
we will be looking at in this section. So

342

00:06:37.559  -->  00:06:37.569

343

00:06:37.569  -->  00:06:38.970
we'll be working quite a

344

00:06:38.970  -->  00:06:38.980

345

00:06:38.980  -->  00:06:41.880
bit with this analytics pane, as you saw

346

00:06:41.880  -->  00:06:41.890

347

00:06:41.890  -->  00:06:44.250
we just create a boxplot. It's got some

348

00:06:44.250  -->  00:06:44.260

349

00:06:44.260  -->  00:06:46.860
trend lines, forecast, distribution

350

00:06:46.860  -->  00:06:46.870

351

00:06:46.870  -->  00:06:49.470
bands. So we'll talk about quite a lot of

352

00:06:49.470  -->  00:06:49.480

353

00:06:49.480  -->  00:06:52.080
the features in here and I'll also show

354

00:06:52.080  -->  00:06:52.090

355

00:06:52.090  -->  00:06:54.690
you other ways that you can access these

356

00:06:54.690  -->  00:06:54.700

357

00:06:54.700  -->  00:06:57.450
features but just bear in mind that it

358

00:06:57.450  -->  00:06:57.460

359

00:06:57.460  -->  00:06:59.010
is there and if you want to go back to

360

00:06:59.010  -->  00:06:59.020

361

00:06:59.020  -->  00:07:01.320
data all you have  to do is click the data tab

362

00:07:01.320  -->  00:07:01.330

363

00:07:01.330  -->  00:07:03.690
over here and then you can go back to

364

00:07:03.690  -->  00:07:03.700

365

00:07:03.700  -->  00:07:05.820
analytics tab. So that's all for today,

366

00:07:05.820  -->  00:07:05.830

367

00:07:05.830  -->  00:07:07.530
this was a quick tutorial to get us

368

00:07:07.530  -->  00:07:07.540

369

00:07:07.540  -->  00:07:09.840
started into the section and next time

370

00:07:09.840  -->  00:07:09.850

371

00:07:09.850  -->  00:07:11.010
we're going to learn how to analyze

372

00:07:11.010  -->  00:07:11.020

373

00:07:11.020  -->  00:07:13.650
these box plots and derive inside. I look

374

00:07:13.650  -->  00:07:13.660

375

00:07:13.660  -->  00:07:15.570
forward to seeing you next time. Until then, happy

376

00:07:15.570  -->  00:07:15.580

377

00:07:15.580  -->  00:07:21.120
analyzing.
