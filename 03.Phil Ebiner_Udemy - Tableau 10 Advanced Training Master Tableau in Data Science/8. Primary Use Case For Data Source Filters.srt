00:00:02,590  -->  00:00:07,080
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:07,090

3

00:00:07,090  -->  00:00:08,879
course on Tableau. I hope you had a chance

4

00:00:08,879  -->  00:00:08,889

5

00:00:08,889  -->  00:00:11,730
to play around with the visualization

6

00:00:11,730  -->  00:00:11,740

7

00:00:11,740  -->  00:00:13,470
that we've created and look at the

8

00:00:13,470  -->  00:00:13,480

9

00:00:13,480  -->  00:00:16,650
different industries in different states

10

00:00:16,650  -->  00:00:16,660

11

00:00:16,660  -->  00:00:19,050
and see what patterns you are able to

12

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:19,060

13

00:00:19,060  -->  00:00:22,050
find and today the topic that we're

14

00:00:22,050  -->  00:00:22,060

15

00:00:22,060  -->  00:00:24,120
going to discuss is the primary use case

16

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:24,130

17

00:00:24,130  -->  00:00:27,510
for data source filters. As you remember

18

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:27,520

19

00:00:27,520  -->  00:00:29,820
previously we use the data source filter

20

00:00:29,820  -->  00:00:29,830

21

00:00:29,830  -->  00:00:33,959
to ease our work with a large data set

22

00:00:33,959  -->  00:00:33,969

23

00:00:33,969  -->  00:00:37,260
and that way we were able to restrict

24

00:00:37,260  -->  00:00:37,270

25

00:00:37,270  -->  00:00:39,510
the number of rows that we're creating a

26

00:00:39,510  -->  00:00:39,520

27

00:00:39,520  -->  00:00:41,580
visualization for and then remove the

28

00:00:41,580  -->  00:00:41,590

29

00:00:41,590  -->  00:00:43,709
restriction once the visualization was ready and

30

00:00:43,709  -->  00:00:43,719

31

00:00:43,719  -->  00:00:45,720
that's a handy trick for you to take

32

00:00:45,720  -->  00:00:45,730

33

00:00:45,730  -->  00:00:48,150
away and use whenever you're working with

34

00:00:48,150  -->  00:00:48,160

35

00:00:48,160  -->  00:00:51,750
large data sets and today we will learn

36

00:00:51,750  -->  00:00:51,760

37

00:00:51,760  -->  00:00:56,880
how to use the data source filter in its

38

00:00:56,880  -->  00:00:56,890

39

00:00:56,890  -->  00:01:00,779
primary purpose. And the primary purpose

40

00:01:00,779  -->  00:01:00,789

41

00:01:00,789  -->  00:01:03,479
for data source filters is to completely

42

00:01:03,479  -->  00:01:03,489

43

00:01:03,489  -->  00:01:06,569
remove categories or rows that

44

00:01:06,569  -->  00:01:06,579

45

00:01:06,579  -->  00:01:08,249
you're definitely not going to be using

46

00:01:08,249  -->  00:01:08,259

47

00:01:08,259  -->  00:01:09,929
in your analysis. So let's have a look

48

00:01:09,929  -->  00:01:09,939

49

00:01:09,939  -->  00:01:12,480
here, we already know that the only

50

00:01:12,480  -->  00:01:12,490

51

00:01:12,490  -->  00:01:14,249
industry that we're interested in in our

52

00:01:14,249  -->  00:01:14,259

53

00:01:14,259  -->  00:01:16,889
analysis is clothing retailing. We're not

54

00:01:16,889  -->  00:01:16,899

55

00:01:16,899  -->  00:01:18,449
interested in cafes, we're not even

56

00:01:18,449  -->  00:01:18,459

57

00:01:18,459  -->  00:01:20,639
interested in a clothing footwear and

58

00:01:20,639  -->  00:01:20,649

59

00:01:20,649  -->  00:01:22,649
personal accessory retailing because

60

00:01:22,649  -->  00:01:22,659

61

00:01:22,659  -->  00:01:24,510
that's a different industry. The one

62

00:01:24,510  -->  00:01:24,520

63

00:01:24,520  -->  00:01:26,489
we're interested in is clothing

64

00:01:26,489  -->  00:01:26,499

65

00:01:26,499  -->  00:01:29,489
retailing, so we don't need all of this

66

00:01:29,489  -->  00:01:29,499

67

00:01:29,499  -->  00:01:32,399
other information on our chart and the

68

00:01:32,399  -->  00:01:32,409

69

00:01:32,409  -->  00:01:35,039
natural way to get rid of it is to use a

70

00:01:35,039  -->  00:01:35,049

71

00:01:35,049  -->  00:01:36,839
filter. So you can take industry put into

72

00:01:36,839  -->  00:01:36,849

73

00:01:36,849  -->  00:01:39,389
filters select nothing and then just

74

00:01:39,389  -->  00:01:39,399

75

00:01:39,399  -->  00:01:41,429
leave clothing and re..clothing

76

00:01:41,500  -->  00:01:44,309
and retailing and here you will have only

77

00:01:44,309  -->  00:01:44,319

78

00:01:44,319  -->  00:01:47,190
the desired industry for all the different

79

00:01:47,190  -->  00:01:47,200

80

00:01:47,200  -->  00:01:49,589
states. However, that's not the best way

81

00:01:49,589  -->  00:01:49,599

82

00:01:49,599  -->  00:01:51,510
to go about it because first of all now

83

00:01:51,510  -->  00:01:51,520

84

00:01:51,520  -->  00:01:53,489
we have a filter that we need to carry

85

00:01:53,489  -->  00:01:53,499

86

00:01:53,499  -->  00:01:55,649
around with us and probably the best way

87

00:01:55,649  -->  00:01:55,659

88

00:01:55,659  -->  00:01:58,679
to do it here is to apply to worksheets

89

00:01:58,679  -->  00:01:58,689

90

00:01:58,689  -->  00:02:01,169
and say all using this data source so

91

00:02:01,169  -->  00:02:01,179

92

00:02:01,179  -->  00:02:02,760
that you're different guaranteed that

93

00:02:02,760  -->  00:02:02,770

94

00:02:02,770  -->  00:02:04,649
this filter is applied across all of

95

00:02:04,649  -->  00:02:04,659

96

00:02:04,659  -->  00:02:06,719
your worksheets and plus like it's

97

00:02:06,719  -->  00:02:06,729

98

00:02:06,729  -->  00:02:08,729
already sitting in the filter shelf so

99

00:02:08,729  -->  00:02:08,739

100

00:02:08,739  -->  00:02:09,930
it's

101

00:02:09,930  -->  00:02:09,940

102

00:02:09,940  -->  00:02:12,810
distracting and taking up space and the

103

00:02:12,810  -->  00:02:12,820

104

00:02:12,820  -->  00:02:14,760
other thing is that Tableau is still

105

00:02:14,760  -->  00:02:14,770

106

00:02:14,770  -->  00:02:17,760
processing those rows so Tableau is

107

00:02:17,760  -->  00:02:17,770

108

00:02:17,770  -->  00:02:20,520
processing the rows and then applying a

109

00:02:20,520  -->  00:02:20,530

110

00:02:20,530  -->  00:02:22,350
filter every single time and that is

111

00:02:22,350  -->  00:02:22,360

112

00:02:22,360  -->  00:02:25,680
taking up processing power and of course

113

00:02:25,680  -->  00:02:25,690

114

00:02:25,690  -->  00:02:27,660
it's slowing down your dashboard. So we

115

00:02:27,660  -->  00:02:27,670

116

00:02:27,670  -->  00:02:30,120
want to get rid of those rows at the

117

00:02:30,120  -->  00:02:30,130

118

00:02:30,130  -->  00:02:32,580
data source level so Tableau doesn't

119

00:02:32,580  -->  00:02:32,590

120

00:02:32,590  -->  00:02:35,490
even know about them so they're not even

121

00:02:35,490  -->  00:02:35,500

122

00:02:35,500  -->  00:02:38,250
part of any calculation whatsoever so

123

00:02:38,250  -->  00:02:38,260

124

00:02:38,260  -->  00:02:40,290
that exclusion is done at the very

125

00:02:40,290  -->  00:02:40,300

126

00:02:40,300  -->  00:02:42,960
beginning and then it doesn't affect the

127

00:02:42,960  -->  00:02:42,970

128

00:02:42,970  -->  00:02:45,240
visualization at all. So that's where why

129

00:02:45,240  -->  00:02:45,250

130

00:02:45,250  -->  00:02:47,400
we're going to proceed back to our

131

00:02:47,400  -->  00:02:47,410

132

00:02:47,410  -->  00:02:49,680
data source we'll just right click here and

133

00:02:49,680  -->  00:02:49,690

134

00:02:49,690  -->  00:02:52,560
we'll say edit data source filters and

135

00:02:52,560  -->  00:02:52,570

136

00:02:52,570  -->  00:02:54,750
here we'll just add a filter and we will

137

00:02:54,750  -->  00:02:54,760

138

00:02:54,760  -->  00:02:56,370
say industry,

139

00:02:56,370  -->  00:02:56,380

140

00:02:56,380  -->  00:02:59,130
ok so same thing as we did just now

141

00:02:59,130  -->  00:02:59,140

142

00:02:59,140  -->  00:03:01,680
clothing retailing ok but now the

143

00:03:01,680  -->  00:03:01,690

144

00:03:01,690  -->  00:03:03,450
difference is that our filter is going

145

00:03:03,450  -->  00:03:03,460

146

00:03:03,460  -->  00:03:05,520
to be at the data source level we click

147

00:03:05,520  -->  00:03:05,530

148

00:03:05,530  -->  00:03:09,570
ok and as you'll see our visualization will

149

00:03:09,570  -->  00:03:09,580

150

00:03:09,580  -->  00:03:11,670
be updated in a second Tableau is

151

00:03:11,670  -->  00:03:11,680

152

00:03:11,680  -->  00:03:14,580
performing the pre calculations and

153

00:03:14,580  -->  00:03:14,590

154

00:03:14,590  -->  00:03:17,280
there you go, so that into those other

155

00:03:17,280  -->  00:03:17,290

156

00:03:17,290  -->  00:03:19,140
industries are gone and now even if you

157

00:03:19,140  -->  00:03:19,150

158

00:03:19,150  -->  00:03:21,510
want to visualize industries you will

159

00:03:21,510  -->  00:03:21,520

160

00:03:21,520  -->  00:03:23,190
see that there's only one industry so

161

00:03:23,190  -->  00:03:23,200

162

00:03:23,200  -->  00:03:24,990
I'll just create a new tab, I'll drag

163

00:03:24,990  -->  00:03:25,000

164

00:03:25,000  -->  00:03:26,280
industry here and you'll see that

165

00:03:26,280  -->  00:03:26,290

166

00:03:26,290  -->  00:03:28,050
there's only clothing and retailing.

167

00:03:28,050  -->  00:03:28,060

168

00:03:28,060  -->  00:03:30,090
There's no other options and note

169

00:03:30,090  -->  00:03:30,100

170

00:03:30,100  -->  00:03:32,070
there's no filter here. That means Tableau

171

00:03:32,070  -->  00:03:32,080

172

00:03:32,080  -->  00:03:33,600
doesn't even know about the other

173

00:03:33,600  -->  00:03:33,610

174

00:03:33,610  -->  00:03:35,190
industries because they'd be filtered out

175

00:03:35,190  -->  00:03:35,200

176

00:03:35,200  -->  00:03:38,970
at the data source level. So great, now

177

00:03:38,970  -->  00:03:38,980

178

00:03:38,980  -->  00:03:42,000
let's get rid of this. Delete sheet,

179

00:03:42,000  -->  00:03:42,010

180

00:03:42,010  -->  00:03:45,540
alright so that was the first example

181

00:03:45,540  -->  00:03:45,550

182

00:03:45,550  -->  00:03:47,070
how we're going to use data source filters.

183

00:03:47,070  -->  00:03:47,080

184

00:03:47,080  -->  00:03:49,890
The second one is going to come on just

185

00:03:49,890  -->  00:03:49,900

186

00:03:49,900  -->  00:03:52,710
now let's fix up the colors because as

187

00:03:52,710  -->  00:03:52,720

188

00:03:52,720  -->  00:03:54,660
we can see they're not the best right

189

00:03:54,660  -->  00:03:54,670

190

00:03:54,670  -->  00:03:56,610
now it's just orange everywhere, so

191

00:03:56,610  -->  00:03:56,620

192

00:03:56,620  -->  00:03:59,820
instead of industry here, we can

193

00:03:59,820  -->  00:03:59,830

194

00:03:59,830  -->  00:04:02,190
take industry completely out of our

195

00:04:02,200  -->  00:04:04,680
visualization because it doesn't change

196

00:04:04,680  -->  00:04:04,690

197

00:04:04,690  -->  00:04:06,210
it's always the same industry. But now

198

00:04:06,210  -->  00:04:06,220

199

00:04:06,220  -->  00:04:08,340
into coloring, we're going take state and going to

200

00:04:08,340  -->  00:04:08,350

201

00:04:08,350  -->  00:04:11,370
drag it into color and this is much

202

00:04:11,370  -->  00:04:11,380

203

00:04:11,380  -->  00:04:12,030
better now.

204

00:04:12,030  -->  00:04:12,040

205

00:04:12,040  -->  00:04:15,090
Alright and the second thing is there's

206

00:04:15,090  -->  00:04:15,100

207

00:04:15,100  -->  00:04:16,860
a bit too many dates here.

208

00:04:16,860  -->  00:04:16,870

209

00:04:16,870  -->  00:04:19,409
The trends in the industry in the

210

00:04:19,409  -->  00:04:19,419

211

00:04:19,419  -->  00:04:21,659
nineties, in the or in the eighties in

212

00:04:21,659  -->  00:04:21,669

213

00:04:21,669  -->  00:04:22,900
the nineties,

214

00:04:22,900  -->  00:04:22,910

215

00:04:22,910  -->  00:04:25,090
doesn't, though they don't really affect

216

00:04:25,090  -->  00:04:25,100

217

00:04:25,100  -->  00:04:30,340
or they don't really impact how we see

218

00:04:30,340  -->  00:04:30,350

219

00:04:30,350  -->  00:04:32,920
the future for the industry now because

220

00:04:32,920  -->  00:04:32,930

221

00:04:32,930  -->  00:04:34,870
things were very different back then and

222

00:04:34,870  -->  00:04:34,880

223

00:04:34,880  -->  00:04:36,490
15 years

224

00:04:36,490  -->  00:04:36,500

225

00:04:36,500  -->  00:04:38,530
let's agree on this 15 years is more

226

00:04:38,530  -->  00:04:38,540

227

00:04:38,540  -->  00:04:40,870
than enough to make our prediction and

228

00:04:40,870  -->  00:04:40,880

229

00:04:40,880  -->  00:04:43,660
forecast so, let's take the past 15 years

230

00:04:43,660  -->  00:04:43,670

231

00:04:43,670  -->  00:04:47,410
and let's keep everything from a 2000

232

00:04:47,410  -->  00:04:47,420

233

00:04:47,420  -->  00:04:49,150
onwards and get rid of everything else.

234

00:04:49,150  -->  00:04:49,160

235

00:04:49,160  -->  00:04:50,860
Once again, what we can do is take date

236

00:04:50,860  -->  00:04:50,870

237

00:04:50,870  -->  00:04:54,220
and it's a range of dates and we will

238

00:04:54,220  -->  00:04:54,230

239

00:04:54,230  -->  00:04:58,630
filter from 2010, from 2000 so

240

00:04:58,630  -->  00:04:58,640

241

00:04:58,640  -->  00:05:01,450
somewhere from there, I'll just do it roughly

242

00:05:01,450  -->  00:05:01,460

243

00:05:01,460  -->  00:05:03,490
feel like that. We can do like that but

244

00:05:03,490  -->  00:05:03,500

245

00:05:03,500  -->  00:05:04,870
once again the filter will be here every

246

00:05:04,870  -->  00:05:04,880

247

00:05:04,880  -->  00:05:06,640
single time. We don't want that so we're

248

00:05:06,640  -->  00:05:06,650

249

00:05:06,650  -->  00:05:10,990
going to go and we will create a data

250

00:05:10,990  -->  00:05:11,000

251

00:05:11,000  -->  00:05:13,690
source filter so right click here edit

252

00:05:13,690  -->  00:05:13,700

253

00:05:13,700  -->  00:05:16,030
data source filters and add another one.

254

00:05:16,030  -->  00:05:16,040

255

00:05:16,040  -->  00:05:20,590
So here we're going to select date and

256

00:05:20,590  -->  00:05:20,600

257

00:05:20,600  -->  00:05:26,500
range of dates, we are going to go next and

258

00:05:26,500  -->  00:05:26,510

259

00:05:26,510  -->  00:05:31,960
here we just want 2000, first of first,

260

00:05:31,960  -->  00:05:32,460

261

00:05:33,190  -->  00:05:33,200

262

00:05:33,200  -->  00:05:34,930
there we go so those are the dates that we're

263

00:05:34,930  -->  00:05:34,940

264

00:05:34,940  -->  00:05:37,480
going to keep, click OK and click OK

265

00:05:37,480  -->  00:05:37,490

266

00:05:37,490  -->  00:05:40,420
again and once again you see that the

267

00:05:40,420  -->  00:05:40,430

268

00:05:40,430  -->  00:05:42,820
correct dates are displayed and other

269

00:05:42,820  -->  00:05:42,830

270

00:05:42,830  -->  00:05:45,490
dates that were here behind, they are

271

00:05:45,490  -->  00:05:45,500

272

00:05:45,500  -->  00:05:48,100
gone. They're not even part of the data

273

00:05:48,100  -->  00:05:48,110

274

00:05:48,110  -->  00:05:51,370
set that we're visualizing. That is the

275

00:05:51,370  -->  00:05:51,380

276

00:05:51,380  -->  00:05:54,250
primary use case for data source filters,

277

00:05:54,250  -->  00:05:54,260

278

00:05:54,260  -->  00:05:57,190
it allows you to narrow down the data

279

00:05:57,190  -->  00:05:57,200

280

00:05:57,200  -->  00:05:58,659
that you're not analyzing. It's kind of

281

00:05:58,659  -->  00:05:58,669

282

00:05:58,669  -->  00:06:01,450
similar to taking excel and just getting

283

00:06:01,450  -->  00:06:01,460

284

00:06:01,460  -->  00:06:04,090
rid completely deleting the rows that

285

00:06:04,090  -->  00:06:04,100

286

00:06:04,100  -->  00:06:06,850
you're not you don't want to analyze or

287

00:06:06,850  -->  00:06:06,860

288

00:06:06,860  -->  00:06:09,640
the columns because we did do a pivot

289

00:06:09,640  -->  00:06:09,650

290

00:06:09,650  -->  00:06:12,940
but sometimes you can't but not always

291

00:06:12,940  -->  00:06:12,950

292

00:06:12,950  -->  00:06:15,400
you can do that because sometimes your

293

00:06:15,400  -->  00:06:15,410

294

00:06:15,410  -->  00:06:17,320
data might be in a database that you

295

00:06:17,320  -->  00:06:17,330

296

00:06:17,330  -->  00:06:19,960
can't modify and things like that so you

297

00:06:19,960  -->  00:06:19,970

298

00:06:19,970  -->  00:06:22,420
have to work with it somehow in Tableau and

299

00:06:22,420  -->  00:06:22,430

300

00:06:22,430  -->  00:06:25,180
that is a very powerful way to work with

301

00:06:25,180  -->  00:06:25,190

302

00:06:25,190  -->  00:06:28,659
it through data source filters.

303

00:06:28,659  -->  00:06:28,669

304

00:06:28,669  -->  00:06:31,690
Alright, so that's all for today and now

305

00:06:31,690  -->  00:06:31,700

306

00:06:31,700  -->  00:06:33,760
that we've prepared our data set and

307

00:06:33,760  -->  00:06:33,770

308

00:06:33,770  -->  00:06:35,500
we've trimmed it down to the rows that

309

00:06:35,500  -->  00:06:35,510

310

00:06:35,510  -->  00:06:35,879
we

311

00:06:35,879  -->  00:06:35,889

312

00:06:35,889  -->  00:06:37,980
you want to analyze, in the next tutorial

313

00:06:37,980  -->  00:06:37,990

314

00:06:37,990  -->  00:06:40,980
we will continue with our investigations.

315

00:06:40,980  -->  00:06:40,990

316

00:06:40,990  -->  00:06:43,140
And I look forward to seeing you next

317

00:06:43,140  -->  00:06:43,150

318

00:06:43,150  -->  00:06:48,479
time.
