00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.740
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06.740  -->  00:00:06.750

3

00:00:06.750  -->  00:00:08.600
course on Tableau. In the previous

4

00:00:08.600  -->  00:00:08.610

5

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:10.879
tutorial, we finalized our animation and

6

00:00:10.879  -->  00:00:10.889

7

00:00:10.889  -->  00:00:12.919
today we're going to put it into a

8

00:00:12.919  -->  00:00:12.929

9

00:00:12.929  -->  00:00:15.200
dashboard to present our audience but

10

00:00:15.200  -->  00:00:15.210

11

00:00:15.210  -->  00:00:16.550
before we continue with today's tutorial

12

00:00:16.550  -->  00:00:16.560

13

00:00:16.560  -->  00:00:18.920
I would like to ask you for a favor and

14

00:00:18.920  -->  00:00:18.930

15

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:20.720
over you brought this up but if you have

16

00:00:20.720  -->  00:00:20.730

17

00:00:20.730  -->  00:00:22.010
enjoyed this course, I would really

18

00:00:22.010  -->  00:00:22.020

19

00:00:22.020  -->  00:00:23.750
appreciate if you could leave a review

20

00:00:23.750  -->  00:00:23.760

21

00:00:23.760  -->  00:00:26.029
for this course. It's very easy to do in

22

00:00:26.029  -->  00:00:26.039

23

00:00:26.039  -->  00:00:27.380
the top right corner, you just have to

24

00:00:27.380  -->  00:00:27.390

25

00:00:27.390  -->  00:00:29.660
click rate course and select number of

26

00:00:29.660  -->  00:00:29.670

27

00:00:29.670  -->  00:00:31.460
stars you think the course deserves and

28

00:00:31.460  -->  00:00:31.470

29

00:00:31.470  -->  00:00:34.280
maybe leave a quick comment if you feel

30

00:00:34.280  -->  00:00:34.290

31

00:00:34.290  -->  00:00:37.100
that you want to do so to help other

32

00:00:37.100  -->  00:00:37.110

33

00:00:37.110  -->  00:00:38.869
students understand whether this course

34

00:00:38.869  -->  00:00:38.879

35

00:00:38.879  -->  00:00:41.240
is worthwhile or not and what you

36

00:00:41.240  -->  00:00:41.250

37

00:00:41.250  -->  00:00:42.229
thought of it I would really appreciate

38

00:00:42.229  -->  00:00:42.239

39

00:00:42.239  -->  00:00:45.560
your feedback. It would mean the world to

40

00:00:45.560  -->  00:00:45.570

41

00:00:45.570  -->  00:00:47.690
me, thank you very much if you can do

42

00:00:47.690  -->  00:00:47.700

43

00:00:47.700  -->  00:00:49.670
that for me today and now let's proceed

44

00:00:49.670  -->  00:00:49.680

45

00:00:49.680  -->  00:00:51.319
on with the show.

46

00:00:51.319  -->  00:00:51.329

47

00:00:51.329  -->  00:00:54.500
Alright so here we've got our animation,

48

00:00:54.500  -->  00:00:54.510

49

00:00:54.510  -->  00:00:56.299
now let's put into a dashboard first

50

00:00:56.299  -->  00:00:56.309

51

00:00:56.309  -->  00:00:57.830
thing we're going to do is change the

52

00:00:57.830  -->  00:00:57.840

53

00:00:57.840  -->  00:00:59.660
name of the sheet so we don't forget to

54

00:00:59.660  -->  00:00:59.670

55

00:00:59.670  -->  00:01:01.430
call animation. Now we're going to create

56

00:01:01.430  -->  00:01:01.440

57

00:01:01.440  -->  00:01:04.609
a dashboard and this one will call world

58

00:01:04.609  -->  00:01:04.619

59

00:01:04.619  -->  00:01:09.590
demographics. Great! And now let's drag

60

00:01:09.590  -->  00:01:09.600

61

00:01:09.600  -->  00:01:13.010
our animation into this dashboard. Alright,

62

00:01:13.010  -->  00:01:13.020

63

00:01:13.020  -->  00:01:15.679
its computing and once it's done,

64

00:01:15.679  -->  00:01:15.689

65

00:01:15.689  -->  00:01:17.899
I'm going to expand my Tableau workbook a

66

00:01:17.899  -->  00:01:17.909

67

00:01:17.909  -->  00:01:20.539
little bit so that I can see everything

68

00:01:20.539  -->  00:01:20.549

69

00:01:20.549  -->  00:01:21.740
we can see everything better.

70

00:01:21.740  -->  00:01:21.750

71

00:01:21.750  -->  00:01:23.990
Alright, so what can we see right away. We

72

00:01:23.990  -->  00:01:24.000

73

00:01:24.000  -->  00:01:25.700
can see that this indicator population

74

00:01:25.700  -->  00:01:25.710

75

00:01:25.710  -->  00:01:27.649
is not really helping us. Nobody is going

76

00:01:27.649  -->  00:01:27.659

77

00:01:27.659  -->  00:01:30.230
to go ahead and compare the size of the

78

00:01:30.230  -->  00:01:30.240

79

00:01:30.240  -->  00:01:32.780
bubbles to this legend. So let's go ahead

80

00:01:32.780  -->  00:01:32.790

81

00:01:32.790  -->  00:01:34.580
and get rid of it.

82

00:01:34.580  -->  00:01:34.590

83

00:01:34.590  -->  00:01:37.730
Next we will take this control panel and

84

00:01:37.730  -->  00:01:37.740

85

00:01:37.740  -->  00:01:39.080
we'll drag it to the top because it is

86

00:01:39.080  -->  00:01:39.090

87

00:01:39.090  -->  00:01:41.690
important that is our control for our

88

00:01:41.690  -->  00:01:41.700

89

00:01:41.700  -->  00:01:45.889
animation. What else we want to do here

90

00:01:45.889  -->  00:01:45.899

91

00:01:45.899  -->  00:01:48.109
is you can see that the names have been

92

00:01:48.109  -->  00:01:48.119

93

00:01:48.119  -->  00:01:50.600
cut off slightly so we want to change

94

00:01:50.600  -->  00:01:50.610

95

00:01:50.610  -->  00:01:53.030
the format so we're going to go format

96

00:01:53.030  -->  00:01:53.040

97

00:01:53.040  -->  00:01:55.280
legends and we will change the font to

98

00:01:55.280  -->  00:01:55.290

99

00:01:55.290  -->  00:01:59.359
10 so that they take up less space and

100

00:01:59.359  -->  00:01:59.369

101

00:01:59.369  -->  00:02:02.389
now we're going to we have to make this

102

00:02:02.389  -->  00:02:02.399

103

00:02:02.399  -->  00:02:05.899
a bit bigger so that we can see the

104

00:02:05.899  -->  00:02:05.909

105

00:02:05.909  -->  00:02:07.880
legend properly because it's not good

106

00:02:07.880  -->  00:02:07.890

107

00:02:07.890  -->  00:02:10.169
when you can only see some like

108

00:02:10.169  -->  00:02:10.179

109

00:02:10.179  -->  00:02:13.349
grab a part of the legend and not to the

110

00:02:13.349  -->  00:02:13.359

111

00:02:13.359  -->  00:02:16.050
full-text bit more.

112

00:02:16.050  -->  00:02:16.060

113

00:02:16.060  -->  00:02:19.530
There we go, so one more thing or one

114

00:02:19.530  -->  00:02:19.540

115

00:02:19.540  -->  00:02:20.729
other thing that you can see right away

116

00:02:20.729  -->  00:02:20.739

117

00:02:20.739  -->  00:02:25.709
is this 1960. It's a bit 22 black want to

118

00:02:25.709  -->  00:02:25.719

119

00:02:25.719  -->  00:02:27.509
change this color. We want to change it

120

00:02:27.509  -->  00:02:27.519

121

00:02:27.519  -->  00:02:33.119
to let's say this or even this color. So

122

00:02:33.119  -->  00:02:33.129

123

00:02:33.129  -->  00:02:34.649
it's kind of like in the background

124

00:02:34.649  -->  00:02:34.659

125

00:02:34.659  -->  00:02:35.910
looks like it's in the background and

126

00:02:35.910  -->  00:02:35.920

127

00:02:35.920  -->  00:02:37.379
then we might want to put it up at the

128

00:02:37.379  -->  00:02:37.389

129

00:02:37.389  -->  00:02:40.800
top here maybe maybe like that. So it's

130

00:02:40.800  -->  00:02:40.810

131

00:02:40.810  -->  00:02:43.199
it's not in your way and we don't need

132

00:02:43.199  -->  00:02:43.209

133

00:02:43.209  -->  00:02:45.659
this title so we're going to hide title

134

00:02:45.659  -->  00:02:45.669

135

00:02:45.669  -->  00:02:48.330
when we will do is we will add our own

136

00:02:48.330  -->  00:02:48.340

137

00:02:48.340  -->  00:02:50.819
title, of course every dashboard has to have

138

00:02:50.819  -->  00:02:50.829

139

00:02:50.829  -->  00:02:55.530
a title so let's drag a text whole place

140

00:02:55.530  -->  00:02:55.540

141

00:02:55.540  -->  00:02:57.780
holder to the top and I've got a pretty

142

00:02:57.780  -->  00:02:57.790

143

00:02:57.790  -->  00:03:00.089
title here world demographics analysis

144

00:03:00.089  -->  00:03:00.099

145

00:03:00.099  -->  00:03:04.080
dashboard, might make it like a 24 and a

146

00:03:04.080  -->  00:03:04.090

147

00:03:04.090  -->  00:03:06.390
bolt and see how that looks.

148

00:03:06.390  -->  00:03:06.400

149

00:03:06.400  -->  00:03:12.300
We want to center it and make it smaller.

150

00:03:12.300  -->  00:03:12.310

151

00:03:12.310  -->  00:03:16.259
That looks ok to me,

152

00:03:16.259  -->  00:03:16.269

153

00:03:16.269  -->  00:03:17.939
what else do we want? So when I put my

154

00:03:17.939  -->  00:03:17.949

155

00:03:17.949  -->  00:03:20.039
mouse over, one of these or when I

156

00:03:20.039  -->  00:03:20.049

157

00:03:20.049  -->  00:03:21.719
selected you can see like this control

158

00:03:21.719  -->  00:03:21.729

159

00:03:21.729  -->  00:03:22.289
pops up,

160

00:03:22.289  -->  00:03:22.299

161

00:03:22.299  -->  00:03:24.300
I don't want that control because I

162

00:03:24.300  -->  00:03:24.310

163

00:03:24.310  -->  00:03:26.670
don't want the user to accidentally

164

00:03:26.670  -->  00:03:26.680

165

00:03:26.680  -->  00:03:28.800
change something in the dashboard so I'm

166

00:03:28.800  -->  00:03:28.810

167

00:03:28.810  -->  00:03:30.659
going to go to worksheet once I've

168

00:03:30.659  -->  00:03:30.669

169

00:03:30.669  -->  00:03:32.039
clicked on this worksheet, I'm going to go to

170

00:03:32.039  -->  00:03:32.049

171

00:03:32.049  -->  00:03:34.500
worksheet, I'm going to go to tooltip and

172

00:03:34.500  -->  00:03:34.510

173

00:03:34.510  -->  00:03:36.420
I'm going to uncheck this include

174

00:03:36.420  -->  00:03:36.430

175

00:03:36.430  -->  00:03:40.800
command command buttons, click OK and now

176

00:03:40.800  -->  00:03:40.810

177

00:03:40.810  -->  00:03:44.969
you can see that it is is gone. So even

178

00:03:44.969  -->  00:03:44.979

179

00:03:44.979  -->  00:03:46.439
when I select something, there's no

180

00:03:46.439  -->  00:03:46.449

181

00:03:46.449  -->  00:03:48.509
control or no command buttons at the top.

182

00:03:48.509  -->  00:03:48.519

183

00:03:48.519  -->  00:03:51.689
There we go by the way you have this

184

00:03:51.689  -->  00:03:51.699

185

00:03:51.699  -->  00:03:53.819
option starting from Tableau nine in your

186

00:03:53.819  -->  00:03:53.829

187

00:03:53.829  -->  00:03:58.050
tool tip, you can change responsive so

188

00:03:58.050  -->  00:03:58.060

189

00:03:58.060  -->  00:04:00.420
show tooltips instantly that's the one

190

00:04:00.420  -->  00:04:00.430

191

00:04:00.430  -->  00:04:04.199
like that is default in Tableau 9.1 or

192

00:04:04.199  -->  00:04:04.209

193

00:04:04.209  -->  00:04:05.999
you can select the previous one that you

194

00:04:05.999  -->  00:04:06.009

195

00:04:06.009  -->  00:04:09.300
had in Tableau 9 or actually Tableau 8.

196

00:04:09.300  -->  00:04:09.310

197

00:04:09.310  -->  00:04:13.439
plus.. at 8 plus, where it was on hover, so it

198

00:04:13.439  -->  00:04:13.449

199

00:04:13.449  -->  00:04:15.240
would not appear instantly but only after

200

00:04:15.240  -->  00:04:15.250

201

00:04:15.250  -->  00:04:17.670
you had your mouse over a point for a

202

00:04:17.670  -->  00:04:17.680

203

00:04:17.680  -->  00:04:19.920
while for like half a second then it up

204

00:04:19.920  -->  00:04:19.930

205

00:04:19.930  -->  00:04:22.500
here. So maybe in this case, might be

206

00:04:22.500  -->  00:04:22.510

207

00:04:22.510  -->  00:04:24.450
better like that so that if the person

208

00:04:24.450  -->  00:04:24.460

209

00:04:24.460  -->  00:04:25.950
is moving the mouse around its not

210

00:04:25.950  -->  00:04:25.960

211

00:04:25.960  -->  00:04:27.150
getting in their way.

212

00:04:27.150  -->  00:04:27.160

213

00:04:27.160  -->  00:04:31.200
So let's leave it at that, okay so that's

214

00:04:31.200  -->  00:04:31.210

215

00:04:31.210  -->  00:04:33.150
pretty much done.

216

00:04:33.150  -->  00:04:33.160

217

00:04:33.160  -->  00:04:34.830
Let's have a look what else would we

218

00:04:34.830  -->  00:04:34.840

219

00:04:34.840  -->  00:04:37.530
want to change here. I think that's all

220

00:04:37.530  -->  00:04:37.540

221

00:04:37.540  -->  00:04:40.290
oh one more thing I wanted to show you. In

222

00:04:40.290  -->  00:04:40.300

223

00:04:40.300  -->  00:04:41.760
terms of formatting a dashboard of

224

00:04:41.760  -->  00:04:41.770

225

00:04:41.770  -->  00:04:43.260
course you can change the colors and so

226

00:04:43.260  -->  00:04:43.270

227

00:04:43.270  -->  00:04:43.980
on,

228

00:04:43.980  -->  00:04:43.990

229

00:04:43.990  -->  00:04:45.780
there's another way you can do it. You

230

00:04:45.780  -->  00:04:45.790

231

00:04:45.790  -->  00:04:50.220
can go to format and workbooks theme, so

232

00:04:50.220  -->  00:04:50.230

233

00:04:50.230  -->  00:04:51.900
there's three themes here. If I click

234

00:04:51.900  -->  00:04:51.910

235

00:04:51.910  -->  00:04:54.000
modern, it won't change much in this

236

00:04:54.000  -->  00:04:54.010

237

00:04:54.010  -->  00:04:55.740
particular instance. It just get rid of

238

00:04:55.740  -->  00:04:55.750

239

00:04:55.750  -->  00:04:57.630
the grid line but in other dashboards

240

00:04:57.630  -->  00:04:57.640

241

00:04:57.640  -->  00:04:59.220
that might change a bit also you can see

242

00:04:59.220  -->  00:04:59.230

243

00:04:59.230  -->  00:05:02.250
that this has become a darker the black

244

00:05:02.250  -->  00:05:02.260

245

00:05:02.260  -->  00:05:04.830
hair has become darker but the other one

246

00:05:04.830  -->  00:05:04.840

247

00:05:04.840  -->  00:05:07.170
that is pretty good my work for us is

248

00:05:07.170  -->  00:05:07.180

249

00:05:07.180  -->  00:05:09.540
work with clean classic, so it makes it look

250

00:05:09.540  -->  00:05:09.550

251

00:05:09.550  -->  00:05:12.840
like one of those research papers from

252

00:05:12.840  -->  00:05:12.850

253

00:05:12.850  -->  00:05:14.580
the nineties or something that. So I'm

254

00:05:14.580  -->  00:05:14.590

255

00:05:14.590  -->  00:05:16.410
going to leave this one just because I

256

00:05:16.410  -->  00:05:16.420

257

00:05:16.420  -->  00:05:19.260
kind of like it, fancy it and I might

258

00:05:19.260  -->  00:05:19.270

259

00:05:19.270  -->  00:05:22.380
change this black to not such a dark

260

00:05:22.380  -->  00:05:22.390

261

00:05:22.390  -->  00:05:25.260
black and there we go so now if I click

262

00:05:25.260  -->  00:05:25.270

263

00:05:25.270  -->  00:05:27.600
so of course I want to save this,

264

00:05:27.600  -->  00:05:27.610

265

00:05:27.610  -->  00:05:32.910
and if i go to window presentation mode

266

00:05:32.910  -->  00:05:32.920

267

00:05:32.920  -->  00:05:35.400
so this is what the dashboard looks like

268

00:05:35.400  -->  00:05:35.410

269

00:05:35.410  -->  00:05:38.400
and if somebody is doing some research

270

00:05:38.400  -->  00:05:38.410

271

00:05:38.410  -->  00:05:40.830
on this dashboard, oh there we go. So once I've

272

00:05:40.830  -->  00:05:40.840

273

00:05:40.840  -->  00:05:44.220
change it to a different style it cut

274

00:05:44.220  -->  00:05:44.230

275

00:05:44.230  -->  00:05:46.680
off the North Africa so I'm going to

276

00:05:46.680  -->  00:05:46.690

277

00:05:46.690  -->  00:05:49.560
maybe give it some more room there.

278

00:05:49.560  -->  00:05:49.570

279

00:05:49.570  -->  00:05:51.510
So is that again window presentation

280

00:05:51.510  -->  00:05:51.520

281

00:05:51.520  -->  00:05:53.280
mode you can see that's that what the

282

00:05:53.280  -->  00:05:53.290

283

00:05:53.290  -->  00:05:56.640
dashboard looks like and I can play the

284

00:05:56.640  -->  00:05:56.650

285

00:05:56.650  -->  00:05:59.970
animation so put the speed-up it's all

286

00:05:59.970  -->  00:05:59.980

287

00:05:59.980  -->  00:06:01.800
happening in real time. This is very

288

00:06:01.800  -->  00:06:01.810

289

00:06:01.810  -->  00:06:04.320
exciting. So imagine an executive or a

290

00:06:04.320  -->  00:06:04.330

291

00:06:04.330  -->  00:06:06.870
manager looking at this or are or even

292

00:06:06.870  -->  00:06:06.880

293

00:06:06.880  -->  00:06:08.640
somebody was doing some research for

294

00:06:08.640  -->  00:06:08.650

295

00:06:08.650  -->  00:06:10.320
somebody who's studying these four

296

00:06:10.320  -->  00:06:10.330

297

00:06:10.330  -->  00:06:13.980
countries and there we go off they go

298

00:06:13.980  -->  00:06:13.990

299

00:06:13.990  -->  00:06:16.710
and so that person can then analyze

300

00:06:16.710  -->  00:06:16.720

301

00:06:16.720  -->  00:06:20.790
exactly what happened so what was going

302

00:06:20.790  -->  00:06:20.800

303

00:06:20.800  -->  00:06:23.040
on there with this country or India or

304

00:06:23.040  -->  00:06:23.050

305

00:06:23.050  -->  00:06:24.660
Brazil.

306

00:06:24.660  -->  00:06:24.670

307

00:06:24.670  -->  00:06:28.620
We have here republic of Korea and

308

00:06:28.620  -->  00:06:28.630

309

00:06:28.630  -->  00:06:30.870
Uganda. So there we go, that's our

310

00:06:30.870  -->  00:06:30.880

311

00:06:30.880  -->  00:06:34.500
dashboard ready to go to the executives.

312

00:06:34.500  -->  00:06:34.510

313

00:06:34.510  -->  00:06:37.500
Well done! It was a great quick section. I

314

00:06:37.500  -->  00:06:37.510

315

00:06:37.510  -->  00:06:38.970
hope you enjoyed it hope you enjoyed the

316

00:06:38.970  -->  00:06:38.980

317

00:06:38.980  -->  00:06:40.770
tutorial in this section if you did

318

00:06:40.770  -->  00:06:40.780

319

00:06:40.780  -->  00:06:42.690
don't forget to leave a review for this

320

00:06:42.690  -->  00:06:42.700

321

00:06:42.700  -->  00:06:44.910
course I would really appreciate that if

322

00:06:44.910  -->  00:06:44.920

323

00:06:44.920  -->  00:06:46.710
you could do that for me today. Thank you

324

00:06:46.710  -->  00:06:46.720

325

00:06:46.720  -->  00:06:48.690
very much and I look forward to seeing

326

00:06:48.690  -->  00:06:48.700

you next time.

328

00:06:49.710  -->  00:06:49.720

329

00:06:49.720  -->  00:06:55.920
Until then, happy analyzing!
