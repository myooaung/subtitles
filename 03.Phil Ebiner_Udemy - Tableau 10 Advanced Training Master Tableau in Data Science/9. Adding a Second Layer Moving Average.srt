00:00:03,150  -->  00:00:07,070
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:07,070  -->  00:00:07,080

3

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:09,260
Tableau. This is Kirill Eremenko and

4

00:00:09,260  -->  00:00:09,270

5

00:00:09,270  -->  00:00:11,090
today we continue with our section on

6

00:00:11,090  -->  00:00:11,100

7

00:00:11,100  -->  00:00:13,190
Tableau calculations. In the previous

8

00:00:13,190  -->  00:00:13,200

9

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:15,440
tutorial we talked about the different

10

00:00:15,440  -->  00:00:15,450

11

00:00:15,450  -->  00:00:17,000
table calculations that you can create

12

00:00:17,000  -->  00:00:17,010

13

00:00:17,010  -->  00:00:19,640
yourself using the formula's provided

14

00:00:19,640  -->  00:00:19,650

15

00:00:19,650  -->  00:00:23,570
in Tableau and this is the table

16

00:00:23,570  -->  00:00:23,580

17

00:00:23,580  -->  00:00:26,150
calculation for a moving average which

18

00:00:26,150  -->  00:00:26,160

19

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:28,370
we talked about in the previous tutorial.

20

00:00:28,370  -->  00:00:28,380

21

00:00:28,380  -->  00:00:30,859
So today we're going to do two things

22

00:00:30,859  -->  00:00:30,869

23

00:00:30,869  -->  00:00:32,720
first of all, we're going to take this

24

00:00:32,720  -->  00:00:32,730

25

00:00:32,730  -->  00:00:34,819
concept and we will apply it to our

26

00:00:34,819  -->  00:00:34,829

27

00:00:34,829  -->  00:00:37,340
analysis because that is exactly what

28

00:00:37,340  -->  00:00:37,350

29

00:00:37,350  -->  00:00:39,440
we're looking for. We're looking for an 8

30

00:00:39,440  -->  00:00:39,450

31

00:00:39,450  -->  00:00:42,500
hour moving average to help us determine

32

00:00:42,500  -->  00:00:42,510

33

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:45,050
which machines need repairs and

34

00:00:45,050  -->  00:00:45,060

35

00:00:45,060  -->  00:00:48,020
maintenance and then we will recap on

36

00:00:48,020  -->  00:00:48,030

37

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:49,940
how the moving average works just to

38

00:00:49,940  -->  00:00:49,950

39

00:00:49,950  -->  00:00:52,520
make sure that going forward we are all

40

00:00:52,520  -->  00:00:52,530

41

00:00:52,530  -->  00:00:54,710
on the same page and we fully understand

42

00:00:54,710  -->  00:00:54,720

43

00:00:54,720  -->  00:00:57,050
the concepts of table calculations.

44

00:00:57,050  -->  00:00:57,060

45

00:00:57,060  -->  00:00:59,210
Alright so let's go ahead and proceed to

46

00:00:59,210  -->  00:00:59,220

47

00:00:59,220  -->  00:01:01,460
our analysis tab. As you can see here

48

00:01:01,460  -->  00:01:01,470

49

00:01:01,470  -->  00:01:04,579
we've got the idle capacity in terms of

50

00:01:04,579  -->  00:01:04,589

51

00:01:04,589  -->  00:01:07,070
percentages of the nominal capacity and

52

00:01:07,070  -->  00:01:07,080

53

00:01:07,080  -->  00:01:08,990
we've already introduced our ten percent

54

00:01:08,990  -->  00:01:09,000

55

00:01:09,000  -->  00:01:11,780
line which will be our threshold to tell

56

00:01:11,780  -->  00:01:11,790

57

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:13,040
whether a machine requires maintenance

58

00:01:13,040  -->  00:01:13,050

59

00:01:13,050  -->  00:01:15,380
or not. But this information is not

60

00:01:15,380  -->  00:01:15,390

61

00:01:15,390  -->  00:01:17,690
sufficient. As you can see every machine

62

00:01:17,690  -->  00:01:17,700

63

00:01:17,700  -->  00:01:21,050
at some point throughout the day spikes

64

00:01:21,050  -->  00:01:21,060

65

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:23,870
above the ten percent threshold. So if we

66

00:01:23,870  -->  00:01:23,880

67

00:01:23,880  -->  00:01:27,530
were to use this chart as our criteria

68

00:01:27,530  -->  00:01:27,540

69

00:01:27,540  -->  00:01:29,240
then every single machine would require

70

00:01:29,240  -->  00:01:29,250

71

00:01:29,250  -->  00:01:32,330
service and maintenance. As the Simon's

72

00:01:32,330  -->  00:01:32,340

73

00:01:32,340  -->  00:01:34,760
jets the machines that require servicing

74

00:01:34,760  -->  00:01:34,770

75

00:01:34,770  -->  00:01:36,950
our machines where there is an

76

00:01:36,950  -->  00:01:36,960

77

00:01:36,960  -->  00:01:38,660
eight-hour period an eight-hour window

78

00:01:38,660  -->  00:01:38,670

79

00:01:38,670  -->  00:01:40,850
somewhere in this data set for that

80

00:01:40,850  -->  00:01:40,860

81

00:01:40,860  -->  00:01:44,300
machine where the average of what we see

82

00:01:44,300  -->  00:01:44,310

83

00:01:44,310  -->  00:01:48,170
here for those eight hours spikes above

84

00:01:48,170  -->  00:01:48,180

85

00:01:48,180  -->  00:01:50,539
the ten percent. So that means that we

86

00:01:50,539  -->  00:01:50,549

87

00:01:50,549  -->  00:01:53,570
need to apply a eight-hour rolling

88

00:01:53,570  -->  00:01:53,580

89

00:01:53,580  -->  00:01:55,640
average or moving average on top of this

90

00:01:55,640  -->  00:01:55,650

91

00:01:55,650  -->  00:01:57,560
data and analyze that.

92

00:01:57,560  -->  00:01:57,570

93

00:01:57,570  -->  00:01:59,300
So let's go ahead and apply it and then

94

00:01:59,300  -->  00:01:59,310

95

00:01:59,310  -->  00:02:01,789
we'll talk about it a bit more. So in

96

00:02:01,789  -->  00:02:01,799

97

00:02:01,799  -->  00:02:04,010
order to create this calculated field,

98

00:02:04,010  -->  00:02:04,020

99

00:02:04,020  -->  00:02:05,810
or this table calculation, I should say

100

00:02:05,810  -->  00:02:05,820

101

00:02:05,820  -->  00:02:08,300
we're going to right-click in the

102

00:02:08,300  -->  00:02:08,310

103

00:02:08,310  -->  00:02:10,789
measures and will create set say create

104

00:02:10,789  -->  00:02:10,799

105

00:02:10,799  -->  00:02:13,339
calculated field and this one will call

106

00:02:13,339  -->  00:02:13,349

107

00:02:13,349  -->  00:02:14,390
idle

108

00:02:14,390  -->  00:02:14,400

109

00:02:14,400  -->  00:02:18,979
capacity moving average. Now in Tableau

110

00:02:18,979  -->  00:02:18,989

111

00:02:18,989  -->  00:02:21,080
they're called if you recall if we go to

112

00:02:21,080  -->  00:02:21,090

113

00:02:21,090  -->  00:02:24,020
table calculations they're called window

114

00:02:24,020  -->  00:02:24,030

115

00:02:24,030  -->  00:02:26,390
average. It's the same thing as a moving

116

00:02:26,390  -->  00:02:26,400

117

00:02:26,400  -->  00:02:27,860
average as we discussed in the previous tutorial.

118

00:02:27,860  -->  00:02:27,870

119

00:02:27,870  -->  00:02:29,330
So lets just name ours moving

120

00:02:29,330  -->  00:02:29,340

121

00:02:29,340  -->  00:02:31,610
average. Now let's apply a window average,

122

00:02:31,610  -->  00:02:31,620

123

00:02:31,620  -->  00:02:33,080
I'll just double click on window average

124

00:02:33,080  -->  00:02:33,090

125

00:02:33,090  -->  00:02:34,910
here. What expression we're going to

126

00:02:34,910  -->  00:02:34,920

127

00:02:34,920  -->  00:02:36,380
apply to? Well we're going to apply to

128

00:02:36,380  -->  00:02:36,390

129

00:02:36,390  -->  00:02:38,059
this exact expression which we see here

130

00:02:38,059  -->  00:02:38,069

131

00:02:38,069  -->  00:02:40,729
and that is the idle capacity percent

132

00:02:40,729  -->  00:02:40,739

133

00:02:40,739  -->  00:02:45,349
positive. So let's type that in and now

134

00:02:45,349  -->  00:02:45,359

135

00:02:45,359  -->  00:02:47,990
we want to say how many bars to the left

136

00:02:47,990  -->  00:02:48,000

137

00:02:48,000  -->  00:02:50,420
to when to go of the current bar? How

138

00:02:50,420  -->  00:02:50,430

139

00:02:50,430  -->  00:02:53,030
many previous hours we want to take

140

00:02:53,030  -->  00:02:53,040

141

00:02:53,040  -->  00:02:55,339
before we include the current hour? We

142

00:02:55,339  -->  00:02:55,349

143

00:02:55,349  -->  00:02:57,410
want to include the previous seven hours

144

00:02:57,410  -->  00:02:57,420

145

00:02:57,420  -->  00:02:59,599
and then we want to include the current

146

00:02:59,599  -->  00:02:59,609

147

00:02:59,609  -->  00:03:02,660
hour as well. So in total that's eight

148

00:03:02,660  -->  00:03:02,670

149

00:03:02,670  -->  00:03:04,580
hours that we will be including our

150

00:03:04,580  -->  00:03:04,590

151

00:03:04,590  -->  00:03:06,140
calculation and that's all.

152

00:03:06,140  -->  00:03:06,150

153

00:03:06,150  -->  00:03:08,929
All we have to type in here and if we're

154

00:03:08,929  -->  00:03:08,939

155

00:03:08,939  -->  00:03:10,369
going to the default table calculation

156

00:03:10,369  -->  00:03:10,379

157

00:03:10,379  -->  00:03:12,349
as we discussed it's better to

158

00:03:12,349  -->  00:03:12,359

159

00:03:12,359  -->  00:03:14,990
explicitly specify our along which field

160

00:03:14,990  -->  00:03:15,000

161

00:03:15,000  -->  00:03:16,970
we want to calculate and in this case we

162

00:03:16,970  -->  00:03:16,980

163

00:03:16,980  -->  00:03:19,819
want to calculate across the table, so

164

00:03:19,819  -->  00:03:19,829

165

00:03:19,829  -->  00:03:22,460
not down but when we calculate from left

166

00:03:22,460  -->  00:03:22,470

167

00:03:22,470  -->  00:03:24,589
to right and that is the date-time field

168

00:03:24,589  -->  00:03:24,599

169

00:03:24,599  -->  00:03:28,339
and so we'll leave that as it is and

170

00:03:28,339  -->  00:03:28,349

171

00:03:28,349  -->  00:03:30,680
we'll just click ok and as you can see

172

00:03:30,680  -->  00:03:30,690

173

00:03:30,690  -->  00:03:32,360
here results are computed a long

174

00:03:32,360  -->  00:03:32,370

175

00:03:32,370  -->  00:03:37,039
date time click ok. So now if we take this

176

00:03:37,039  -->  00:03:37,049

177

00:03:37,049  -->  00:03:40,490
new calculation, we can replace the old

178

00:03:40,490  -->  00:03:40,500

179

00:03:40,500  -->  00:03:43,460
idle capacity percent pause with the new

180

00:03:43,460  -->  00:03:43,470

181

00:03:43,470  -->  00:03:44,839
calculation. So let's go ahead and do

182

00:03:44,839  -->  00:03:44,849

183

00:03:44,849  -->  00:03:48,800
that and there we go so right away we

184

00:03:48,800  -->  00:03:48,810

185

00:03:48,810  -->  00:03:52,280
can see a much better picture so what

186

00:03:52,280  -->  00:03:52,290

187

00:03:52,290  -->  00:03:54,589
happened here is now the results are

188

00:03:54,589  -->  00:03:54,599

189

00:03:54,599  -->  00:03:57,349
averaged out and instead of all this

190

00:03:57,349  -->  00:03:57,359

191

00:03:57,359  -->  00:04:00,020
sporadic, all these sporadic, all this

192

00:04:00,020  -->  00:04:00,030

193

00:04:00,030  -->  00:04:01,939
sporadic data for every single hour we

194

00:04:01,939  -->  00:04:01,949

195

00:04:01,949  -->  00:04:03,920
can see the average for every eight

196

00:04:03,920  -->  00:04:03,930

197

00:04:03,930  -->  00:04:08,420
hours in our data set and right away you

198

00:04:08,420  -->  00:04:08,430

199

00:04:08,430  -->  00:04:11,089
can already see some preliminary results

200

00:04:11,089  -->  00:04:11,099

201

00:04:11,099  -->  00:04:13,159
you can see that this machine does have

202

00:04:13,159  -->  00:04:13,169

203

00:04:13,169  -->  00:04:15,740
averages that spike over the 10 percent

204

00:04:15,740  -->  00:04:15,750

205

00:04:15,750  -->  00:04:17,360
line. This machine doesn't even though

206

00:04:17,360  -->  00:04:17,370

207

00:04:17,370  -->  00:04:20,149
the individual hours that spike over the

208

00:04:20,149  -->  00:04:20,159

209

00:04:20,159  -->  00:04:22,189
ten percent line. This one doesn't. Here we

210

00:04:22,189  -->  00:04:22,199

211

00:04:22,199  -->  00:04:24,080
can see some spikes but we'll talk about

212

00:04:24,080  -->  00:04:24,090

213

00:04:24,090  -->  00:04:26,149
these separately in a separate tutorial

214

00:04:26,149  -->  00:04:26,159

215

00:04:26,159  -->  00:04:27,230
these are irregularities

216

00:04:27,230  -->  00:04:27,240

217

00:04:27,240  -->  00:04:29,719
that appear because of the

218

00:04:29,719  -->  00:04:29,729

219

00:04:29,729  -->  00:04:31,309
moving average calculation and I will

220

00:04:31,309  -->  00:04:31,319

221

00:04:31,319  -->  00:04:32,839
show you how to deal with them in an

222

00:04:32,839  -->  00:04:32,849

223

00:04:32,849  -->  00:04:35,059
upcoming tutorial and this machine over

224

00:04:35,059  -->  00:04:35,069

225

00:04:35,069  -->  00:04:37,159
here also has an average so it does look

226

00:04:37,159  -->  00:04:37,169

227

00:04:37,169  -->  00:04:40,070
like it requires maintenance at this

228

00:04:40,070  -->  00:04:40,080

229

00:04:40,080  -->  00:04:43,189
stage. So but we'll talk about that in a

230

00:04:43,189  -->  00:04:43,199

231

00:04:43,199  -->  00:04:45,559
further tutorial, the purpose of this

232

00:04:45,559  -->  00:04:45,569

233

00:04:45,569  -->  00:04:49,580
tutorial was to show you how to apply

234

00:04:49,580  -->  00:04:49,590

235

00:04:49,590  -->  00:04:52,040
the moving average to our actual data

236

00:04:52,040  -->  00:04:52,050

237

00:04:52,050  -->  00:04:54,589
set and we've done that. As you can see

238

00:04:54,589  -->  00:04:54,599

239

00:04:54,599  -->  00:04:56,240
the result is completely different to

240

00:04:56,240  -->  00:04:56,250

241

00:04:56,250  -->  00:04:57,740
what we saw without the moving

242

00:04:57,740  -->  00:04:57,750

243

00:04:57,750  -->  00:05:01,040
average and now just to recap on how the

244

00:05:01,040  -->  00:05:01,050

245

00:05:01,050  -->  00:05:03,170
moving average works I prepared a small

246

00:05:03,170  -->  00:05:03,180

247

00:05:03,180  -->  00:05:06,770
two slide presentation which I'd like to

248

00:05:06,770  -->  00:05:06,780

249

00:05:06,780  -->  00:05:09,950
walk through to make sure that we are on

250

00:05:09,950  -->  00:05:09,960

251

00:05:09,960  -->  00:05:12,770
the same page in terms of how the table

252

00:05:12,770  -->  00:05:12,780

253

00:05:12,780  -->  00:05:15,080
calculation was performed and what steps

254

00:05:15,080  -->  00:05:15,090

255

00:05:15,090  -->  00:05:17,420
we took to get to this result. So let's

256

00:05:17,420  -->  00:05:17,430

257

00:05:17,430  -->  00:05:18,379
go ahead and proceed to that

258

00:05:18,379  -->  00:05:18,389

259

00:05:18,389  -->  00:05:19,700
presentation.

260

00:05:19,700  -->  00:05:19,710

261

00:05:19,710  -->  00:05:21,469
Ok so we started off our visualization

262

00:05:21,469  -->  00:05:21,479

263

00:05:21,479  -->  00:05:23,390
with a simple table like this which had

264

00:05:23,390  -->  00:05:23,400

265

00:05:23,400  -->  00:05:27,710
the time, the machine and the tons. I'm

266

00:05:27,710  -->  00:05:27,720

267

00:05:27,720  -->  00:05:29,180
going to put it on inside so we can

268

00:05:29,180  -->  00:05:29,190

269

00:05:29,190  -->  00:05:31,430
better visualize the chronological steps

270

00:05:31,430  -->  00:05:31,440

271

00:05:31,440  -->  00:05:33,980
that we took to get the final stage and

272

00:05:33,980  -->  00:05:33,990

273

00:05:33,990  -->  00:05:35,600
what we did to this table is we

274

00:05:35,600  -->  00:05:35,610

275

00:05:35,610  -->  00:05:38,839
visualized it and we visualize it by

276

00:05:38,839  -->  00:05:38,849

277

00:05:38,849  -->  00:05:41,570
aggregating it to a level of sum and now

278

00:05:41,570  -->  00:05:41,580

279

00:05:41,580  -->  00:05:43,999
of course we visualize the table at its

280

00:05:43,999  -->  00:05:44,009

281

00:05:44,009  -->  00:05:47,180
most highest level of granularity so we

282

00:05:47,180  -->  00:05:47,190

283

00:05:47,190  -->  00:05:51,020
plotted the tons for every single

284

00:05:51,020  -->  00:05:51,030

285

00:05:51,030  -->  00:05:54,110
machine at every single hour, so there

286

00:05:54,110  -->  00:05:54,120

287

00:05:54,120  -->  00:05:58,760
was no actual point in this sum. It didn't

288

00:05:58,760  -->  00:05:58,770

289

00:05:58,770  -->  00:06:00,140
change anything we were actually

290

00:06:00,140  -->  00:06:00,150

291

00:06:00,150  -->  00:06:02,659
plotting the values that we saw in our

292

00:06:02,659  -->  00:06:02,669

293

00:06:02,669  -->  00:06:04,700
Tableau but nevertheless this was an

294

00:06:04,700  -->  00:06:04,710

295

00:06:04,710  -->  00:06:07,459
important step because now for Tableau

296

00:06:07,459  -->  00:06:07,469

297

00:06:07,469  -->  00:06:10,219
this data has been aggregated even

298

00:06:10,219  -->  00:06:10,229

299

00:06:10,229  -->  00:06:12,170
though it has been aggregated to a

300

00:06:12,170  -->  00:06:12,180

301

00:06:12,180  -->  00:06:14,719
granularity of one. So basically that

302

00:06:14,719  -->  00:06:14,729

303

00:06:14,729  -->  00:06:19,279
same level of granularity as in as it is

304

00:06:19,279  -->  00:06:19,289

305

00:06:19,289  -->  00:06:21,110
in the data set so nothing has changed

306

00:06:21,110  -->  00:06:21,120

307

00:06:21,120  -->  00:06:23,870
for us for Tableau it perceives as data

308

00:06:23,870  -->  00:06:23,880

309

00:06:23,880  -->  00:06:26,209
as group aggregated and that means that

310

00:06:26,209  -->  00:06:26,219

311

00:06:26,219  -->  00:06:28,309
on top of aggregated data we can apply

312

00:06:28,309  -->  00:06:28,319

313

00:06:28,319  -->  00:06:30,920
table calculations. So then we applied a

314

00:06:30,920  -->  00:06:30,930

315

00:06:30,930  -->  00:06:33,860
table calculation which should stay the

316

00:06:33,860  -->  00:06:33,870

317

00:06:33,870  -->  00:06:36,110
percent difference from and we can't see

318

00:06:36,110  -->  00:06:36,120

319

00:06:36,120  -->  00:06:38,149
the fields that were also part of this

320

00:06:38,149  -->  00:06:38,159

321

00:06:38,159  -->  00:06:39,920
calculation. We can see that

322

00:06:39,920  -->  00:06:39,930

323

00:06:39,930  -->  00:06:42,230
nominal capacity because we hit them but

324

00:06:42,230  -->  00:06:42,240

325

00:06:42,240  -->  00:06:44,719
what we did is we calculated the

326

00:06:44,719  -->  00:06:44,729

327

00:06:44,729  -->  00:06:47,689
difference between the actual tons

328

00:06:47,689  -->  00:06:47,699

329

00:06:47,699  -->  00:06:49,939
processed and the normal capacity and

330

00:06:49,939  -->  00:06:49,949

331

00:06:49,949  -->  00:06:52,010
then divide by the nominal capacity so

332

00:06:52,010  -->  00:06:52,020

333

00:06:52,020  -->  00:06:53,450
basically we looked at the percent

334

00:06:53,450  -->  00:06:53,460

335

00:06:53,460  -->  00:06:55,490
difference from the nominal capacity,

336

00:06:55,490  -->  00:06:55,500

337

00:06:55,500  -->  00:07:02,240
there x minus one to invert our axis,

338

00:07:02,240  -->  00:07:02,250

339

00:07:02,250  -->  00:07:04,969
and so we ended up with a chart like this and

340

00:07:04,969  -->  00:07:04,979

341

00:07:04,979  -->  00:07:07,310
then on top of that chart because this

342

00:07:07,310  -->  00:07:07,320

343

00:07:07,320  -->  00:07:10,340
is still an aggregated calculation we

344

00:07:10,340  -->  00:07:10,350

345

00:07:10,350  -->  00:07:11,810
were able to play another table

346

00:07:11,810  -->  00:07:11,820

347

00:07:11,820  -->  00:07:14,330
calculation which was the window average

348

00:07:14,330  -->  00:07:14,340

349

00:07:14,340  -->  00:07:16,999
which we applied just now and then we

350

00:07:16,999  -->  00:07:17,009

351

00:07:17,009  -->  00:07:19,580
got this chart which we see in front of

352

00:07:19,580  -->  00:07:19,590

353

00:07:19,590  -->  00:07:21,710
us on, in Tableau now and the window

354

00:07:21,710  -->  00:07:21,720

355

00:07:21,720  -->  00:07:23,330
average this time was not applied

356

00:07:23,330  -->  00:07:23,340

357

00:07:23,340  -->  00:07:26,029
top-down, it was applied across as you

358

00:07:26,029  -->  00:07:26,039

359

00:07:26,039  -->  00:07:28,339
can see we have quite an interesting and

360

00:07:28,339  -->  00:07:28,349

361

00:07:28,349  -->  00:07:31,040
somewhat complex combination of

362

00:07:31,040  -->  00:07:31,050

363

00:07:31,050  -->  00:07:33,529
aggregations and Tableau calculations.

364

00:07:33,529  -->  00:07:33,539

365

00:07:33,539  -->  00:07:36,020
We've got an initial aggregation to the

366

00:07:36,020  -->  00:07:36,030

367

00:07:36,030  -->  00:07:37,760
level of sum then we've got a table

368

00:07:37,760  -->  00:07:37,770

369

00:07:37,770  -->  00:07:41,089
calculation that works top down or I

370

00:07:41,089  -->  00:07:41,099

371

00:07:41,099  -->  00:07:43,610
uses the machine field and then we got a

372

00:07:43,610  -->  00:07:43,620

373

00:07:43,620  -->  00:07:45,589
table calculation that works across the

374

00:07:45,589  -->  00:07:45,599

375

00:07:45,599  -->  00:07:49,010
table left to right or uses the daytime

376

00:07:49,010  -->  00:07:49,020

377

00:07:49,020  -->  00:07:51,500
field. So as you can see we're slowly

378

00:07:51,500  -->  00:07:51,510

379

00:07:51,510  -->  00:07:54,830
venturing into a bit more complex

380

00:07:54,830  -->  00:07:54,840

381

00:07:54,840  -->  00:07:56,930
calculations and an upcoming tutorials

382

00:07:56,930  -->  00:07:56,940

383

00:07:56,940  -->  00:08:01,100
we will actually learn how to refine our

384

00:08:01,100  -->  00:08:01,110

385

00:08:01,110  -->  00:08:02,870
table calculations and get rid of

386

00:08:02,870  -->  00:08:02,880

387

00:08:02,880  -->  00:08:04,730
irregularities using other table

388

00:08:04,730  -->  00:08:04,740

389

00:08:04,740  -->  00:08:07,100
calculations. So we'll build on this a

390

00:08:07,100  -->  00:08:07,110

391

00:08:07,110  -->  00:08:08,570
little bit more in the upcoming

392

00:08:08,570  -->  00:08:08,580

393

00:08:08,580  -->  00:08:10,040
tutorials and I look forward to seeing

394

00:08:10,040  -->  00:08:10,050

395

00:08:10,050  -->  00:08:10,909
you next time.

396

00:08:10,909  -->  00:08:10,919

397

00:08:10,919  -->  00:08:17,599
Until then, Happy Analyzing.
