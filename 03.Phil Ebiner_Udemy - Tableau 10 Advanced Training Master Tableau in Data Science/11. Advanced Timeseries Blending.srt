00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:05,300

2

00:00:05,300  -->  00:00:06,710
Hello and welcome back to the advance

3

00:00:06,710  -->  00:00:06,720

4

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:08,570
course on Tableau. In the previous tutorial,

5

00:00:08,570  -->  00:00:08,580

6

00:00:08,580  -->  00:00:11,900
we connected to our next data set which is

7

00:00:11,900  -->  00:00:11,910

8

00:00:11,910  -->  00:00:14,150
the population statistics and today

9

00:00:14,150  -->  00:00:14,160

10

00:00:14,160  -->  00:00:17,660
we're going to start blending to join

11

00:00:17,660  -->  00:00:17,670

12

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:19,460
our existing association to that new

13

00:00:19,460  -->  00:00:19,470

14

00:00:19,470  -->  00:00:21,590
data set. So you can see the new data set

15

00:00:21,590  -->  00:00:21,600

16

00:00:21,600  -->  00:00:24,080
over here which is this one and

17

00:00:24,080  -->  00:00:24,090

18

00:00:24,090  -->  00:00:26,060
therefore it's highlighted in orange and

19

00:00:26,060  -->  00:00:26,070

20

00:00:26,070  -->  00:00:27,830
the left because it's not the primary

21

00:00:27,830  -->  00:00:27,840

22

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:30,560
data source. The primary data source is the

23

00:00:30,560  -->  00:00:30,570

24

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:33,290
industry data source which we really

25

00:00:33,290  -->  00:00:33,300

26

00:00:33,300  -->  00:00:35,090
connected to which are using here so

27

00:00:35,090  -->  00:00:35,100

28

00:00:35,100  -->  00:00:36,860
this is the secondary data source and

29

00:00:36,860  -->  00:00:36,870

30

00:00:36,870  -->  00:00:37,850
therefore it's orange.

31

00:00:37,850  -->  00:00:37,860

32

00:00:37,860  -->  00:00:40,430
Ok so what we're going to do. First of all,

33

00:00:40,430  -->  00:00:40,440

34

00:00:40,440  -->  00:00:42,139
first thing I would like to do is since

35

00:00:42,139  -->  00:00:42,149

36

00:00:42,149  -->  00:00:43,220
we're only working with these four

37

00:00:43,220  -->  00:00:43,230

38

00:00:43,230  -->  00:00:45,049
states let's go ahead re and reassign

39

00:00:45,049  -->  00:00:45,059

40

00:00:45,059  -->  00:00:47,240
the colors so it looks a bit better so

41

00:00:47,240  -->  00:00:47,250

42

00:00:47,250  -->  00:00:48,650
just going to click assign palette click

43

00:00:48,650  -->  00:00:48,660

44

00:00:48,660  -->  00:00:52,189
OK and it looks way better like this I

45

00:00:52,189  -->  00:00:52,199

46

00:00:52,199  -->  00:00:56,150
think and next we're going to duplicate

47

00:00:56,150  -->  00:00:56,160

48

00:00:56,160  -->  00:00:59,270
this tab so we're going to say duplicate

49

00:00:59,270  -->  00:00:59,280

50

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:01,910
sheet and will rename it later once

51

00:01:01,910  -->  00:01:01,920

52

00:01:01,920  -->  00:01:05,570
we're ready and for now let's see how we

53

00:01:05,570  -->  00:01:05,580

54

00:01:05,580  -->  00:01:09,890
can blend these two data sets together.

55

00:01:09,890  -->  00:01:09,900

56

00:01:09,900  -->  00:01:12,020
Alright so first things first we need to

57

00:01:12,020  -->  00:01:12,030

58

00:01:12,030  -->  00:01:14,539
go and look at the relationships that

59

00:01:14,539  -->  00:01:14,549

60

00:01:14,549  -->  00:01:17,810
exist between the two datasets so we go

61

00:01:17,810  -->  00:01:17,820

62

00:01:17,820  -->  00:01:20,090
into it relationships as you can see

63

00:01:20,090  -->  00:01:20,100

64

00:01:20,100  -->  00:01:22,670
this is a primary data source of

65

00:01:22,670  -->  00:01:22,680

66

00:01:22,680  -->  00:01:25,219
Industry and this is the demographic

67

00:01:25,219  -->  00:01:25,229

68

00:01:25,229  -->  00:01:27,140
statistics data source which is our

69

00:01:27,140  -->  00:01:27,150

70

00:01:27,150  -->  00:01:28,880
secondary data source, the only

71

00:01:28,880  -->  00:01:28,890

72

00:01:28,890  -->  00:01:30,289
relationship they have right now is a

73

00:01:30,289  -->  00:01:30,299

74

00:01:30,299  -->  00:01:34,010
state and state so why is that? Well that's

75

00:01:34,010  -->  00:01:34,020

76

00:01:34,020  -->  00:01:35,960
because we renamed the column for date

77

00:01:35,960  -->  00:01:35,970

78

00:01:35,970  -->  00:01:38,690
in the primary data source to date. You

79

00:01:38,690  -->  00:01:38,700

80

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:40,880
can see it over here and here you still have one,

81

00:01:40,880  -->  00:01:40,890

82

00:01:40,890  -->  00:01:43,399
what you can do is you can rename f1 to

83

00:01:43,399  -->  00:01:43,409

84

00:01:43,409  -->  00:01:45,710
date and then Tableau will pick it up

85

00:01:45,710  -->  00:01:45,720

86

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:48,139
automatically but then you will have

87

00:01:48,139  -->  00:01:48,149

88

00:01:48,149  -->  00:01:50,840
another problem that Tableau pickup way

89

00:01:50,840  -->  00:01:50,850

90

00:01:50,850  -->  00:01:54,319
too many connections that are possible

91

00:01:54,319  -->  00:01:54,329

92

00:01:54,329  -->  00:01:57,740
between the two date fields like week,

93

00:01:57,740  -->  00:01:57,750

94

00:01:57,750  -->  00:02:00,380
month, year, day and so on everything,

95

00:02:00,380  -->  00:02:00,390

96

00:02:00,390  -->  00:02:03,319
and that is why I'm going to keep it as

97

00:02:03,319  -->  00:02:03,329

98

00:02:03,329  -->  00:02:05,810
f1 and I'm just going to create my

99

00:02:05,810  -->  00:02:05,820

100

00:02:05,820  -->  00:02:09,559
custom relationship between these two

101

00:02:09,559  -->  00:02:09,569

102

00:02:09,569  -->  00:02:11,720
data sets. So let's go ahead and click custom

103

00:02:11,720  -->  00:02:11,730

104

00:02:11,730  -->  00:02:14,750
and here we're going to add a new

105

00:02:14,750  -->  00:02:14,760

106

00:02:14,760  -->  00:02:20,479
error so on the left we have date and on

107

00:02:20,479  -->  00:02:20,489

108

00:02:20,489  -->  00:02:23,420
the right we're going to have f1. So how

109

00:02:23,420  -->  00:02:23,430

110

00:02:23,430  -->  00:02:25,399
we going to do this? We're going to look

111

00:02:25,399  -->  00:02:25,409

112

00:02:25,409  -->  00:02:27,830
at year of date and we're going to look

113

00:02:27,830  -->  00:02:27,840

114

00:02:27,840  -->  00:02:30,680
at a year of f1. That's that's a good

115

00:02:30,680  -->  00:02:30,690

116

00:02:30,690  -->  00:02:33,050
start and the next one we're going to

117

00:02:33,050  -->  00:02:33,060

118

00:02:33,060  -->  00:02:35,509
add is we're going to look at quarter

119

00:02:35,509  -->  00:02:35,519

120

00:02:35,519  -->  00:02:37,309
update and quarter f1 and I'll

121

00:02:37,309  -->  00:02:37,319

122

00:02:37,319  -->  00:02:39,050
explain this just now. So let's go ahead

123

00:02:39,050  -->  00:02:39,060

124

00:02:39,060  -->  00:02:42,020
and do that so we got state quarter and

125

00:02:42,020  -->  00:02:42,030

126

00:02:42,030  -->  00:02:44,930
year and click OK and now it's just

127

00:02:44,930  -->  00:02:44,940

128

00:02:44,940  -->  00:02:48,020
quickly checked that it's all still there.

129

00:02:48,020  -->  00:02:48,030

130

00:02:48,030  -->  00:02:50,900
It's all good and you can see this grey

131

00:02:50,900  -->  00:02:50,910

132

00:02:50,910  -->  00:02:53,630
icon appear here so why did we specify

133

00:02:53,630  -->  00:02:53,640

134

00:02:53,640  -->  00:02:56,059
exactly year and quarter and to look

135

00:02:56,059  -->  00:02:56,069

136

00:02:56,069  -->  00:02:58,610
into that further I've prepared a slide.

137

00:02:58,610  -->  00:02:58,620

138

00:02:58,620  -->  00:03:02,690
Let's go ahead and look at it. So this

139

00:03:02,690  -->  00:03:02,700

140

00:03:02,700  -->  00:03:04,849
our primary are set and there's our

141

00:03:04,849  -->  00:03:04,859

142

00:03:04,859  -->  00:03:07,250
second are set and both of them have a

143

00:03:07,250  -->  00:03:07,260

144

00:03:07,260  -->  00:03:10,880
Tableau and this is where we get to the

145

00:03:10,880  -->  00:03:10,890

146

00:03:10,890  -->  00:03:13,640
topic of advanced time series blending,

147

00:03:13,640  -->  00:03:13,650

148

00:03:13,650  -->  00:03:17,720
so here we've got some observations on

149

00:03:17,720  -->  00:03:17,730

150

00:03:17,730  -->  00:03:19,520
the f.. in the first data set in the

151

00:03:19,520  -->  00:03:19,530

152

00:03:19,530  -->  00:03:22,879
primary data set and they are for every

153

00:03:22,879  -->  00:03:22,889

154

00:03:22,889  -->  00:03:24,740
month so those letters are for months

155

00:03:24,740  -->  00:03:24,750

156

00:03:24,750  -->  00:03:27,470
so January, February, March, April, May and so

157

00:03:27,470  -->  00:03:27,480

158

00:03:27,480  -->  00:03:29,809
on and in the secondary data set we also

159

00:03:29,809  -->  00:03:29,819

160

00:03:29,819  -->  00:03:31,129
have observations but they're not for

161

00:03:31,129  -->  00:03:31,139

162

00:03:31,139  -->  00:03:33,080
every month there for every third month

163

00:03:33,080  -->  00:03:33,090

164

00:03:33,090  -->  00:03:35,930
so March, June, September, December ,March,

165

00:03:35,930  -->  00:03:35,940

166

00:03:35,940  -->  00:03:39,680
June, September, December and so on. So when

167

00:03:39,680  -->  00:03:39,690

168

00:03:39,690  -->  00:03:43,159
we're blending we want to somehow create

169

00:03:43,159  -->  00:03:43,169

170

00:03:43,169  -->  00:03:45,740
a connection between the two but as you

171

00:03:45,740  -->  00:03:45,750

172

00:03:45,750  -->  00:03:48,229
can see the secondary data set has

173

00:03:48,229  -->  00:03:48,239

174

00:03:48,239  -->  00:03:50,479
less data so how do we create that

175

00:03:50,479  -->  00:03:50,489

176

00:03:50,489  -->  00:03:51,349
connection?

177

00:03:51,349  -->  00:03:51,359

178

00:03:51,359  -->  00:03:53,360
Well the first condition we specified

179

00:03:53,360  -->  00:03:53,370

180

00:03:53,370  -->  00:03:56,210
the year, what does is it breaks our

181

00:03:56,210  -->  00:03:56,220

182

00:03:56,220  -->  00:03:58,430
datasets in two years and it says

183

00:03:58,430  -->  00:03:58,440

184

00:03:58,440  -->  00:04:01,069
alright so definitely make sure that

185

00:04:01,069  -->  00:04:01,079

186

00:04:01,079  -->  00:04:04,009
anything from let's say 2014 is only

187

00:04:04,009  -->  00:04:04,019

188

00:04:04,019  -->  00:04:06,650
connected to anything from 2014. The

189

00:04:06,650  -->  00:04:06,660

190

00:04:06,660  -->  00:04:09,229
primary data set and anything from 2015

191

00:04:09,229  -->  00:04:09,239

192

00:04:09,239  -->  00:04:12,589
is also only connected to anything from

193

00:04:12,589  -->  00:04:12,599

194

00:04:12,599  -->  00:04:14,659
2015 in the primary data set. So there's

195

00:04:14,659  -->  00:04:14,669

196

00:04:14,669  -->  00:04:16,490
no mix-up there will be no mix-up

197

00:04:16,490  -->  00:04:16,500

198

00:04:16,500  -->  00:04:18,620
between years because we specified that

199

00:04:18,620  -->  00:04:18,630

200

00:04:18,630  -->  00:04:20,990
year equals your condition.

201

00:04:20,990  -->  00:04:21,000

202

00:04:21,000  -->  00:04:24,830
Now what else we did is we specify the

203

00:04:24,830  -->  00:04:24,840

204

00:04:24,840  -->  00:04:25,320
quarter

205

00:04:25,320  -->  00:04:25,330

206

00:04:25,330  -->  00:04:28,320
equals quarter condition and that allows

207

00:04:28,320  -->  00:04:28,330

208

00:04:28,330  -->  00:04:32,670
us to break this matching into even more

209

00:04:32,670  -->  00:04:32,680

210

00:04:32,680  -->  00:04:36,390
detail and as you can see here what that

211

00:04:36,390  -->  00:04:36,400

212

00:04:36,400  -->  00:04:38,939
will do is it will make sure that only

213

00:04:38,939  -->  00:04:38,949

214

00:04:38,949  -->  00:04:42,749
data from the correct quarter is

215

00:04:42,749  -->  00:04:42,759

216

00:04:42,759  -->  00:04:45,809
specified to that corner in the primary

217

00:04:45,809  -->  00:04:45,819

218

00:04:45,819  -->  00:04:47,879
data set and it just so happens that our

219

00:04:47,879  -->  00:04:47,889

220

00:04:47,889  -->  00:04:50,580
secondary data set is so structured that

221

00:04:50,580  -->  00:04:50,590

222

00:04:50,590  -->  00:04:52,649
there's only one data point for each

223

00:04:52,649  -->  00:04:52,659

224

00:04:52,659  -->  00:04:55,260
quarter, because it is quarterly

225

00:04:55,260  -->  00:04:55,270

226

00:04:55,270  -->  00:04:58,110
observations and what will happen when

227

00:04:58,110  -->  00:04:58,120

228

00:04:58,120  -->  00:05:00,450
we create the blend when we execute the

229

00:05:00,450  -->  00:05:00,460

230

00:05:00,460  -->  00:05:03,089
blend is this.

231

00:05:03,089  -->  00:05:03,099

232

00:05:03,099  -->  00:05:05,879
So the information from the secondary

233

00:05:05,879  -->  00:05:05,889

234

00:05:05,889  -->  00:05:09,779
data source will be translated into more

235

00:05:09,779  -->  00:05:09,789

236

00:05:09,789  -->  00:05:11,580
blended with the primary data set in

237

00:05:11,580  -->  00:05:11,590

238

00:05:11,590  -->  00:05:13,200
this fashion and because as you remember

239

00:05:13,200  -->  00:05:13,210

240

00:05:13,210  -->  00:05:17,279
from the basic course on Tableau the

241

00:05:17,279  -->  00:05:17,289

242

00:05:17,289  -->  00:05:21,180
blend is a left join so here you can see

243

00:05:21,180  -->  00:05:21,190

244

00:05:21,190  -->  00:05:23,999
that our primary dataset on the left or

245

00:05:23,999  -->  00:05:24,009

246

00:05:24,009  -->  00:05:25,980
here's on the top and the secondary

247

00:05:25,980  -->  00:05:25,990

248

00:05:25,990  -->  00:05:28,589
data set is being joined to it and given

249

00:05:28,589  -->  00:05:28,599

250

00:05:28,599  -->  00:05:32,430
our conditions every single a month of

251

00:05:32,430  -->  00:05:32,440

252

00:05:32,440  -->  00:05:34,260
or every single observation in

253

00:05:34,260  -->  00:05:34,270

254

00:05:34,270  -->  00:05:36,510
the secondary data set will be joined to

255

00:05:36,510  -->  00:05:36,520

256

00:05:36,520  -->  00:05:39,149
three observations in the primary

257

00:05:39,149  -->  00:05:39,159

258

00:05:39,159  -->  00:05:40,920
data set and that is exactly what

259

00:05:40,920  -->  00:05:40,930

260

00:05:40,930  -->  00:05:42,930
you want. So if we were to go ahead and

261

00:05:42,930  -->  00:05:42,940

262

00:05:42,940  -->  00:05:45,420
specify additional conditions on top of

263

00:05:45,420  -->  00:05:45,430

264

00:05:45,430  -->  00:05:45,749
that,

265

00:05:45,749  -->  00:05:45,759

266

00:05:45,759  -->  00:05:47,700
let's say we would say make sure that

267

00:05:47,700  -->  00:05:47,710

268

00:05:47,710  -->  00:05:50,070
the month is equal then we would would

269

00:05:50,070  -->  00:05:50,080

270

00:05:50,080  -->  00:05:53,579
get the wrong thing because the data

271

00:05:53,579  -->  00:05:53,589

272

00:05:53,589  -->  00:05:55,379
from other observations from the

273

00:05:55,379  -->  00:05:55,389

274

00:05:55,389  -->  00:05:57,119
secondary data set will only be joined

275

00:05:57,119  -->  00:05:57,129

276

00:05:57,129  -->  00:06:00,600
to one observation of every or every

277

00:06:00,600  -->  00:06:00,610

278

00:06:00,610  -->  00:06:02,040
single observation for the second data

279

00:06:02,040  -->  00:06:02,050

280

00:06:02,050  -->  00:06:03,240
set would only be joined to one

281

00:06:03,240  -->  00:06:03,250

282

00:06:03,250  -->  00:06:05,070
observation from the primary data set

283

00:06:05,070  -->  00:06:05,080

284

00:06:05,080  -->  00:06:07,050
but that's not what we want because then we

285

00:06:07,050  -->  00:06:07,060

286

00:06:07,060  -->  00:06:09,149
would have observations and the primary

287

00:06:09,149  -->  00:06:09,159

288

00:06:09,159  -->  00:06:10,950
data set that would had would have no match.

289

00:06:10,950  -->  00:06:10,960

290

00:06:10,960  -->  00:06:14,070
That is why we're kind of ignoring the

291

00:06:14,070  -->  00:06:14,080

292

00:06:14,080  -->  00:06:16,559
month in the secondary data set we're

293

00:06:16,559  -->  00:06:16,569

294

00:06:16,569  -->  00:06:20,339
only looking at it from the level of

295

00:06:20,339  -->  00:06:20,349

296

00:06:20,349  -->  00:06:22,649
granularity of quarters which allows us

297

00:06:22,649  -->  00:06:22,659

298

00:06:22,659  -->  00:06:25,350
to duplicate or in this case triplicate

299

00:06:25,350  -->  00:06:27,869
our data from the secondary set into

300

00:06:27,869  -->  00:06:27,879

301

00:06:27,879  -->  00:06:29,760
the primary data set and so that's what's

302

00:06:29,760  -->  00:06:29,770

303

00:06:29,770  -->  00:06:31,499
going on in the background or that's

304

00:06:31,499  -->  00:06:31,509

305

00:06:31,509  -->  00:06:32,790
what will be going in the background

306

00:06:32,790  -->  00:06:32,800

307

00:06:32,800  -->  00:06:36,510
when we will be executing this blend in

308

00:06:36,510  -->  00:06:36,520

309

00:06:36,520  -->  00:06:38,820
Tableau. Alright so let's move back

310

00:06:38,820  -->  00:06:38,830

311

00:06:38,830  -->  00:06:41,550
Tableau now, so to see this blend in action

312

00:06:41,550  -->  00:06:41,560

313

00:06:41,560  -->  00:06:42,600
what we're going to do is we're going to

314

00:06:42,600  -->  00:06:42,610

315

00:06:42,610  -->  00:06:45,930
remove the some states from here so

316

00:06:45,930  -->  00:06:45,940

317

00:06:45,940  -->  00:06:47,250
we're going to just leave New South Wales

318

00:06:47,250  -->  00:06:47,260

319

00:06:47,260  -->  00:06:49,650
for now and that will free up some

320

00:06:49,650  -->  00:06:49,660

321

00:06:49,660  -->  00:06:52,440
space and allow us to better understand

322

00:06:52,440  -->  00:06:52,450

323

00:06:52,450  -->  00:06:55,830
the blend as we are executing it.

324

00:06:55,830  -->  00:06:55,840

325

00:06:55,840  -->  00:06:58,530
Let's get rid of Queensland, Victoria and

326

00:06:58,530  -->  00:06:58,540

327

00:06:58,540  -->  00:07:00,810
Western Australia,  click ok so now we

328

00:07:00,810  -->  00:07:00,820

329

00:07:00,820  -->  00:07:03,300
only have New South Wales left, and now

330

00:07:03,300  -->  00:07:03,310

331

00:07:03,310  -->  00:07:05,190
let's go ahead and click this button to

332

00:07:05,190  -->  00:07:05,200

333

00:07:05,200  -->  00:07:08,910
confirm that we want this field in the

334

00:07:08,910  -->  00:07:08,920

335

00:07:08,920  -->  00:07:12,660
blend and now we're going to take the

336

00:07:12,660  -->  00:07:12,670

337

00:07:12,670  -->  00:07:15,720
population measure and we'll drag it

338

00:07:15,720  -->  00:07:15,730

339

00:07:15,730  -->  00:07:17,460
into our visualization. We'll put it

340

00:07:17,460  -->  00:07:17,470

341

00:07:17,470  -->  00:07:20,700
into rows here and what that uses is it

342

00:07:20,700  -->  00:07:20,710

343

00:07:20,710  -->  00:07:22,170
gives us the progression of course it's

344

00:07:22,170  -->  00:07:22,180

345

00:07:22,180  -->  00:07:24,720
not correct as you can see there's a

346

00:07:24,720  -->  00:07:24,730

347

00:07:24,730  -->  00:07:28,710
nowhere near 250 million people living

348

00:07:28,710  -->  00:07:28,720

349

00:07:28,720  -->  00:07:31,680
in Australia and that is because our

350

00:07:31,680  -->  00:07:31,690

351

00:07:31,690  -->  00:07:34,110
blend is not being executed correctly at

352

00:07:34,110  -->  00:07:34,120

353

00:07:34,120  -->  00:07:37,050
this stage and the reason being is that

354

00:07:37,050  -->  00:07:37,060

355

00:07:37,060  -->  00:07:40,020
the fields that we specified in our

356

00:07:40,020  -->  00:07:40,030

357

00:07:40,030  -->  00:07:43,080
blend the quarter and year of this

358

00:07:43,080  -->  00:07:43,090

359

00:07:43,090  -->  00:07:49,080
variable f1 they're not accessible to

360

00:07:49,080  -->  00:07:49,090

361

00:07:49,090  -->  00:07:51,720
Tableau in this aggregation so it cannot

362

00:07:51,720  -->  00:07:51,730

363

00:07:51,730  -->  00:07:54,660
blend on them right now. So what we need

364

00:07:54,660  -->  00:07:54,670

365

00:07:54,670  -->  00:07:57,180
to do is we need to take f1 and drag it

366

00:07:57,180  -->  00:07:57,190

367

00:07:57,190  -->  00:08:00,930
into detail and here we've got year of

368

00:08:00,930  -->  00:08:00,940

369

00:08:00,940  -->  00:08:03,540
f1 which is a good start and now we

370

00:08:03,540  -->  00:08:03,550

371

00:08:03,550  -->  00:08:06,630
want to drag f1 into detail again and as

372

00:08:06,630  -->  00:08:06,640

373

00:08:06,640  -->  00:08:08,850
you can see it already gives us quarter

374

00:08:08,850  -->  00:08:08,860

375

00:08:08,860  -->  00:08:12,360
of f1 automatically and so that is what

376

00:08:12,360  -->  00:08:12,370

377

00:08:12,370  -->  00:08:14,550
we want. So now I'm just going to get rid

378

00:08:14,550  -->  00:08:14,560

379

00:08:14,560  -->  00:08:18,330
of these trend lines show trendlines no,

380

00:08:18,330  -->  00:08:18,340

381

00:08:18,340  -->  00:08:23,190
no need in them well in this part of

382

00:08:23,190  -->  00:08:23,200

383

00:08:23,200  -->  00:08:25,770
the visualization anyway and so what we

384

00:08:25,770  -->  00:08:25,780

385

00:08:25,780  -->  00:08:28,320
can see here is we can see that for

386

00:08:28,320  -->  00:08:28,330

387

00:08:28,330  -->  00:08:32,580
every single month we've got a

388

00:08:32,580  -->  00:08:32,590

389

00:08:32,590  -->  00:08:36,690
population and it does look like this

390

00:08:36,690  -->  00:08:36,700

391

00:08:36,700  -->  00:08:38,790
these values are constantly increasing

392

00:08:38,790  -->  00:08:38,800

393

00:08:38,800  -->  00:08:41,550
but that's just a visual effect so if

394

00:08:41,550  -->  00:08:41,560

395

00:08:41,560  -->  00:08:44,820
you look closely if we look at one of

396

00:08:44,820  -->  00:08:44,830

397

00:08:44,830  -->  00:08:46,740
the quarters here you'll see that within

398

00:08:46,740  -->  00:08:46,750

399

00:08:46,750  -->  00:08:48,600
the quarter the values not changing so

400

00:08:48,600  -->  00:08:48,610

401

00:08:48,610  -->  00:08:50,920
the population here 6,530

402

00:08:50,920  -->  00:08:50,930

403

00:08:50,930  -->  00:08:53,769
then it's 6,530 and it's 6,530 again

404

00:08:53,769  -->  00:08:53,779

405

00:08:53,779  -->  00:08:55,840
and then for the next quarter increases

406

00:08:55,840  -->  00:08:55,850

407

00:08:55,850  -->  00:09:00,880
6,544 and then 6,544 and then it hold on a

408

00:09:00,880  -->  00:09:00,890

409

00:09:00,890  -->  00:09:03,370
6,544 and then one more time 6,544.

410

00:09:03,370  -->  00:09:03,380

411

00:09:03,380  -->  00:09:05,320
So we've got we've achieved the effect

412

00:09:05,320  -->  00:09:05,330

413

00:09:05,330  -->  00:09:09,100
that we wanted for every month in this

414

00:09:09,100  -->  00:09:09,110

415

00:09:09,110  -->  00:09:11,500
timeline and this timeline let's not

416

00:09:11,500  -->  00:09:11,510

417

00:09:11,510  -->  00:09:13,060
forget this timeline belongs to the

418

00:09:13,060  -->  00:09:13,070

419

00:09:13,070  -->  00:09:14,860
primary data source. It doesn't have an

420

00:09:14,860  -->  00:09:14,870

421

00:09:14,870  -->  00:09:17,290
orange icon here so for every month of

422

00:09:17,290  -->  00:09:17,300

423

00:09:17,300  -->  00:09:19,810
the primary data source, we have three

424

00:09:19,810  -->  00:09:19,820

425

00:09:19,820  -->  00:09:22,720
we have triplicated, no for every month

426

00:09:22,720  -->  00:09:22,730

427

00:09:22,730  -->  00:09:25,060
of the primary data source we have

428

00:09:25,060  -->  00:09:25,070

429

00:09:25,070  -->  00:09:28,570
extracted a population value from the

430

00:09:28,570  -->  00:09:28,580

431

00:09:28,580  -->  00:09:30,310
secondary data source and we were

432

00:09:30,310  -->  00:09:30,320

433

00:09:30,320  -->  00:09:33,699
extracted it is we've triplicated the

434

00:09:33,699  -->  00:09:33,709

435

00:09:33,709  -->  00:09:36,100
value that quarterly value that

436

00:09:36,100  -->  00:09:36,110

437

00:09:36,110  -->  00:09:38,740
we have. So as you can see the value

438

00:09:38,740  -->  00:09:38,750

439

00:09:38,750  -->  00:09:41,019
within every single quarter is the same

440

00:09:41,019  -->  00:09:41,029

441

00:09:41,029  -->  00:09:43,840
edit is equal to the value that we had

442

00:09:43,840  -->  00:09:43,850

443

00:09:43,850  -->  00:09:45,550
in the stops and we can check that we

444

00:09:45,550  -->  00:09:45,560

445

00:09:45,560  -->  00:09:48,250
can just go to view data so we're

446

00:09:48,250  -->  00:09:48,260

447

00:09:48,260  -->  00:09:51,400
looking for New South Wales and let's

448

00:09:51,400  -->  00:09:51,410

449

00:09:51,410  -->  00:09:54,370
look at one of the recent years so March

450

00:09:54,370  -->  00:09:54,380

451

00:09:54,380  -->  00:09:58,240
2007 there was 6,815

452

00:09:58,240  -->  00:09:58,250

453

00:09:58,250  -->  00:10:02,230
right? So let's find March 2007,

454

00:10:02,230  -->  00:10:02,240

455

00:10:02,240  -->  00:10:04,480
this is 2007 and March 2007

456

00:10:04,480  -->  00:10:04,490

457

00:10:04,490  -->  00:10:07,120
would be this one 6,815 so

458

00:10:07,120  -->  00:10:07,130

459

00:10:07,130  -->  00:10:09,010
you can see it's the same for January

460

00:10:09,010  -->  00:10:09,020

461

00:10:09,020  -->  00:10:11,769
2007, March, February 2007

462

00:10:11,769  -->  00:10:11,779

463

00:10:11,779  -->  00:10:13,630
and March 2007, we've

464

00:10:13,630  -->  00:10:13,640

465

00:10:13,640  -->  00:10:18,579
achieved the same exact figure of 6

466

00:10:18,579  -->  00:10:18,589

467

00:10:18,589  -->  00:10:24,070
million and 850,000 for New South Wales. So

468

00:10:24,070  -->  00:10:24,080

469

00:10:24,080  -->  00:10:27,160
there we go, so that's how we can blend

470

00:10:27,160  -->  00:10:27,170

471

00:10:27,170  -->  00:10:29,949
in this case. The only drawback of this

472

00:10:29,949  -->  00:10:29,959

473

00:10:29,959  -->  00:10:31,510
approach to blending is that because

474

00:10:31,510  -->  00:10:31,520

475

00:10:31,520  -->  00:10:34,480
we've added these fields in here you can

476

00:10:34,480  -->  00:10:34,490

477

00:10:34,490  -->  00:10:36,699
see that outline is now broken up like

478

00:10:36,699  -->  00:10:36,709

479

00:10:36,709  -->  00:10:41,710
it's it's broken and therefore the

480

00:10:41,710  -->  00:10:41,720

481

00:10:41,720  -->  00:10:46,120
is working into quarters and therefore

482

00:10:46,120  -->  00:10:46,130

483

00:10:46,130  -->  00:10:49,329
the visual aspect or this aesthetics of

484

00:10:49,329  -->  00:10:49,339

485

00:10:49,339  -->  00:10:53,139
this approach is its kind of not the

486

00:10:53,139  -->  00:10:53,149

487

00:10:53,149  -->  00:10:56,260
best like it's better to see a smooth

488

00:10:56,260  -->  00:10:56,270

489

00:10:56,270  -->  00:10:58,960
line. So you can keep it this way if you

490

00:10:58,960  -->  00:10:58,970

491

00:10:58,970  -->  00:11:01,630
like, but for practice sake what we're

492

00:11:01,630  -->  00:11:01,640

493

00:11:01,640  -->  00:11:03,010
going to do is we're going to adjust

494

00:11:03,010  -->  00:11:03,020

495

00:11:03,020  -->  00:11:03,720
this blend.

496

00:11:03,720  -->  00:11:03,730

497

00:11:03,730  -->  00:11:06,629
To actually create a different blend

498

00:11:06,629  -->  00:11:06,639

499

00:11:06,639  -->  00:11:08,699
because you can you can control the way

500

00:11:08,699  -->  00:11:08,709

501

00:11:08,709  -->  00:11:10,620
you blend this data and what we're

502

00:11:10,620  -->  00:11:10,630

503

00:11:10,630  -->  00:11:13,079
going to do is we're going to fix up

504

00:11:13,079  -->  00:11:13,089

505

00:11:13,089  -->  00:11:15,870
this blend so that now we won't we'll

506

00:11:15,870  -->  00:11:15,880

507

00:11:15,880  -->  00:11:17,970
have a smooth line and it'll actually be

508

00:11:17,970  -->  00:11:17,980

509

00:11:17,980  -->  00:11:20,879
blended a bit differently and the way it

510

00:11:20,879  -->  00:11:20,889

511

00:11:20,889  -->  00:11:22,439
will be blended is it will be blended

512

00:11:22,439  -->  00:11:22,449

513

00:11:22,449  -->  00:11:24,689
on a yearly level rather than a

514

00:11:24,689  -->  00:11:24,699

515

00:11:24,699  -->  00:11:27,840
quarter level and going back to our

516

00:11:27,840  -->  00:11:27,850

517

00:11:27,850  -->  00:11:28,800
presentation

518

00:11:28,800  -->  00:11:28,810

519

00:11:28,810  -->  00:11:31,769
what that means is that now we're going

520

00:11:31,769  -->  00:11:31,779

521

00:11:31,779  -->  00:11:34,230
to remove these restrictions for

522

00:11:34,230  -->  00:11:34,240

523

00:11:34,240  -->  00:11:36,360
quarterly and of course this is going to

524

00:11:36,360  -->  00:11:36,370

525

00:11:36,370  -->  00:11:39,360
go is to and in order for things not to

526

00:11:39,360  -->  00:11:39,370

527

00:11:39,370  -->  00:11:40,319
get mixed up

528

00:11:40,319  -->  00:11:40,329

529

00:11:40,329  -->  00:11:44,340
we cannot have that many observations in

530

00:11:44,340  -->  00:11:44,350

531

00:11:44,350  -->  00:11:45,629
our secondary data set because

532

00:11:45,629  -->  00:11:45,639

533

00:11:45,639  -->  00:11:48,210
otherwise there will be too much

534

00:11:48,210  -->  00:11:48,220

535

00:11:48,220  -->  00:11:50,220
duplication. What we will need to do is

536

00:11:50,220  -->  00:11:50,230

537

00:11:50,230  -->  00:11:51,990
we'll need to get rid of some

538

00:11:51,990  -->  00:11:52,000

539

00:11:52,000  -->  00:11:53,280
observations so we make sure that

540

00:11:53,280  -->  00:11:53,290

541

00:11:53,290  -->  00:11:56,460
there's only one observation left in

542

00:11:56,460  -->  00:11:56,470

543

00:11:56,470  -->  00:11:59,129
this secondary data set and that

544

00:11:59,129  -->  00:11:59,139

545

00:11:59,139  -->  00:12:01,350
observation will be joined to every

546

00:12:01,350  -->  00:12:01,360

547

00:12:01,360  -->  00:12:03,540
single observation for that same year in

548

00:12:03,540  -->  00:12:03,550

549

00:12:03,550  -->  00:12:05,519
the primary data set, and the reason why

550

00:12:05,519  -->  00:12:05,529

551

00:12:05,529  -->  00:12:07,350
we're going to choose March is because

552

00:12:07,350  -->  00:12:07,360

553

00:12:07,360  -->  00:12:11,430
it comes earlier than the other quarters

554

00:12:11,430  -->  00:12:11,440

555

00:12:11,440  -->  00:12:15,689
and therefore we won't miss out for

556

00:12:15,689  -->  00:12:15,699

557

00:12:15,699  -->  00:12:17,879
instance in the last year because the

558

00:12:17,879  -->  00:12:17,889

559

00:12:17,889  -->  00:12:19,829
last quarter might not be yet available

560

00:12:19,829  -->  00:12:19,839

561

00:12:19,839  -->  00:12:21,360
in our secondary data set, if we

562

00:12:21,360  -->  00:12:21,370

563

00:12:21,370  -->  00:12:24,269
re.. if we keep only that then for

564

00:12:24,269  -->  00:12:24,279

565

00:12:24,279  -->  00:12:26,610
the last year we might end up with a

566

00:12:26,610  -->  00:12:26,620

567

00:12:26,620  -->  00:12:29,460
situation where we won't have sufficient

568

00:12:29,460  -->  00:12:29,470

569

00:12:29,470  -->  00:12:32,340
information to visi.. visualize that last

570

00:12:32,340  -->  00:12:32,350

571

00:12:32,350  -->  00:12:33,750
year. So we want to keep the earlier

572

00:12:33,750  -->  00:12:33,760

573

00:12:33,760  -->  00:12:35,610
quarter and so that's exactly what we're

574

00:12:35,610  -->  00:12:35,620

575

00:12:35,620  -->  00:12:37,110
going to do now we're going to go ahead

576

00:12:37,110  -->  00:12:37,120

577

00:12:37,120  -->  00:12:40,530
and form this new blend in Tableau. Let's

578

00:12:40,530  -->  00:12:40,540

579

00:12:40,540  -->  00:12:41,759
go ahead and do that.

580

00:12:41,759  -->  00:12:41,769

581

00:12:41,769  -->  00:12:44,670
Alright so first of all as in the

582

00:12:44,670  -->  00:12:44,680

583

00:12:44,680  -->  00:12:46,319
presentation we're going to get rid of

584

00:12:46,319  -->  00:12:46,329

585

00:12:46,329  -->  00:12:49,470
this restriction on quarter so let's go

586

00:12:49,470  -->  00:12:49,480

587

00:12:49,480  -->  00:12:52,860
ahead and look at our relationships and

588

00:12:52,860  -->  00:12:52,870

589

00:12:52,870  -->  00:12:54,420
here we're going to get rid of this

590

00:12:54,420  -->  00:12:54,430

591

00:12:54,430  -->  00:12:57,480
restriction that the quarter has to equal

592

00:12:57,480  -->  00:12:57,490

593

00:12:57,490  -->  00:12:59,699
the quarter and as soon as I delete that

594

00:12:59,699  -->  00:12:59,709

595

00:12:59,709  -->  00:13:01,290
and click ok we'll look at the chart it

596

00:13:01,290  -->  00:13:01,300

597

00:13:01,300  -->  00:13:04,500
will change. So here what you can see in

598

00:13:04,500  -->  00:13:04,510

599

00:13:04,510  -->  00:13:09,329
the population is now in a ...like

600

00:13:09,329  -->  00:13:09,339

601

00:13:09,339  -->  00:13:12,480
huge numbers, 25 million and that is

602

00:13:12,480  -->  00:13:12,490

603

00:13:12,490  -->  00:13:14,670
definitely way too much and as you can

604

00:13:14,670  -->  00:13:14,680

605

00:13:14,680  -->  00:13:16,120
see here it drops off and that's

606

00:13:16,120  -->  00:13:16,130

607

00:13:16,130  -->  00:13:18,490
that's kind of very a good hint that

608

00:13:18,490  -->  00:13:18,500

609

00:13:18,500  -->  00:13:20,020
something is wrong.

610

00:13:20,020  -->  00:13:20,030

611

00:13:20,030  -->  00:13:21,850
Well what's happening here is we have

612

00:13:21,850  -->  00:13:21,860

613

00:13:21,860  -->  00:13:25,420
that the multiple duplication where

614

00:13:25,420  -->  00:13:25,430

615

00:13:25,430  -->  00:13:29,140
within a year we have four values. We

616

00:13:29,140  -->  00:13:29,150

617

00:13:29,150  -->  00:13:30,790
have four quarters and they're actually

618

00:13:30,790  -->  00:13:30,800

619

00:13:30,800  -->  00:13:34,990
being all joined to one field so here the

620

00:13:34,990  -->  00:13:35,000

621

00:13:35,000  -->  00:13:38,260
values four times greater than it should be

622

00:13:38,260  -->  00:13:38,270

623

00:13:38,270  -->  00:13:42,640
so 27 should be actually divided by 4, well

624

00:13:42,640  -->  00:13:42,650

625

00:13:42,650  -->  00:13:44,200
that's that's a very rough estimate

626

00:13:44,200  -->  00:13:44,210

627

00:13:44,210  -->  00:13:46,330
anyway. So now we're going to perform

628

00:13:46,330  -->  00:13:46,340

629

00:13:46,340  -->  00:13:49,840
that second aspect we talked about in

630

00:13:49,840  -->  00:13:49,850

631

00:13:49,850  -->  00:13:52,180
the presentation we're going to get rid

632

00:13:52,180  -->  00:13:52,190

633

00:13:52,190  -->  00:13:54,370
of all the other observations or all the

634

00:13:54,370  -->  00:13:54,380

635

00:13:54,380  -->  00:13:55,960
information that we don't need in the

636

00:13:55,960  -->  00:13:55,970

637

00:13:55,970  -->  00:13:58,300
secondary data source so let's go to a data

638

00:13:58,300  -->  00:13:58,310

639

00:13:58,310  -->  00:14:00,460
source and add another data source

640

00:14:00,460  -->  00:14:00,470

641

00:14:00,470  -->  00:14:03,640
filter. We're going to go add. We're going

642

00:14:03,640  -->  00:14:03,650

643

00:14:03,650  -->  00:14:07,120
to look at f1 and here we're going to

644

00:14:07,120  -->  00:14:07,130

645

00:14:07,130  -->  00:14:09,760
say months. So we only want March, we

646

00:14:09,760  -->  00:14:09,770

647

00:14:09,770  -->  00:14:11,140
don't want these other three months we

648

00:14:11,140  -->  00:14:11,150

649

00:14:11,150  -->  00:14:12,910
always only want much for every single

650

00:14:12,910  -->  00:14:12,920

651

00:14:12,920  -->  00:14:13,480
year.

652

00:14:13,480  -->  00:14:13,490

653

00:14:13,490  -->  00:14:16,240
Click ok and now here you can see that

654

00:14:16,240  -->  00:14:16,250

655

00:14:16,250  -->  00:14:17,800
we're going we're only left with March

656

00:14:17,800  -->  00:14:17,810

657

00:14:17,810  -->  00:14:19,660
and if we go back to data set you can

658

00:14:19,660  -->  00:14:19,670

659

00:14:19,670  -->  00:14:22,090
see it's all fixed up now. So now our

660

00:14:22,090  -->  00:14:22,100

661

00:14:22,100  -->  00:14:25,030
population is back to normal and now the

662

00:14:25,030  -->  00:14:25,040

663

00:14:25,040  -->  00:14:27,580
difference is that this step is not

664

00:14:27,580  -->  00:14:27,590

665

00:14:27,590  -->  00:14:30,760
three months it is actually every year

666

00:14:30,760  -->  00:14:30,770

667

00:14:30,770  -->  00:14:32,950
so as you can see the population doesn't

668

00:14:32,950  -->  00:14:32,960

669

00:14:32,960  -->  00:14:35,860
change within the year 6,735 for this

670

00:14:35,860  -->  00:14:35,870

671

00:14:35,870  -->  00:14:38,350
year, then here it's the same and that is

672

00:14:38,350  -->  00:14:38,360

673

00:14:38,360  -->  00:14:40,780
the March population taken from the

674

00:14:40,780  -->  00:14:40,790

675

00:14:40,790  -->  00:14:41,950
secondary data source.

676

00:14:41,950  -->  00:14:41,960

677

00:14:41,960  -->  00:14:44,470
So now what we can to do to get rid of

678

00:14:44,470  -->  00:14:44,480

679

00:14:44,480  -->  00:14:46,240
these gaps. We're just going to take

680

00:14:46,240  -->  00:14:46,250

681

00:14:46,250  -->  00:14:49,150
quarters out and we can also take years

682

00:14:49,150  -->  00:14:49,160

683

00:14:49,160  -->  00:14:53,500
out and that way now it is working

684

00:14:53,500  -->  00:14:53,510

685

00:14:53,510  -->  00:14:55,660
without any gaps and as you can see it

686

00:14:55,660  -->  00:14:55,670

687

00:14:55,670  -->  00:14:58,540
is nice and smooth.

688

00:14:58,540  -->  00:14:58,550

689

00:14:58,550  -->  00:15:01,570
Ok so that is how you perform different

690

00:15:01,570  -->  00:15:01,580

691

00:15:01,580  -->  00:15:03,340
types of blends always make sure to

692

00:15:03,340  -->  00:15:03,350

693

00:15:03,350  -->  00:15:07,420
check your work so by going to your

694

00:15:07,420  -->  00:15:07,430

695

00:15:07,430  -->  00:15:10,180
data set and clicking view data or

696

00:15:10,180  -->  00:15:10,190

697

00:15:10,190  -->  00:15:11,950
even better going to the original to

698

00:15:11,950  -->  00:15:11,960

699

00:15:11,960  -->  00:15:14,380
excel file and checking that. What you're

700

00:15:14,380  -->  00:15:14,390

701

00:15:14,390  -->  00:15:18,150
seeing on the chart is actually, what is,

702

00:15:18,150  -->  00:15:18,160

703

00:15:18,160  -->  00:15:20,249
What was given to you in the data set so

704

00:15:20,249  -->  00:15:20,259

705

00:15:20,259  -->  00:15:23,519
we can hear check 2013 New South Wales

706

00:15:23,519  -->  00:15:23,529

707

00:15:23,529  -->  00:15:29,009
should be 7, 3, 8, 6 so 2013, 7, 3, 8, 6 so

708

00:15:29,009  -->  00:15:29,019

709

00:15:29,019  -->  00:15:29,819
that's great!

710

00:15:29,819  -->  00:15:29,829

711

00:15:29,829  -->  00:15:31,439
And that brings us to the end of this

712

00:15:31,439  -->  00:15:31,449

713

00:15:31,449  -->  00:15:33,030
tutorial, hope you found this information

714

00:15:33,030  -->  00:15:33,040

715

00:15:33,040  -->  00:15:35,519
useful and it will give you some ideas

716

00:15:35,519  -->  00:15:35,529

717

00:15:35,529  -->  00:15:37,769
on how to do advanced blending in

718

00:15:37,769  -->  00:15:37,779

719

00:15:37,779  -->  00:15:39,990
Tableau and in next tutorial we will

720

00:15:39,990  -->  00:15:40,000

721

00:15:40,000  -->  00:15:42,809
continue with our investigations. I look

722

00:15:42,809  -->  00:15:42,819

723

00:15:42,819  -->  00:15:43,980
forward to seeing you then,

724

00:15:43,980  -->  00:15:43,990

725

00:15:43,990  -->  00:15:50,879
until next time, Happy Analyzing!
