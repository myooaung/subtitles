00:00:05.300  -->  00:00:06.920
Hello and welcome back to that advance

3

00:00:06.920  -->  00:00:06.930

4

00:00:06.930  -->  00:00:09.110
course on Tableau. In the previous

5

00:00:09.110  -->  00:00:09.120

6

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:11.810
tutorial, we successfully finalized the

7

00:00:11.810  -->  00:00:11.820

8

00:00:11.820  -->  00:00:13.520
blend and today we're going to take

9

00:00:13.520  -->  00:00:13.530

10

00:00:13.530  -->  00:00:15.320
advantage of the blended data and

11

00:00:15.320  -->  00:00:15.330

12

00:00:15.330  -->  00:00:17.630
creating new calculated field and what

13

00:00:17.630  -->  00:00:17.640

14

00:00:17.640  -->  00:00:18.890
we're going to be doing is we're going

15

00:00:18.890  -->  00:00:18.900

16

00:00:18.900  -->  00:00:21.170
to take the turnover for the industry

17

00:00:21.170  -->  00:00:21.180

18

00:00:21.180  -->  00:00:23.240
which we can see here in this case is

19

00:00:23.240  -->  00:00:23.250

20

00:00:23.250  -->  00:00:24.560
for New South Wales and we're going to

21

00:00:24.560  -->  00:00:24.570

22

00:00:24.570  -->  00:00:27.439
divide it by the population for New

23

00:00:27.439  -->  00:00:27.449

24

00:00:27.449  -->  00:00:30.380
South Wales and also you can see that

25

00:00:30.380  -->  00:00:30.390

26

00:00:30.390  -->  00:00:32.960
we've got the population graph here so

27

00:00:32.960  -->  00:00:32.970

28

00:00:32.970  -->  00:00:35.570
we have data on how the population

29

00:00:35.570  -->  00:00:35.580

30

00:00:35.580  -->  00:00:38.899
is changing and we chose to take

31

00:00:38.899  -->  00:00:38.909

32

00:00:38.909  -->  00:00:40.880
advantage of the yearly population so

33

00:00:40.880  -->  00:00:40.890

34

00:00:40.890  -->  00:00:42.950
we're substituting the population in

35

00:00:42.950  -->  00:00:42.960

36

00:00:42.960  -->  00:00:45.380
every month with the March population

37

00:00:45.380  -->  00:00:45.390

38

00:00:45.390  -->  00:00:46.729
for that year. So we're going to

39

00:00:46.729  -->  00:00:46.739

40

00:00:46.739  -->  00:00:48.649
basically take the information in this

41

00:00:48.649  -->  00:00:48.659

42

00:00:48.659  -->  00:00:50.509
graph and divide it by the information in this

43

00:00:50.509  -->  00:00:50.519

44

00:00:50.519  -->  00:00:52.820
graph and getting new calculated field

45

00:00:52.820  -->  00:00:52.830

46

00:00:52.830  -->  00:00:55.250
so we're going to divide turnover by population

47

00:00:55.250  -->  00:00:55.260

48

00:00:55.260  -->  00:00:59.030
and that will leave us with sales per

49

00:00:59.030  -->  00:00:59.040

50

00:00:59.040  -->  00:01:02.780
capita and to achieve this we're going

51

00:01:02.780  -->  00:01:02.790

52

00:01:02.790  -->  00:01:05.299
to have to work with two data sets so

53

00:01:05.299  -->  00:01:05.309

54

00:01:05.309  -->  00:01:08.150
these two data sets which are within a

55

00:01:08.150  -->  00:01:08.160

56

00:01:08.160  -->  00:01:09.680
blend so are calculated field is

57

00:01:09.680  -->  00:01:09.690

58

00:01:09.690  -->  00:01:11.450
actually going to be a calculated field

59

00:01:11.450  -->  00:01:11.460

60

00:01:11.460  -->  00:01:14.450
across two separate data sets within

61

00:01:14.450  -->  00:01:14.460

62

00:01:14.460  -->  00:01:17.630
a blend and as you recall from the basic

63

00:01:17.630  -->  00:01:17.640

64

00:01:17.640  -->  00:01:18.590
course on Tableau we've already

65

00:01:18.590  -->  00:01:18.600

66

00:01:18.600  -->  00:01:21.020
discussed this topic and we already know

67

00:01:21.020  -->  00:01:21.030

68

00:01:21.030  -->  00:01:22.610
how to create these calculated fields

69

00:01:22.610  -->  00:01:22.620

70

00:01:22.620  -->  00:01:24.050
and therefore that knowledge will

71

00:01:24.050  -->  00:01:24.060

72

00:01:24.060  -->  00:01:26.840
definitely come in handy. So let's get

73

00:01:26.840  -->  00:01:26.850

74

00:01:26.850  -->  00:01:29.000
down to work, in order to create a

75

00:01:29.000  -->  00:01:29.010

76

00:01:29.010  -->  00:01:31.460
calculated field across blend we have to

77

00:01:31.460  -->  00:01:31.470

78

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:36.560
first select one of the elements of our

79

00:01:36.560  -->  00:01:36.570

80

00:01:36.570  -->  00:01:37.670
calculations in this case will be

81

00:01:37.670  -->  00:01:37.680

82

00:01:37.680  -->  00:01:39.560
turnover will right-click it and select

83

00:01:39.560  -->  00:01:39.570

84

00:01:39.570  -->  00:01:42.800
create calculated field right and here

85

00:01:42.800  -->  00:01:42.810

86

00:01:42.810  -->  00:01:44.390
we're going to say we want to take

87

00:01:44.390  -->  00:01:44.400

88

00:01:44.400  -->  00:01:47.990
turnover and we want to divide it by population so,

89

00:01:47.990  -->  00:01:48.000

90

00:01:48.000  -->  00:01:50.149
we're going to go back to the population

91

00:01:50.149  -->  00:01:50.159

92

00:01:50.159  -->  00:01:53.540
source which is this data set over here

93

00:01:53.540  -->  00:01:53.550

94

00:01:53.550  -->  00:01:55.160
and we're going to take population and

95

00:01:55.160  -->  00:01:55.170

96

00:01:55.170  -->  00:01:58.490
drag it here. Now we might need a quick

97

00:01:58.490  -->  00:01:58.500

98

00:01:58.500  -->  00:02:00.200
refresher on what's going on

99

00:02:00.200  -->  00:02:00.210

100

00:02:00.210  -->  00:02:03.080
so where as you can see once I drag

101

00:02:03.080  -->  00:02:03.090

102

00:02:03.090  -->  00:02:06.110
population in it automatically sum the

103

00:02:06.110  -->  00:02:06.120

104

00:02:06.120  -->  00:02:10.279
population bearable and what you can see

105

00:02:10.279  -->  00:02:10.289

106

00:02:10.289  -->  00:02:11.510
here is also it

107

00:02:11.510  -->  00:02:11.520

108

00:02:11.520  -->  00:02:13.850
Tableau added this prefix, so this prefix

109

00:02:13.850  -->  00:02:13.860

110

00:02:13.860  -->  00:02:15.840
tells you where this

111

00:02:15.840  -->  00:02:15.850

112

00:02:15.850  -->  00:02:17.820
column is coming from and that is this data

113

00:02:17.820  -->  00:02:17.830

114

00:02:17.830  -->  00:02:21.060
set and the sum is here because of the

115

00:02:21.060  -->  00:02:21.070

116

00:02:21.070  -->  00:02:24.810
way the blend works and that is first

117

00:02:24.810  -->  00:02:24.820

118

00:02:24.820  -->  00:02:27.660
before the blend is conducted Tableau

119

00:02:27.660  -->  00:02:27.670

120

00:02:27.670  -->  00:02:30.030
sense queries to both datasets and then

121

00:02:30.030  -->  00:02:30.040

122

00:02:30.040  -->  00:02:32.580
asks the datasets to aggregate the data

123

00:02:32.580  -->  00:02:32.590

124

00:02:32.590  -->  00:02:35.310
to the level of aggregation in the view

125

00:02:35.310  -->  00:02:35.320

126

00:02:35.320  -->  00:02:37.530
and then once the data has come back

127

00:02:37.530  -->  00:02:37.540

128

00:02:37.540  -->  00:02:40.020
only then the two datasets are joined which

129

00:02:40.020  -->  00:02:40.030

130

00:02:40.030  -->  00:02:42.840
is called the blend and therefore there

131

00:02:42.840  -->  00:02:42.850

132

00:02:42.850  -->  00:02:45.000
has to be an aggregation when you are

133

00:02:45.000  -->  00:02:45.010

134

00:02:45.010  -->  00:02:46.920
creating calculated field across a blend

135

00:02:46.920  -->  00:02:46.930

136

00:02:46.930  -->  00:02:48.570
you have to have an aggregation here

137

00:02:48.570  -->  00:02:48.580

138

00:02:48.580  -->  00:02:50.910
because the data is already aggregated

139

00:02:50.910  -->  00:02:50.920

140

00:02:50.920  -->  00:02:54.270
and that is exactly why we have an error

141

00:02:54.270  -->  00:02:54.280

142

00:02:54.280  -->  00:02:57.180
here because one field is aggregated and

143

00:02:57.180  -->  00:02:57.190

144

00:02:57.190  -->  00:02:59.700
so does the other one have to be so we

145

00:02:59.700  -->  00:02:59.710

146

00:02:59.710  -->  00:03:01.650
have to put an aggregation here in this

147

00:03:01.650  -->  00:03:01.660

148

00:03:01.660  -->  00:03:04.440
case is going to be sum as well. Sum

149

00:03:04.440  -->  00:03:04.450

150

00:03:04.450  -->  00:03:10.710
meaning it will the elements or the rows

151

00:03:10.710  -->  00:03:10.720

152

00:03:10.720  -->  00:03:12.270
have to be summed to the level of

153

00:03:12.270  -->  00:03:12.280

154

00:03:12.280  -->  00:03:14.790
aggregation in this view which is in our

155

00:03:14.790  -->  00:03:14.800

156

00:03:14.800  -->  00:03:18.660
case monthly. Okay so we've got sum of

157

00:03:18.660  -->  00:03:18.670

158

00:03:18.670  -->  00:03:22.380
turnover divide it by sum of population and we're

159

00:03:22.380  -->  00:03:22.390

160

00:03:22.390  -->  00:03:26.940
going to call this sales per capita and

161

00:03:26.940  -->  00:03:26.950

162

00:03:26.950  -->  00:03:29.130
will click ok. Now as you can see, it

163

00:03:29.130  -->  00:03:29.140

164

00:03:29.140  -->  00:03:30.570
hasn't appeared here but that's because

165

00:03:30.570  -->  00:03:30.580

166

00:03:30.580  -->  00:03:32.460
we're in the secondary data source if we

167

00:03:32.460  -->  00:03:32.470

168

00:03:32.470  -->  00:03:34.290
go to the primary then we got sales per

169

00:03:34.290  -->  00:03:34.300

170

00:03:34.300  -->  00:03:36.870
capita here and now we just take sales

171

00:03:36.870  -->  00:03:36.880

172

00:03:36.880  -->  00:03:39.270
per capita and we're going to replace

173

00:03:39.270  -->  00:03:39.280

174

00:03:39.280  -->  00:03:42.120
sum of turnover with sales per capita.

175

00:03:42.120  -->  00:03:42.130

176

00:03:42.130  -->  00:03:48.060
It's going to take a few seconds to

177

00:03:48.060  -->  00:03:48.070

178

00:03:48.070  -->  00:03:52.059
calculate,

179

00:03:52.059  -->  00:03:52.069

180

00:03:52.069  -->  00:03:54.880
and now we can also get rid of just sum

181

00:03:54.880  -->  00:03:54.890

182

00:03:54.890  -->  00:03:56.470
of population because we don't need that.

183

00:03:56.470  -->  00:03:56.480

184

00:03:56.480  -->  00:04:00.220
Oh in fact, as you can see the values

185

00:04:00.220  -->  00:04:00.230

186

00:04:00.230  -->  00:04:02.949
are very small and that is because we're

187

00:04:02.949  -->  00:04:02.959

188

00:04:02.959  -->  00:04:05.979
taking we're dividing turnover

189

00:04:05.979  -->  00:04:05.989

190

00:04:05.989  -->  00:04:08.050
expressed in millions of dollars so what

191

00:04:08.050  -->  00:04:08.060

192

00:04:08.060  -->  00:04:09.789
we can do is we can right click and edit

193

00:04:09.789  -->  00:04:09.799

194

00:04:09.799  -->  00:04:13.539
and we can say take all of this and

195

00:04:13.539  -->  00:04:13.549

196

00:04:13.549  -->  00:04:17.439
multiply it by 1 million. That way we'll

197

00:04:17.439  -->  00:04:17.449

198

00:04:17.449  -->  00:04:19.749
be measuring sales per capita in terms

199

00:04:19.749  -->  00:04:19.759

200

00:04:19.759  -->  00:04:21.640
of dollars rather than millions of

201

00:04:21.640  -->  00:04:21.650

202

00:04:21.650  -->  00:04:24.159
dollars and there we go so now we can

203

00:04:24.159  -->  00:04:24.169

204

00:04:24.169  -->  00:04:26.680
see that this is a proper figuring out.

205

00:04:26.680  -->  00:04:26.690

206

00:04:26.690  -->  00:04:29.650
Now we can fix about filter change this

207

00:04:29.650  -->  00:04:29.660

208

00:04:29.660  -->  00:04:31.960
and return Queensland, Victoria and Western

209

00:04:31.960  -->  00:04:31.970

210

00:04:31.970  -->  00:04:35.589
Australia. There we go, so now we've got

211

00:04:35.589  -->  00:04:35.599

212

00:04:35.599  -->  00:04:39.219
the new charts. This is kind of you can

213

00:04:39.219  -->  00:04:39.229

214

00:04:39.229  -->  00:04:40.900
call it the normalized chart so it

215

00:04:40.900  -->  00:04:40.910

216

00:04:40.910  -->  00:04:42.610
doesn't tell you the total sales like

217

00:04:42.610  -->  00:04:42.620

218

00:04:42.620  -->  00:04:43.990
this industry analysis chart over here

219

00:04:43.990  -->  00:04:44.000

220

00:04:44.000  -->  00:04:46.779
it actually tells you the sales per

221

00:04:46.779  -->  00:04:46.789

222

00:04:46.789  -->  00:04:50.770
capita and now we can rename this so

223

00:04:50.770  -->  00:04:50.780

224

00:04:50.780  -->  00:04:55.719
we'll say sales per capita and ok so

225

00:04:55.719  -->  00:04:55.729

226

00:04:55.729  -->  00:04:57.129
what can we see what is the difference

227

00:04:57.129  -->  00:04:57.139

228

00:04:57.139  -->  00:04:58.990
between the two charts in industry

229

00:04:58.990  -->  00:04:59.000

230

00:04:59.000  -->  00:05:02.560
analysis we can see that this state is

231

00:05:02.560  -->  00:05:02.570

232

00:05:02.570  -->  00:05:06.279
has an upward trend and the p-values

233

00:05:06.279  -->  00:05:06.289

234

00:05:06.289  -->  00:05:09.219
less than 0.0001 meaning that it is

235

00:05:09.219  -->  00:05:09.229

236

00:05:09.229  -->  00:05:11.439
statistically significant trend. Here

237

00:05:11.439  -->  00:05:11.449

238

00:05:11.449  -->  00:05:14.020
there's also an upward trend, here is an

239

00:05:14.020  -->  00:05:14.030

240

00:05:14.030  -->  00:05:16.390
upward trend and here is also upward trend.

241

00:05:16.390  -->  00:05:16.400

242

00:05:16.400  -->  00:05:19.450
So all the industries all of the states

243

00:05:19.450  -->  00:05:19.460

244

00:05:19.460  -->  00:05:22.870
have upward trends in relation to total

245

00:05:22.870  -->  00:05:22.880

246

00:05:22.880  -->  00:05:25.149
ternal but now when we've divided by the

247

00:05:25.149  -->  00:05:25.159

248

00:05:25.159  -->  00:05:27.879
population what we can see is there's

249

00:05:27.879  -->  00:05:27.889

250

00:05:27.889  -->  00:05:30.070
still an upward trend here and still an

251

00:05:30.070  -->  00:05:30.080

252

00:05:30.080  -->  00:05:33.279
upward trend here but in these two states

253

00:05:33.279  -->  00:05:33.289

254

00:05:33.289  -->  00:05:35.860
and Queensland and Western Australia here you

255

00:05:35.860  -->  00:05:35.870

256

00:05:35.870  -->  00:05:37.779
don't have an upward trend if anything

257

00:05:37.779  -->  00:05:37.789

258

00:05:37.789  -->  00:05:40.450
this is a downward sloping line of

259

00:05:40.450  -->  00:05:40.460

260

00:05:40.460  -->  00:05:42.249
course the p-value is quite high so it

261

00:05:42.249  -->  00:05:42.259

262

00:05:42.259  -->  00:05:45.490
is 0.95 is very high so that means we

263

00:05:45.490  -->  00:05:45.500

264

00:05:45.500  -->  00:05:48.399
can't rely on this result is not

265

00:05:48.399  -->  00:05:48.409

266

00:05:48.409  -->  00:05:50.260
statistically significant but at the

267

00:05:50.260  -->  00:05:50.270

268

00:05:50.270  -->  00:05:50.980
same time

269

00:05:50.980  -->  00:05:50.990

270

00:05:50.990  -->  00:05:52.510
what is this is showing us is that the

271

00:05:52.510  -->  00:05:52.520

272

00:05:52.520  -->  00:05:54.040
upward trend that we did have is no

273

00:05:54.040  -->  00:05:54.050

274

00:05:54.050  -->  00:05:58.390
longer present and that means that what

275

00:05:58.390  -->  00:05:58.400

276

00:05:58.400  -->  00:05:59.830
we saw in the previous chart the

277

00:05:59.830  -->  00:05:59.840

278

00:05:59.840  -->  00:06:02.350
industry analysis that upward trend may

279

00:06:02.350  -->  00:06:02.360

280

00:06:02.360  -->  00:06:04.170
have been attributed

281

00:06:04.170  -->  00:06:04.180

282

00:06:04.180  -->  00:06:07.770
attributable to the growth in population

283

00:06:07.770  -->  00:06:07.780

284

00:06:07.780  -->  00:06:11.219
rather than just people spending more on

285

00:06:11.219  -->  00:06:11.229

286

00:06:11.229  -->  00:06:14.279
the products of this industry and

287

00:06:14.279  -->  00:06:14.289

288

00:06:14.289  -->  00:06:16.110
Western Australia what we see here once

289

00:06:16.110  -->  00:06:16.120

290

00:06:16.120  -->  00:06:19.140
again, we'd still have a bit of an upward

291

00:06:19.140  -->  00:06:19.150

292

00:06:19.150  -->  00:06:22.050
trend but the p-value is higher now 0.08

293

00:06:22.050  -->  00:06:22.060

294

00:06:22.060  -->  00:06:25.050
so it might, you might consider it

295

00:06:25.050  -->  00:06:25.060

296

00:06:25.060  -->  00:06:27.029
statistically significant but as you can

297

00:06:27.029  -->  00:06:27.039

298

00:06:27.039  -->  00:06:29.400
see it's a much flatter now than it used

299

00:06:29.400  -->  00:06:29.410

300

00:06:29.410  -->  00:06:32.340
to be and once again so that means that

301

00:06:32.340  -->  00:06:32.350

302

00:06:32.350  -->  00:06:34.800
probably in the Queensland and Western

303

00:06:34.800  -->  00:06:34.810

304

00:06:34.810  -->  00:06:37.050
Australia what we saw these upward

305

00:06:37.050  -->  00:06:37.060

306

00:06:37.060  -->  00:06:40.980
trends were predominantly attributable

307

00:06:40.980  -->  00:06:40.990

308

00:06:40.990  -->  00:06:43.379
to the growth in population and

309

00:06:43.379  -->  00:06:43.389

310

00:06:43.389  -->  00:06:45.510
therefore more people were spending more

311

00:06:45.510  -->  00:06:45.520

312

00:06:45.520  -->  00:06:46.860
money in

313

00:06:46.860  -->  00:06:46.870

314

00:06:46.870  -->  00:06:49.050
sum and total rather than each

315

00:06:49.050  -->  00:06:49.060

316

00:06:49.060  -->  00:06:51.480
and in each individual person spending

317

00:06:51.480  -->  00:06:51.490

318

00:06:51.490  -->  00:06:53.610
more and more over time whereas what we

319

00:06:53.610  -->  00:06:53.620

320

00:06:53.620  -->  00:06:55.379
see in these two states in New South

321

00:06:55.379  -->  00:06:55.389

322

00:06:55.389  -->  00:06:57.450
Wales and Victoria is that the

323

00:06:57.450  -->  00:06:57.460

324

00:06:57.460  -->  00:06:59.339
industries itself is growing so

325

00:06:59.339  -->  00:06:59.349

326

00:06:59.349  -->  00:07:01.320
regardless of population size the

327

00:07:01.320  -->  00:07:01.330

328

00:07:01.330  -->  00:07:03.480
industry itself is growing. Another thing

329

00:07:03.480  -->  00:07:03.490

330

00:07:03.490  -->  00:07:06.719
now is that we can compare the different

331

00:07:06.719  -->  00:07:06.729

332

00:07:06.729  -->  00:07:09.450
states among each other, so here we

333

00:07:09.450  -->  00:07:09.460

334

00:07:09.460  -->  00:07:10.740
couldn't do that because as you can see

335

00:07:10.740  -->  00:07:10.750

336

00:07:10.750  -->  00:07:15.300
the axis were completely had completely

337

00:07:15.300  -->  00:07:15.310

338

00:07:15.310  -->  00:07:16.439
different ranges and that's because

339

00:07:16.439  -->  00:07:16.449

340

00:07:16.449  -->  00:07:18.960
simply there are more people in New South

341

00:07:18.960  -->  00:07:18.970

342

00:07:18.970  -->  00:07:20.460
Wales and Victoria than there are in

343

00:07:20.460  -->  00:07:20.470

344

00:07:20.470  -->  00:07:23.310
Queensland and Western Australia but now if

345

00:07:23.310  -->  00:07:23.320

346

00:07:23.320  -->  00:07:24.750
we go back to this chart you can see

347

00:07:24.750  -->  00:07:24.760

348

00:07:24.760  -->  00:07:29.820
that the axis ranges here we can even

349

00:07:29.820  -->  00:07:29.830

350

00:07:29.830  -->  00:07:31.740
keep them uniform right? So we can keep

351

00:07:31.740  -->  00:07:31.750

352

00:07:31.750  -->  00:07:34.529
them uniform across all of them because

353

00:07:34.529  -->  00:07:34.539

354

00:07:34.539  -->  00:07:38.189
they are normalized, we've divided it by the population and

355

00:07:38.189  -->  00:07:38.199

356

00:07:38.199  -->  00:07:41.010
now this is actually how much people are

357

00:07:41.010  -->  00:07:41.020

358

00:07:41.020  -->  00:07:43.920
spending. So if anything we can just even

359

00:07:43.920  -->  00:07:43.930

360

00:07:43.930  -->  00:07:46.529
take state out and we'll get of course

361

00:07:46.529  -->  00:07:46.539

362

00:07:46.539  -->  00:07:48.719
this chart is much more cluttered but we

363

00:07:48.719  -->  00:07:48.729

364

00:07:48.729  -->  00:07:51.120
can actually compare them side-by-side

365

00:07:51.120  -->  00:07:51.130

366

00:07:51.130  -->  00:07:52.649
like that. So I'm just going to return

367

00:07:52.649  -->  00:07:52.659

368

00:07:52.659  -->  00:07:55.529
state because it's more it's easier

369

00:07:55.529  -->  00:07:55.539

370

00:07:55.539  -->  00:07:57.180
to understand this way and easier to see

371

00:07:57.180  -->  00:07:57.190

372

00:07:57.190  -->  00:08:00.510
and so what can we see we can see that

373

00:08:00.510  -->  00:08:00.520

374

00:08:00.520  -->  00:08:04.830
overall people are spending more of

375

00:08:04.830  -->  00:08:04.840

376

00:08:04.840  -->  00:08:07.140
course in New South Wales and Victoria.

377

00:08:07.140  -->  00:08:07.150

378

00:08:07.150  -->  00:08:10.230
We can see that just simply by looking

379

00:08:10.230  -->  00:08:10.240

380

00:08:10.240  -->  00:08:13.230
at this chart so for instance here it's

381

00:08:13.230  -->  00:08:13.240

382

00:08:13.240  -->  00:08:17.129
63.53, here at 63.72 so

383

00:08:17.129  -->  00:08:17.139

384

00:08:17.139  -->  00:08:19.170
these two states are very similar in

385

00:08:19.170  -->  00:08:19.180

386

00:08:19.180  -->  00:08:21.659
that sense I hear people are spending

387

00:08:21.659  -->  00:08:21.669

388

00:08:21.669  -->  00:08:25.379
less than fifty dollars per person per

389

00:08:25.379  -->  00:08:25.389

390

00:08:25.389  -->  00:08:28.409
month on in this industry in both

391

00:08:28.409  -->  00:08:28.419

392

00:08:28.419  -->  00:08:31.080
Queensland and Western Australia. So that is

393

00:08:31.080  -->  00:08:31.090

394

00:08:31.090  -->  00:08:34.889
how we analyze these charts and that

395

00:08:34.889  -->  00:08:34.899

396

00:08:34.899  -->  00:08:39.149
is the advantage that per capita

397

00:08:39.149  -->  00:08:39.159

398

00:08:39.159  -->  00:08:40.769
calculation can give us. It gives us a

399

00:08:40.769  -->  00:08:40.779

400

00:08:40.779  -->  00:08:43.380
clearer picture and allows us to achieve

401

00:08:43.380  -->  00:08:43.390

402

00:08:43.390  -->  00:08:46.769
some or derive some insights that are

403

00:08:46.769  -->  00:08:46.779

404

00:08:46.779  -->  00:08:49.290
more relevant to our task at hand and

405

00:08:49.290  -->  00:08:49.300

406

00:08:49.300  -->  00:08:51.480
that is investigating the business

407

00:08:51.480  -->  00:08:51.490

408

00:08:51.490  -->  00:08:53.850
environment within each of these states

409

00:08:53.850  -->  00:08:53.860

410

00:08:53.860  -->  00:08:55.439
to understand where the expansion should

411

00:08:55.439  -->  00:08:55.449

412

00:08:55.449  -->  00:08:58.050
happen. So the conclusion here would be

413

00:08:58.050  -->  00:08:58.060

414

00:08:58.060  -->  00:09:01.230
that first of all, out of these other

415

00:09:01.230  -->  00:09:01.240

416

00:09:01.240  -->  00:09:02.790
three states that the business is not

417

00:09:02.790  -->  00:09:02.800

418

00:09:02.800  -->  00:09:05.160
currently operating in Victoria has the

419

00:09:05.160  -->  00:09:05.170

420

00:09:05.170  -->  00:09:06.990
upward trend so the industry is actually

421

00:09:06.990  -->  00:09:07.000

422

00:09:07.000  -->  00:09:10.680
growing in Victoria and also we would

423

00:09:10.680  -->  00:09:10.690

424

00:09:10.690  -->  00:09:13.439
say that out of these three states

425

00:09:13.439  -->  00:09:13.449

426

00:09:13.449  -->  00:09:15.329
Victoria is the most similar the

427

00:09:15.329  -->  00:09:15.339

428

00:09:15.339  -->  00:09:16.740
business environment is the most similar

429

00:09:16.740  -->  00:09:16.750

430

00:09:16.750  -->  00:09:18.840
to New South Wales so you can see that the

431

00:09:18.840  -->  00:09:18.850

432

00:09:18.850  -->  00:09:21.449
trends are questionable, so they are both upward trends

433

00:09:21.449  -->  00:09:21.459

434

00:09:21.459  -->  00:09:24.360
and also which you can see is that the

435

00:09:24.360  -->  00:09:24.370

436

00:09:24.370  -->  00:09:28.380
price or the amount spent per capita is

437

00:09:28.380  -->  00:09:28.390

438

00:09:28.390  -->  00:09:31.829
greater than fifty dollars only in

439

00:09:31.829  -->  00:09:31.839

440

00:09:31.839  -->  00:09:33.810
Victoria just like in a New South Wales.

441

00:09:33.810  -->  00:09:33.820

442

00:09:33.820  -->  00:09:37.560
So in from both of those points of view

443

00:09:37.560  -->  00:09:37.570

444

00:09:37.570  -->  00:09:43.079
Victoria is the better state to consider

445

00:09:43.079  -->  00:09:43.089

446

00:09:43.089  -->  00:09:45.990
for the expansion and that brings us to

447

00:09:45.990  -->  00:09:46.000

448

00:09:46.000  -->  00:09:48.120
the end of today's tutorial. In the next

449

00:09:48.120  -->  00:09:48.130

450

00:09:48.130  -->  00:09:50.579
tutorial, we're going to talk about the

451

00:09:50.579  -->  00:09:50.589

452

00:09:50.589  -->  00:09:52.889
next step that we need to take and that is how to

453

00:09:52.889  -->  00:09:52.899

454

00:09:52.899  -->  00:09:55.500
add forecasting flow charts and I look

455

00:09:55.500  -->  00:09:55.510

456

00:09:55.510  -->  00:09:56.759
forward to seeing you next time and

457

00:09:56.759  -->  00:09:56.769

458

00:09:56.769  -->  00:10:03.300
until then, happy analyzing.
