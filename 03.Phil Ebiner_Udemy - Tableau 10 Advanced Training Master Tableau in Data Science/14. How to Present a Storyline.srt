1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,670

2

00:00:05,300  -->  00:00:07,300
Hello and welcome back to the advance

3

00:00:07,300  -->  00:00:07,310

4

00:00:07,310  -->  00:00:09,910
course on Tableau. We are very close to

5

00:00:09,910  -->  00:00:09,920

6

00:00:09,920  -->  00:00:11,530
the end of the section. We have conducted

7

00:00:11,530  -->  00:00:11,540

8

00:00:11,540  -->  00:00:14,560
all of the required analysis and we are

9

00:00:14,560  -->  00:00:14,570

10

00:00:14,570  -->  00:00:16,870
ready to put our findings into a report

11

00:00:16,870  -->  00:00:16,880

12

00:00:16,880  -->  00:00:18,700
and that is exactly what we're going to

13

00:00:18,700  -->  00:00:18,710

14

00:00:18,710  -->  00:00:19,600
do today.

15

00:00:19,600  -->  00:00:19,610

16

00:00:19,610  -->  00:00:22,029
Now let's see what the best way to do

17

00:00:22,029  -->  00:00:22,039

18

00:00:22,039  -->  00:00:24,790
that is. Alright so we have the box plots

19

00:00:24,790  -->  00:00:24,800

20

00:00:24,800  -->  00:00:27,040
and the box plots they do feel like they

21

00:00:27,040  -->  00:00:27,050

22

00:00:27,050  -->  00:00:29,140
were quite a long time ago.

23

00:00:29,140  -->  00:00:29,150

24

00:00:29,150  -->  00:00:33,009
This is the analysis of competitors. This

25

00:00:33,009  -->  00:00:33,019

26

00:00:33,019  -->  00:00:36,280
is our industry analysis so just in a

27

00:00:36,280  -->  00:00:36,290

28

00:00:36,290  -->  00:00:38,829
general without taking into account per

29

00:00:38,829  -->  00:00:38,839

30

00:00:38,839  -->  00:00:41,829
capita and per capita sales and here

31

00:00:41,829  -->  00:00:41,839

32

00:00:41,839  -->  00:00:43,420
we've got the sales per capita with the

33

00:00:43,420  -->  00:00:43,430

34

00:00:43,430  -->  00:00:45,579
forecast. So there are a number of ways

35

00:00:45,579  -->  00:00:45,589

36

00:00:45,589  -->  00:00:47,920
of presenting this and I'm going to go

37

00:00:47,920  -->  00:00:47,930

38

00:00:47,930  -->  00:00:49,360
with the storyline. So I'm going to

39

00:00:49,360  -->  00:00:49,370

40

00:00:49,370  -->  00:00:51,640
create a storyline and we're going to

41

00:00:51,640  -->  00:00:51,650

42

00:00:51,650  -->  00:00:57,939
say maybe, final presentation here and so

43

00:00:57,939  -->  00:00:57,949

44

00:00:57,949  -->  00:01:00,910
a couple ways you could just show the

45

00:01:00,910  -->  00:01:00,920

46

00:01:00,920  -->  00:01:02,859
box plots and you could just show the

47

00:01:02,859  -->  00:01:02,869

48

00:01:02,869  -->  00:01:04,990
sales per capital as is like this. So I

49

00:01:04,990  -->  00:01:05,000

50

00:01:05,000  -->  00:01:06,550
was thinking of doing that as well but

51

00:01:06,550  -->  00:01:06,560

52

00:01:06,560  -->  00:01:09,550
then the presentation feels a bit weak I

53

00:01:09,550  -->  00:01:09,560

54

00:01:09,560  -->  00:01:12,639
think it feels a bit empty so you want

55

00:01:12,639  -->  00:01:12,649

56

00:01:12,649  -->  00:01:14,770
you want to put in some more steps into

57

00:01:14,770  -->  00:01:14,780

58

00:01:14,780  -->  00:01:17,139
not necessarily more different visuals

59

00:01:17,139  -->  00:01:17,149

60

00:01:17,149  -->  00:01:20,260
but show people like a few more steps

61

00:01:20,260  -->  00:01:20,270

62

00:01:20,270  -->  00:01:22,270
and expand on things a little bit more

63

00:01:22,270  -->  00:01:22,280

64

00:01:22,280  -->  00:01:25,209
and that's why I think what we're going

65

00:01:25,209  -->  00:01:25,219

66

00:01:25,219  -->  00:01:26,859
to do is we're going to add the box

67

00:01:26,859  -->  00:01:26,869

68

00:01:26,869  -->  00:01:29,499
plots, then we're going to show the

69

00:01:29,499  -->  00:01:29,509

70

00:01:29,509  -->  00:01:31,989
industry analysis so we will actually

71

00:01:31,989  -->  00:01:31,999

72

00:01:31,999  -->  00:01:35,260
say this is what the industries

73

00:01:35,260  -->  00:01:35,270

74

00:01:35,270  -->  00:01:38,080
turnovers look like for all. This

75

00:01:38,080  -->  00:01:38,090

76

00:01:38,090  -->  00:01:40,179
industries turnover looks like in a

77

00:01:40,179  -->  00:01:40,189

78

00:01:40,189  -->  00:01:41,230
different state.

79

00:01:41,230  -->  00:01:41,240

80

00:01:41,240  -->  00:01:44,440
However, if we take into consideration

81

00:01:44,440  -->  00:01:44,450

82

00:01:44,450  -->  00:01:45,969
that the populations are growing at

83

00:01:45,969  -->  00:01:45,979

84

00:01:45,979  -->  00:01:47,020
different rates,

85

00:01:47,020  -->  00:01:47,030

86

00:01:47,030  -->  00:01:48,669
this is what sales per capital looks like

87

00:01:48,669  -->  00:01:48,679

88

00:01:48,679  -->  00:01:50,230
and then we'll show this chart but

89

00:01:50,230  -->  00:01:50,240

90

00:01:50,240  -->  00:01:52,690
without the forecast and then we'll

91

00:01:52,690  -->  00:01:52,700

92

00:01:52,700  -->  00:01:54,609
show this chart with the forecast. So

93

00:01:54,609  -->  00:01:54,619

94

00:01:54,619  -->  00:01:57,550
that's our plan for now, so and in this

95

00:01:57,550  -->  00:01:57,560

96

00:01:57,560  -->  00:01:59,349
in this storyline we're not going to add

97

00:01:59,349  -->  00:01:59,359

98

00:01:59,359  -->  00:02:01,389
text, we're just going to have the pictures

99

00:02:01,389  -->  00:02:01,399

100

00:02:01,399  -->  00:02:03,940
and when you're talking, you're

101

00:02:03,940  -->  00:02:03,950

102

00:02:03,950  -->  00:02:07,239
actually presenting you will then say

103

00:02:07,239  -->  00:02:07,249

104

00:02:07,249  -->  00:02:08,740
all the words that requires. So we're

105

00:02:08,740  -->  00:02:08,750

106

00:02:08,750  -->  00:02:10,330
assuming that this presentation has to be

107

00:02:10,330  -->  00:02:10,340

108

00:02:10,340  -->  00:02:13,119
delivered in person rather than the

109

00:02:13,119  -->  00:02:13,129

110

00:02:13,129  -->  00:02:14,289
stakeholders reading through it

111

00:02:14,289  -->  00:02:14,299

112

00:02:14,299  -->  00:02:15,220
themselves.

113

00:02:15,220  -->  00:02:15,230

114

00:02:15,230  -->  00:02:16,540
So let's change this to

115

00:02:16,540  -->  00:02:16,550

116

00:02:16,550  -->  00:02:19,630
maybe yeah why not? Let's change it to a

117

00:02:19,630  -->  00:02:19,640

118

00:02:19,640  -->  00:02:22,420
desktop and I'll expand my Tableau maybe

119

00:02:22,420  -->  00:02:22,430

120

00:02:22,430  -->  00:02:25,120
that's a bit too much so let's expand it

121

00:02:25,120  -->  00:02:25,130

122

00:02:25,130  -->  00:02:30,790
a bit so I just see this whole storyline.

123

00:02:30,790  -->  00:02:30,800

124

00:02:30,800  -->  00:02:33,100
Alright so there we go and this is gonna

125

00:02:33,100  -->  00:02:33,110

126

00:02:33,110  -->  00:02:35,740
be our final presentation box plots so

127

00:02:35,740  -->  00:02:35,750

128

00:02:35,750  -->  00:02:38,620
we got a title here and actually as we

129

00:02:38,620  -->  00:02:38,630

130

00:02:38,630  -->  00:02:40,510
discussed previously we want to first

131

00:02:40,510  -->  00:02:40,520

132

00:02:40,520  -->  00:02:42,910
create dashboards right? So we want to

133

00:02:42,910  -->  00:02:42,920

134

00:02:42,920  -->  00:02:44,710
create a dashboard for every single one,

135

00:02:44,710  -->  00:02:44,720

136

00:02:44,720  -->  00:02:49,420
maybe duplicate the sales per capita and

137

00:02:49,420  -->  00:02:49,430

138

00:02:49,430  -->  00:02:52,060
this one will call sales per capita with

139

00:02:52,060  -->  00:02:52,070

140

00:02:52,070  -->  00:03:00,370
forecast, with forecast and here we're

141

00:03:00,370  -->  00:03:00,380

142

00:03:00,380  -->  00:03:02,170
going to just switch the forecast off,

143

00:03:02,170  -->  00:03:02,180

144

00:03:02,180  -->  00:03:04,900
show forecast

145

00:03:04,900  -->  00:03:04,910

146

00:03:04,910  -->  00:03:08,140
there we go and now we can match the

147

00:03:08,140  -->  00:03:08,150

148

00:03:08,150  -->  00:03:13,060
dashboards to the worksheet and so in

149

00:03:13,060  -->  00:03:13,070

150

00:03:13,070  -->  00:03:15,280
this dashboard and so our presentation

151

00:03:15,280  -->  00:03:15,290

152

00:03:15,290  -->  00:03:16,870
is going to be desktop size we're going

153

00:03:16,870  -->  00:03:16,880

154

00:03:16,880  -->  00:03:19,180
to make dashboards a bit smaller maybe a

155

00:03:19,180  -->  00:03:19,190

156

00:03:19,190  -->  00:03:22,300
laptop size, so because in the final

157

00:03:22,300  -->  00:03:22,310

158

00:03:22,310  -->  00:03:23,560
presentation we've got this bit at the

159

00:03:23,560  -->  00:03:23,570

160

00:03:23,570  -->  00:03:26,590
top right? So we want to leave some space

161

00:03:26,590  -->  00:03:26,600

162

00:03:26,600  -->  00:03:28,180
for it,

163

00:03:28,180  -->  00:03:28,190

164

00:03:28,190  -->  00:03:33,670
laptop, laptop and laptop here. Okay and

165

00:03:33,670  -->  00:03:33,680

166

00:03:33,680  -->  00:03:36,610
now let's just drag our visuals in here

167

00:03:36,610  -->  00:03:36,620

168

00:03:36,620  -->  00:03:38,380
and as you remember dashboards give you

169

00:03:38,380  -->  00:03:38,390

170

00:03:38,390  -->  00:03:40,510
more control you can delete things you

171

00:03:40,510  -->  00:03:40,520

172

00:03:40,520  -->  00:03:41,770
don't want. So that and that is a bit too

173

00:03:41,770  -->  00:03:41,780

174

00:03:41,780  -->  00:03:44,920
wide and the name here box plots that's

175

00:03:44,920  -->  00:03:44,930

176

00:03:44,930  -->  00:03:47,320
why I kind of showed the title here

177

00:03:47,320  -->  00:03:47,330

178

00:03:47,330  -->  00:03:50,080
because that is the same title that you

179

00:03:50,080  -->  00:03:50,090

180

00:03:50,090  -->  00:03:53,110
get here so we can change this to a

181

00:03:53,110  -->  00:03:53,120

182

00:03:53,120  -->  00:03:57,699
competitor analysis and maybe make it a

183

00:03:57,699  -->  00:03:57,709

184

00:03:57,709  -->  00:04:00,880
12 and center it, make

185

00:04:00,880  -->  00:04:00,890

186

00:04:00,890  -->  00:04:03,130
leave it bold, yep! So let's see competitor

187

00:04:03,130  -->  00:04:03,140

188

00:04:03,140  -->  00:04:07,390
analysis, so we don't need this label

189

00:04:07,390  -->  00:04:07,400

190

00:04:07,400  -->  00:04:08,770
because we already see that the

191

00:04:08,770  -->  00:04:08,780

192

00:04:08,780  -->  00:04:12,280
state is here, net profit margin maybe 12

193

00:04:12,280  -->  00:04:12,290

194

00:04:12,290  -->  00:04:14,620
is not the best maybe make it a bit

195

00:04:14,620  -->  00:04:14,630

196

00:04:14,630  -->  00:04:17,259
higher like 20,

197

00:04:17,259  -->  00:04:17,269

198

00:04:17,269  -->  00:04:19,570
there we go that looks better. So

199

00:04:19,570  -->  00:04:19,580

200

00:04:19,580  -->  00:04:22,810
competitor analysis and it is like the

201

00:04:22,810  -->  00:04:22,820

202

00:04:22,820  -->  00:04:24,909
box plot is why that's might not be the

203

00:04:24,909  -->  00:04:24,919

204

00:04:24,919  -->  00:04:29,360
best so what I usually do I take this

205

00:04:29,360  -->  00:04:29,370

206

00:04:29,370  -->  00:04:32,750
like I add in these things on the sides

207

00:04:32,750  -->  00:04:32,760

208

00:04:32,760  -->  00:04:39,890
and that way it fits in nicely and also

209

00:04:39,890  -->  00:04:39,900

210

00:04:39,900  -->  00:04:42,650
just to make sure that the same size, so

211

00:04:42,650  -->  00:04:42,660

212

00:04:42,660  -->  00:04:45,260
that's our competitor analysis if I drag

213

00:04:45,260  -->  00:04:45,270

214

00:04:45,270  -->  00:04:46,909
it in here now,

215

00:04:46,909  -->  00:04:46,919

216

00:04:46,919  -->  00:04:50,480
there it is. So that's our dashboard one

217

00:04:50,480  -->  00:04:50,490

218

00:04:50,490  -->  00:04:53,150
industry analysis same thing just drag

219

00:04:53,150  -->  00:04:53,160

220

00:04:53,160  -->  00:04:55,310
it into here we don't need the colors

221

00:04:55,310  -->  00:04:55,320

222

00:04:55,320  -->  00:04:57,890
because we have the names of the states

223

00:04:57,890  -->  00:04:57,900

224

00:04:57,900  -->  00:05:04,010
right so in this case same thing, so here

225

00:05:04,010  -->  00:05:04,020

226

00:05:04,020  -->  00:05:07,490
we want size 20.

227

00:05:07,490  -->  00:05:07,500

228

00:05:07,500  -->  00:05:10,640
What are we going to call this one? I'll

229

00:05:10,640  -->  00:05:10,650

230

00:05:10,650  -->  00:05:12,740
just keep it industry analysis just keep

231

00:05:12,740  -->  00:05:12,750

232

00:05:12,750  -->  00:05:16,100
it just center it, so industry analysis, we

233

00:05:16,100  -->  00:05:16,110

234

00:05:16,110  -->  00:05:19,460
don't need this label because it doesn't

235

00:05:19,460  -->  00:05:19,470

236

00:05:19,470  -->  00:05:24,020
show us any, it has no use. Here month of date

237

00:05:24,020  -->  00:05:24,030

238

00:05:24,030  -->  00:05:27,350
also same thing, no use from that label

239

00:05:27,350  -->  00:05:27,360

240

00:05:27,360  -->  00:05:28,490
just get rid of it.

241

00:05:28,490  -->  00:05:28,500

242

00:05:28,500  -->  00:05:32,029
Alright so that's our dashboard two, let's

243

00:05:32,029  -->  00:05:32,039

244

00:05:32,039  -->  00:05:36,650
add a new blank point, dashboard two, ok so

245

00:05:36,650  -->  00:05:36,660

246

00:05:36,660  -->  00:05:39,650
industry sales per capita, pretty much

247

00:05:39,650  -->  00:05:39,660

248

00:05:39,660  -->  00:05:45,110
same thing sales per capita, just change

249

00:05:45,110  -->  00:05:45,120

250

00:05:45,120  -->  00:05:49,490
a few things. Change this to a 20 keep it

251

00:05:49,490  -->  00:05:49,500

252

00:05:49,500  -->  00:05:54,680
bold, center it, get rid of state, hide

253

00:05:54,680  -->  00:05:54,690

254

00:05:54,690  -->  00:06:00,140
that, change this to nothing and get rid

255

00:06:00,140  -->  00:06:00,150

256

00:06:00,150  -->  00:06:00,920
of this.

257

00:06:00,920  -->  00:06:00,930

258

00:06:00,930  -->  00:06:05,210
Alright as you can see it's pretty quite

259

00:06:05,210  -->  00:06:05,220

260

00:06:05,220  -->  00:06:06,830
a quick process once you have a plan.

261

00:06:06,830  -->  00:06:06,840

262

00:06:06,840  -->  00:06:08,420
What you want to do?

263

00:06:08,420  -->  00:06:08,430

264

00:06:08,430  -->  00:06:10,189
it's pretty straightforward how to get

265

00:06:10,189  -->  00:06:10,199

266

00:06:10,199  -->  00:06:11,990
there and that's what I really

267

00:06:11,990  -->  00:06:12,000

268

00:06:12,000  -->  00:06:14,120
like about storylines in Tableau,

269

00:06:14,120  -->  00:06:14,130

270

00:06:14,130  -->  00:06:17,779
doesn't take long to put it together and

271

00:06:17,779  -->  00:06:17,789

272

00:06:17,789  -->  00:06:19,310
especially the ones we don't have to

273

00:06:19,310  -->  00:06:19,320

274

00:06:19,320  -->  00:06:21,800
write the text and then sales with forecast

275

00:06:21,800  -->  00:06:21,810

276

00:06:21,810  -->  00:06:26,810
same thing drag it into here, get rid of that.

277

00:06:26,810  -->  00:06:26,820

278

00:06:26,820  -->  00:06:34,660
You can even change the

279

00:06:34,660  -->  00:06:34,670

280

00:06:34,670  -->  00:06:40,450
label here. So well let's make it

281

00:06:40,450  -->  00:06:40,460

282

00:06:40,460  -->  00:06:45,430
nice and neat so maybe actually type it up

283

00:06:45,430  -->  00:06:45,440

284

00:06:45,440  -->  00:06:53,140
sales for capita and then with forecast.

285

00:06:53,140  -->  00:06:53,150

286

00:06:53,150  -->  00:06:59,470
Alright, okay a new blank points. That

287

00:06:59,470  -->  00:06:59,480

288

00:06:59,480  -->  00:07:06,250
alright so I think that looks ok, so if

289

00:07:06,250  -->  00:07:06,260

290

00:07:06,260  -->  00:07:07,720
we go through them,

291

00:07:07,720  -->  00:07:07,730

292

00:07:07,730  -->  00:07:09,670
the only thing we might want to do is

293

00:07:09,670  -->  00:07:09,680

294

00:07:09,680  -->  00:07:17,020
just change the captions here so this

295

00:07:17,020  -->  00:07:17,030

296

00:07:17,030  -->  00:07:23,230
one we're just going to copy it. A

297

00:07:23,230  -->  00:07:23,240

298

00:07:23,240  -->  00:07:25,420
competitor analysis, this is going to be

299

00:07:25,420  -->  00:07:25,430

300

00:07:25,430  -->  00:07:33,250
industry analysis and then if we go here

301

00:07:33,250  -->  00:07:33,260

302

00:07:33,260  -->  00:07:38,800
and steal it from here and then just copy

303

00:07:38,800  -->  00:07:38,810

304

00:07:38,810  -->  00:07:39,730
it here.

305

00:07:39,730  -->  00:07:39,740

306

00:07:39,740  -->  00:07:42,340
Alright, so there we go that's our

307

00:07:42,340  -->  00:07:42,350

308

00:07:42,350  -->  00:07:44,860
presentation. So let's go ahead and save

309

00:07:44,860  -->  00:07:44,870

310

00:07:44,870  -->  00:07:48,490
that and let's have a look through it. So

311

00:07:48,490  -->  00:07:48,500

312

00:07:48,500  -->  00:07:50,830
our story title, forgot the story title,

313

00:07:50,830  -->  00:07:50,840

314

00:07:50,840  -->  00:07:53,110
how could we forget the story title?

315

00:07:53,110  -->  00:07:53,120

316

00:07:53,120  -->  00:08:01,570
Expansion analysis insights and

317

00:08:01,570  -->  00:08:01,580

318

00:08:01,580  -->  00:08:05,350
maybe make it a 22 and center that as

319

00:08:05,350  -->  00:08:05,360

320

00:08:05,360  -->  00:08:12,220
well, maybe make it actually 24. Let's see

321

00:08:12,220  -->  00:08:12,230

322

00:08:12,230  -->  00:08:13,450
how that looks.

323

00:08:13,450  -->  00:08:13,460

324

00:08:13,460  -->  00:08:16,660
So there we go, that is our final

325

00:08:16,660  -->  00:08:16,670

326

00:08:16,670  -->  00:08:18,940
presentation and when we are presenting

327

00:08:18,940  -->  00:08:18,950

328

00:08:18,950  -->  00:08:21,610
it to the executives or the stakeholders

329

00:08:21,610  -->  00:08:21,620

330

00:08:21,620  -->  00:08:23,440
we would just walk through our

331

00:08:23,440  -->  00:08:23,450

332

00:08:23,450  -->  00:08:25,960
investigation and explain what we saw.

333

00:08:25,960  -->  00:08:25,970

334

00:08:25,970  -->  00:08:28,510
So let's have a quick rehearsal at that, in

335

00:08:28,510  -->  00:08:28,520

336

00:08:28,520  -->  00:08:31,930
the first part of our analysis we looked

337

00:08:31,930  -->  00:08:31,940

338

00:08:31,940  -->  00:08:35,320
at the competitors and we saw that out

339

00:08:35,320  -->  00:08:35,330

340

00:08:35,330  -->  00:08:38,680
of all the states, the best business

341

00:08:38,680  -->  00:08:38,690

342

00:08:38,690  -->  00:08:41,350
environment is actually in Victoria and

343

00:08:41,350  -->  00:08:41,360

344

00:08:41,360  -->  00:08:42,730
that is because as you can see the box

345

00:08:42,730  -->  00:08:42,740

346

00:08:42,740  -->  00:08:44,680
plot is quite compact here and the box

347

00:08:44,680  -->  00:08:44,690

348

00:08:44,690  -->  00:08:46,810
part of the box plot is close to the top

349

00:08:46,810  -->  00:08:46,820

350

00:08:46,820  -->  00:08:48,570
meaning that in overall

351

00:08:48,570  -->  00:08:48,580

352

00:08:48,580  -->  00:08:52,770
there's more certainty that how much net

353

00:08:52,770  -->  00:08:52,780

354

00:08:52,780  -->  00:08:56,070
profit margin we can expect to earn in

355

00:08:56,070  -->  00:08:56,080

356

00:08:56,080  -->  00:08:59,430
this state and plus most of the

357

00:08:59,430  -->  00:08:59,440

358

00:08:59,440  -->  00:09:01,290
companies are earning towards the top of

359

00:09:01,290  -->  00:09:01,300

360

00:09:01,300  -->  00:09:02,880
this box plot so means that

361

00:09:02,880  -->  00:09:02,890

362

00:09:02,890  -->  00:09:05,010
even a random company thrown into this

363

00:09:05,010  -->  00:09:05,020

364

00:09:05,020  -->  00:09:06,750
state will have a higher chance of

365

00:09:06,750  -->  00:09:06,760

366

00:09:06,760  -->  00:09:09,960
success and then in the other states.

367

00:09:09,960  -->  00:09:09,970

368

00:09:09,970  -->  00:09:12,120
Then we moved on to industry analysis

369

00:09:12,120  -->  00:09:12,130

370

00:09:12,130  -->  00:09:14,100
and here we can say that all the states

371

00:09:14,100  -->  00:09:14,110

372

00:09:14,110  -->  00:09:16,620
have upward trends for this industry

373

00:09:16,620  -->  00:09:16,630

374

00:09:16,630  -->  00:09:20,490
which is clothing retailing however, if

375

00:09:20,490  -->  00:09:20,500

376

00:09:20,500  -->  00:09:23,400
we take into account population because

377

00:09:23,400  -->  00:09:23,410

378

00:09:23,410  -->  00:09:25,950
as you can see here the turnovers are in

379

00:09:25,950  -->  00:09:25,960

380

00:09:25,960  -->  00:09:27,390
millions of dollars and they are

381

00:09:27,390  -->  00:09:27,400

382

00:09:27,400  -->  00:09:29,100
completely different for all the states

383

00:09:29,100  -->  00:09:29,110

384

00:09:29,110  -->  00:09:32,580
just simply because all of these states

385

00:09:32,580  -->  00:09:32,590

386

00:09:32,590  -->  00:09:34,050
have different populations so if we take

387

00:09:34,050  -->  00:09:34,060

388

00:09:34,060  -->  00:09:36,180
population into account and calculate

389

00:09:36,180  -->  00:09:36,190

390

00:09:36,190  -->  00:09:39,900
the per capita sales then we will see

391

00:09:39,900  -->  00:09:39,910

392

00:09:39,910  -->  00:09:43,080
that the per capita sales are actually

393

00:09:43,080  -->  00:09:43,090

394

00:09:43,090  -->  00:09:46,170
growing only in New South Wales and

395

00:09:46,170  -->  00:09:46,180

396

00:09:46,180  -->  00:09:48,600
Victoria. In Queensland and Western Australia,

397

00:09:48,600  -->  00:09:48,610

398

00:09:48,610  -->  00:09:50,340
the upward trend that we saw previously

399

00:09:50,340  -->  00:09:50,350

400

00:09:50,350  -->  00:09:53,550
are no longer visible meaning that they

401

00:09:53,550  -->  00:09:53,560

402

00:09:53,560  -->  00:09:55,710
were partially attributable to the

403

00:09:55,710  -->  00:09:55,720

404

00:09:55,720  -->  00:09:58,920
growth in population in those states. So

405

00:09:58,920  -->  00:09:58,930

406

00:09:58,930  -->  00:10:01,680
therefore we can make a conclusion that

407

00:10:01,680  -->  00:10:01,690

408

00:10:01,690  -->  00:10:04,500
the actually two conclusions from this

409

00:10:04,500  -->  00:10:04,510

410

00:10:04,510  -->  00:10:06,930
chart, first of all the business

411

00:10:06,930  -->  00:10:06,940

412

00:10:06,940  -->  00:10:09,180
environment in Victoria is a similar to

413

00:10:09,180  -->  00:10:09,190

414

00:10:09,190  -->  00:10:10,500
the one in New South Wales, which we

415

00:10:10,500  -->  00:10:10,510

416

00:10:10,510  -->  00:10:12,270
already have experience with in this

417

00:10:12,270  -->  00:10:12,280

418

00:10:12,280  -->  00:10:14,940
company and second of all we can also

419

00:10:14,940  -->  00:10:14,950

420

00:10:14,950  -->  00:10:17,670
see that the industry itself clothing

421

00:10:17,670  -->  00:10:17,680

422

00:10:17,680  -->  00:10:20,190
and re.. clothing retailing is actually

423

00:10:20,190  -->  00:10:20,200

424

00:10:20,200  -->  00:10:23,520
growing in Victoria just as it is in New

425

00:10:23,520  -->  00:10:23,530

426

00:10:23,530  -->  00:10:26,190
South Wales so the growth that we're

427

00:10:26,190  -->  00:10:26,200

428

00:10:26,200  -->  00:10:27,930
seeing here is not attributable to

429

00:10:27,930  -->  00:10:27,940

430

00:10:27,940  -->  00:10:30,030
simply a growth in population,

431

00:10:30,030  -->  00:10:30,040

432

00:10:30,040  -->  00:10:32,880
actually a growth in people's demands

433

00:10:32,880  -->  00:10:32,890

434

00:10:32,890  -->  00:10:35,340
and their expenditure within this

435

00:10:35,340  -->  00:10:35,350

436

00:10:35,350  -->  00:10:36,930
industry which is exactly what we're

437

00:10:36,930  -->  00:10:36,940

438

00:10:36,940  -->  00:10:40,770
after. So we want to create a expansion

439

00:10:40,770  -->  00:10:40,780

440

00:10:40,780  -->  00:10:43,680
in a business environment which has high

441

00:10:43,680  -->  00:10:43,690

442

00:10:43,690  -->  00:10:46,200
potential for future growth and that in

443

00:10:46,200  -->  00:10:46,210

444

00:10:46,210  -->  00:10:48,150
this case is Victoria, so from those two

445

00:10:48,150  -->  00:10:48,160

446

00:10:48,160  -->  00:10:50,610
stand points Victoria is the place to go

447

00:10:50,610  -->  00:10:50,620

448

00:10:50,620  -->  00:10:52,410
if you add in the competitor analysis

449

00:10:52,410  -->  00:10:52,420

450

00:10:52,420  -->  00:10:54,660
that is a three reasons why Victoria is

451

00:10:54,660  -->  00:10:54,670

452

00:10:54,670  -->  00:10:56,880
the place to be and to finish off we

453

00:10:56,880  -->  00:10:56,890

454

00:10:56,890  -->  00:10:58,530
went above and beyond and we actually

455

00:10:58,530  -->  00:10:58,540

456

00:10:58,540  -->  00:11:01,630
derive some forecasts for

457

00:11:01,630  -->  00:11:01,640

458

00:11:01,640  -->  00:11:05,230
different States and we can if required,

459

00:11:05,230  -->  00:11:05,240

460

00:11:05,240  -->  00:11:07,840
we can supply some information on what

461

00:11:07,840  -->  00:11:07,850

462

00:11:07,850  -->  00:11:11,020
we think is going to be the future of

463

00:11:11,020  -->  00:11:11,030

464

00:11:11,030  -->  00:11:12,880
three years on how the future

465

00:11:12,880  -->  00:11:12,890

466

00:11:12,890  -->  00:11:15,310
two-and-a-half years are going to look

467

00:11:15,310  -->  00:11:15,320

468

00:11:15,320  -->  00:11:17,530
like for Victoria so that when the

469

00:11:17,530  -->  00:11:17,540

470

00:11:17,540  -->  00:11:19,120
expansion is being set up,

471

00:11:19,120  -->  00:11:19,130

472

00:11:19,130  -->  00:11:21,130
we are already prepared and we can already

473

00:11:21,130  -->  00:11:21,140

474

00:11:21,140  -->  00:11:24,370
estimate the revenue for this expansion.

475

00:11:24,370  -->  00:11:24,380

476

00:11:24,380  -->  00:11:27,370
So there we go that is how we put

477

00:11:27,370  -->  00:11:27,380

478

00:11:27,380  -->  00:11:29,440
everything into a storyline and that is

479

00:11:29,440  -->  00:11:29,450

480

00:11:29,450  -->  00:11:31,600
how we present it. I think we've got a

481

00:11:31,600  -->  00:11:31,610

482

00:11:31,610  -->  00:11:34,000
solid case here for the stakeholders

483

00:11:34,000  -->  00:11:34,010

484

00:11:34,010  -->  00:11:35,920
which state to go and that state is

485

00:11:35,920  -->  00:11:35,930

486

00:11:35,930  -->  00:11:37,690
Victoria. Thank you very much for your

487

00:11:37,690  -->  00:11:37,700

488

00:11:37,700  -->  00:11:39,850
attention throughout this section and I

489

00:11:39,850  -->  00:11:39,860

490

00:11:39,860  -->  00:11:41,440
look forward to seeing you next time.

491

00:11:41,440  -->  00:11:41,450

492

00:11:41,450  -->  00:11:48,040
Until then, happy analyzing!
