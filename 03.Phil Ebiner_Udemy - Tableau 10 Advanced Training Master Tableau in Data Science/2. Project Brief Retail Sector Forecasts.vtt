00:00:03.180  -->  00:00:07.099
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:07.099  -->  00:00:07.109

3

00:00:07.109  -->  00:00:10.009
course on Tableau. We're starting off the

4

00:00:10.009  -->  00:00:10.019

5

00:00:10.019  -->  00:00:12.740
section on advanced data preparation and

6

00:00:12.740  -->  00:00:12.750

7

00:00:12.750  -->  00:00:15.050
analytics in Tableau. In order to get the

8

00:00:15.050  -->  00:00:15.060

9

00:00:15.060  -->  00:00:16.519
data set for the section, you need to go

10

00:00:16.519  -->  00:00:16.529

11

00:00:16.529  -->  00:00:19.790
to superdatascience.com/tableau-

12

00:00:19.790  -->  00:00:19.800

13

00:00:19.800  -->  00:00:22.340
advanced and now here if you

14

00:00:22.340  -->  00:00:22.350

15

00:00:22.350  -->  00:00:25.100
scroll down to section 4 advance data of prep

16

00:00:25.100  -->  00:00:25.110

17

00:00:25.110  -->  00:00:27.410
plus analytics in Tableau, you will see that

18

00:00:27.410  -->  00:00:27.420

19

00:00:27.420  -->  00:00:29.510
there are four files, there's a section

20

00:00:29.510  -->  00:00:29.520

21

00:00:29.520  -->  00:00:32.299
for the challenge, there's video file then we've

22

00:00:32.299  -->  00:00:32.309

23

00:00:32.309  -->  00:00:34.849
got the computer research CSV file and

24

00:00:34.849  -->  00:00:34.859

25

00:00:34.859  -->  00:00:37.880
two excel files which have been taken

26

00:00:37.880  -->  00:00:37.890

27

00:00:37.890  -->  00:00:41.090
from the Australian Bureau of

28

00:00:41.090  -->  00:00:41.100

29

00:00:41.100  -->  00:00:43.069
Statistics, so the website is abs.gov.au

30

00:00:43.069  -->  00:00:43.079

31

00:00:43.079  -->  00:00:46.549
and these files are one

32

00:00:46.549  -->  00:00:46.559

33

00:00:46.559  -->  00:00:48.799
is on retail turnover for industries and

34

00:00:48.799  -->  00:00:48.809

35

00:00:48.809  -->  00:00:50.479
other one is on demographic statistics.

36

00:00:50.479  -->  00:00:50.489

37

00:00:50.489  -->  00:00:53.930
So quite an interesting combination

38

00:00:53.930  -->  00:00:53.940

39

00:00:53.940  -->  00:00:57.440
let's have a quick look at the challenge

40

00:00:57.440  -->  00:00:57.450

41

00:00:57.450  -->  00:01:00.110
for this section.

42

00:01:00.110  -->  00:01:00.120

43

00:01:00.120  -->  00:01:02.990
Ok section 4 - the challenge, you are a

44

00:01:02.990  -->  00:01:03.000

45

00:01:03.000  -->  00:01:05.209
data scientist working for an Australian

46

00:01:05.209  -->  00:01:05.219

47

00:01:05.219  -->  00:01:08.000
retail chain operating in the clothing

48

00:01:08.000  -->  00:01:08.010

49

00:01:08.010  -->  00:01:10.850
retailing industry. To date the company

50

00:01:10.850  -->  00:01:10.860

51

00:01:10.860  -->  00:01:13.039
has only been running operations in New

52

00:01:13.039  -->  00:01:13.049

53

00:01:13.049  -->  00:01:14.690
South Wales which is a state in

54

00:01:14.690  -->  00:01:14.700

55

00:01:14.700  -->  00:01:15.500
Australia.

56

00:01:15.500  -->  00:01:15.510

57

00:01:15.510  -->  00:01:16.910
However, the board of directors is

58

00:01:16.910  -->  00:01:16.920

59

00:01:16.920  -->  00:01:19.130
considering an expansion into one of the

60

00:01:19.130  -->  00:01:19.140

61

00:01:19.140  -->  00:01:21.230
following three states: Queensland,

62

00:01:21.230  -->  00:01:21.240

63

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:24.170
Victoria and Western Australia. You have been

64

00:01:24.170  -->  00:01:24.180

65

00:01:24.180  -->  00:01:25.490
asked to assess the business

66

00:01:25.490  -->  00:01:25.500

67

00:01:25.500  -->  00:01:27.109
environments for the industry in

68

00:01:27.109  -->  00:01:27.119

69

00:01:27.119  -->  00:01:29.120
question in each of these three states

70

00:01:29.120  -->  00:01:29.130

71

00:01:29.130  -->  00:01:31.340
and present your findings to the Board

72

00:01:31.340  -->  00:01:31.350

73

00:01:31.350  -->  00:01:33.230
of Directors in person.

74

00:01:33.230  -->  00:01:33.240

75

00:01:33.240  -->  00:01:34.640
Now of course to understand this

76

00:01:34.640  -->  00:01:34.650

77

00:01:34.650  -->  00:01:36.140
challenge a little bit better we need a

78

00:01:36.140  -->  00:01:36.150

79

00:01:36.150  -->  00:01:38.149
brief introduction to Australian

80

00:01:38.149  -->  00:01:38.159

81

00:01:38.159  -->  00:01:40.670
geography so let's have a quick look at

82

00:01:40.670  -->  00:01:40.680

83

00:01:40.680  -->  00:01:43.100
the second page of the challenge. Here

84

00:01:43.100  -->  00:01:43.110

85

00:01:43.110  -->  00:01:46.190
we've got a map of Australia and what

86

00:01:46.190  -->  00:01:46.200

87

00:01:46.200  -->  00:01:48.950
you can see here are the states and

88

00:01:48.950  -->  00:01:48.960

89

00:01:48.960  -->  00:01:50.630
territories that are highlighted, Australia

90

00:01:50.630  -->  00:01:50.640

91

00:01:50.640  -->  00:01:53.780
has a total of six states and two

92

00:01:53.780  -->  00:01:53.790

93

00:01:53.790  -->  00:01:57.080
territories so let's go through them one

94

00:01:57.080  -->  00:01:57.090

95

00:01:57.090  -->  00:02:00.050
by one. The largest one is a New South

96

00:02:00.050  -->  00:02:00.060

97

00:02:00.060  -->  00:02:02.300
Wales and that is a state and that is

98

00:02:02.300  -->  00:02:02.310

99

00:02:02.310  -->  00:02:05.630
also where Sydney is located. Next in

100

00:02:05.630  -->  00:02:05.640

101

00:02:05.640  -->  00:02:07.789
size is Victoria so these are the

102

00:02:07.789  -->  00:02:07.799

103

00:02:07.799  -->  00:02:09.199
numbers of the most recent population

104

00:02:09.199  -->  00:02:09.209

105

00:02:09.209  -->  00:02:11.420
numbers and next size is Victoria that is

106

00:02:11.420  -->  00:02:11.430

107

00:02:11.430  -->  00:02:14.449
where Melbourne is located, the next comes

108

00:02:14.449  -->  00:02:14.459

109

00:02:14.459  -->  00:02:15.570
Queensland with

110

00:02:15.570  -->  00:02:15.580

111

00:02:15.580  -->  00:02:17.610
4.8 million people that is where

112

00:02:17.610  -->  00:02:17.620

113

00:02:17.620  -->  00:02:19.500
Brisbane is located and that's that

114

00:02:19.500  -->  00:02:19.510

115

00:02:19.510  -->  00:02:20.790
somewhere there that's where I'm sitting

116

00:02:20.790  -->  00:02:20.800

117

00:02:20.800  -->  00:02:23.040
right now as I'm recording this video.

118

00:02:23.040  -->  00:02:23.050

119

00:02:23.050  -->  00:02:25.800
Next is Western Australia, that's where

120

00:02:25.800  -->  00:02:25.810

121

00:02:25.810  -->  00:02:27.510
Perth is somewhere here at the bottom

122

00:02:27.510  -->  00:02:27.520

123

00:02:27.520  -->  00:02:32.880
and then we've got South Australia and

124

00:02:32.880  -->  00:02:32.890

125

00:02:32.890  -->  00:02:36.240
that's where Alice Springs is and then

126

00:02:36.240  -->  00:02:36.250

127

00:02:36.250  -->  00:02:39.300
we've got the other smaller states such

128

00:02:39.300  -->  00:02:39.310

129

00:02:39.310  -->  00:02:42.810
Tasmania are also a state and then

130

00:02:42.810  -->  00:02:42.820

131

00:02:42.820  -->  00:02:44.880
we've got two territories. So Northern

132

00:02:44.880  -->  00:02:44.890

133

00:02:44.890  -->  00:02:46.740
Territory and we've got Australian

134

00:02:46.740  -->  00:02:46.750

135

00:02:46.750  -->  00:02:49.170
Capital Territory over there so Darwin

136

00:02:49.170  -->  00:02:49.180

137

00:02:49.180  -->  00:02:50.340
is somewhere up there in Northern

138

00:02:50.340  -->  00:02:50.350

139

00:02:50.350  -->  00:02:52.080
Territory and Australian capital

140

00:02:52.080  -->  00:02:52.090

141

00:02:52.090  -->  00:02:54.630
territory has Canberra which is the

142

00:02:54.630  -->  00:02:54.640

143

00:02:54.640  -->  00:02:56.910
capital of Australia. So from our

144

00:02:56.910  -->  00:02:56.920

145

00:02:56.920  -->  00:02:58.830
challenge we know that the company that

146

00:02:58.830  -->  00:02:58.840

147

00:02:58.840  -->  00:03:00.990
we're working for is currently operating

148

00:03:00.990  -->  00:03:01.000

149

00:03:01.000  -->  00:03:03.810
in a New South Wales already and they're

150

00:03:03.810  -->  00:03:03.820

151

00:03:03.820  -->  00:03:06.090
considering an expansion into one of the

152

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:06.100

153

00:03:06.100  -->  00:03:08.190
following three states Queensland,

154

00:03:08.190  -->  00:03:08.200

155

00:03:08.200  -->  00:03:10.110
Victoria and Western Australia and

156

00:03:10.110  -->  00:03:10.120

157

00:03:10.120  -->  00:03:12.000
which is fair enough because these are

158

00:03:12.000  -->  00:03:12.010

159

00:03:12.010  -->  00:03:14.970
the next three largest state so you can

160

00:03:14.970  -->  00:03:14.980

161

00:03:14.980  -->  00:03:17.850
kind of see what logic the executives

162

00:03:17.850  -->  00:03:17.860

163

00:03:17.860  -->  00:03:19.740
are following their looking at the top

164

00:03:19.740  -->  00:03:19.750

165

00:03:19.750  -->  00:03:21.840
three states in terms of population and

166

00:03:21.840  -->  00:03:21.850

167

00:03:21.850  -->  00:03:24.390
they want to expand their chain there

168

00:03:24.390  -->  00:03:24.400

169

00:03:24.400  -->  00:03:27.870
and so our task is to understand in

170

00:03:27.870  -->  00:03:27.880

171

00:03:27.880  -->  00:03:29.520
which of these three states Queensland,

172

00:03:29.520  -->  00:03:29.530

173

00:03:29.530  -->  00:03:31.350
Victoria or Western Australia is the

174

00:03:31.350  -->  00:03:31.360

175

00:03:31.360  -->  00:03:33.449
business environment the best, the most

176

00:03:33.449  -->  00:03:33.459

177

00:03:33.459  -->  00:03:37.290
hospitable for a company like ours to

178

00:03:37.290  -->  00:03:37.300

179

00:03:37.300  -->  00:03:41.759
come and create another retail chain

180

00:03:41.759  -->  00:03:41.769

181

00:03:41.769  -->  00:03:43.290
and prosper,

182

00:03:43.290  -->  00:03:43.300

183

00:03:43.300  -->  00:03:45.900
so how we going to do that? Let's go and

184

00:03:45.900  -->  00:03:45.910

185

00:03:45.910  -->  00:03:48.509
have a look at the data set. In this

186

00:03:48.509  -->  00:03:48.519

187

00:03:48.519  -->  00:03:50.610
challenge we have three data sets, we've

188

00:03:50.610  -->  00:03:50.620

189

00:03:50.620  -->  00:03:53.729
got one which will start off first in

190

00:03:53.729  -->  00:03:53.739

191

00:03:53.739  -->  00:03:56.520
this section is a computer research so

192

00:03:56.520  -->  00:03:56.530

193

00:03:56.530  -->  00:03:59.610
if I open that up, even if I open up in a

194

00:03:59.610  -->  00:03:59.620

195

00:03:59.620  -->  00:04:02.759
notepad or text editor you can really

196

00:04:02.759  -->  00:04:02.769

197

00:04:02.769  -->  00:04:06.000
see so it's got four states is going to

198

00:04:06.000  -->  00:04:06.010

199

00:04:06.010  -->  00:04:07.290
companies so these are the competitors

200

00:04:07.290  -->  00:04:07.300

201

00:04:07.300  -->  00:04:09.060
with there was some competitive research

202

00:04:09.060  -->  00:04:09.070

203

00:04:09.070  -->  00:04:12.509
conducted and this is the net profit

204

00:04:12.509  -->  00:04:12.519

205

00:04:12.519  -->  00:04:14.729
margin of their of each of these

206

00:04:14.729  -->  00:04:14.739

207

00:04:14.739  -->  00:04:16.830
companies within each of those states. So

208

00:04:16.830  -->  00:04:16.840

209

00:04:16.840  -->  00:04:19.440
we can use this information to gather

210

00:04:19.440  -->  00:04:19.450

211

00:04:19.450  -->  00:04:22.080
and assess some statistics on how the

212

00:04:22.080  -->  00:04:22.090

213

00:04:22.090  -->  00:04:23.760
existing companies already operating in

214

00:04:23.760  -->  00:04:23.770

215

00:04:23.770  -->  00:04:25.650
the states and that will give us an

216

00:04:25.650  -->  00:04:25.660

217

00:04:25.660  -->  00:04:28.110
overview a general overview of

218

00:04:28.110  -->  00:04:28.120

219

00:04:28.120  -->  00:04:30.000
the business environment and how

220

00:04:30.000  -->  00:04:30.010

221

00:04:30.010  -->  00:04:32.280
favorable business environments are in

222

00:04:32.280  -->  00:04:32.290

223

00:04:32.290  -->  00:04:34.500
the four different states and then we've

224

00:04:34.500  -->  00:04:34.510

225

00:04:34.510  -->  00:04:36.689
got some information on the statistics

226

00:04:36.689  -->  00:04:36.699

227

00:04:36.699  -->  00:04:40.560
of how the industries are performing in

228

00:04:40.560  -->  00:04:40.570

229

00:04:40.570  -->  00:04:42.719
all different states so I won't open

230

00:04:42.719  -->  00:04:42.729

231

00:04:42.729  -->  00:04:44.280
these up now because it's a bit early

232

00:04:44.280  -->  00:04:44.290

233

00:04:44.290  -->  00:04:47.159
for us we will open them and investigate

234

00:04:47.159  -->  00:04:47.169

235

00:04:47.169  -->  00:04:50.010
them when we get to them in this section.

236

00:04:50.010  -->  00:04:50.020

237

00:04:50.020  -->  00:04:51.420
Overall, it's going to be fun and exciting

238

00:04:51.420  -->  00:04:51.430

239

00:04:51.430  -->  00:04:53.460
section and I look forward to seeing in

240

00:04:53.460  -->  00:04:53.470

241

00:04:53.470  -->  00:04:55.290
the first tutorial until then,

242

00:04:55.290  -->  00:04:55.300

243

00:04:55.300  -->  00:05:00.840
happy analyzing.
