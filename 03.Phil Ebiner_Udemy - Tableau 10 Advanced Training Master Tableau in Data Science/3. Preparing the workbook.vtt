00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.530
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06.530  -->  00:00:06.540

3

00:00:06.540  -->  00:00:07.909
course in Tableau. In today's tutorial

4

00:00:07.909  -->  00:00:07.919

5

00:00:07.919  -->  00:00:11.150
we're going to prepare all workbook so

6

00:00:11.150  -->  00:00:11.160

7

00:00:11.160  -->  00:00:12.379
that when we actually start talking

8

00:00:12.379  -->  00:00:12.389

9

00:00:12.389  -->  00:00:14.419
about level of detail calculations we're

10

00:00:14.419  -->  00:00:14.429

11

00:00:14.429  -->  00:00:16.519
not going to waste time on importing

12

00:00:16.519  -->  00:00:16.529

13

00:00:16.529  -->  00:00:18.980
data set and doing all of the groundwork.

14

00:00:18.980  -->  00:00:18.990

15

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:21.019
So let's get straight into it. I'm going

16

00:00:21.019  -->  00:00:21.029

17

00:00:21.029  -->  00:00:23.450
to open up Tableau and here we're going

18

00:00:23.450  -->  00:00:23.460

19

00:00:23.460  -->  00:00:25.640
to connect an excel file which is going

20

00:00:25.640  -->  00:00:25.650

21

00:00:25.650  -->  00:00:29.269
to be on Megamerchandise.xlsx and

22

00:00:29.269  -->  00:00:29.279

23

00:00:29.279  -->  00:00:30.500
here we already know a little bit about

24

00:00:30.500  -->  00:00:30.510

25

00:00:30.510  -->  00:00:33.380
data, we know that it contains two tabs,

26

00:00:33.380  -->  00:00:33.390

27

00:00:33.390  -->  00:00:35.090
its got a list of orders and order breakdown.

28

00:00:35.090  -->  00:00:35.100

29

00:00:35.100  -->  00:00:37.040
So if you look at list of orders, you'll

30

00:00:37.040  -->  00:00:37.050

31

00:00:37.050  -->  00:00:39.979
see that here we've got a unique order

32

00:00:39.979  -->  00:00:39.989

33

00:00:39.989  -->  00:00:42.080
IDs in this column and then for every

34

00:00:42.080  -->  00:00:42.090

35

00:00:42.090  -->  00:00:43.880
order ID we've got some information. So

36

00:00:43.880  -->  00:00:43.890

37

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:45.560
who is the person that ordered it? When

38

00:00:45.560  -->  00:00:45.570

39

00:00:45.570  -->  00:00:47.900
was it ordered? Where it was ordered from,

40

00:00:47.900  -->  00:00:47.910

41

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:51.500
including possible code and so on and

42

00:00:51.500  -->  00:00:51.510

43

00:00:51.510  -->  00:00:54.139
then if we close this and we look at the

44

00:00:54.139  -->  00:00:54.149

45

00:00:54.149  -->  00:00:55.729
order break down you'll see that

46

00:00:55.729  -->  00:00:55.739

47

00:00:55.739  -->  00:00:58.760
actually order IDs can consist of

48

00:00:58.760  -->  00:00:58.770

49

00:00:58.770  -->  00:01:01.490
multiple items. So order ID might be

50

00:01:01.490  -->  00:01:01.500

51

00:01:01.500  -->  00:01:04.460
single but then it might contain several

52

00:01:04.460  -->  00:01:04.470

53

00:01:04.470  -->  00:01:06.500
items within it, so for instance here

54

00:01:06.500  -->  00:01:06.510

55

00:01:06.510  -->  00:01:08.929
we've got an order ID that contains two

56

00:01:08.929  -->  00:01:08.939

57

00:01:08.939  -->  00:01:11.899
rows here, meaning that it has two items

58

00:01:11.899  -->  00:01:11.909

59

00:01:11.909  -->  00:01:14.060
within that order ID. Then here's another

60

00:01:14.060  -->  00:01:14.070

61

00:01:14.070  -->  00:01:16.429
good example, this order ID has three

62

00:01:16.429  -->  00:01:16.439

63

00:01:16.439  -->  00:01:20.060
items within and that is what this tab

64

00:01:20.060  -->  00:01:20.070

65

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:21.770
shows us it shows us the breakdown

66

00:01:21.770  -->  00:01:21.780

67

00:01:21.780  -->  00:01:23.570
actually shows us also the sales, the

68

00:01:23.570  -->  00:01:23.580

69

00:01:23.580  -->  00:01:26.600
profit for each particular item so that

70

00:01:26.600  -->  00:01:26.610

71

00:01:26.610  -->  00:01:29.390
is a very handy tab as well and in order

72

00:01:29.390  -->  00:01:29.400

73

00:01:29.400  -->  00:01:30.649
to get the full view of the data

74

00:01:30.649  -->  00:01:30.659

75

00:01:30.659  -->  00:01:31.910
that we're going to have to combine them.

76

00:01:31.910  -->  00:01:31.920

77

00:01:31.920  -->  00:01:32.899
So that's what we're going to do now,

78

00:01:32.899  -->  00:01:32.909

79

00:01:32.909  -->  00:01:35.030
we're going to take list of orders, take

80

00:01:35.030  -->  00:01:35.040

81

00:01:35.040  -->  00:01:37.520
order breakdown, connect them and make

82

00:01:37.520  -->  00:01:37.530

83

00:01:37.530  -->  00:01:38.929
sure that we're using an inner join

84

00:01:38.929  -->  00:01:38.939

85

00:01:38.939  -->  00:01:42.020
here and that order ID is the field that

86

00:01:42.020  -->  00:01:42.030

87

00:01:42.030  -->  00:01:44.870
we're joining on and that is correct and

88

00:01:44.870  -->  00:01:44.880

89

00:01:44.880  -->  00:01:46.969
here we're going to just change this to

90

00:01:46.969  -->  00:01:46.979

91

00:01:46.979  -->  00:01:48.950
a large number for instance a hundred

92

00:01:48.950  -->  00:01:48.960

93

00:01:48.960  -->  00:01:51.289
thousand and that will show us the total number of

94

00:01:51.289  -->  00:01:51.299

95

00:01:51.299  -->  00:01:55.490
rows 8,028 and now if we just sort this

96

00:01:55.490  -->  00:01:55.500

97

00:01:55.500  -->  00:01:58.459
by order ID you'll see that here for

98

00:01:58.459  -->  00:01:58.469

99

00:01:58.469  -->  00:02:01.520
example we've got the first order which

100

00:02:01.520  -->  00:02:01.530

101

00:02:01.530  -->  00:02:04.249
we saw was unique in list of orders but

102

00:02:04.249  -->  00:02:04.259

103

00:02:04.259  -->  00:02:06.800
in order to break down it had two items

104

00:02:06.800  -->  00:02:06.810

105

00:02:06.810  -->  00:02:09.229
within, so what happened here so I

106

00:02:09.229  -->  00:02:09.239

107

00:02:09.239  -->  00:02:11.240
highlighted here you can see that on the

108

00:02:11.240  -->  00:02:11.250

109

00:02:11.250  -->  00:02:12.180
right here,

110

00:02:12.180  -->  00:02:12.190

111

00:02:12.190  -->  00:02:14.370
this is the order breakdown part of

112

00:02:14.370  -->  00:02:14.380

113

00:02:14.380  -->  00:02:17.310
things. Here you've got the two separate

114

00:02:17.310  -->  00:02:17.320

115

00:02:17.320  -->  00:02:19.860
items from that order and what happened

116

00:02:19.860  -->  00:02:19.870

117

00:02:19.870  -->  00:02:22.140
in the inner join is that the rows from

118

00:02:22.140  -->  00:02:22.150

119

00:02:22.150  -->  00:02:24.030
the left data set from list of orders

120

00:02:24.030  -->  00:02:24.040

121

00:02:24.040  -->  00:02:26.400
were duplicated so this row was

122

00:02:26.400  -->  00:02:26.410

123

00:02:26.410  -->  00:02:28.800
duplicated identical as you can see

124

00:02:28.800  -->  00:02:28.810

125

00:02:28.810  -->  00:02:31.890
these two identical in order to match

126

00:02:31.890  -->  00:02:31.900

127

00:02:31.900  -->  00:02:34.650
the number of items and same thing

128

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:34.660

129

00:02:34.660  -->  00:02:36.600
happened for this order over here which

130

00:02:36.600  -->  00:02:36.610

131

00:02:36.610  -->  00:02:39.420
had three items you can see that on the

132

00:02:39.420  -->  00:02:39.430

133

00:02:39.430  -->  00:02:41.130
right you've got the three different

134

00:02:41.130  -->  00:02:41.140

135

00:02:41.140  -->  00:02:43.560
items three different rows here, but

136

00:02:43.560  -->  00:02:43.570

137

00:02:43.570  -->  00:02:45.810
this row which was unique in the list of

138

00:02:45.810  -->  00:02:45.820

139

00:02:45.820  -->  00:02:48.930
orders data set here it's actually been

140

00:02:48.930  -->  00:02:48.940

141

00:02:48.940  -->  00:02:51.300
triplicated. Alright so that shows us

142

00:02:51.300  -->  00:02:51.310

143

00:02:51.310  -->  00:02:52.980
that the join has been performed

144

00:02:52.980  -->  00:02:52.990

145

00:02:52.990  -->  00:02:55.230
correctly and also you can just confirm

146

00:02:55.230  -->  00:02:55.240

147

00:02:55.240  -->  00:02:58.290
that 8,028 is indeed the natural number

148

00:02:58.290  -->  00:02:58.300

149

00:02:58.300  -->  00:02:59.700
of items if you just look at order

150

00:02:59.700  -->  00:02:59.710

151

00:02:59.710  -->  00:03:01.110
breakdown by itself you'll see that

152

00:03:01.110  -->  00:03:01.120

153

00:03:01.120  -->  00:03:04.620
there is total 8,028 items meaning we

154

00:03:04.620  -->  00:03:04.630

155

00:03:04.630  -->  00:03:06.480
haven't lost in Euros in the process

156

00:03:06.480  -->  00:03:06.490

157

00:03:06.490  -->  00:03:09.990
which is good and now we can simply

158

00:03:09.990  -->  00:03:10.000

159

00:03:10.000  -->  00:03:12.120
proceed to sheet one and one more thing

160

00:03:12.120  -->  00:03:12.130

161

00:03:12.130  -->  00:03:14.220
that we need to do here is we need to

162

00:03:14.220  -->  00:03:14.230

163

00:03:14.230  -->  00:03:16.710
create a hierarchies for our

164

00:03:16.710  -->  00:03:16.720

165

00:03:16.720  -->  00:03:20.190
geography. So we've got state, postal code,

166

00:03:20.190  -->  00:03:20.200

167

00:03:20.200  -->  00:03:22.560
country and city. So just take any two of

168

00:03:22.560  -->  00:03:22.570

169

00:03:22.570  -->  00:03:24.870
them. City drag it on top of state.

170

00:03:24.870  -->  00:03:24.880

171

00:03:24.880  -->  00:03:27.660
This creates a hierarchy name we call

172

00:03:27.660  -->  00:03:27.670

173

00:03:27.670  -->  00:03:30.449
geography, you can all geographical

174

00:03:30.449  -->  00:03:30.459

175

00:03:30.459  -->  00:03:33.510
hierarchy can call it anything you like

176

00:03:33.510  -->  00:03:33.520

177

00:03:33.520  -->  00:03:35.760
and here we've got state and city so

178

00:03:35.760  -->  00:03:35.770

179

00:03:35.770  -->  00:03:37.290
we're going to add country into it as

180

00:03:37.290  -->  00:03:37.300

181

00:03:37.300  -->  00:03:39.750
well above state and then we're going to

182

00:03:39.750  -->  00:03:39.760

183

00:03:39.760  -->  00:03:43.770
add postal code below city. So there we

184

00:03:43.770  -->  00:03:43.780

185

00:03:43.780  -->  00:03:45.449
go now geography is ready and we can

186

00:03:45.449  -->  00:03:45.459

187

00:03:45.459  -->  00:03:47.729
just simply drag country in here and

188

00:03:47.729  -->  00:03:47.739

189

00:03:47.739  -->  00:03:50.160
then or we don't have to do that we just

190

00:03:50.160  -->  00:03:50.170

191

00:03:50.170  -->  00:03:52.440
click this plus sign and you can see

192

00:03:52.440  -->  00:03:52.450

193

00:03:52.450  -->  00:03:54.449
that now we've got all the states we can

194

00:03:54.449  -->  00:03:54.459

195

00:03:54.459  -->  00:03:56.699
drill down to the city level if we like,

196

00:03:56.699  -->  00:03:56.709

197

00:03:56.709  -->  00:03:59.190
or we can go down to the post code level.

198

00:03:59.190  -->  00:03:59.200

199

00:03:59.200  -->  00:04:01.290
So you can see that not much changes but

200

00:04:01.290  -->  00:04:01.300

201

00:04:01.300  -->  00:04:03.570
actually they are a few cities that

202

00:04:03.570  -->  00:04:03.580

203

00:04:03.580  -->  00:04:05.970
contains several post codes and we'll

204

00:04:05.970  -->  00:04:05.980

205

00:04:05.980  -->  00:04:08.009
that'll be something I'll be looking at

206

00:04:08.009  -->  00:04:08.019

207

00:04:08.019  -->  00:04:10.080
further down in this section. So there we

208

00:04:10.080  -->  00:04:10.090

209

00:04:10.090  -->  00:04:12.300
go, our preparation's done, just make sure to

210

00:04:12.300  -->  00:04:12.310

211

00:04:12.310  -->  00:04:14.580
save your workbook to finish off. I'm

212

00:04:14.580  -->  00:04:14.590

213

00:04:14.590  -->  00:04:18.150
going to save file, save as section 6.

214

00:04:18.150  -->  00:04:18.160

215

00:04:18.160  -->  00:04:21.180
There we go alright and hope you enjoyed

216

00:04:21.180  -->  00:04:21.190

217

00:04:21.190  -->  00:04:22.590
this tutorial. I look forward to seeing

218

00:04:22.590  -->  00:04:22.600

219

00:04:22.600  -->  00:04:23.629
you next time and until

220

00:04:23.629  -->  00:04:23.639

221

00:04:23.639  -->  00:04:29.749
then, happy analyzing.
