00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,769
Hello and welcome back to the advanced course

2

00:00:06,769  -->  00:00:06,779

3

00:00:06,779  -->  00:00:08,990
on Tableau. In today's tutorial we're

4

00:00:08,990  -->  00:00:09,000

5

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:10,580
going to continue with the level of

6

00:00:10,580  -->  00:00:10,590

7

00:00:10,590  -->  00:00:14,780
detail calculation which is exclude and

8

00:00:14,780  -->  00:00:14,790

9

00:00:14,790  -->  00:00:16,099
we're actually going to drive some

10

00:00:16,099  -->  00:00:16,109

11

00:00:16,109  -->  00:00:19,130
insights or change this visualization to

12

00:00:19,130  -->  00:00:19,140

13

00:00:19,140  -->  00:00:21,320
be useful to drive insights.

14

00:00:21,320  -->  00:00:21,330

15

00:00:21,330  -->  00:00:22,609
Alright so let's have a look what do we

16

00:00:22,609  -->  00:00:22,619

17

00:00:22,619  -->  00:00:26,150
do we have so far? So far we know that

18

00:00:26,150  -->  00:00:26,160

19

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:30,140
we've been able to bring the profit for

20

00:00:30,140  -->  00:00:30,150

21

00:00:30,150  -->  00:00:32,810
the whole state down to the level of

22

00:00:32,810  -->  00:00:32,820

23

00:00:32,820  -->  00:00:36,080
this granular and aggregation which is a

24

00:00:36,080  -->  00:00:36,090

25

00:00:36,090  -->  00:00:38,840
city. So as you can see the value for all

26

00:00:38,840  -->  00:00:38,850

27

00:00:38,850  -->  00:00:41,420
the cities here is the same within each

28

00:00:41,420  -->  00:00:41,430

29

00:00:41,430  -->  00:00:44,450
state, but now how can that be useful?

30

00:00:44,450  -->  00:00:44,460

31

00:00:44,460  -->  00:00:47,810
What we can do is we can take the profit

32

00:00:47,810  -->  00:00:47,820

33

00:00:47,820  -->  00:00:53,420
for the state and city which we know we

34

00:00:53,420  -->  00:00:53,430

35

00:00:53,430  -->  00:00:56,869
can calculate and then divide it by this

36

00:00:56,869  -->  00:00:56,879

37

00:00:56,879  -->  00:00:58,490
value that we brought back and that will

38

00:00:58,490  -->  00:00:58,500

39

00:00:58,500  -->  00:01:00,920
give us the proportion or the portion of

40

00:01:00,920  -->  00:01:00,930

41

00:01:00,930  -->  00:01:04,340
the profit that that city brought into

42

00:01:04,340  -->  00:01:04,350

43

00:01:04,350  -->  00:01:07,550
the overall profit for that state.

44

00:01:07,550  -->  00:01:07,560

45

00:01:07,560  -->  00:01:09,800
Alright so here it's a good, it's good

46

00:01:09,800  -->  00:01:09,810

47

00:01:09,810  -->  00:01:11,000
that we have this visualization on the

48

00:01:11,000  -->  00:01:11,010

49

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:13,130
side so let's first of all duplicate the

50

00:01:13,130  -->  00:01:13,140

51

00:01:13,140  -->  00:01:16,039
sheet and we'll call this LOD exclude

52

00:01:16,039  -->  00:01:16,049

53

00:01:16,049  -->  00:01:17,929
part 2 and it's good that we have this

54

00:01:17,929  -->  00:01:17,939

55

00:01:17,939  -->  00:01:19,370
on the side here so I'm going to zoom

56

00:01:19,370  -->  00:01:19,380

57

00:01:19,380  -->  00:01:23,060
into North Dakota and actually I'm going

58

00:01:23,060  -->  00:01:23,070

59

00:01:23,070  -->  00:01:26,570
to go to all here and change the label,

60

00:01:26,570  -->  00:01:26,580

61

00:01:26,580  -->  00:01:30,800
size make it 12 and bold and so here you

62

00:01:30,800  -->  00:01:30,810

63

00:01:30,810  -->  00:01:32,960
can see that we've got the profit for

64

00:01:32,960  -->  00:01:32,970

65

00:01:32,970  -->  00:01:33,950
the state we've been able to

66

00:01:33,950  -->  00:01:33,960

67

00:01:33,960  -->  00:01:35,810
successfully bring it down to this

68

00:01:35,810  -->  00:01:35,820

69

00:01:35,820  -->  00:01:37,670
higher level of granularity which is the

70

00:01:37,670  -->  00:01:37,680

71

00:01:37,680  -->  00:01:40,069
city and here we have the actual profit

72

00:01:40,069  -->  00:01:40,079

73

00:01:40,079  -->  00:01:42,560
for each of the cities. So which is just

74

00:01:42,560  -->  00:01:42,570

75

00:01:42,570  -->  00:01:44,749
a simple sum profit, as you can see

76

00:01:44,749  -->  00:01:44,759

77

00:01:44,759  -->  00:01:46,609
there and what we want to do is want to

78

00:01:46,609  -->  00:01:46,619

79

00:01:46,619  -->  00:01:48,170
take this number and divide by this

80

00:01:48,170  -->  00:01:48,180

81

00:01:48,180  -->  00:01:49,910
number for every single city and

82

00:01:49,910  -->  00:01:49,920

83

00:01:49,920  -->  00:01:52,190
visualization and what that will give us

84

00:01:52,190  -->  00:01:52,200

85

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:56,749
is it will give us the portion of the

86

00:01:56,749  -->  00:01:56,759

87

00:01:56,759  -->  00:02:00,679
profit that each city contributed to the

88

00:02:00,679  -->  00:02:00,689

89

00:02:00,689  -->  00:02:03,380
total profit of the state right so let's

90

00:02:03,380  -->  00:02:03,390

91

00:02:03,390  -->  00:02:05,420
do that. Again we're going to only work

92

00:02:05,420  -->  00:02:05,430

93

00:02:05,430  -->  00:02:07,969
with the visualization on the left and

94

00:02:07,969  -->  00:02:07,979

95

00:02:07,979  -->  00:02:11,660
let's get straight into it. So ready to

96

00:02:11,660  -->  00:02:11,670

97

00:02:11,670  -->  00:02:12,570
go open it up

98

00:02:12,570  -->  00:02:12,580

99

00:02:12,580  -->  00:02:16,680
and here so we no longer want that value

100

00:02:16,680  -->  00:02:16,690

101

00:02:16,690  -->  00:02:20,550
right? We actually want

102

00:02:20,550  -->  00:02:20,560

103

00:02:20,560  -->  00:02:23,070
let's say, let's take profit for now and

104

00:02:23,070  -->  00:02:23,080

105

00:02:23,080  -->  00:02:26,100
we'll drag it into label and here we

106

00:02:26,100  -->  00:02:26,110

107

00:02:26,110  -->  00:02:28,200
just double-click and do a calculation

108

00:02:28,200  -->  00:02:28,210

109

00:02:28,210  -->  00:02:32,040
right inside this item we're going to

110

00:02:32,040  -->  00:02:32,050

111

00:02:32,050  -->  00:02:37,050
say divide that by as you remember we

112

00:02:37,050  -->  00:02:37,060

113

00:02:37,060  -->  00:02:39,600
had the ATTR function because we need

114

00:02:39,600  -->  00:02:39,610

115

00:02:39,610  -->  00:02:42,750
some sort of aggregation and then we're

116

00:02:42,750  -->  00:02:42,760

117

00:02:42,760  -->  00:02:43,500
going to do

118

00:02:43,500  -->  00:02:43,510

119

00:02:43,510  -->  00:02:47,520
LOD exclude state profit. That's what

120

00:02:47,520  -->  00:02:47,530

121

00:02:47,530  -->  00:02:48,600
we want.

122

00:02:48,600  -->  00:02:48,610

123

00:02:48,610  -->  00:02:51,990
So let me just expand this bit more so

124

00:02:51,990  -->  00:02:52,000

125

00:02:52,000  -->  00:02:53,970
we can see it.

126

00:02:53,970  -->  00:02:53,980

127

00:02:53,980  -->  00:02:56,040
These are very handy is a very handy way

128

00:02:56,040  -->  00:02:56,050

129

00:02:56,050  -->  00:02:57,990
to do calculations just that ours is

130

00:02:57,990  -->  00:02:58,000

131

00:02:58,000  -->  00:03:01,080
quite long so we got sum profit and

132

00:03:01,080  -->  00:03:01,090

133

00:03:01,090  -->  00:03:05,550
we're dividing it by ATTR and so we need

134

00:03:05,550  -->  00:03:05,560

135

00:03:05,560  -->  00:03:07,980
ATTR we discussed that previously, dividing it

136

00:03:07,980  -->  00:03:07,990

137

00:03:07,990  -->  00:03:11,280
by this value of the state profit that

138

00:03:11,280  -->  00:03:11,290

139

00:03:11,290  -->  00:03:13,290
we're bringing from a different level of

140

00:03:13,290  -->  00:03:13,300

141

00:03:13,300  -->  00:03:17,370
aggregation. Click OK and now we also

142

00:03:17,370  -->  00:03:17,380

143

00:03:17,380  -->  00:03:20,759
drag this into color and we can actually

144

00:03:20,759  -->  00:03:20,769

145

00:03:20,769  -->  00:03:23,820
drag it into size as well. So there we go,

146

00:03:23,820  -->  00:03:23,830

147

00:03:23,830  -->  00:03:26,850
so this is the start. This is a good start

148

00:03:26,850  -->  00:03:26,860

149

00:03:26,860  -->  00:03:28,410
actually let's get rid of the second

150

00:03:28,410  -->  00:03:28,420

151

00:03:28,420  -->  00:03:29,940
chart because we don't need it.

152

00:03:29,940  -->  00:03:29,950

153

00:03:29,950  -->  00:03:32,100
There's nothing to compare to in this

154

00:03:32,100  -->  00:03:32,110

155

00:03:32,110  -->  00:03:34,560
case. So we're going to take this and

156

00:03:34,560  -->  00:03:34,570

157

00:03:34,570  -->  00:03:36,870
remove it and that way we only have this

158

00:03:36,870  -->  00:03:36,880

159

00:03:36,880  -->  00:03:41,280
one chart left so now if I look at what

160

00:03:41,280  -->  00:03:41,290

161

00:03:41,290  -->  00:03:43,110
we have here it's a good start because

162

00:03:43,110  -->  00:03:43,120

163

00:03:43,120  -->  00:03:44,550
we can already see like for instance

164

00:03:44,550  -->  00:03:44,560

165

00:03:44,560  -->  00:03:50,130
0.382 right. So I can take the profit

166

00:03:50,130  -->  00:03:50,140

167

00:03:50,140  -->  00:03:54,390
and just added into somewhere where you

168

00:03:54,390  -->  00:03:54,400

169

00:03:54,400  -->  00:03:58,140
can add it if I added into the tooltip

170

00:03:58,140  -->  00:03:58,150

171

00:03:58,150  -->  00:04:00,180
for example, just sum profit in the

172

00:04:00,180  -->  00:04:00,190

173

00:04:00,190  -->  00:04:02,699
tooltip, here I can see that profit is

174

00:04:02,699  -->  00:04:02,709

175

00:04:02,709  -->  00:04:06,030
2,678 and also let's take the state

176

00:04:06,030  -->  00:04:06,040

177

00:04:06,040  -->  00:04:07,740
profit and put into the tooltip as well.

178

00:04:07,740  -->  00:04:07,750

179

00:04:07,750  -->  00:04:09,840
I know this is getting quite large but

180

00:04:09,840  -->  00:04:09,850

181

00:04:09,850  -->  00:04:12,630
it should all make sense so we've just

182

00:04:12,630  -->  00:04:12,640

183

00:04:12,640  -->  00:04:15,240
got the state.

184

00:04:15,240  -->  00:04:15,250

185

00:04:15,250  -->  00:04:17,699
We've got the calculation as a label, the

186

00:04:17,699  -->  00:04:17,709

187

00:04:17,709  -->  00:04:19,979
calculation as the size, the calculation

188

00:04:19,979  -->  00:04:19,989

189

00:04:19,989  -->  00:04:24,420
so that a ratio that percentage as the

190

00:04:24,420  -->  00:04:24,430

191

00:04:24,430  -->  00:04:27,360
color as well and then we've got the

192

00:04:27,360  -->  00:04:27,370

193

00:04:27,370  -->  00:04:28,950
calculator and then we're going to some

194

00:04:28,950  -->  00:04:28,960

195

00:04:28,960  -->  00:04:31,530
profit as the tooltip and the sum

196

00:04:31,530  -->  00:04:31,540

197

00:04:31,540  -->  00:04:33,390
profit of the state as a tooltip so if

198

00:04:33,390  -->  00:04:33,400

199

00:04:33,400  -->  00:04:35,220
we take the city for instance here.

200

00:04:35,220  -->  00:04:35,230

201

00:04:35,230  -->  00:04:37,950
Dickinson we can see that the state

202

00:04:37,950  -->  00:04:37,960

203

00:04:37,960  -->  00:04:43,230
profit is 7,002 the profit is 2,678 and so the

204

00:04:43,230  -->  00:04:43,240

205

00:04:43,240  -->  00:04:47,340
sum of profit divide it by the sum of state profit is

206

00:04:47,340  -->  00:04:47,350

207

00:04:47,350  -->  00:04:49,650
thirty-eight percent three-eight-point-two

208

00:04:49,650  -->  00:04:49,660

209

00:04:49,660  -->  00:04:52,200
percent which seems about right.

210

00:04:52,200  -->  00:04:52,210

211

00:04:52,210  -->  00:04:58,500
So 2,678, 2,678 let's bring up a calculator,

212

00:04:58,500  -->  00:04:58,510

213

00:04:58,510  -->  00:05:05,130
let's just check this right, 2,678 divide it by 7,002

214

00:05:05,130  -->  00:05:05,140

215

00:05:05,140  -->  00:05:08,820
38.2 yeah so that's that's correct and

216

00:05:08,820  -->  00:05:08,830

217

00:05:08,830  -->  00:05:11,070
that's also correct and then if you add

218

00:05:11,070  -->  00:05:11,080

219

00:05:11,080  -->  00:05:14,190
these up then you should get a total of

220

00:05:14,190  -->  00:05:14,200

221

00:05:14,200  -->  00:05:16,170
one which also seems to be the case

222

00:05:16,170  -->  00:05:16,180

223

00:05:16,180  -->  00:05:21,000
which is good. The thing that is not exactly

224

00:05:21,000  -->  00:05:21,010

225

00:05:21,010  -->  00:05:23,130
right here or is a bit misleading on

226

00:05:23,130  -->  00:05:23,140

227

00:05:23,140  -->  00:05:24,990
this visualization like visualization is

228

00:05:24,990  -->  00:05:25,000

229

00:05:25,000  -->  00:05:27,180
pretty much completed this is what we

230

00:05:27,180  -->  00:05:27,190

231

00:05:27,190  -->  00:05:29,940
are after but the thing there's a few

232

00:05:29,940  -->  00:05:29,950

233

00:05:29,950  -->  00:05:31,110
misleading things on this visualization

234

00:05:31,110  -->  00:05:31,120

235

00:05:31,120  -->  00:05:34,170
so going to move this here so we have

236

00:05:34,170  -->  00:05:34,180

237

00:05:34,180  -->  00:05:35,100
some room.

238

00:05:35,100  -->  00:05:35,110

239

00:05:35,110  -->  00:05:36,719
What's misleading number one is that

240

00:05:36,719  -->  00:05:36,729

241

00:05:36,729  -->  00:05:40,890
Tableau is creating this size legend

242

00:05:40,890  -->  00:05:40,900

243

00:05:40,900  -->  00:05:44,340
base starting from like it's taking

244

00:05:44,340  -->  00:05:44,350

245

00:05:44,350  -->  00:05:48,450
negative values has very low and in size

246

00:05:48,450  -->  00:05:48,460

247

00:05:48,460  -->  00:05:51,480
and then going up to high values which

248

00:05:51,480  -->  00:05:51,490

249

00:05:51,490  -->  00:05:53,969
is going up to like all the way too high

250

00:05:53,969  -->  00:05:53,979

251

00:05:53,979  -->  00:05:55,950
values and by the way it is normal that

252

00:05:55,950  -->  00:05:55,960

253

00:05:55,960  -->  00:05:58,140
we can have like a value greater than 1

254

00:05:58,140  -->  00:05:58,150

255

00:05:58,150  -->  00:05:59,820
because we can have negative values and

256

00:05:59,820  -->  00:05:59,830

257

00:05:59,830  -->  00:06:01,890
the cancel each other out but what this

258

00:06:01,890  -->  00:06:01,900

259

00:06:01,900  -->  00:06:04,020
isn't what we want we want to see so

260

00:06:04,020  -->  00:06:04,030

261

00:06:04,030  -->  00:06:06,900
even if it's a negative profit we want

262

00:06:06,900  -->  00:06:06,910

263

00:06:06,910  -->  00:06:08,580
to see it as a big circle rather than

264

00:06:08,580  -->  00:06:08,590

265

00:06:08,590  -->  00:06:10,080
tiny circle which won't be able to

266

00:06:10,080  -->  00:06:10,090

267

00:06:10,090  -->  00:06:11,880
notice right? We'll we'll be able to tell

268

00:06:11,880  -->  00:06:11,890

269

00:06:11,890  -->  00:06:13,320
that it's negative because of the color,

270

00:06:13,320  -->  00:06:13,330

271

00:06:13,330  -->  00:06:15,090
but we don't want it to be also very

272

00:06:15,090  -->  00:06:15,100

273

00:06:15,100  -->  00:06:17,190
small so let's go to correct that so we

274

00:06:17,190  -->  00:06:17,200

275

00:06:17,200  -->  00:06:18,900
need to correct this one over here which

276

00:06:18,900  -->  00:06:18,910

277

00:06:18,910  -->  00:06:21,630
is which contains the size and so how

278

00:06:21,630  -->  00:06:21,640

279

00:06:21,640  -->  00:06:23,310
we're going to do that? Well we're just going

280

00:06:23,310  -->  00:06:23,320

281

00:06:23,320  -->  00:06:25,500
to double click in here

282

00:06:25,500  -->  00:06:25,510

283

00:06:25,510  -->  00:06:26,760
and we're just going to add another

284

00:06:26,760  -->  00:06:26,770

285

00:06:26,770  -->  00:06:31,110
formula here we're going to say abs for

286

00:06:31,110  -->  00:06:31,120

287

00:06:31,120  -->  00:06:36,210
the absolute value of this so the ratio

288

00:06:36,210  -->  00:06:36,220

289

00:06:36,220  -->  00:06:37,620
might be negative but then if you take

290

00:06:37,620  -->  00:06:37,630

291

00:06:37,630  -->  00:06:40,410
the absolute value it'll be positive always so

292

00:06:40,410  -->  00:06:40,420

293

00:06:40,420  -->  00:06:42,510
if you click that now the visualization

294

00:06:42,510  -->  00:06:42,520

295

00:06:42,520  -->  00:06:45,750
is much better right so now big circle

296

00:06:45,750  -->  00:06:45,760

297

00:06:45,760  -->  00:06:47,940
is a big percentage regardless of

298

00:06:47,940  -->  00:06:47,950

299

00:06:47,950  -->  00:06:50,220
whether it's positive or negative and

300

00:06:50,220  -->  00:06:50,230

301

00:06:50,230  -->  00:06:51,810
then the color will tell us if it's

302

00:06:51,810  -->  00:06:51,820

303

00:06:51,820  -->  00:06:52,860
positive or negative.

304

00:06:52,860  -->  00:06:52,870

305

00:06:52,870  -->  00:06:54,780
This brings us to the second misleading

306

00:06:54,780  -->  00:06:54,790

307

00:06:54,790  -->  00:06:57,240
thing that we can see here is that let's

308

00:06:57,240  -->  00:06:57,250

309

00:06:57,250  -->  00:07:00,510
say if we have a state, so if we go to states

310

00:07:00,510  -->  00:07:00,520

311

00:07:00,520  -->  00:07:03,390
here, the state has a positive profit so

312

00:07:03,390  -->  00:07:03,400

313

00:07:03,400  -->  00:07:06,510
never like North Dakota or California

314

00:07:06,510  -->  00:07:06,520

315

00:07:06,520  -->  00:07:08,790
you can see that yes it all makes sense

316

00:07:08,790  -->  00:07:08,800

317

00:07:08,800  -->  00:07:11,460
this is positive and then this one is

318

00:07:11,460  -->  00:07:11,470

319

00:07:11,470  -->  00:07:12,510
negative.

320

00:07:12,510  -->  00:07:12,520

321

00:07:12,520  -->  00:07:13,650
Let's look at, I'm gonna let's look at

322

00:07:13,650  -->  00:07:13,660

323

00:07:13,660  -->  00:07:15,750
another one that's a that's the Arizona

324

00:07:15,750  -->  00:07:15,760

325

00:07:15,760  -->  00:07:17,610
here right so it's got a positive profit

326

00:07:17,610  -->  00:07:17,620

327

00:07:17,620  -->  00:07:21,960
685 and here so you've got the negative

328

00:07:21,960  -->  00:07:21,970

329

00:07:21,970  -->  00:07:25,320
has an orange color and any positives

330

00:07:25,320  -->  00:07:25,330

331

00:07:25,330  -->  00:07:27,240
has a blue color right? So that that

332

00:07:27,240  -->  00:07:27,250

333

00:07:27,250  -->  00:07:29,700
makes sense but now if we take a state

334

00:07:29,700  -->  00:07:29,710

335

00:07:29,710  -->  00:07:32,160
which actually has a total negative

336

00:07:32,160  -->  00:07:32,170

337

00:07:32,170  -->  00:07:34,470
profit so great examples Wyoming right

338

00:07:34,470  -->  00:07:34,480

339

00:07:34,480  -->  00:07:37,680
so zoom into Wyoming and let me have a

340

00:07:37,680  -->  00:07:37,690

341

00:07:37,690  -->  00:07:40,500
look at the map so here you can see it's

342

00:07:40,500  -->  00:07:40,510

343

00:07:40,510  -->  00:07:43,620
minus 3,655 so it's a total negative

344

00:07:43,620  -->  00:07:43,630

345

00:07:43,630  -->  00:07:47,490
profit and if you look at this at the

346

00:07:47,490  -->  00:07:47,500

347

00:07:47,500  -->  00:07:51,030
colors here you can see that the 1.533

348

00:07:51,030  -->  00:07:51,040

349

00:07:51,040  -->  00:07:53,820
if you look at the profit, it's negative but

350

00:07:53,820  -->  00:07:53,830

351

00:07:53,830  -->  00:07:56,190
the color is blue so the value that

352

00:07:56,190  -->  00:07:56,200

353

00:07:56,200  -->  00:07:57,990
affect the value is positive that's good

354

00:07:57,990  -->  00:07:58,000

355

00:07:58,000  -->  00:08:00,030
that just means that this city

356

00:08:00,030  -->  00:08:00,040

357

00:08:00,040  -->  00:08:03,930
contributed 153% of the total

358

00:08:03,930  -->  00:08:03,940

359

00:08:03,940  -->  00:08:06,270
profit of Wyoming and this city

360

00:08:06,270  -->  00:08:06,280

361

00:08:06,280  -->  00:08:09,330
contribute minus fifty three percent so

362

00:08:09,330  -->  00:08:09,340

363

00:08:09,340  -->  00:08:11,460
in total it's it's a solid one that's

364

00:08:11,460  -->  00:08:11,470

365

00:08:11,470  -->  00:08:14,610
fine but what is concerning is that this

366

00:08:14,610  -->  00:08:14,620

367

00:08:14,620  -->  00:08:18,330
color is blue so it's kind of hinting at

368

00:08:18,330  -->  00:08:18,340

369

00:08:18,340  -->  00:08:20,520
that Rock Springs had a positive profit

370

00:08:20,520  -->  00:08:20,530

371

00:08:20,530  -->  00:08:22,110
which is not the case, Rock Springs had a

372

00:08:22,110  -->  00:08:22,120

373

00:08:22,120  -->  00:08:25,500
minus style and 5600 dollars profit

374

00:08:25,500  -->  00:08:25,510

375

00:08:25,510  -->  00:08:28,980
whereas this city I hope I'm pronouncing

376

00:08:28,980  -->  00:08:28,990

377

00:08:28,990  -->  00:08:30,270
this right,

378

00:08:30,270  -->  00:08:30,280

379

00:08:30,280  -->  00:08:33,750
Cheyenne had a positive profit so why does

380

00:08:33,750  -->  00:08:33,760

381

00:08:33,760  -->  00:08:34,980
this happen? Well let's look at the

382

00:08:34,980  -->  00:08:34,990

383

00:08:34,990  -->  00:08:36,719
calculation for color what we're doing

384

00:08:36,719  -->  00:08:36,729

385

00:08:36,729  -->  00:08:38,020
here is we're taking now

386

00:08:38,020  -->  00:08:38,030

387

00:08:38,030  -->  00:08:40,180
we're taking the profit right so we're

388

00:08:40,180  -->  00:08:40,190

389

00:08:40,190  -->  00:08:42,910
taking a profit for the city and we're

390

00:08:42,910  -->  00:08:42,920

391

00:08:42,920  -->  00:08:44,980
dividing it by the profit for the state

392

00:08:44,980  -->  00:08:44,990

393

00:08:44,990  -->  00:08:47,050
so in the case when the profit for the

394

00:08:47,050  -->  00:08:47,060

395

00:08:47,060  -->  00:08:50,800
state is positive so in that case if the

396

00:08:50,800  -->  00:08:50,810

397

00:08:50,810  -->  00:08:52,600
profit for the city is positive then

398

00:08:52,600  -->  00:08:52,610

399

00:08:52,610  -->  00:08:54,280
it's going to be positive and going to

400

00:08:54,280  -->  00:08:54,290

401

00:08:54,290  -->  00:08:56,050
be blue if the plus profit for the

402

00:08:56,050  -->  00:08:56,060

403

00:08:56,060  -->  00:08:58,390
city's negative is still negative

404

00:08:58,390  -->  00:08:58,400

405

00:08:58,400  -->  00:09:00,190
divided by positive is still going to be

406

00:09:00,190  -->  00:09:00,200

407

00:09:00,200  -->  00:09:01,660
part of negative is going to be red

408

00:09:01,660  -->  00:09:01,670

409

00:09:01,670  -->  00:09:05,380
orange, but in the case when the profit

410

00:09:05,380  -->  00:09:05,390

411

00:09:05,390  -->  00:09:07,510
for the state is negative everything

412

00:09:07,510  -->  00:09:07,520

413

00:09:07,520  -->  00:09:11,080
reversed, so if this is negative then if the

414

00:09:11,080  -->  00:09:11,090

415

00:09:11,090  -->  00:09:12,730
city profit is positive then you have

416

00:09:12,730  -->  00:09:12,740

417

00:09:12,740  -->  00:09:14,590
positive divided by negative gives us

418

00:09:14,590  -->  00:09:14,600

419

00:09:14,600  -->  00:09:17,830
negative and if the city profit is

420

00:09:17,830  -->  00:09:17,840

421

00:09:17,840  -->  00:09:19,330
negative that's negative divided by

422

00:09:19,330  -->  00:09:19,340

423

00:09:19,340  -->  00:09:20,890
negative and gives us positive and

424

00:09:20,890  -->  00:09:20,900

425

00:09:20,900  -->  00:09:24,190
that's reversal of what we want. So here

426

00:09:24,190  -->  00:09:24,200

427

00:09:24,200  -->  00:09:25,840
what we want to do is we want to take

428

00:09:25,840  -->  00:09:25,850

429

00:09:25,850  -->  00:09:28,600
this and want to correct it we want to

430

00:09:28,600  -->  00:09:28,610

431

00:09:28,610  -->  00:09:32,230
multiply this whole thing by the sign of

432

00:09:32,230  -->  00:09:32,240

433

00:09:32,240  -->  00:09:35,650
this value there you go, those too many

434

00:09:35,650  -->  00:09:35,660

435

00:09:35,660  -->  00:09:37,630
brackets so I'm just going to take this

436

00:09:37,630  -->  00:09:37,640

437

00:09:37,640  -->  00:09:41,230
whole calculation and so let's bring up

438

00:09:41,230  -->  00:09:41,240

439

00:09:41,240  -->  00:09:43,090
a word document and I'm going to copy

440

00:09:43,090  -->  00:09:43,100

441

00:09:43,100  -->  00:09:44,980
here and so we're going to discuss it

442

00:09:44,980  -->  00:09:44,990

443

00:09:44,990  -->  00:09:48,550
what's going on here so this part we

444

00:09:48,550  -->  00:09:48,560

445

00:09:48,560  -->  00:09:51,670
discussed already so we've got sum

446

00:09:51,670  -->  00:09:51,680

447

00:09:51,680  -->  00:09:55,900
profit divided by the ATTR of so the sum so

448

00:09:55,900  -->  00:09:55,910

449

00:09:55,910  -->  00:09:58,420
basically the profit of the city divided the

450

00:09:58,420  -->  00:09:58,430

451

00:09:58,430  -->  00:10:00,580
profit of the state and it should make

452

00:10:00,580  -->  00:10:00,590

453

00:10:00,590  -->  00:10:04,690
sense by now how this can be when the

454

00:10:04,690  -->  00:10:04,700

455

00:10:04,700  -->  00:10:07,480
state profit is negative how this is all

456

00:10:07,480  -->  00:10:07,490

457

00:10:07,490  -->  00:10:08,560
mixed up.

458

00:10:08,560  -->  00:10:08,570

459

00:10:08,570  -->  00:10:11,260
Well this sign basically plus or minus

460

00:10:11,260  -->  00:10:11,270

461

00:10:11,270  -->  00:10:14,830
of the state profit fixes

462

00:10:14,830  -->  00:10:14,840

463

00:10:14,840  -->  00:10:17,320
everything, so if the state profit's

464

00:10:17,320  -->  00:10:17,330

465

00:10:17,330  -->  00:10:18,730
positive, this is a one and nothing

466

00:10:18,730  -->  00:10:18,740

467

00:10:18,740  -->  00:10:20,560
changes which is good if the state

468

00:10:20,560  -->  00:10:20,570

469

00:10:20,570  -->  00:10:22,960
profit is negative then it will again

470

00:10:22,960  -->  00:10:22,970

471

00:10:22,970  -->  00:10:25,210
reverse everything and will give us the

472

00:10:25,210  -->  00:10:25,220

473

00:10:25,220  -->  00:10:26,890
final result that we want.

474

00:10:26,890  -->  00:10:26,900

475

00:10:26,900  -->  00:10:30,160
So a bit of a trick here and therefore

476

00:10:30,160  -->  00:10:30,170

477

00:10:30,170  -->  00:10:31,720
as you can see now we've got the good

478

00:10:31,720  -->  00:10:31,730

479

00:10:31,730  -->  00:10:35,440
colors now in Wyoming. This is orange

480

00:10:35,440  -->  00:10:35,450

481

00:10:35,450  -->  00:10:37,570
meaning that this city had a negative

482

00:10:37,570  -->  00:10:37,580

483

00:10:37,580  -->  00:10:39,460
profit and this is blue meaning ahead

484

00:10:39,460  -->  00:10:39,470

485

00:10:39,470  -->  00:10:41,560
positive product and there we go so that

486

00:10:41,560  -->  00:10:41,570

487

00:10:41,570  -->  00:10:46,120
is how we actually leveraged a level of

488

00:10:46,120  -->  00:10:46,130

489

00:10:46,130  -->  00:10:46,750
detail.

490

00:10:46,750  -->  00:10:46,760

491

00:10:46,760  -->  00:10:49,750
They should exclude to bring information

492

00:10:49,750  -->  00:10:49,760

493

00:10:49,760  -->  00:10:54,790
from a higher level of aggregation so

494

00:10:54,790  -->  00:10:54,800

495

00:10:54,800  -->  00:10:57,460
from the level of aggregation of state

496

00:10:57,460  -->  00:10:57,470

497

00:10:57,470  -->  00:10:59,440
protect this way from here

498

00:10:59,440  -->  00:10:59,450

499

00:10:59,450  -->  00:11:00,880
don't don't mind these colors this is

500

00:11:00,880  -->  00:11:00,890

501

00:11:00,890  -->  00:11:02,650
just because I messed up the

502

00:11:02,650  -->  00:11:02,660

503

00:11:02,660  -->  00:11:05,110
visualization right now so I mix it up

504

00:11:05,110  -->  00:11:05,120

505

00:11:05,120  -->  00:11:08,200
and I just, just to illustrate that we

506

00:11:08,200  -->  00:11:08,210

507

00:11:08,210  -->  00:11:10,720
brought this report values from here

508

00:11:10,720  -->  00:11:10,730

509

00:11:10,730  -->  00:11:15,070
into this chart and that's what we're

510

00:11:15,070  -->  00:11:15,080

511

00:11:15,080  -->  00:11:17,410
after and moreover we were able to use

512

00:11:17,410  -->  00:11:17,420

513

00:11:17,420  -->  00:11:19,840
those values to create these ratios and

514

00:11:19,840  -->  00:11:19,850

515

00:11:19,850  -->  00:11:23,530
colors and sizes which will now show us

516

00:11:23,530  -->  00:11:23,540

517

00:11:23,540  -->  00:11:27,790
which cities in their respective states

518

00:11:27,790  -->  00:11:27,800

519

00:11:27,800  -->  00:11:30,640
had the biggest impact. So this is a way

520

00:11:30,640  -->  00:11:30,650

521

00:11:30,650  -->  00:11:34,420
to kind of normalize our analysis right?

522

00:11:34,420  -->  00:11:34,430

523

00:11:34,430  -->  00:11:36,970
So even though cities might have

524

00:11:36,970  -->  00:11:36,980

525

00:11:36,980  -->  00:11:39,010
different actual values so for instance

526

00:11:39,010  -->  00:11:39,020

527

00:11:39,020  -->  00:11:42,430
here 48.5 percents or nearly fifty

528

00:11:42,430  -->  00:11:42,440

529

00:11:42,440  -->  00:11:45,670
percent of the total profit is actually

530

00:11:45,670  -->  00:11:45,680

531

00:11:45,680  -->  00:11:50,350
only 332 dollars whereas let's say

532

00:11:50,350  -->  00:11:50,360

533

00:11:50,360  -->  00:11:51,100
here

534

00:11:51,100  -->  00:11:51,110

535

00:11:51,110  -->  00:11:54,490
thirty-eight percent even less in top as

536

00:11:54,490  -->  00:11:54,500

537

00:11:54,500  -->  00:11:57,280
higher 2,678 but that's because the

538

00:11:57,280  -->  00:11:57,290

539

00:11:57,290  -->  00:11:58,960
state profit is higher, seven thousand

540

00:11:58,960  -->  00:11:58,970

541

00:11:58,970  -->  00:12:02,800
dollars and here it's only 605 so

542

00:12:02,800  -->  00:12:02,810

543

00:12:02,810  -->  00:12:04,870
basically we're normalizing by state

544

00:12:04,870  -->  00:12:04,880

545

00:12:04,880  -->  00:12:07,930
profit and then now we can compare we

546

00:12:07,930  -->  00:12:07,940

547

00:12:07,940  -->  00:12:10,210
can say regardless of the absolute

548

00:12:10,210  -->  00:12:10,220

549

00:12:10,220  -->  00:12:13,390
figures in relative terms which of these

550

00:12:13,390  -->  00:12:13,400

551

00:12:13,400  -->  00:12:16,720
cities are performing really well in

552

00:12:16,720  -->  00:12:16,730

553

00:12:16,730  -->  00:12:18,940
their respective states or really badly

554

00:12:18,940  -->  00:12:18,950

555

00:12:18,950  -->  00:12:20,410
in their respective states. You can see

556

00:12:20,410  -->  00:12:20,420

557

00:12:20,420  -->  00:12:22,420
this city's performing really bad. This city is

558

00:12:22,420  -->  00:12:22,430

559

00:12:22,430  -->  00:12:24,490
performing bad. This city is performing well.

560

00:12:24,490  -->  00:12:24,500

561

00:12:24,500  -->  00:12:26,650
This city is performing really

562

00:12:26,650  -->  00:12:26,660

563

00:12:26,660  -->  00:12:29,860
well, very well as well so it's this

564

00:12:29,860  -->  00:12:29,870

565

00:12:29,870  -->  00:12:31,810
visualization shows us which cities to

566

00:12:31,810  -->  00:12:31,820

567

00:12:31,820  -->  00:12:34,000
focus on and then which ones to leave

568

00:12:34,000  -->  00:12:34,010

569

00:12:34,010  -->  00:12:38,110
alone or to try to even further improve

570

00:12:38,110  -->  00:12:38,120

571

00:12:38,120  -->  00:12:39,850
on or which cities like little ones

572

00:12:39,850  -->  00:12:39,860

573

00:12:39,860  -->  00:12:42,700
maybe they're not doing anything so that

574

00:12:42,700  -->  00:12:42,710

575

00:12:42,710  -->  00:12:45,280
there's there isn't much demand for our

576

00:12:45,280  -->  00:12:45,290

577

00:12:45,290  -->  00:12:46,870
products in those season maybe that's

578

00:12:46,870  -->  00:12:46,880

579

00:12:46,880  -->  00:12:49,220
the point of concern or something so

580

00:12:49,220  -->  00:12:49,230

581

00:12:49,230  -->  00:12:50,900
this is a very, very powerful

582

00:12:50,900  -->  00:12:50,910

583

00:12:50,910  -->  00:12:54,560
visualization and it does combined

584

00:12:54,560  -->  00:12:54,570

585

00:12:54,570  -->  00:12:57,320
calculations from little different

586

00:12:57,320  -->  00:12:57,330

587

00:12:57,330  -->  00:13:00,650
levels of aggregation. So there we go,

588

00:13:00,650  -->  00:13:00,660

589

00:13:00,660  -->  00:13:03,350
that is the second type of level of

590

00:13:03,350  -->  00:13:03,360

591

00:13:03,360  -->  00:13:05,270
detail calculation as you can see this

592

00:13:05,270  -->  00:13:05,280

593

00:13:05,280  -->  00:13:07,310
one is a you even though it's

594

00:13:07,310  -->  00:13:07,320

595

00:13:07,320  -->  00:13:11,150
conceptually simpler in this case we

596

00:13:11,150  -->  00:13:11,160

597

00:13:11,160  -->  00:13:13,280
were able to create a very complex

598

00:13:13,280  -->  00:13:13,290

599

00:13:13,290  -->  00:13:16,370
visualization I'll say using this level

600

00:13:16,370  -->  00:13:16,380

601

00:13:16,380  -->  00:13:18,800
of detail calculation. I highly encourage

602

00:13:18,800  -->  00:13:18,810

603

00:13:18,810  -->  00:13:21,170
you to take some time before you go to

604

00:13:21,170  -->  00:13:21,180

605

00:13:21,180  -->  00:13:22,730
the next tutorial to actually practice

606

00:13:22,730  -->  00:13:22,740

607

00:13:22,740  -->  00:13:25,790
these things to maybe you try recreates

608

00:13:25,790  -->  00:13:25,800

609

00:13:25,800  -->  00:13:28,580
again just for practice sake for use some

610

00:13:28,580  -->  00:13:28,590

611

00:13:28,590  -->  00:13:30,020
of the other dimensions that we have

612

00:13:30,020  -->  00:13:30,030

613

00:13:30,030  -->  00:13:33,320
other measures to practice creating

614

00:13:33,320  -->  00:13:33,330

615

00:13:33,330  -->  00:13:35,600
another level of detail calculation of

616

00:13:35,600  -->  00:13:35,610

617

00:13:35,610  -->  00:13:37,880
the type exclude just so that this

618

00:13:37,880  -->  00:13:37,890

619

00:13:37,890  -->  00:13:40,070
knowledge sinks in and after that I look

620

00:13:40,070  -->  00:13:40,080

621

00:13:40,080  -->  00:13:41,540
forward to see you in the next tutorial

622

00:13:41,540  -->  00:13:41,550

623

00:13:41,550  -->  00:13:48,770
and until then happy analyzing.
