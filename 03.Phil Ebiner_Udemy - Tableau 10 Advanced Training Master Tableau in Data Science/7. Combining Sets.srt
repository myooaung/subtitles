00:00:02,620  -->  00:00:07,829
Welcome back to the Advanced Course and

2

00:00:07,829  -->  00:00:07,839

3

00:00:07,839  -->  00:00:09,959
today we're talking about combining set.

4

00:00:09,959  -->  00:00:09,969

5

00:00:09,969  -->  00:00:12,089
So in order to combine this obviously we

6

00:00:12,089  -->  00:00:12,099

7

00:00:12,099  -->  00:00:14,520
have to have more than one set and let's

8

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:14,530

9

00:00:14,530  -->  00:00:16,230
go ahead and create another set.

10

00:00:16,230  -->  00:00:16,240

11

00:00:16,240  -->  00:00:18,659
Now remember that in order to be able to

12

00:00:18,659  -->  00:00:18,669

13

00:00:18,669  -->  00:00:20,819
combine two sets they have to be based

14

00:00:20,819  -->  00:00:20,829

15

00:00:20,829  -->  00:00:23,609
on the same dimension. So because our

16

00:00:23,609  -->  00:00:23,619

17

00:00:23,619  -->  00:00:25,889
first set is based on the ID dimension,

18

00:00:25,889  -->  00:00:25,899

19

00:00:25,899  -->  00:00:27,600
our second set is also going to have to

20

00:00:27,600  -->  00:00:27,610

21

00:00:27,610  -->  00:00:31,049
be based on this ID dimension. And we

22

00:00:31,049  -->  00:00:31,059

23

00:00:31,059  -->  00:00:33,479
already have a set that shows the high

24

00:00:33,479  -->  00:00:33,489

25

00:00:33,489  -->  00:00:35,279
shows us the high revenue companies.

26

00:00:35,279  -->  00:00:35,289

27

00:00:35,289  -->  00:00:37,770
Let's create a set that shows us the low

28

00:00:37,770  -->  00:00:37,780

29

00:00:37,780  -->  00:00:41,220
expense companies. Same thing as last

30

00:00:41,220  -->  00:00:41,230

31

00:00:41,230  -->  00:00:44,669
time, right click the ID dimension then

32

00:00:44,669  -->  00:00:44,679

33

00:00:44,679  -->  00:00:50,579
select create set and once against like

34

00:00:50,579  -->  00:00:50,589

35

00:00:50,589  -->  00:00:53,279
use all here and in condition we want to

36

00:00:53,279  -->  00:00:53,289

37

00:00:53,289  -->  00:00:57,000
say expenses but 2015 expenses be

38

00:00:57,000  -->  00:00:57,010

39

00:00:57,010  -->  00:00:58,529
careful of that doesn't matter which

40

00:00:58,529  -->  00:00:58,539

41

00:00:58,539  -->  00:01:00,239
aggregation we use because we are

42

00:01:00,239  -->  00:01:00,249

43

00:01:00,249  -->  00:01:03,450
working at the most granular level here

44

00:01:03,450  -->  00:01:03,460

45

00:01:03,460  -->  00:01:07,560
and and we want to say expenses are less

46

00:01:07,560  -->  00:01:07,570

47

00:01:07,570  -->  00:01:10,080
than a certain cutoff point and we can

48

00:01:10,080  -->  00:01:10,090

49

00:01:10,090  -->  00:01:13,740
see that our how our expenses range

50

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:13,750

51

00:01:13,750  -->  00:01:15,630
actually you can see the range of values

52

00:01:15,630  -->  00:01:15,640

53

00:01:15,640  -->  00:01:17,670
here. There is a very convenient way you just

54

00:01:17,670  -->  00:01:17,680

55

00:01:17,680  -->  00:01:19,290
click load and it'll tell you the range

56

00:01:19,290  -->  00:01:19,300

57

00:01:19,300  -->  00:01:22,230
of values right away and let's say you

58

00:01:22,230  -->  00:01:22,240

59

00:01:22,240  -->  00:01:26,580
want to cut it off at under 5,000. No, 5

60

00:01:26,580  -->  00:01:26,590

61

00:01:26,590  -->  00:01:32,160
million and click ok. So once again we

62

00:01:32,160  -->  00:01:32,170

63

00:01:32,170  -->  00:01:33,540
didn't give it a name,

64

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:33,550

65

00:01:33,550  -->  00:01:36,660
let's give it a name will say low

66

00:01:36,660  -->  00:01:36,670

67

00:01:36,670  -->  00:01:41,310
expenses, click ok. So there is our a new

68

00:01:41,310  -->  00:01:41,320

69

00:01:41,320  -->  00:01:45,570
set and now we want to let's just see

70

00:01:45,570  -->  00:01:45,580

71

00:01:45,580  -->  00:01:48,510
how it works by itself. So instead of

72

00:01:48,510  -->  00:01:48,520

73

00:01:48,520  -->  00:01:51,180
this set let's put the new set in here

74

00:01:51,180  -->  00:01:51,190

75

00:01:51,190  -->  00:01:52,890
and as you can see those are low

76

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:52,900

77

00:01:52,900  -->  00:01:53,730
expenses.

78

00:01:53,730  -->  00:01:53,740

79

00:01:53,740  -->  00:01:55,860
Alright that's good, so but now we want

80

00:01:55,860  -->  00:01:55,870

81

00:01:55,870  -->  00:01:58,530
to see the companies that have low

82

00:01:58,530  -->  00:01:58,540

83

00:01:58,540  -->  00:02:01,050
expenses and also have a high revenue.

84

00:02:01,050  -->  00:02:01,060

85

00:02:01,060  -->  00:02:03,660
How do we do that? Well obviously we need

86

00:02:03,660  -->  00:02:03,670

87

00:02:03,670  -->  00:02:05,670
to create a set that combines the two

88

00:02:05,670  -->  00:02:05,680

89

00:02:05,680  -->  00:02:08,580
and when we combine two dynamic sets we

90

00:02:08,580  -->  00:02:08,590

91

00:02:08,590  -->  00:02:11,640
get a dynamic set in return.

92

00:02:11,640  -->  00:02:11,650

93

00:02:11,650  -->  00:02:13,490
Let's see how we can combine sets,

94

00:02:13,490  -->  00:02:13,500

95

00:02:13,500  -->  00:02:14,990
select one of the sets that you want to

96

00:02:14,990  -->  00:02:15,000

97

00:02:15,000  -->  00:02:17,510
combine right-click it and select create

98

00:02:17,510  -->  00:02:17,520

99

00:02:17,520  -->  00:02:20,270
combined set. Now let's give it a name

100

00:02:20,270  -->  00:02:20,280

101

00:02:20,280  -->  00:02:23,570
right away we want to call it target

102

00:02:23,570  -->  00:02:23,580

103

00:02:23,580  -->  00:02:27,980
quadrant because as you'll see

104

00:02:27,980  -->  00:02:27,990

105

00:02:27,990  -->  00:02:31,400
combining sets will break up our visual

106

00:02:31,400  -->  00:02:31,410

107

00:02:31,410  -->  00:02:34,520
into quadrants and the quadrant that we

108

00:02:34,520  -->  00:02:34,530

109

00:02:34,530  -->  00:02:38,900
want is the high revenue low expenses. So

110

00:02:38,900  -->  00:02:38,910

111

00:02:38,910  -->  00:02:41,210
let's select the other set that we want

112

00:02:41,210  -->  00:02:41,220

113

00:02:41,220  -->  00:02:43,880
to combine with, low expenses. As you can

114

00:02:43,880  -->  00:02:43,890

115

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:46,250
see, we can only select from the assets

116

00:02:46,250  -->  00:02:46,260

117

00:02:46,260  -->  00:02:50,060
that are based on the same ID same

118

00:02:50,060  -->  00:02:50,070

119

00:02:50,070  -->  00:02:51,860
dimension. So we only have two of those

120

00:02:51,860  -->  00:02:51,870

121

00:02:51,870  -->  00:02:53,780
sets low expenses and top startups by

122

00:02:53,780  -->  00:02:53,790

123

00:02:53,790  -->  00:02:55,430
growth. We cannot select from the other

124

00:02:55,430  -->  00:02:55,440

125

00:02:55,440  -->  00:02:56,960
sets because they're based on other

126

00:02:56,960  -->  00:02:56,970

127

00:02:56,970  -->  00:03:00,410
dimensions. So we select low expenses and

128

00:03:00,410  -->  00:03:00,420

129

00:03:00,420  -->  00:03:03,890
here you have a few ways of combining

130

00:03:03,890  -->  00:03:03,900

131

00:03:03,900  -->  00:03:07,250
sets so first one is all members in both

132

00:03:07,250  -->  00:03:07,260

133

00:03:07,260  -->  00:03:10,430
sets that basically it's very very

134

00:03:10,430  -->  00:03:10,440

135

00:03:10,440  -->  00:03:12,410
simple to understand them they've got

136

00:03:12,410  -->  00:03:12,420

137

00:03:12,420  -->  00:03:14,330
pictures over here and we'll look for

138

00:03:14,330  -->  00:03:14,340

139

00:03:14,340  -->  00:03:15,860
the road through them just now. So let's

140

00:03:15,860  -->  00:03:15,870

141

00:03:15,870  -->  00:03:18,440
just click OK for now and let's replace

142

00:03:18,440  -->  00:03:18,450

143

00:03:18,450  -->  00:03:20,600
what we have here with target quadrant

144

00:03:20,600  -->  00:03:20,610

145

00:03:20,610  -->  00:03:22,789
and so as you can see we've combined the

146

00:03:22,789  -->  00:03:22,799

147

00:03:22,799  -->  00:03:24,830
high revenue companies with the low

148

00:03:24,830  -->  00:03:24,840

149

00:03:24,840  -->  00:03:27,259
expense companies and we haven't got an

150

00:03:27,259  -->  00:03:27,269

151

00:03:27,269  -->  00:03:29,270
intersect of them, we got like a union so

152

00:03:29,270  -->  00:03:29,280

153

00:03:29,280  -->  00:03:31,220
we're looking at any company which has

154

00:03:31,220  -->  00:03:31,230

155

00:03:31,230  -->  00:03:35,060
low expenses or has high revenue.

156

00:03:35,060  -->  00:03:35,070

157

00:03:35,070  -->  00:03:38,570
Let's go ahead and modify our set,

158

00:03:38,570  -->  00:03:38,580

159

00:03:38,580  -->  00:03:40,759
target quadrant and we click edit set

160

00:03:40,759  -->  00:03:40,769

161

00:03:40,769  -->  00:03:43,580
and here we can change it. So let's say

162

00:03:43,580  -->  00:03:43,590

163

00:03:43,590  -->  00:03:46,400
if we want that's what happens if we

164

00:03:46,400  -->  00:03:46,410

165

00:03:46,410  -->  00:03:47,449
look at this one

166

00:03:47,449  -->  00:03:47,459

167

00:03:47,459  -->  00:03:49,430
apply so that's basically all companies

168

00:03:49,430  -->  00:03:49,440

169

00:03:49,440  -->  00:03:52,430
that have high revenue but don't have

170

00:03:52,430  -->  00:03:52,440

171

00:03:52,440  -->  00:03:54,229
low expense, so we've excluded the

172

00:03:54,229  -->  00:03:54,239

173

00:03:54,239  -->  00:03:56,810
companies with the low expenses and if

174

00:03:56,810  -->  00:03:56,820

175

00:03:56,820  -->  00:03:59,060
we select this then we're looking at the

176

00:03:59,060  -->  00:03:59,070

177

00:03:59,070  -->  00:04:01,670
companies that have low expenses but

178

00:04:01,670  -->  00:04:01,680

179

00:04:01,680  -->  00:04:04,130
don't have high revenue but the one we

180

00:04:04,130  -->  00:04:04,140

181

00:04:04,140  -->  00:04:06,860
actually want is the ones only the ones

182

00:04:06,860  -->  00:04:06,870

183

00:04:06,870  -->  00:04:09,050
that are in both sets so high revenue

184

00:04:09,050  -->  00:04:09,060

185

00:04:09,060  -->  00:04:10,460
and low expenses.

186

00:04:10,460  -->  00:04:10,470

187

00:04:10,470  -->  00:04:12,560
We're going to click apply that's the quadrant

188

00:04:12,560  -->  00:04:12,570

189

00:04:12,570  -->  00:04:15,620
we get that's how you combine sets very

190

00:04:15,620  -->  00:04:15,630

191

00:04:15,630  -->  00:04:18,380
powerful feature the only thing that we

192

00:04:18,380  -->  00:04:18,390

193

00:04:18,390  -->  00:04:21,680
might want to change here is the

194

00:04:21,680  -->  00:04:21,690

195

00:04:21,690  -->  00:04:22,880
representation.

196

00:04:22,880  -->  00:04:22,890

197

00:04:22,890  -->  00:04:24,650
Normally, it's best practice for the

198

00:04:24,650  -->  00:04:24,660

199

00:04:24,660  -->  00:04:26,390
quadrant that you want to be in the top

200

00:04:26,390  -->  00:04:26,400

201

00:04:26,400  -->  00:04:27,000
right

202

00:04:27,000  -->  00:04:27,010

203

00:04:27,010  -->  00:04:29,940
and in order to achieve that result what

204

00:04:29,940  -->  00:04:29,950

205

00:04:29,950  -->  00:04:31,320
we're going to do is we're going to flip

206

00:04:31,320  -->  00:04:31,330

207

00:04:31,330  -->  00:04:33,300
this chart we're going to flip this axis

208

00:04:33,300  -->  00:04:33,310

209

00:04:33,310  -->  00:04:35,850
so if you right-click on the axis and

210

00:04:35,850  -->  00:04:35,860

211

00:04:35,860  -->  00:04:40,050
click edit axis, and then over here by

212

00:04:40,050  -->  00:04:40,060

213

00:04:40,060  -->  00:04:42,570
the way this is a hack Tableau hack, so

214

00:04:42,570  -->  00:04:42,580

215

00:04:42,580  -->  00:04:45,060
let's put a star here. Let's click

216

00:04:45,060  -->  00:04:45,070

217

00:04:45,070  -->  00:04:48,630
reverse and let's click ok. So simple as

218

00:04:48,630  -->  00:04:48,640

219

00:04:48,640  -->  00:04:51,240
that so now you axis goes has the

220

00:04:51,240  -->  00:04:51,250

221

00:04:51,250  -->  00:04:52,920
lowest value at the top then goes

222

00:04:52,920  -->  00:04:52,930

223

00:04:52,930  -->  00:04:55,380
downwards and which makes sense right so

224

00:04:55,380  -->  00:04:55,390

225

00:04:55,390  -->  00:04:57,840
expenses are actually negative even

226

00:04:57,840  -->  00:04:57,850

227

00:04:57,850  -->  00:04:59,460
though they don't have minus signs

228

00:04:59,460  -->  00:04:59,470

229

00:04:59,470  -->  00:05:02,040
it's a it's good practice to show that

230

00:05:02,040  -->  00:05:02,050

231

00:05:02,050  -->  00:05:04,830
as you go deeper down expenses are

232

00:05:04,830  -->  00:05:04,840

233

00:05:04,840  -->  00:05:07,680
getting greater so that means the best

234

00:05:07,680  -->  00:05:07,690

235

00:05:07,690  -->  00:05:09,990
companies are at the top it's like it's

236

00:05:09,990  -->  00:05:10,000

237

00:05:10,000  -->  00:05:12,750
like this is the cream on top of the

238

00:05:12,750  -->  00:05:12,760

239

00:05:12,760  -->  00:05:15,000
milk and the rest companies are heavy

240

00:05:15,000  -->  00:05:15,010

241

00:05:15,010  -->  00:05:16,770
because their expenses are high.

242

00:05:16,770  -->  00:05:16,780

243

00:05:16,780  -->  00:05:18,180
Another thing that we might want to do

244

00:05:18,180  -->  00:05:18,190

245

00:05:18,190  -->  00:05:21,360
here is to make this look a bit prettier.

246

00:05:21,360  -->  00:05:21,370

247

00:05:21,370  -->  00:05:25,230
We might want to go to format font and

248

00:05:25,230  -->  00:05:25,240

249

00:05:25,240  -->  00:05:27,840
let's give it our favorite font of 12 and

250

00:05:27,840  -->  00:05:27,850

251

00:05:27,850  -->  00:05:30,540
bold so that we can see everything are

252

00:05:30,540  -->  00:05:30,550

253

00:05:30,550  -->  00:05:32,400
really nice in here.

254

00:05:32,400  -->  00:05:32,410

255

00:05:32,410  -->  00:05:35,130
Ok so that's that don't forget to save

256

00:05:35,130  -->  00:05:35,140

257

00:05:35,140  -->  00:05:39,210
your worksheet workbook by pressing control

258

00:05:39,210  -->  00:05:39,220

259

00:05:39,220  -->  00:05:41,520
S or select where you want to save it.

260

00:05:41,520  -->  00:05:41,530

261

00:05:41,530  -->  00:05:45,120
That is how we combine sets. In the next

262

00:05:45,120  -->  00:05:45,130

263

00:05:45,130  -->  00:05:47,280
tutorial, we're going to talk about

264

00:05:47,280  -->  00:05:47,290

265

00:05:47,290  -->  00:05:50,250
another cool feature which is using

266

00:05:50,250  -->  00:05:50,260

267

00:05:50,260  -->  00:05:52,650
parameters to control sets and that's

268

00:05:52,650  -->  00:05:52,660

269

00:05:52,660  -->  00:05:54,330
really going to be a fun tutorial and I

270

00:05:54,330  -->  00:05:54,340

271

00:05:54,340  -->  00:05:55,590
look forward to see you next time.

272

00:05:55,590  -->  00:05:55,600

273

00:05:55,600  -->  00:05:57,839
Until then, happy analyzing!

274

00:05:57,839  -->  00:05:57,849

275

00:05:57,849  -->  00:06:05,459
I
