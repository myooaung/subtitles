00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:00.500

2

00:00:05.300  -->  00:00:07.460
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

3

00:00:07.460  -->  00:00:07.470

4

00:00:07.470  -->  00:00:09.890
course on Tableau. In the previous

5

00:00:09.890  -->  00:00:09.900

6

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:11.870
tutorial we calculate the sales per

7

00:00:11.870  -->  00:00:11.880

8

00:00:11.880  -->  00:00:14.030
capita and we've pretty much already

9

00:00:14.030  -->  00:00:14.040

10

00:00:14.040  -->  00:00:16.970
completed this analysis. So we looked at

11

00:00:16.970  -->  00:00:16.980

12

00:00:16.980  -->  00:00:19.040
this chart and we were able to derive

13

00:00:19.040  -->  00:00:19.050

14

00:00:19.050  -->  00:00:21.710
that from two stand  points Victoria is

15

00:00:21.710  -->  00:00:21.720

16

00:00:21.720  -->  00:00:24.320
the better state to consider for the

17

00:00:24.320  -->  00:00:24.330

18

00:00:24.330  -->  00:00:27.589
expansion and all in all our analysis is

19

00:00:27.589  -->  00:00:27.599

20

00:00:27.599  -->  00:00:30.470
ready to go and ready to be presented

21

00:00:30.470  -->  00:00:30.480

22

00:00:30.480  -->  00:00:32.870
but today we will do one quick thing too

23

00:00:32.870  -->  00:00:32.880

24

00:00:32.880  -->  00:00:35.030
is a quick tutorial to introduce one

25

00:00:35.030  -->  00:00:35.040

26

00:00:35.040  -->  00:00:38.720
more tool that is available for you in

27

00:00:38.720  -->  00:00:38.730

28

00:00:38.730  -->  00:00:42.470
Tableau and that will help us make this

29

00:00:42.470  -->  00:00:42.480

30

00:00:42.480  -->  00:00:45.799
analysis a bit prettier in a sense of

31

00:00:45.799  -->  00:00:45.809

32

00:00:45.809  -->  00:00:49.220
for when we're presenting, so that it's

33

00:00:49.220  -->  00:00:49.230

34

00:00:49.230  -->  00:00:51.049
it's a bit more insightful so just add

35

00:00:51.049  -->  00:00:51.059

36

00:00:51.059  -->  00:00:53.360
that finishing touch to our analysis. So

37

00:00:53.360  -->  00:00:53.370

38

00:00:53.370  -->  00:00:54.619
if we're going to analytics over here

39

00:00:54.619  -->  00:00:54.629

40

00:00:54.629  -->  00:00:56.510
the tool we're going to be talking about

41

00:00:56.510  -->  00:00:56.520

42

00:00:56.520  -->  00:00:59.270
is called the forecast over here and in

43

00:00:59.270  -->  00:00:59.280

44

00:00:59.280  -->  00:01:00.920
order to apply the forecast, What we're

45

00:01:00.920  -->  00:01:00.930

46

00:01:00.930  -->  00:01:01.729
going to do is we're going to take

47

00:01:01.729  -->  00:01:01.739

48

00:01:01.739  -->  00:01:03.950
forecast and we going to drag it onto

49

00:01:03.950  -->  00:01:03.960

50

00:01:03.960  -->  00:01:07.460
the chart and there we go what you can

51

00:01:07.460  -->  00:01:07.470

52

00:01:07.470  -->  00:01:08.690
see is on the right,

53

00:01:08.690  -->  00:01:08.700

54

00:01:08.700  -->  00:01:11.810
some new bars have appeared and they are

55

00:01:11.810  -->  00:01:11.820

56

00:01:11.820  -->  00:01:14.960
actually for future dates, so for dates

57

00:01:14.960  -->  00:01:14.970

58

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:17.420
not present data set so there's May 2016,

59

00:01:17.420  -->  00:01:17.430

60

00:01:17.430  -->  00:01:21.560
August 2016, December 2016, so as you can

61

00:01:21.560  -->  00:01:21.570

62

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:23.570
see it's these days haven't even

63

00:01:23.570  -->  00:01:23.580

64

00:01:23.580  -->  00:01:26.060
occurred yet but Tableau can already

65

00:01:26.060  -->  00:01:26.070

66

00:01:26.070  -->  00:01:31.490
predict or hence the word forecast what

67

00:01:31.490  -->  00:01:31.500

68

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:34.310
the probable sales are going to be or

69

00:01:34.310  -->  00:01:34.320

70

00:01:34.320  -->  00:01:36.200
the sales per capita in this case are

71

00:01:36.200  -->  00:01:36.210

72

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:38.630
going to be in those months for each of

73

00:01:38.630  -->  00:01:38.640

74

00:01:38.640  -->  00:01:40.999
these states and how does that work? How

75

00:01:40.999  -->  00:01:41.009

76

00:01:41.009  -->  00:01:43.850
does Tableau predict? Well Tableau is

77

00:01:43.850  -->  00:01:43.860

78

00:01:43.860  -->  00:01:46.039
looking at two things, it's looking at

79

00:01:46.039  -->  00:01:46.049

80

00:01:46.049  -->  00:01:48.649
the trend over here, which is we've

81

00:01:48.649  -->  00:01:48.659

82

00:01:48.659  -->  00:01:51.170
already got highlighted or outlined with

83

00:01:51.170  -->  00:01:51.180

84

00:01:51.180  -->  00:01:53.179
this trend line and it's also looking at

85

00:01:53.179  -->  00:01:53.189

86

00:01:53.189  -->  00:01:55.490
seasonality. So this is a great example

87

00:01:55.490  -->  00:01:55.500

88

00:01:55.500  -->  00:01:59.510
where seasonality is playing a huge role.

89

00:01:59.510  -->  00:01:59.520

90

00:01:59.520  -->  00:02:01.250
So as we discussed,

91

00:02:01.250  -->  00:02:01.260

92

00:02:01.260  -->  00:02:02.990
the peaks are in December when but

93

00:02:02.990  -->  00:02:03.000

94

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:04.910
people are buying a lot for Christmas,

95

00:02:04.910  -->  00:02:04.920

96

00:02:04.920  -->  00:02:08.000
New Year's and the trolls are in

97

00:02:08.000  -->  00:02:08.010

98

00:02:08.010  -->  00:02:09.350
February, when people are paying off the

99

00:02:09.350  -->  00:02:09.360

100

00:02:09.360  -->  00:02:12.710
credit cards. So Tableau is able to look

101

00:02:12.710  -->  00:02:12.720

102

00:02:12.720  -->  00:02:14.570
at this information or look at these

103

00:02:14.570  -->  00:02:14.580

104

00:02:14.580  -->  00:02:17.600
graphs and pick out these seasonal

105

00:02:17.600  -->  00:02:17.610

106

00:02:17.610  -->  00:02:19.520
effects and apply them to the forecast

107

00:02:19.520  -->  00:02:19.530

108

00:02:19.530  -->  00:02:23.570
so not only is a trend intact. So it's

109

00:02:23.570  -->  00:02:23.580

110

00:02:23.580  -->  00:02:25.580
it's taking a trend into account to see

111

00:02:25.580  -->  00:02:25.590

112

00:02:25.590  -->  00:02:27.800
in which direction the sales per capita

113

00:02:27.800  -->  00:02:27.810

114

00:02:27.810  -->  00:02:31.220
going to go but also you can see that

115

00:02:31.220  -->  00:02:31.230

116

00:02:31.230  -->  00:02:33.320
here in December there's a peek, here in

117

00:02:33.320  -->  00:02:33.330

118

00:02:33.330  -->  00:02:35.240
December's the peak and the troll falls

119

00:02:35.240  -->  00:02:35.250

120

00:02:35.250  -->  00:02:37.160
in February so the seasonal effects are

121

00:02:37.160  -->  00:02:37.170

122

00:02:37.170  -->  00:02:40.190
also taken into account and in order to

123

00:02:40.190  -->  00:02:40.200

124

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:42.170
control this forecast, all you have to do

125

00:02:42.170  -->  00:02:42.180

126

00:02:42.180  -->  00:02:44.450
is right click and go to forecast. You

127

00:02:44.450  -->  00:02:44.460

128

00:02:44.460  -->  00:02:46.430
see this arrow over here, you can see the

129

00:02:46.430  -->  00:02:46.440

130

00:02:46.440  -->  00:02:48.440
arrow over here as well and you can see

131

00:02:48.440  -->  00:02:48.450

132

00:02:48.450  -->  00:02:50.570
the arrow over here. By the way, this color

133

00:02:50.570  -->  00:02:50.580

134

00:02:50.580  -->  00:02:52.940
has been added automatically so that the

135

00:02:52.940  -->  00:02:52.950

136

00:02:52.950  -->  00:02:56.090
forecast is a bit more pale than the

137

00:02:56.090  -->  00:02:56.100

138

00:02:56.100  -->  00:02:59.930
main chart. So we're going to forecast if

139

00:02:59.930  -->  00:02:59.940

140

00:02:59.940  -->  00:03:01.310
you want to take the forecast off you

141

00:03:01.310  -->  00:03:01.320

142

00:03:01.320  -->  00:03:04.100
just uncheck show forecast,

143

00:03:04.100  -->  00:03:04.110

144

00:03:04.110  -->  00:03:06.590
let's go into forecast options. So here

145

00:03:06.590  -->  00:03:06.600

146

00:03:06.600  -->  00:03:08.479
you've got some controls that you some

147

00:03:08.479  -->  00:03:08.489

148

00:03:08.489  -->  00:03:10.520
flexibility around, what you want to see

149

00:03:10.520  -->  00:03:10.530

150

00:03:10.530  -->  00:03:13.430
with the forecast. So automatic, it's

151

00:03:13.430  -->  00:03:13.440

152

00:03:13.440  -->  00:03:14.570
telling us,

153

00:03:14.570  -->  00:03:14.580

154

00:03:14.580  -->  00:03:16.100
so this is the forecastle length it's set to

155

00:03:16.100  -->  00:03:16.110

156

00:03:16.110  -->  00:03:19.520
automatic now Tableau picks an automatic

157

00:03:19.520  -->  00:03:19.530

158

00:03:19.530  -->  00:03:21.620
range where how long, how far ahead was

159

00:03:21.620  -->  00:03:21.630

160

00:03:21.630  -->  00:03:23.540
forecast you can change that if you want

161

00:03:23.540  -->  00:03:23.550

162

00:03:23.550  -->  00:03:26.630
to forecast exactly certain period of

163

00:03:26.630  -->  00:03:26.640

164

00:03:26.640  -->  00:03:28.940
time so one year in this case 12 months

165

00:03:28.940  -->  00:03:28.950

166

00:03:28.950  -->  00:03:31.699
then you just say exactly or you can say

167

00:03:31.699  -->  00:03:31.709

168

00:03:31.709  -->  00:03:34.070
two years or if you go up it goes in

169

00:03:34.070  -->  00:03:34.080

170

00:03:34.080  -->  00:03:35.390
different increments, so it can be three,

171

00:03:35.390  -->  00:03:35.400

172

00:03:35.400  -->  00:03:37.640
if you want you can specify 2, specify

173

00:03:37.640  -->  00:03:37.650

174

00:03:37.650  -->  00:03:39.110
22 if you like.

175

00:03:39.110  -->  00:03:39.120

176

00:03:39.120  -->  00:03:42.920
So Tableau will forecast it for you and

177

00:03:42.920  -->  00:03:42.930

178

00:03:42.930  -->  00:03:44.630
now you can see that the further you go

179

00:03:44.630  -->  00:03:44.640

180

00:03:44.640  -->  00:03:47.449
the greater this shaded area becomes

181

00:03:47.449  -->  00:03:47.459

182

00:03:47.459  -->  00:03:49.759
well that's shaded area is actually the

183

00:03:49.759  -->  00:03:49.769

184

00:03:49.769  -->  00:03:51.350
prediction interval which you can see

185

00:03:51.350  -->  00:03:51.360

186

00:03:51.360  -->  00:03:53.930
over here so if I uncheck that will go

187

00:03:53.930  -->  00:03:53.940

188

00:03:53.940  -->  00:03:55.430
away right so there's no prediction

189

00:03:55.430  -->  00:03:55.440

190

00:03:55.440  -->  00:03:58.009
interval and what it's telling us is

191

00:03:58.009  -->  00:03:58.019

192

00:03:58.019  -->  00:04:01.490
that based on the information that Tableau

193

00:04:01.490  -->  00:04:01.500

194

00:04:01.500  -->  00:04:03.350
has gathered from the existing data

195

00:04:03.350  -->  00:04:03.360

196

00:04:03.360  -->  00:04:07.130
source or existing data set, there is a

197

00:04:07.130  -->  00:04:07.140

198

00:04:07.140  -->  00:04:09.860
95% chance that all of,

199

00:04:09.860  -->  00:04:09.870

200

00:04:09.870  -->  00:04:12.680
so if there is some discrepancies so if

201

00:04:12.680  -->  00:04:12.690

202

00:04:12.690  -->  00:04:14.460
the value is not exactly what

203

00:04:14.460  -->  00:04:14.470

204

00:04:14.470  -->  00:04:16.440
is forecasted to be, then there's a

205

00:04:16.440  -->  00:04:16.450

206

00:04:16.450  -->  00:04:17.580
95% chance that the

207

00:04:17.580  -->  00:04:17.590

208

00:04:17.590  -->  00:04:19.560
value will still be within the shaded

209

00:04:19.560  -->  00:04:19.570

210

00:04:19.570  -->  00:04:22.050
area and naturally the further you go

211

00:04:22.050  -->  00:04:22.060

212

00:04:22.060  -->  00:04:25.230
away from today's date the harder it is

213

00:04:25.230  -->  00:04:25.240

214

00:04:25.240  -->  00:04:27.780
to forecast so the shaded area expands

215

00:04:27.780  -->  00:04:27.790

216

00:04:27.790  -->  00:04:30.180
and for instance you can see here that

217

00:04:30.180  -->  00:04:30.190

218

00:04:30.190  -->  00:04:32.760
the shaded area expands greater. So that

219

00:04:32.760  -->  00:04:32.770

220

00:04:32.770  -->  00:04:34.920
means there is less certainty where

221

00:04:34.920  -->  00:04:34.930

222

00:04:34.930  -->  00:04:39.570
exactly the estimate although the value

223

00:04:39.570  -->  00:04:39.580

224

00:04:39.580  -->  00:04:41.280
of the actual value will fall but

225

00:04:41.280  -->  00:04:41.290

226

00:04:41.290  -->  00:04:43.170
Tableau predicting and 95%

227

00:04:43.170  -->  00:04:43.180

228

00:04:43.180  -->  00:04:44.970
chance that will fall within the

229

00:04:44.970  -->  00:04:44.980

230

00:04:44.980  -->  00:04:47.040
shaded area. Which is  pretty

231

00:04:47.040  -->  00:04:47.050

232

00:04:47.050  -->  00:04:50.550
pretty good. Now we can change this

233

00:04:50.550  -->  00:04:50.560

234

00:04:50.560  -->  00:04:55.170
prediction interval if we want a so

235

00:04:55.170  -->  00:04:55.180

236

00:04:55.180  -->  00:04:56.940
let's say for example if we say

237

00:04:56.940  -->  00:04:56.950

238

00:04:56.950  -->  00:05:00.210
90% right? So if we want a

239

00:05:00.210  -->  00:05:00.220

240

00:05:00.220  -->  00:05:01.950
90% confidence instead of

241

00:05:01.950  -->  00:05:01.960

242

00:05:01.960  -->  00:05:03.660
95% confidence,

243

00:05:03.660  -->  00:05:03.670

244

00:05:03.670  -->  00:05:05.070
what's a 90% confidence? This

245

00:05:05.070  -->  00:05:05.080

246

00:05:05.080  -->  00:05:08.670
will reduce our shaded interval right or

247

00:05:08.670  -->  00:05:08.680

248

00:05:08.680  -->  00:05:10.530
if we want a 99% confidence so

249

00:05:10.530  -->  00:05:10.540

250

00:05:10.540  -->  00:05:13.409
we want to know with a lot of certainty

251

00:05:13.409  -->  00:05:13.419

252

00:05:13.419  -->  00:05:16.650
where we can expect the value the actual

253

00:05:16.650  -->  00:05:16.660

254

00:05:16.660  -->  00:05:19.380
values fall we set 99 and as you can see

255

00:05:19.380  -->  00:05:19.390

256

00:05:19.390  -->  00:05:22.080
the shaded area increases a lot, So but

257

00:05:22.080  -->  00:05:22.090

258

00:05:22.090  -->  00:05:23.760
now there's a more higher chance because

259

00:05:23.760  -->  00:05:23.770

260

00:05:23.770  -->  00:05:25.590
the area is greater. Now there's a higher

261

00:05:25.590  -->  00:05:25.600

262

00:05:25.600  -->  00:05:27.360
chance that the values will actually

263

00:05:27.360  -->  00:05:27.370

264

00:05:27.370  -->  00:05:30.000
fall within that chair. So that's how the

265

00:05:30.000  -->  00:05:30.010

266

00:05:30.010  -->  00:05:31.680
prediction interval works you can switch

267

00:05:31.680  -->  00:05:31.690

268

00:05:31.690  -->  00:05:34.830
off the field like to see it and the

269

00:05:34.830  -->  00:05:34.840

270

00:05:34.840  -->  00:05:36.270
difference between these two is that

271

00:05:36.270  -->  00:05:36.280

272

00:05:36.280  -->  00:05:39.600
this is 22 years exactly. This is until

273

00:05:39.600  -->  00:05:39.610

274

00:05:39.610  -->  00:05:43.200
one year meaning it kind of like

275

00:05:43.200  -->  00:05:43.210

276

00:05:43.210  -->  00:05:45.270
finishes off this year so as you can see

277

00:05:45.270  -->  00:05:45.280

278

00:05:45.280  -->  00:05:46.800
it is not 12 months here. It just goes

279

00:05:46.800  -->  00:05:46.810

280

00:05:46.810  -->  00:05:48.300
all the way to December or if you say

281

00:05:48.300  -->  00:05:48.310

282

00:05:48.310  -->  00:05:51.270
three years in this case it will

283

00:05:51.270  -->  00:05:51.280

284

00:05:51.280  -->  00:05:54.270
take you to the third December, so it's

285

00:05:54.270  -->  00:05:54.280

286

00:05:54.280  -->  00:05:57.450
it's,  it's convenient way of finalizing

287

00:05:57.450  -->  00:05:57.460

288

00:05:57.460  -->  00:06:00.060
periods instead of going exactly 12

289

00:06:00.060  -->  00:06:00.070

290

00:06:00.070  -->  00:06:03.420
months going the remaining 12 remaining

291

00:06:03.420  -->  00:06:03.430

292

00:06:03.430  -->  00:06:05.340
months to the end of the year plus the

293

00:06:05.340  -->  00:06:05.350

294

00:06:05.350  -->  00:06:06.540
certain number of years.

295

00:06:06.540  -->  00:06:06.550

296

00:06:06.550  -->  00:06:08.850
You can also change this to a different

297

00:06:08.850  -->  00:06:08.860

298

00:06:08.860  -->  00:06:10.650
measure here if you like.

299

00:06:10.650  -->  00:06:10.660

300

00:06:10.660  -->  00:06:15.930
What else? So aggregate by so this is you

301

00:06:15.930  -->  00:06:15.940

302

00:06:15.940  -->  00:06:19.860
can use this control if you want to

303

00:06:19.860  -->  00:06:19.870

304

00:06:19.870  -->  00:06:23.159
change the level of aggregation in this

305

00:06:23.159  -->  00:06:23.169

306

00:06:23.169  -->  00:06:25.170
case where our visualizations aggregate

307

00:06:25.170  -->  00:06:25.180

308

00:06:25.180  -->  00:06:27.570
two months and obviously Tableau has

309

00:06:27.570  -->  00:06:27.580

310

00:06:27.580  -->  00:06:28.020
picked

311

00:06:28.020  -->  00:06:28.030

312

00:06:28.030  -->  00:06:30.060
the automatic aggregation as months as

313

00:06:30.060  -->  00:06:30.070

314

00:06:30.070  -->  00:06:32.640
well, if in your data for instance you

315

00:06:32.640  -->  00:06:32.650

316

00:06:32.650  -->  00:06:36.870
have daily data but your visualization

317

00:06:36.870  -->  00:06:36.880

318

00:06:36.880  -->  00:06:39.990
is aggregated to the monthly level then

319

00:06:39.990  -->  00:06:40.000

320

00:06:40.000  -->  00:06:42.480
you can either calculate the forecast at

321

00:06:42.480  -->  00:06:42.490

322

00:06:42.490  -->  00:06:43.590
the monthly level like your

323

00:06:43.590  -->  00:06:43.600

324

00:06:43.600  -->  00:06:45.990
visualization is or you can keep the

325

00:06:45.990  -->  00:06:46.000

326

00:06:46.000  -->  00:06:47.760
visualization at the monthly level, but

327

00:06:47.760  -->  00:06:47.770

328

00:06:47.770  -->  00:06:50.700
tell Tableau to look at the daily

329

00:06:50.700  -->  00:06:50.710

330

00:06:50.710  -->  00:06:54.000
data to create the forecast. So

331

00:06:54.000  -->  00:06:54.010

332

00:06:54.010  -->  00:06:55.380
sometimes you might be able to achieve

333

00:06:55.380  -->  00:06:55.390

334

00:06:55.390  -->  00:06:57.690
more accuracy by doing that or you might

335

00:06:57.690  -->  00:06:57.700

336

00:06:57.700  -->  00:07:00.030
be able to achieve other goals by

337

00:07:00.030  -->  00:07:00.040

338

00:07:00.040  -->  00:07:03.060
changing aggregation, but in our case, our

339

00:07:03.060  -->  00:07:03.070

340

00:07:03.070  -->  00:07:05.340
data is monthly and we want to keep

341

00:07:05.340  -->  00:07:05.350

342

00:07:05.350  -->  00:07:07.440
it monthly for the forecast as well so

343

00:07:07.440  -->  00:07:07.450

344

00:07:07.450  -->  00:07:10.620
we're going to keep that. Ignore lost

345

00:07:10.620  -->  00:07:10.630

346

00:07:10.630  -->  00:07:14.430
allows you to ignore the last couple of

347

00:07:14.430  -->  00:07:14.440

348

00:07:14.440  -->  00:07:16.770
months if you don't want them to

349

00:07:16.770  -->  00:07:16.780

350

00:07:16.780  -->  00:07:18.330
participate in your forecast and they're

351

00:07:18.330  -->  00:07:18.340

352

00:07:18.340  -->  00:07:19.440
actually taken out of the bills

353

00:07:19.440  -->  00:07:19.450

354

00:07:19.450  -->  00:07:22.620
visualization, so if I take changes to 0

355

00:07:22.620  -->  00:07:22.630

356

00:07:22.630  -->  00:07:25.140
you'll see that new bar has appeared and

357

00:07:25.140  -->  00:07:25.150

358

00:07:25.150  -->  00:07:29.490
that is that last month that we had in

359

00:07:29.490  -->  00:07:29.500

360

00:07:29.500  -->  00:07:32.700
our data set and in our case we don't

361

00:07:32.700  -->  00:07:32.710

362

00:07:32.710  -->  00:07:34.680
want to ignore any months because we

363

00:07:34.680  -->  00:07:34.690

364

00:07:34.690  -->  00:07:36.690
know that any data that we're using is

365

00:07:36.690  -->  00:07:36.700

366

00:07:36.700  -->  00:07:38.550
from the ABS or Australian Bureau of

367

00:07:38.550  -->  00:07:38.560

368

00:07:38.560  -->  00:07:40.500
Statistics and therefore it's definitely

369

00:07:40.500  -->  00:07:40.510

370

00:07:40.510  -->  00:07:43.980
final. It's not like it is actually

371

00:07:43.980  -->  00:07:43.990

372

00:07:43.990  -->  00:07:48.150
published for delays the spend with the

373

00:07:48.150  -->  00:07:48.160

374

00:07:48.160  -->  00:07:51.900
purpose that we have to wait for the

375

00:07:51.900  -->  00:07:51.910

376

00:07:51.910  -->  00:07:53.550
data to be final before you can get it

377

00:07:53.550  -->  00:07:53.560

378

00:07:53.560  -->  00:07:56.310
but sometimes in some cases you might be

379

00:07:56.310  -->  00:07:56.320

380

00:07:56.320  -->  00:07:58.380
dealing with data that is not final that

381

00:07:58.380  -->  00:07:58.390

382

00:07:58.390  -->  00:08:00.420
you know this month this last month is

383

00:08:00.420  -->  00:08:00.430

384

00:08:00.430  -->  00:08:02.190
hasn't been finished, it hasn't finished yet,

385

00:08:02.190  -->  00:08:02.200

386

00:08:02.200  -->  00:08:04.740
and the data will change. So you

387

00:08:04.740  -->  00:08:04.750

388

00:08:04.750  -->  00:08:06.270
don't want to include in your forecast.

389

00:08:06.270  -->  00:08:06.280

390

00:08:06.280  -->  00:08:08.940
So that's why Tableau defaults to one.

391

00:08:08.940  -->  00:08:08.950

392

00:08:08.950  -->  00:08:11.580
Sometimes it might even be a couple of

393

00:08:11.580  -->  00:08:11.590

394

00:08:11.590  -->  00:08:13.530
months. It might be 12 months that are

395

00:08:13.530  -->  00:08:13.540

396

00:08:13.540  -->  00:08:16.170
not final so if they're like concerned I

397

00:08:16.170  -->  00:08:16.180

398

00:08:16.180  -->  00:08:18.330
think it click center so let me go back

399

00:08:18.330  -->  00:08:18.340

400

00:08:18.340  -->  00:08:23.190
in there so maybe some sort of financial

401

00:08:23.190  -->  00:08:23.200

402

00:08:23.200  -->  00:08:25.320
statements that haven't been finalized

403

00:08:25.320  -->  00:08:25.330

404

00:08:25.330  -->  00:08:28.530
or something that is still going to be

405

00:08:28.530  -->  00:08:28.540

406

00:08:28.540  -->  00:08:30.090
reviewed and might be change you might

407

00:08:30.090  -->  00:08:30.100

408

00:08:30.100  -->  00:08:32.370
want to omit a couple of months. So in

409

00:08:32.370  -->  00:08:32.380

410

00:08:32.380  -->  00:08:33.870
our case we don't want to omit anything

411

00:08:33.870  -->  00:08:33.880

412

00:08:33.880  -->  00:08:36.450
so we're going to say zero. Let's remain

413

00:08:36.450  -->  00:08:36.460

414

00:08:36.460  -->  00:08:38.820
zeros all right fill me, fill in missing

415

00:08:38.820  -->  00:08:38.830

416

00:08:38.830  -->  00:08:40.199
values with zeros

417

00:08:40.199  -->  00:08:40.209

418

00:08:40.209  -->  00:08:42.659
makes sense right so if there's some

419

00:08:42.659  -->  00:08:42.669

420

00:08:42.669  -->  00:08:44.850
missing values in your observations and

421

00:08:44.850  -->  00:08:44.860

422

00:08:44.860  -->  00:08:46.859
I'll just put zeros in there.

423

00:08:46.859  -->  00:08:46.869

424

00:08:46.869  -->  00:08:49.679
Forecast model, so this is your main

425

00:08:49.679  -->  00:08:49.689

426

00:08:49.689  -->  00:08:51.749
control for which model is used by

427

00:08:51.749  -->  00:08:51.759

428

00:08:51.759  -->  00:08:56.369
Tableau to drive its forecast, so you can

429

00:08:56.369  -->  00:08:56.379

430

00:08:56.379  -->  00:08:58.439
say automatic, automatic without

431

00:08:58.439  -->  00:08:58.449

432

00:08:58.449  -->  00:09:00.329
seasonality. As you can see seasonality

433

00:09:00.329  -->  00:09:00.339

434

00:09:00.339  -->  00:09:02.549
is gone and Tableau just looks at the

435

00:09:02.549  -->  00:09:02.559

436

00:09:02.559  -->  00:09:05.759
trend which happens to be the same as

437

00:09:05.759  -->  00:09:05.769

438

00:09:05.769  -->  00:09:09.150
the trend that we've created over here

439

00:09:09.150  -->  00:09:09.160

440

00:09:09.160  -->  00:09:11.639
so it's just basically just completely

441

00:09:11.639  -->  00:09:11.649

442

00:09:11.649  -->  00:09:13.710
ignoring these seasonal effects and in

443

00:09:13.710  -->  00:09:13.720

444

00:09:13.720  -->  00:09:15.600
retail sales that's and that's not a

445

00:09:15.600  -->  00:09:15.610

446

00:09:15.610  -->  00:09:18.239
good choice and finally you've got

447

00:09:18.239  -->  00:09:18.249

448

00:09:18.249  -->  00:09:20.609
custom here. So you can specify your own

449

00:09:20.609  -->  00:09:20.619

450

00:09:20.619  -->  00:09:23.460
so there's two options you can say your

451

00:09:23.460  -->  00:09:23.470

452

00:09:23.470  -->  00:09:25.499
trend can be additive and your season

453

00:09:25.499  -->  00:09:25.509

454

00:09:25.509  -->  00:09:28.049
can be multiplicative or both can be

455

00:09:28.049  -->  00:09:28.059

456

00:09:28.059  -->  00:09:30.600
additive and so on if you want to find

457

00:09:30.600  -->  00:09:30.610

458

00:09:30.610  -->  00:09:31.859
out more information about the

459

00:09:31.859  -->  00:09:31.869

460

00:09:31.869  -->  00:09:32.850
difference between an additive and

461

00:09:32.850  -->  00:09:32.860

462

00:09:32.860  -->  00:09:35.730
multiplicative, just click this button over

463

00:09:35.730  -->  00:09:35.740

464

00:09:35.740  -->  00:09:37.470
here and you'll be taken to a page

465

00:09:37.470  -->  00:09:37.480

466

00:09:37.480  -->  00:09:40.439
on the Tableau website which will allow

467

00:09:40.439  -->  00:09:40.449

468

00:09:40.449  -->  00:09:43.470
you to read up about the different types

469

00:09:43.470  -->  00:09:43.480

470

00:09:43.480  -->  00:09:44.970
of trends and actually they're quite

471

00:09:44.970  -->  00:09:44.980

472

00:09:44.980  -->  00:09:46.980
useful over here if you really want to

473

00:09:46.980  -->  00:09:46.990

474

00:09:46.990  -->  00:09:49.650
get into the nitty-gritty of how

475

00:09:49.650  -->  00:09:49.660

476

00:09:49.660  -->  00:09:52.019
forecasting works in Tableau, but

477

00:09:52.019  -->  00:09:52.029

478

00:09:52.029  -->  00:09:54.509
otherwise normally automatic should be

479

00:09:54.509  -->  00:09:54.519

480

00:09:54.519  -->  00:09:58.230
sufficient to get some preliminary or

481

00:09:58.230  -->  00:09:58.240

482

00:09:58.240  -->  00:10:02.340
all general overview of what the trends

483

00:10:02.340  -->  00:10:02.350

484

00:10:02.350  -->  00:10:05.129
and what the forecast look like. So

485

00:10:05.129  -->  00:10:05.139

486

00:10:05.139  -->  00:10:06.539
there we go, that's how you use the

487

00:10:06.539  -->  00:10:06.549

488

00:10:06.549  -->  00:10:08.850
forecast options.

489

00:10:08.850  -->  00:10:08.860

490

00:10:08.860  -->  00:10:10.859
We're going to leave the settings as

491

00:10:10.859  -->  00:10:10.869

492

00:10:10.869  -->  00:10:13.379
they are now. We're going to click ok and

493

00:10:13.379  -->  00:10:13.389

494

00:10:13.389  -->  00:10:16.530
what does what this gives us is it gives

495

00:10:16.530  -->  00:10:16.540

496

00:10:16.540  -->  00:10:18.929
us some kind of interest something

497

00:10:18.929  -->  00:10:18.939

498

00:10:18.939  -->  00:10:20.639
interesting to talk about during our

499

00:10:20.639  -->  00:10:20.649

500

00:10:20.649  -->  00:10:23.369
presentation. So it allows us not only

501

00:10:23.369  -->  00:10:23.379

502

00:10:23.379  -->  00:10:25.679
to show the actual data but say that

503

00:10:25.679  -->  00:10:25.689

504

00:10:25.689  -->  00:10:28.590
alright so we're saying that Victoria is

505

00:10:28.590  -->  00:10:28.600

506

00:10:28.600  -->  00:10:31.350
the industry that is most favorable to

507

00:10:31.350  -->  00:10:31.360

508

00:10:31.360  -->  00:10:34.619
go and look for an expansion or to

509

00:10:34.619  -->  00:10:34.629

510

00:10:34.629  -->  00:10:36.600
create an expansion in and we can

511

00:10:36.600  -->  00:10:36.610

512

00:10:36.610  -->  00:10:39.239
actually already without any

513

00:10:39.239  -->  00:10:39.249

514

00:10:39.249  -->  00:10:41.639
statistical effort on our behalf. We can

515

00:10:41.639  -->  00:10:41.649

516

00:10:41.649  -->  00:10:45.299
predict what the sales per capita, how

517

00:10:45.299  -->  00:10:45.309

518

00:10:45.309  -->  00:10:48.539
much people, how much per person people

519

00:10:48.539  -->  00:10:48.549

520

00:10:48.549  -->  00:10:52.009
per month are going to be spending on

521

00:10:52.009  -->  00:10:52.019

522

00:10:52.019  -->  00:10:54.499
our another price are in this industry.

523

00:10:54.499  -->  00:10:54.509

524

00:10:54.509  -->  00:10:58.519
So we can really add a prediction to our

525

00:10:58.519  -->  00:10:58.529

526

00:10:58.529  -->  00:11:00.979
final presentation which is always a

527

00:11:00.979  -->  00:11:00.989

528

00:11:00.989  -->  00:11:02.479
plus it is always interesting to talk

529

00:11:02.479  -->  00:11:02.489

530

00:11:02.489  -->  00:11:04.790
about it was always something that

531

00:11:04.790  -->  00:11:04.800

532

00:11:04.800  -->  00:11:07.429
attracts attention of people that you're

533

00:11:07.429  -->  00:11:07.439

534

00:11:07.439  -->  00:11:09.439
presenting to. So there we go, that's how you

535

00:11:09.439  -->  00:11:09.449

536

00:11:09.449  -->  00:11:12.169
use a forecasting in Tableau and this

537

00:11:12.169  -->  00:11:12.179

538

00:11:12.179  -->  00:11:15.079
brings us to the end of today's tutorial.

539

00:11:15.079  -->  00:11:15.089

540

00:11:15.089  -->  00:11:16.910
I look forward to seeing you next time

541

00:11:16.910  -->  00:11:16.920

542

00:11:16.920  -->  00:11:24.079
and until then, happy analyzing!
