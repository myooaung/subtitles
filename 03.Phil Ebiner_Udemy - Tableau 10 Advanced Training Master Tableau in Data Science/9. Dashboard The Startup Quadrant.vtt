00:00:03.170  -->  00:00:07.120
Welcome back to the advance course on

2

00:00:07.120  -->  00:00:07.130

3

00:00:07.130  -->  00:00:08.860
Tableau and today we got a very exciting

4

00:00:08.860  -->  00:00:08.870

5

00:00:08.870  -->  00:00:11.589
tutorial ahead of us. We are creating our

6

00:00:11.589  -->  00:00:11.599

7

00:00:11.599  -->  00:00:13.390
dashboard that's going to go to the

8

00:00:13.390  -->  00:00:13.400

9

00:00:13.400  -->  00:00:15.940
board of directors of the venture

10

00:00:15.940  -->  00:00:15.950

11

00:00:15.950  -->  00:00:17.109
capital fund.

12

00:00:17.109  -->  00:00:17.119

13

00:00:17.119  -->  00:00:19.240
Alright so let's jump straight into it.

14

00:00:19.240  -->  00:00:19.250

15

00:00:19.250  -->  00:00:21.939
I'm going to click the new dashboard

16

00:00:21.939  -->  00:00:21.949

17

00:00:21.949  -->  00:00:24.730
button over here and this one we're

18

00:00:24.730  -->  00:00:24.740

19

00:00:24.740  -->  00:00:29.800
going to call the start up quadrant. You

20

00:00:29.800  -->  00:00:29.810

21

00:00:29.810  -->  00:00:33.400
know how our gardener be I have the

22

00:00:33.400  -->  00:00:33.410

23

00:00:33.410  -->  00:00:36.850
magic quadrant for lots of different

24

00:00:36.850  -->  00:00:36.860

25

00:00:36.860  -->  00:00:39.460
things that they measure well this is

26

00:00:39.460  -->  00:00:39.470

27

00:00:39.470  -->  00:00:42.729
going to be our own start up quadrant.

28

00:00:42.729  -->  00:00:42.739

29

00:00:42.739  -->  00:00:44.410
Alright so what do we want in this

30

00:00:44.410  -->  00:00:44.420

31

00:00:44.420  -->  00:00:46.329
dashboard? Obviously, want to scatter plot

32

00:00:46.329  -->  00:00:46.339

33

00:00:46.339  -->  00:00:48.340
that is going to be our main feature of

34

00:00:48.340  -->  00:00:48.350

35

00:00:48.350  -->  00:00:50.860
the dashboard and by the way in this

36

00:00:50.860  -->  00:00:50.870

37

00:00:50.870  -->  00:00:53.200
course we are going to be talking about

38

00:00:53.200  -->  00:00:53.210

39

00:00:53.210  -->  00:00:56.920
aesthetics and best practices as we go

40

00:00:56.920  -->  00:00:56.930

41

00:00:56.930  -->  00:00:59.320
along and proceed through the course. So

42

00:00:59.320  -->  00:00:59.330

43

00:00:59.330  -->  00:01:01.359
just watch out look out for that because

44

00:01:01.359  -->  00:01:01.369

45

00:01:01.369  -->  00:01:03.039
for instance today we're going to

46

00:01:03.039  -->  00:01:03.049

47

00:01:03.049  -->  00:01:04.600
mention a couple of things on that and

48

00:01:04.600  -->  00:01:04.610

49

00:01:04.610  -->  00:01:08.770
that will help you kind of follow best

50

00:01:08.770  -->  00:01:08.780

51

00:01:08.780  -->  00:01:10.270
practices in Tableau in terms of

52

00:01:10.270  -->  00:01:10.280

53

00:01:10.280  -->  00:01:12.039
visualizing and help your visualizations

54

00:01:12.039  -->  00:01:12.049

55

00:01:12.049  -->  00:01:16.179
be a bit more intuitive and a bit better

56

00:01:16.179  -->  00:01:16.189

57

00:01:16.189  -->  00:01:18.730
like in terms of people understanding

58

00:01:18.730  -->  00:01:18.740

59

00:01:18.740  -->  00:01:20.529
them more quickly and getting more

60

00:01:20.529  -->  00:01:20.539

61

00:01:20.539  -->  00:01:23.319
information from them. So I'm going to

62

00:01:23.319  -->  00:01:23.329

63

00:01:23.329  -->  00:01:25.899
actually make this window a bit bigger

64

00:01:25.899  -->  00:01:25.909

65

00:01:25.909  -->  00:01:29.800
because it's not fitting. My dashboard is

66

00:01:29.800  -->  00:01:29.810

67

00:01:29.810  -->  00:01:31.330
not fitting. You can always change the

68

00:01:31.330  -->  00:01:31.340

69

00:01:31.340  -->  00:01:33.370
size of your dashboard by the way. Here,

70

00:01:33.370  -->  00:01:33.380

71

00:01:33.380  -->  00:01:35.200
if you want you can change the width and

72

00:01:35.200  -->  00:01:35.210

73

00:01:35.210  -->  00:01:36.999
we'll just select different type of

74

00:01:36.999  -->  00:01:37.009

75

00:01:37.009  -->  00:01:40.239
dashboard as you can see like for

76

00:01:40.239  -->  00:01:40.249

77

00:01:40.249  -->  00:01:43.060
laptops whatever you like but in this

78

00:01:43.060  -->  00:01:43.070

79

00:01:43.070  -->  00:01:44.649
case I'm just going to keep it for a

80

00:01:44.649  -->  00:01:44.659

81

00:01:44.659  -->  00:01:47.200
desktop computer so a thousand in with

82

00:01:47.200  -->  00:01:47.210

83

00:01:47.210  -->  00:01:48.969
let me

84

00:01:48.969  -->  00:01:48.979

85

00:01:48.979  -->  00:01:53.230
ok now just that. Alright great so that's

86

00:01:53.230  -->  00:01:53.240

87

00:01:53.240  -->  00:01:55.029
the start about dashboard as you can see

88

00:01:55.029  -->  00:01:55.039

89

00:01:55.039  -->  00:01:57.039
is already looking good just with this one

90

00:01:57.039  -->  00:01:57.049

91

00:01:57.049  -->  00:02:00.849
chart. We don't need this because it's

92

00:02:00.849  -->  00:02:00.859

93

00:02:00.859  -->  00:02:03.370
it's obvious what's the blue and

94

00:02:03.370  -->  00:02:03.380

95

00:02:03.380  -->  00:02:06.879
the gray mean. We will need the parameter

96

00:02:06.879  -->  00:02:06.889

97

00:02:06.889  -->  00:02:09.490
controls so already looking good and

98

00:02:09.490  -->  00:02:09.500

99

00:02:09.500  -->  00:02:11.170
that's part of his aesthetic. We don't

100

00:02:11.170  -->  00:02:11.180

101

00:02:11.180  -->  00:02:13.030
want to put too much information to the

102

00:02:13.030  -->  00:02:13.040

103

00:02:13.040  -->  00:02:14.470
dashboard because then all the cluttered.

104

00:02:14.470  -->  00:02:14.480

105

00:02:14.480  -->  00:02:16.300
Sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's

106

00:02:16.300  -->  00:02:16.310

107

00:02:16.310  -->  00:02:16.840
ok to put a lot

108

00:02:16.840  -->  00:02:16.850

109

00:02:16.850  -->  00:02:19.300
of charts. If it's like a a very

110

00:02:19.300  -->  00:02:19.310

111

00:02:19.310  -->  00:02:21.370
sophisticated dashboard that provides

112

00:02:21.370  -->  00:02:21.380

113

00:02:21.380  -->  00:02:22.630
lots of different people, lots of differences

114

00:02:22.630  -->  00:02:22.640

115

00:02:22.640  -->  00:02:25.210
but for a board of directors, you

116

00:02:25.210  -->  00:02:25.220

117

00:02:25.220  -->  00:02:26.530
know their they've got a very short

118

00:02:26.530  -->  00:02:26.540

119

00:02:26.540  -->  00:02:28.210
attention span they're busy people you

120

00:02:28.210  -->  00:02:28.220

121

00:02:28.220  -->  00:02:30.820
don't want to put too much. So let's see

122

00:02:30.820  -->  00:02:30.830

123

00:02:30.830  -->  00:02:33.040
what else they want to hear. The things

124

00:02:33.040  -->  00:02:33.050

125

00:02:33.050  -->  00:02:35.320
that they were interested in is the

126

00:02:35.320  -->  00:02:35.330

127

00:02:35.330  -->  00:02:37.000
revenue and expenses which we already

128

00:02:37.000  -->  00:02:37.010

129

00:02:37.010  -->  00:02:39.190
kind of have here and we even have

130

00:02:39.190  -->  00:02:39.200

131

00:02:39.200  -->  00:02:41.740
controls that allow us to allow them

132

00:02:41.740  -->  00:02:41.750

133

00:02:41.750  -->  00:02:44.740
will allow them to adjust the dashboard

134

00:02:44.740  -->  00:02:44.750

135

00:02:44.750  -->  00:02:48.070
and adjust the criteria for we are how

136

00:02:48.070  -->  00:02:48.080

137

00:02:48.080  -->  00:02:49.450
they're selecting companies but they

138

00:02:49.450  -->  00:02:49.460

139

00:02:49.460  -->  00:02:52.390
also asked about growth so we have a tab

140

00:02:52.390  -->  00:02:52.400

141

00:02:52.400  -->  00:02:55.420
here for growth which is this one and

142

00:02:55.420  -->  00:02:55.430

143

00:02:55.430  -->  00:02:57.970
how about we put it into our dashboard

144

00:02:57.970  -->  00:02:57.980

145

00:02:57.980  -->  00:03:00.670
now so let's take growth and put it here

146

00:03:00.670  -->  00:03:00.680

147

00:03:00.680  -->  00:03:05.710
under these controls and maybe let's

148

00:03:05.710  -->  00:03:05.720

149

00:03:05.720  -->  00:03:07.390
make some space.

150

00:03:07.390  -->  00:03:07.400

151

00:03:07.400  -->  00:03:11.440
Now obviously this is not the

152

00:03:11.440  -->  00:03:11.450

153

00:03:11.450  -->  00:03:14.350
best-looking dashboard yet, let's add all

154

00:03:14.350  -->  00:03:14.360

155

00:03:14.360  -->  00:03:19.120
parameters so we'll go to analysis and

156

00:03:19.120  -->  00:03:19.130

157

00:03:19.130  -->  00:03:22.030
parameters growth leaders and of course

158

00:03:22.030  -->  00:03:22.040

159

00:03:22.040  -->  00:03:24.580
we needed above growth so this one will

160

00:03:24.580  -->  00:03:24.590

161

00:03:24.590  -->  00:03:25.720
go above growth because it is

162

00:03:25.720  -->  00:03:25.730

163

00:03:25.730  -->  00:03:27.220
controlling growth.

164

00:03:27.220  -->  00:03:27.230

165

00:03:27.230  -->  00:03:29.920
Alright so that's getting better, now

166

00:03:29.920  -->  00:03:29.930

167

00:03:29.930  -->  00:03:32.830
this is a bit of color, it's a bit blunt

168

00:03:32.830  -->  00:03:32.840

169

00:03:32.840  -->  00:03:35.890
right now, it's boring if we go to growth

170

00:03:35.890  -->  00:03:35.900

171

00:03:35.900  -->  00:03:38.380
then we take sum of growth and put it into

172

00:03:38.380  -->  00:03:38.390

173

00:03:38.390  -->  00:03:42.820
color. Actually we need to change this to

174

00:03:42.820  -->  00:03:42.830

175

00:03:42.830  -->  00:03:47.350
a square so it colors the background and

176

00:03:47.350  -->  00:03:47.360

177

00:03:47.360  -->  00:03:51.850
let's undo green, let's do red which

178

00:03:51.850  -->  00:03:51.860

179

00:03:51.860  -->  00:03:55.780
red do we want? That's okay. Well that's not

180

00:03:55.780  -->  00:03:55.790

181

00:03:55.790  -->  00:03:56.710
okay.

182

00:03:56.710  -->  00:03:56.720

183

00:03:56.720  -->  00:04:01.060
Definitely not okay, so maybe like a bit

184

00:04:01.060  -->  00:04:01.070

185

00:04:01.070  -->  00:04:03.730
of a darker type of red. We can fix it up

186

00:04:03.730  -->  00:04:03.740

187

00:04:03.740  -->  00:04:06.190
later. So that looks a bit better so

188

00:04:06.190  -->  00:04:06.200

189

00:04:06.200  -->  00:04:07.720
there we go.

190

00:04:07.720  -->  00:04:07.730

191

00:04:07.730  -->  00:04:11.980
Ok so growth leaders, so we this is not

192

00:04:11.980  -->  00:04:11.990

193

00:04:11.990  -->  00:04:13.540
doing anything right now right? So we

194

00:04:13.540  -->  00:04:13.550

195

00:04:13.550  -->  00:04:17.620
want to fix this up over here we want to

196

00:04:17.620  -->  00:04:17.630

197

00:04:17.630  -->  00:04:20.569
add our growth leaders

198

00:04:20.569  -->  00:04:20.579

199

00:04:20.579  -->  00:04:24.230
so we actually want to add our set which

200

00:04:24.230  -->  00:04:24.240

201

00:04:24.240  -->  00:04:26.839
is called top 10.

202

00:04:26.839  -->  00:04:26.849

203

00:04:26.849  -->  00:04:27.980
Let's get rid of the sense that we're

204

00:04:27.980  -->  00:04:27.990

205

00:04:27.990  -->  00:04:29.149
not using because it gets a bit

206

00:04:29.149  -->  00:04:29.159

207

00:04:29.159  -->  00:04:30.649
confusing we're not using this one this

208

00:04:30.649  -->  00:04:30.659

209

00:04:30.659  -->  00:04:32.990
is a static version of our set so let's

210

00:04:32.990  -->  00:04:33.000

211

00:04:33.000  -->  00:04:35.540
delete that and we're not using

212

00:04:35.540  -->  00:04:35.550

213

00:04:35.550  -->  00:04:38.059
information technology set so let's

214

00:04:38.059  -->  00:04:38.069

215

00:04:38.069  -->  00:04:39.950
delete that. That was just an example. We

216

00:04:39.950  -->  00:04:39.960

217

00:04:39.960  -->  00:04:40.820
don't need that.

218

00:04:40.820  -->  00:04:40.830

219

00:04:40.830  -->  00:04:44.360
Alright so now we have this growth set.

220

00:04:44.360  -->  00:04:44.370

221

00:04:44.370  -->  00:04:47.959
Let's put it into filter, so we only see

222

00:04:47.959  -->  00:04:47.969

223

00:04:47.969  -->  00:04:49.490
the top ones here.

224

00:04:49.490  -->  00:04:49.500

225

00:04:49.500  -->  00:04:52.820
Ok so the startup quadrant, ok looking a

226

00:04:52.820  -->  00:04:52.830

227

00:04:52.830  -->  00:04:55.159
bit better but still this is not good

228

00:04:55.159  -->  00:04:55.169

229

00:04:55.169  -->  00:04:56.779
enough and I was actually building this

230

00:04:56.779  -->  00:04:56.789

231

00:04:56.789  -->  00:04:59.570
for you to say to feel like this is not

232

00:04:59.570  -->  00:04:59.580

233

00:04:59.580  -->  00:05:02.089
exactly good enough like on one hand

234

00:05:02.089  -->  00:05:02.099

235

00:05:02.099  -->  00:05:03.800
we've got this on the other hand we got

236

00:05:03.800  -->  00:05:03.810

237

00:05:03.810  -->  00:05:06.589
this. This is not data mining let's, let's

238

00:05:06.589  -->  00:05:06.599

239

00:05:06.599  -->  00:05:09.080
agree on that. This is not how not the

240

00:05:09.080  -->  00:05:09.090

241

00:05:09.090  -->  00:05:11.629
best that we can do right? We can deliver

242

00:05:11.629  -->  00:05:11.639

243

00:05:11.639  -->  00:05:13.129
this to the board of executives and say

244

00:05:13.129  -->  00:05:13.139

245

00:05:13.139  -->  00:05:15.140
hey guys are you, can you can zoom

246

00:05:15.140  -->  00:05:15.150

247

00:05:15.150  -->  00:05:17.540
you can scroll here so you can find your

248

00:05:17.540  -->  00:05:17.550

249

00:05:17.550  -->  00:05:19.700
company's that other the best in terms

250

00:05:19.700  -->  00:05:19.710

251

00:05:19.710  -->  00:05:22.309
of revenue and expenses but then if you

252

00:05:22.309  -->  00:05:22.319

253

00:05:22.319  -->  00:05:24.559
wanna look for the growth you look at

254

00:05:24.559  -->  00:05:24.569

255

00:05:24.569  -->  00:05:26.119
this separate chart and then combine them

256

00:05:26.119  -->  00:05:26.129

257

00:05:26.129  -->  00:05:28.850
and you know use a spreadsheet or pen

258

00:05:28.850  -->  00:05:28.860

259

00:05:28.860  -->  00:05:30.320
and paper to find out what how they

260

00:05:30.320  -->  00:05:30.330

261

00:05:30.330  -->  00:05:34.159
combine. That's definitely not the way a

262

00:05:34.159  -->  00:05:34.169

263

00:05:34.169  -->  00:05:37.189
good data scientist or Tableau analyst

264

00:05:37.189  -->  00:05:37.199

265

00:05:37.199  -->  00:05:39.350
would present or solve this problem. So

266

00:05:39.350  -->  00:05:39.360

267

00:05:39.360  -->  00:05:41.209
how about we find a way to put the

268

00:05:41.209  -->  00:05:41.219

269

00:05:41.219  -->  00:05:43.939
growth on to the scatter plot? That will

270

00:05:43.939  -->  00:05:43.949

271

00:05:43.949  -->  00:05:46.670
be fun. That will actually show allow

272

00:05:46.670  -->  00:05:46.680

273

00:05:46.680  -->  00:05:48.950
them the board directors to see those

274

00:05:48.950  -->  00:05:48.960

275

00:05:48.960  -->  00:05:50.510
gems that they're looking for

276

00:05:50.510  -->  00:05:50.520

277

00:05:50.520  -->  00:05:53.390
so how can we visualize these stand over

278

00:05:53.390  -->  00:05:53.400

279

00:05:53.400  -->  00:05:59.329
here without impacting the integrity of

280

00:05:59.329  -->  00:05:59.339

281

00:05:59.339  -->  00:06:01.610
this dashboard that we've already created or this

282

00:06:01.610  -->  00:06:01.620

283

00:06:01.620  -->  00:06:04.040
scatterplot. Well, I'll show you a way. Let's

284

00:06:04.040  -->  00:06:04.050

285

00:06:04.050  -->  00:06:05.659
let's have a look at this scatterplot,

286

00:06:05.659  -->  00:06:05.669

287

00:06:05.669  -->  00:06:08.390
over here. So to start off with, what we

288

00:06:08.390  -->  00:06:08.400

289

00:06:08.400  -->  00:06:10.309
want to visualize is we want this set

290

00:06:10.309  -->  00:06:10.319

291

00:06:10.319  -->  00:06:13.309
for the growth we want it to also be

292

00:06:13.309  -->  00:06:13.319

293

00:06:13.319  -->  00:06:15.740
somehow represented. And an easy way

294

00:06:15.740  -->  00:06:15.750

295

00:06:15.750  -->  00:06:19.249
is to use shapes. So we have used colors

296

00:06:19.249  -->  00:06:19.259

297

00:06:19.259  -->  00:06:21.230
so far, but we haven't used shapes. Let's change

298

00:06:21.230  -->  00:06:21.240

299

00:06:21.240  -->  00:06:21.559
that.

300

00:06:21.559  -->  00:06:21.569

301

00:06:21.569  -->  00:06:24.800
Let's go to change circles into shapes

302

00:06:24.800  -->  00:06:24.810

303

00:06:24.810  -->  00:06:28.999
and now we're going to take this set and

304

00:06:28.999  -->  00:06:29.009

305

00:06:29.009  -->  00:06:33.019
drag it onto shape. So anything that has

306

00:06:33.019  -->  00:06:33.029

307

00:06:33.029  -->  00:06:34.190
or any company that has high

308

00:06:34.190  -->  00:06:34.200

309

00:06:34.200  -->  00:06:35.450
growth, will have a different shape and

310

00:06:35.450  -->  00:06:35.460

311

00:06:35.460  -->  00:06:36.470
you can already see them over here. So

312

00:06:36.470  -->  00:06:36.480

313

00:06:36.480  -->  00:06:38.060
there's a circle, there's a circle is a

314

00:06:38.060  -->  00:06:38.070

315

00:06:38.070  -->  00:06:40.850
circle but this is even worse than we

316

00:06:40.850  -->  00:06:40.860

317

00:06:40.860  -->  00:06:43.010
thought we just had but not worry not

318

00:06:43.010  -->  00:06:43.020

319

00:06:43.020  -->  00:06:45.440
worry let's let's fix up these shapes to

320

00:06:45.440  -->  00:06:45.450

321

00:06:45.450  -->  00:06:48.920
start off with. Here just so what I did

322

00:06:48.920  -->  00:06:48.930

323

00:06:48.930  -->  00:06:52.010
is I just clicked on on shape and here

324

00:06:52.010  -->  00:06:52.020

325

00:06:52.020  -->  00:06:53.870
in shape you can select different loads of

326

00:06:53.870  -->  00:06:53.880

327

00:06:53.880  -->  00:06:55.430
all sorts of different types of shapes,

328

00:06:55.430  -->  00:06:55.440

329

00:06:55.440  -->  00:06:58.670
so you can have a play around with that

330

00:06:58.670  -->  00:06:58.680

331

00:06:58.680  -->  00:07:01.790
but the one I mean to select is for just

332

00:07:01.790  -->  00:07:01.800

333

00:07:01.800  -->  00:07:03.620
the normal companies that are not in the

334

00:07:03.620  -->  00:07:03.630

335

00:07:03.630  -->  00:07:06.830
high-growth set. I'll just put a circle

336

00:07:06.830  -->  00:07:06.840

337

00:07:06.840  -->  00:07:08.960
as it was and their companies that are

338

00:07:08.960  -->  00:07:08.970

339

00:07:08.970  -->  00:07:10.100
in the higher ups and I'm going to put

340

00:07:10.100  -->  00:07:10.110

341

00:07:10.110  -->  00:07:14.090
diamond, click apply. So okay so we can

342

00:07:14.090  -->  00:07:14.100

343

00:07:14.100  -->  00:07:15.890
see a few diamonds but very hard to see

344

00:07:15.890  -->  00:07:15.900

345

00:07:15.900  -->  00:07:17.630
these diamonds are very hard to see. It's

346

00:07:17.630  -->  00:07:17.640

347

00:07:17.640  -->  00:07:19.790
it's gonna take a lot of effort on

348

00:07:19.790  -->  00:07:19.800

349

00:07:19.800  -->  00:07:21.920
behalf of the board to find these

350

00:07:21.920  -->  00:07:21.930

351

00:07:21.930  -->  00:07:22.610
diamonds.

352

00:07:22.610  -->  00:07:22.620

353

00:07:22.620  -->  00:07:24.410
How about we make it easier for them

354

00:07:24.410  -->  00:07:24.420

355

00:07:24.420  -->  00:07:27.590
let's add color to the diamonds as well.

356

00:07:27.590  -->  00:07:27.600

357

00:07:27.600  -->  00:07:30.200
So this is going to be fun bit, if I just

358

00:07:30.200  -->  00:07:30.210

359

00:07:30.210  -->  00:07:32.360
drag the set and put into color

360

00:07:32.360  -->  00:07:32.370

361

00:07:32.370  -->  00:07:34.160
obviously the diamonds are color but

362

00:07:34.160  -->  00:07:34.170

363

00:07:34.170  -->  00:07:37.220
then I lost that I've jeopardize the

364

00:07:37.220  -->  00:07:37.230

365

00:07:37.230  -->  00:07:39.320
integrity of the scatterplot. I no longer

366

00:07:39.320  -->  00:07:39.330

367

00:07:39.330  -->  00:07:42.530
have the quadrants. So I it's like you

368

00:07:42.530  -->  00:07:42.540

369

00:07:42.540  -->  00:07:44.540
either get one or you get the other and

370

00:07:44.540  -->  00:07:44.550

371

00:07:44.550  -->  00:07:46.100
but we want both.

372

00:07:46.100  -->  00:07:46.110

373

00:07:46.110  -->  00:07:47.570
Well it sounds like sometimes in life it

374

00:07:47.570  -->  00:07:47.580

375

00:07:47.580  -->  00:07:50.330
happens you want both and there is a way

376

00:07:50.330  -->  00:07:50.340

377

00:07:50.340  -->  00:07:52.910
to get both. All you have to do is you

378

00:07:52.910  -->  00:07:52.920

379

00:07:52.920  -->  00:07:56.240
take your two sets, your top start ups by

380

00:07:56.240  -->  00:07:56.250

381

00:07:56.250  -->  00:07:59.930
growth and your target quadrant and you

382

00:07:59.930  -->  00:07:59.940

383

00:07:59.940  -->  00:08:02.300
press control just like both of them and by

384

00:08:02.300  -->  00:08:02.310

385

00:08:02.310  -->  00:08:04.130
the way start over here you can do this

386

00:08:04.130  -->  00:08:04.140

387

00:08:04.140  -->  00:08:06.470
with field as well so you can drag

388

00:08:06.470  -->  00:08:06.480

389

00:08:06.480  -->  00:08:08.480
multiple into color but you have to do

390

00:08:08.480  -->  00:08:08.490

391

00:08:08.490  -->  00:08:09.830
it at the same time. You can't do it one

392

00:08:09.830  -->  00:08:09.840

393

00:08:09.840  -->  00:08:11.720
by one, you have to select them at the

394

00:08:11.720  -->  00:08:11.730

395

00:08:11.730  -->  00:08:14.300
same time and you drag these two sets

396

00:08:14.300  -->  00:08:14.310

397

00:08:14.310  -->  00:08:17.240
into color and viola! This looks much

398

00:08:17.240  -->  00:08:17.250

399

00:08:17.250  -->  00:08:18.410
better already.

400

00:08:18.410  -->  00:08:18.420

401

00:08:18.420  -->  00:08:20.690
Right so of course still not the best.

402

00:08:20.690  -->  00:08:20.700

403

00:08:20.700  -->  00:08:23.240
Let's fix it up a bit more, so now we go

404

00:08:23.240  -->  00:08:23.250

405

00:08:23.250  -->  00:08:25.820
to color. It's all in our hands on our

406

00:08:25.820  -->  00:08:25.830

407

00:08:25.830  -->  00:08:27.140
control.

408

00:08:27.140  -->  00:08:27.150

409

00:08:27.150  -->  00:08:30.110
Let's go to the Tableau 10 and let's say

410

00:08:30.110  -->  00:08:30.120

411

00:08:30.120  -->  00:08:33.560
everything that's orange right so

412

00:08:33.560  -->  00:08:33.570

413

00:08:33.570  -->  00:08:35.839
everything that's out, it doesn't matter

414

00:08:35.839  -->  00:08:35.849

415

00:08:35.849  -->  00:08:37.940
if it's diamond or if it's not a diamond.

416

00:08:37.940  -->  00:08:37.950

417

00:08:37.950  -->  00:08:41.089
It's not in our criteria right. So it's

418

00:08:41.089  -->  00:08:41.099

419

00:08:41.099  -->  00:08:44.120
this has company that's orange either

420

00:08:44.120  -->  00:08:44.130

421

00:08:44.130  -->  00:08:47.150
has to high revenue or too high or too

422

00:08:47.150  -->  00:08:47.160

423

00:08:47.160  -->  00:08:47.690
low revenue or

424

00:08:47.690  -->  00:08:47.700

425

00:08:47.700  -->  00:08:49.340
your expenses which are too high so

426

00:08:49.340  -->  00:08:49.350

427

00:08:49.350  -->  00:08:52.040
let's like both of these and make them

428

00:08:52.040  -->  00:08:52.050

429

00:08:52.050  -->  00:08:57.260
great. Now anything that's in our revenue

430

00:08:57.260  -->  00:08:57.270

431

00:08:57.270  -->  00:08:59.150
and expenses cut-offs but it's not a

432

00:08:59.150  -->  00:08:59.160

433

00:08:59.160  -->  00:09:01.340
diamond or it's not dark blue on this

434

00:09:01.340  -->  00:09:01.350

435

00:09:01.350  -->  00:09:04.040
chart is just going to be blue because

436

00:09:04.040  -->  00:09:04.050

437

00:09:04.050  -->  00:09:05.990
that's just the normal companies that

438

00:09:05.990  -->  00:09:06.000

439

00:09:06.000  -->  00:09:07.730
passes the expense criteria, but they

440

00:09:07.730  -->  00:09:07.740

441

00:09:07.740  -->  00:09:09.650
don't pass the growth criteria and

442

00:09:09.650  -->  00:09:09.660

443

00:09:09.660  -->  00:09:12.350
everything that is in both so basically

444

00:09:12.350  -->  00:09:12.360

445

00:09:12.360  -->  00:09:14.810
it's it passes the revenue and expense

446

00:09:14.810  -->  00:09:14.820

447

00:09:14.820  -->  00:09:16.310
criteria and it passes the growth

448

00:09:16.310  -->  00:09:16.320

449

00:09:16.320  -->  00:09:18.980
criteria that's the gems. That's the gems

450

00:09:18.980  -->  00:09:18.990

451

00:09:18.990  -->  00:09:20.540
that the executives are looking for and

452

00:09:20.540  -->  00:09:20.550

453

00:09:20.550  -->  00:09:23.540
then we'll make them red. So click apply

454

00:09:23.540  -->  00:09:23.550

455

00:09:23.550  -->  00:09:27.440
and as you can see already it's much

456

00:09:27.440  -->  00:09:27.450

457

00:09:27.450  -->  00:09:30.290
better. So here you might want to play

458

00:09:30.290  -->  00:09:30.300

459

00:09:30.300  -->  00:09:33.080
around with the size transparency so

460

00:09:33.080  -->  00:09:33.090

461

00:09:33.090  -->  00:09:36.500
maybe if you make it less transparent

462

00:09:36.500  -->  00:09:36.510

463

00:09:36.510  -->  00:09:39.200
maybe the red will stand out a bit more

464

00:09:39.200  -->  00:09:39.210

465

00:09:39.210  -->  00:09:41.960
but that is looking much better and if

466

00:09:41.960  -->  00:09:41.970

467

00:09:41.970  -->  00:09:44.390
we go back to the quadrant here you can

468

00:09:44.390  -->  00:09:44.400

469

00:09:44.400  -->  00:09:47.090
see how easy it is for the executives to

470

00:09:47.090  -->  00:09:47.100

471

00:09:47.100  -->  00:09:49.760
pick out the top-performing companies

472

00:09:49.760  -->  00:09:49.770

473

00:09:49.770  -->  00:09:52.550
that they are after and if from which

474

00:09:52.550  -->  00:09:52.560

475

00:09:52.560  -->  00:09:55.100
lets play around with this for a bit if

476

00:09:55.100  -->  00:09:55.110

477

00:09:55.110  -->  00:09:57.950
I change growth leaders a number of

478

00:09:57.950  -->  00:09:57.960

479

00:09:57.960  -->  00:09:59.300
growth leaders you can see how the

480

00:09:59.300  -->  00:09:59.310

481

00:09:59.310  -->  00:10:00.920
number of diamonds is growing very

482

00:10:00.920  -->  00:10:00.930

483

00:10:00.930  -->  00:10:03.650
quickly right. So you like that was

484

00:10:03.650  -->  00:10:03.660

485

00:10:03.660  -->  00:10:05.240
pretty cool how it changes from circle

486

00:10:05.240  -->  00:10:05.250

487

00:10:05.250  -->  00:10:08.840
to a diamond also you can see how as I

488

00:10:08.840  -->  00:10:08.850

489

00:10:08.850  -->  00:10:11.780
change the expenses cut off the number

490

00:10:11.780  -->  00:10:11.790

491

00:10:11.790  -->  00:10:13.940
of diamonds is decreasing or the number

492

00:10:13.940  -->  00:10:13.950

493

00:10:13.950  -->  00:10:17.570
of times is increasing and the revenue

494

00:10:17.570  -->  00:10:17.580

495

00:10:17.580  -->  00:10:20.270
as well so there you go so this allows

496

00:10:20.270  -->  00:10:20.280

497

00:10:20.280  -->  00:10:22.580
executives to feel like they're our the

498

00:10:22.580  -->  00:10:22.590

499

00:10:22.590  -->  00:10:24.200
board of directors that are going to be

500

00:10:24.200  -->  00:10:24.210

501

00:10:24.210  -->  00:10:26.270
looking at still feel like that actually

502

00:10:26.270  -->  00:10:26.280

503

00:10:26.280  -->  00:10:28.310
mining the data. They don't probably

504

00:10:28.310  -->  00:10:28.320

505

00:10:28.320  -->  00:10:30.290
don't know anything about Tableau or how

506

00:10:30.290  -->  00:10:30.300

507

00:10:30.300  -->  00:10:32.660
to use it but you are building right

508

00:10:32.660  -->  00:10:32.670

509

00:10:32.670  -->  00:10:35.960
here. You're building a tool for them to

510

00:10:35.960  -->  00:10:35.970

511

00:10:35.970  -->  00:10:38.180
mind the data and that is the power of Tableau.

512

00:10:38.180  -->  00:10:38.190

513

00:10:38.190  -->  00:10:40.940
That people with no experience,

514

00:10:40.940  -->  00:10:40.950

515

00:10:40.950  -->  00:10:43.370
whatsoever in data science, but they

516

00:10:43.370  -->  00:10:43.380

517

00:10:43.380  -->  00:10:44.690
know what they want from the data.

518

00:10:44.690  -->  00:10:44.700

519

00:10:44.700  -->  00:10:47.060
You are helping them see it and that

520

00:10:47.060  -->  00:10:47.070

521

00:10:47.070  -->  00:10:50.990
that is you know the true enjoyment of

522

00:10:50.990  -->  00:10:51.000

523

00:10:51.000  -->  00:10:54.500
this type of work and exactly what

524

00:10:54.500  -->  00:10:54.510

525

00:10:54.510  -->  00:10:57.740
people appreciate so much about data

526

00:10:57.740  -->  00:10:57.750

527

00:10:57.750  -->  00:11:00.350
visualization data mining. Ok, so we've

528

00:11:00.350  -->  00:11:00.360

529

00:11:00.360  -->  00:11:01.490
got the main concept

530

00:11:01.490  -->  00:11:01.500

531

00:11:01.500  -->  00:11:04.460
already here. All we have to do is of

532

00:11:04.460  -->  00:11:04.470

533

00:11:04.470  -->  00:11:06.320
course make this dashboard look pretty.

534

00:11:06.320  -->  00:11:06.330

535

00:11:06.330  -->  00:11:08.900
Add some you know reference lines are

536

00:11:08.900  -->  00:11:08.910

537

00:11:08.910  -->  00:11:10.460
going to drop lines, we're gonna fix the

538

00:11:10.460  -->  00:11:10.470

539

00:11:10.470  -->  00:11:12.860
tooltip, fix the colors and make it look

540

00:11:12.860  -->  00:11:12.870

541

00:11:12.870  -->  00:11:16.010
fantastic but the the engine everything

542

00:11:16.010  -->  00:11:16.020

543

00:11:16.020  -->  00:11:17.660
that we need in terms of functionality

544

00:11:17.660  -->  00:11:17.670

545

00:11:17.670  -->  00:11:21.260
is already there and that's how we use

546

00:11:21.260  -->  00:11:21.270

547

00:11:21.270  -->  00:11:23.480
sets to deliver very very powerful

548

00:11:23.480  -->  00:11:23.490

549

00:11:23.490  -->  00:11:27.080
Tableau tools and in the next tutorial we

550

00:11:27.080  -->  00:11:27.090

551

00:11:27.090  -->  00:11:29.840
will pretty this up and finalize it and

552

00:11:29.840  -->  00:11:29.850

553

00:11:29.850  -->  00:11:31.190
look forward to seeing you next time

554

00:11:31.190  -->  00:11:31.200

555

00:11:31.200  -->  00:11:37.760
until then happy analyzing.
