00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.800
Hello and welcome back to the advance

2

00:00:06.800  -->  00:00:06.810

3

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:08.600
course on Tableau. In the previous

4

00:00:08.600  -->  00:00:08.610

5

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:11.150
tutorial, we created our data source

6

00:00:11.150  -->  00:00:11.160

7

00:00:11.160  -->  00:00:12.860
filters and today we're going to

8

00:00:12.860  -->  00:00:12.870

9

00:00:12.870  -->  00:00:15.110
continue with our investigations so

10

00:00:15.110  -->  00:00:15.120

11

00:00:15.120  -->  00:00:16.970
right away we can see that there are

12

00:00:16.970  -->  00:00:16.980

13

00:00:16.980  -->  00:00:19.279
quite a few states here but we know that

14

00:00:19.279  -->  00:00:19.289

15

00:00:19.289  -->  00:00:21.109
we're only supposed to be looking at

16

00:00:21.109  -->  00:00:21.119

17

00:00:21.119  -->  00:00:23.689
four, so the one we're operating in right

18

00:00:23.689  -->  00:00:23.699

19

00:00:23.699  -->  00:00:26.540
now which is a New South Wales and the

20

00:00:26.540  -->  00:00:26.550

21

00:00:26.550  -->  00:00:28.970
ones that we are considering so those

22

00:00:28.970  -->  00:00:28.980

23

00:00:28.980  -->  00:00:32.030
are Queensland, Victoria and Western

24

00:00:32.030  -->  00:00:32.040

25

00:00:32.040  -->  00:00:33.680
Australia so let's go ahead and add a

26

00:00:33.680  -->  00:00:33.690

27

00:00:33.690  -->  00:00:35.690
filter to leave only the states that

28

00:00:35.690  -->  00:00:35.700

29

00:00:35.700  -->  00:00:37.850
were interested in and let's not get

30

00:00:37.850  -->  00:00:37.860

31

00:00:37.860  -->  00:00:40.040
carried away with data source filters. We

32

00:00:40.040  -->  00:00:40.050

33

00:00:40.050  -->  00:00:43.010
could use one here but at the same time

34

00:00:43.010  -->  00:00:43.020

35

00:00:43.020  -->  00:00:44.840
maybe the management might change their

36

00:00:44.840  -->  00:00:44.850

37

00:00:44.850  -->  00:00:46.279
opinion and they might want to look at

38

00:00:46.279  -->  00:00:46.289

39

00:00:46.289  -->  00:00:50.479
other states maybe we might need this

40

00:00:50.479  -->  00:00:50.489

41

00:00:50.489  -->  00:00:53.209
row one day which is representing a

42

00:00:53.209  -->  00:00:53.219

43

00:00:53.219  -->  00:00:55.130
total for all states for the whole

44

00:00:55.130  -->  00:00:55.140

45

00:00:55.140  -->  00:00:56.689
Australia, so let's just use a normal

46

00:00:56.689  -->  00:00:56.699

47

00:00:56.699  -->  00:00:59.000
filter here which is going to take state

48

00:00:59.000  -->  00:00:59.010

49

00:00:59.010  -->  00:01:01.459
and drag it into filters now we will

50

00:01:01.459  -->  00:01:01.469

51

00:01:01.469  -->  00:01:03.590
select the ones we need which are New

52

00:01:03.590  -->  00:01:03.600

53

00:01:03.600  -->  00:01:06.170
South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western

54

00:01:06.170  -->  00:01:06.180

55

00:01:06.180  -->  00:01:06.859
Australia.

56

00:01:06.859  -->  00:01:06.869

57

00:01:06.869  -->  00:01:10.340
Ok alright so there is our trend for the

58

00:01:10.340  -->  00:01:10.350

59

00:01:10.350  -->  00:01:11.780
industry which we are looking at which

60

00:01:11.780  -->  00:01:11.790

61

00:01:11.790  -->  00:01:14.630
is clothing and what can we see here

62

00:01:14.630  -->  00:01:14.640

63

00:01:14.640  -->  00:01:17.060
well let's go ahead and add a trendline

64

00:01:17.060  -->  00:01:17.070

65

00:01:17.070  -->  00:01:18.950
and we already know how to a trend lines

66

00:01:18.950  -->  00:01:18.960

67

00:01:18.960  -->  00:01:22.399
we can right click here and select trend

68

00:01:22.399  -->  00:01:22.409

69

00:01:22.409  -->  00:01:24.499
lines show trend lines or the other way

70

00:01:24.499  -->  00:01:24.509

71

00:01:24.509  -->  00:01:26.660
to do it is to go to the analytics pane

72

00:01:26.660  -->  00:01:26.670

73

00:01:26.670  -->  00:01:28.700
which we already talked about and take

74

00:01:28.700  -->  00:01:28.710

75

00:01:28.710  -->  00:01:30.800
the trendline drag it into here. Now you

76

00:01:30.800  -->  00:01:30.810

77

00:01:30.810  -->  00:01:32.450
can select from multiple types of trend

78

00:01:32.450  -->  00:01:32.460

79

00:01:32.460  -->  00:01:35.390
lines so exponential polynomial you can

80

00:01:35.390  -->  00:01:35.400

81

00:01:35.400  -->  00:01:37.550
select algorithmic in this case or you

82

00:01:37.550  -->  00:01:37.560

83

00:01:37.560  -->  00:01:39.590
can go linear so in this case that

84

00:01:39.590  -->  00:01:39.600

85

00:01:39.600  -->  00:01:42.830
they just put a polynomial just for fun

86

00:01:42.830  -->  00:01:42.840

87

00:01:42.840  -->  00:01:46.130
and that's what it looks like but

88

00:01:46.130  -->  00:01:46.140

89

00:01:46.140  -->  00:01:50.270
normally the most common one and the one

90

00:01:50.270  -->  00:01:50.280

91

00:01:50.280  -->  00:01:51.649
we're going to use is actually the

92

00:01:51.649  -->  00:01:51.659

93

00:01:51.659  -->  00:01:54.679
linear trend line. Alright so here's our

94

00:01:54.679  -->  00:01:54.689

95

00:01:54.689  -->  00:01:57.080
trend line, now let's adjust a few things

96

00:01:57.080  -->  00:01:57.090

97

00:01:57.090  -->  00:01:58.700
about our trend line if we right-click

98

00:01:58.700  -->  00:01:58.710

99

00:01:58.710  -->  00:02:01.580
and go to trend lines and select a trend

100

00:02:01.580  -->  00:02:01.590

101

00:02:01.590  -->  00:02:03.319
lines we can change a few things here so

102

00:02:03.319  -->  00:02:03.329

103

00:02:03.329  -->  00:02:05.420
we can change the type of trend line so

104

00:02:05.420  -->  00:02:05.430

105

00:02:05.430  -->  00:02:07.700
if you you select a polynomial you can

106

00:02:07.700  -->  00:02:07.710

107

00:02:07.710  -->  00:02:09.469
select the number of degrees in your

108

00:02:09.469  -->  00:02:09.479

109

00:02:09.479  -->  00:02:10.760
polynom

110

00:02:10.760  -->  00:02:10.770

111

00:02:10.770  -->  00:02:12.260
but we're not going to do that we're

112

00:02:12.260  -->  00:02:12.270

113

00:02:12.270  -->  00:02:14.810
going to keep it linear then include the

114

00:02:14.810  -->  00:02:14.820

115

00:02:14.820  -->  00:02:17.450
fields that were using as factors so in

116

00:02:17.450  -->  00:02:17.460

117

00:02:17.460  -->  00:02:19.130
this case we're only using one field so

118

00:02:19.130  -->  00:02:19.140

119

00:02:19.140  -->  00:02:22.010
state so we have a different trend line

120

00:02:22.010  -->  00:02:22.020

121

00:02:22.020  -->  00:02:23.840
for every state if we uncheck that then

122

00:02:23.840  -->  00:02:23.850

123

00:02:23.850  -->  00:02:26.090
the trend line will be the same across

124

00:02:26.090  -->  00:02:26.100

125

00:02:26.100  -->  00:02:28.190
all of the data sets like it looks

126

00:02:28.190  -->  00:02:28.200

127

00:02:28.200  -->  00:02:29.840
different but that's because the axis

128

00:02:29.840  -->  00:02:29.850

129

00:02:29.850  -->  00:02:31.760
are not aligned so if I right click and

130

00:02:31.760  -->  00:02:31.770

131

00:02:31.770  -->  00:02:34.280
click edit access and I say uniform

132

00:02:34.280  -->  00:02:34.290

133

00:02:34.290  -->  00:02:35.930
range and then you'll see that it's

134

00:02:35.930  -->  00:02:35.940

135

00:02:35.940  -->  00:02:37.490
exactly the same trend line in every

136

00:02:37.490  -->  00:02:37.500

137

00:02:37.500  -->  00:02:40.430
single case and that's because it's not

138

00:02:40.430  -->  00:02:40.440

139

00:02:40.440  -->  00:02:45.950
being calculated at every single row or

140

00:02:45.950  -->  00:02:45.960

141

00:02:45.960  -->  00:02:48.020
every single one of these states but

142

00:02:48.020  -->  00:02:48.030

143

00:02:48.030  -->  00:02:49.910
it's actually being calculated overall

144

00:02:49.910  -->  00:02:49.920

145

00:02:49.920  -->  00:02:52.940
for all of them all together so let's go

146

00:02:52.940  -->  00:02:52.950

147

00:02:52.950  -->  00:02:56.990
ahead and change that back. So it's state

148

00:02:56.990  -->  00:02:57.000

149

00:02:57.000  -->  00:02:58.430
here so when you have multiple fields

150

00:02:58.430  -->  00:02:58.440

151

00:02:58.440  -->  00:03:00.050
here you can select you can select some

152

00:03:00.050  -->  00:03:00.060

153

00:03:00.060  -->  00:03:01.790
of them if you don't want that level of

154

00:03:01.790  -->  00:03:01.800

155

00:03:01.800  -->  00:03:03.830
granularity in the calculation of your

156

00:03:03.830  -->  00:03:03.840

157

00:03:03.840  -->  00:03:05.570
trend line which can be useful

158

00:03:05.570  -->  00:03:05.580

159

00:03:05.580  -->  00:03:06.590
sometimes.

160

00:03:06.590  -->  00:03:06.600

161

00:03:06.600  -->  00:03:10.610
Alright so there we go, that's the proper

162

00:03:10.610  -->  00:03:10.620

163

00:03:10.620  -->  00:03:12.710
trendlines now let's go ahead trendlines

164

00:03:12.710  -->  00:03:12.720

165

00:03:12.720  -->  00:03:14.360
what else do we have here? A lot of trend

166

00:03:14.360  -->  00:03:14.370

167

00:03:14.370  -->  00:03:16.430
line per color-changing is one too much

168

00:03:16.430  -->  00:03:16.440

169

00:03:16.440  -->  00:03:19.010
because we already have this this color

170

00:03:19.010  -->  00:03:19.020

171

00:03:19.020  -->  00:03:22.130
is in state so this is more for when you

172

00:03:22.130  -->  00:03:22.140

173

00:03:22.140  -->  00:03:27.650
have multiple lines on one chart, so let

174

00:03:27.650  -->  00:03:27.660

175

00:03:27.660  -->  00:03:29.270
may give you an example. So let's say I

176

00:03:29.270  -->  00:03:29.280

177

00:03:29.280  -->  00:03:31.010
don't have state here but I have state

178

00:03:31.010  -->  00:03:31.020

179

00:03:31.020  -->  00:03:32.600
in color and as you can see there's a

180

00:03:32.600  -->  00:03:32.610

181

00:03:32.610  -->  00:03:34.880
trend line for every single color. So if

182

00:03:34.880  -->  00:03:34.890

183

00:03:34.890  -->  00:03:38.600
i go to edit trend lines and I say

184

00:03:38.600  -->  00:03:38.610

185

00:03:38.610  -->  00:03:41.810
unselect not a trend line per color so

186

00:03:41.810  -->  00:03:41.820

187

00:03:41.820  -->  00:03:43.699
you can see what happens that all the

188

00:03:43.699  -->  00:03:43.709

189

00:03:43.709  -->  00:03:45.980
trendlines they get combined into one so

190

00:03:45.980  -->  00:03:45.990

191

00:03:45.990  -->  00:03:47.870
it's pretty much same as unchecking

192

00:03:47.870  -->  00:03:47.880

193

00:03:47.880  -->  00:03:50.540
state here but here is specifically

194

00:03:50.540  -->  00:03:50.550

195

00:03:50.550  -->  00:03:53.449
looking at the column that's responsible

196

00:03:53.449  -->  00:03:53.459

197

00:03:53.459  -->  00:03:55.730
for color so let's just control zed

198

00:03:55.730  -->  00:03:55.740

199

00:03:55.740  -->  00:03:57.770
that that a couple times.

200

00:03:57.770  -->  00:03:57.780

201

00:03:57.780  -->  00:04:01.130
Ok so as you can see the trend line here

202

00:04:01.130  -->  00:04:01.140

203

00:04:01.140  -->  00:04:03.199
has these confidence bands which are not

204

00:04:03.199  -->  00:04:03.209

205

00:04:03.209  -->  00:04:04.880
very helpful because since we've got

206

00:04:04.880  -->  00:04:04.890

207

00:04:04.890  -->  00:04:11.060
like such large spikes which are normal

208

00:04:11.060  -->  00:04:11.070

209

00:04:11.070  -->  00:04:12.800
these are seasonal spikes and of course

210

00:04:12.800  -->  00:04:12.810

211

00:04:12.810  -->  00:04:14.720
is going to be out of the confidence

212

00:04:14.720  -->  00:04:14.730

213

00:04:14.730  -->  00:04:17.420
band so what we want is we want to get

214

00:04:17.420  -->  00:04:17.430

215

00:04:17.430  -->  00:04:18.830
rid of these confidence bands they're

216

00:04:18.830  -->  00:04:18.840

217

00:04:18.840  -->  00:04:20.570
not really helping.

218

00:04:20.570  -->  00:04:20.580

219

00:04:20.580  -->  00:04:22.909
Let's go trend lines and get rid of them

220

00:04:22.909  -->  00:04:22.919

221

00:04:22.919  -->  00:04:24.330
is just taking up space and now you

222

00:04:24.330  -->  00:04:24.340

223

00:04:24.340  -->  00:04:25.800
see that trend lines that much better

224

00:04:25.800  -->  00:04:25.810

225

00:04:25.810  -->  00:04:28.950
more legible like that and the last

226

00:04:28.950  -->  00:04:28.960

227

00:04:28.960  -->  00:04:30.629
option that we have here is show

228

00:04:30.629  -->  00:04:30.639

229

00:04:30.639  -->  00:04:32.820
recalculate line for highlighted or

230

00:04:32.820  -->  00:04:32.830

231

00:04:32.830  -->  00:04:35.310
select data points. So let's keep that on

232

00:04:35.310  -->  00:04:35.320

233

00:04:35.320  -->  00:04:37.320
and I will show you how that can

234

00:04:37.320  -->  00:04:37.330

235

00:04:37.330  -->  00:04:39.060
sometimes be useful.

236

00:04:39.060  -->  00:04:39.070

237

00:04:39.070  -->  00:04:41.969
Let's click OK and right-click our axis

238

00:04:41.969  -->  00:04:41.979

239

00:04:41.979  -->  00:04:45.390
and change it to independent axis for

240

00:04:45.390  -->  00:04:45.400

241

00:04:45.400  -->  00:04:49.980
each row column and now let's see what

242

00:04:49.980  -->  00:04:49.990

243

00:04:49.990  -->  00:04:52.680
that option does so what I'll do is once

244

00:04:52.680  -->  00:04:52.690

245

00:04:52.690  -->  00:04:55.200
I select few data points it will recreate the

246

00:04:55.200  -->  00:04:55.210

247

00:04:55.210  -->  00:04:56.430
trend line so you can see that second

248

00:04:56.430  -->  00:04:56.440

249

00:04:56.440  -->  00:04:59.070
trend line up hearing over there and

250

00:04:59.070  -->  00:04:59.080

251

00:04:59.080  -->  00:05:00.210
just for the ones that I've highlighted

252

00:05:00.210  -->  00:05:00.220

253

00:05:00.220  -->  00:05:02.909
or selected and how can that be useful?

254

00:05:02.909  -->  00:05:02.919

255

00:05:02.919  -->  00:05:05.159
Well this is the overall trend for past

256

00:05:05.159  -->  00:05:05.169

257

00:05:05.169  -->  00:05:07.469
15 years in each state for this industry

258

00:05:07.469  -->  00:05:07.479

259

00:05:07.479  -->  00:05:10.740
and let's say I want to see how this

260

00:05:10.740  -->  00:05:10.750

261

00:05:10.750  -->  00:05:14.730
trend has changed in the past five years

262

00:05:14.730  -->  00:05:14.740

263

00:05:14.740  -->  00:05:17.370
or let's say yeah let's say five years

264

00:05:17.370  -->  00:05:17.380

265

00:05:17.380  -->  00:05:23.010
so so they'll be 2015, 14, 13, 12 and 11. So

266

00:05:23.010  -->  00:05:23.020

267

00:05:23.020  -->  00:05:25.379
let's find where 2011 starts so that's

268

00:05:25.379  -->  00:05:25.389

269

00:05:25.389  -->  00:05:27.600
over there and let's just select all the

270

00:05:27.600  -->  00:05:27.610

271

00:05:27.610  -->  00:05:30.180
data points in the past five years and

272

00:05:30.180  -->  00:05:30.190

273

00:05:30.190  -->  00:05:32.610
as you can see the trend is steeper here

274

00:05:32.610  -->  00:05:32.620

275

00:05:32.620  -->  00:05:36.180
so the trend is accelerating and we were

276

00:05:36.180  -->  00:05:36.190

277

00:05:36.190  -->  00:05:38.760
able to very quickly identify that so we

278

00:05:38.760  -->  00:05:38.770

279

00:05:38.770  -->  00:05:40.200
don't have to recreate are visually in

280

00:05:40.200  -->  00:05:40.210

281

00:05:40.210  -->  00:05:42.089
any sort of way we can see right away

282

00:05:42.089  -->  00:05:42.099

283

00:05:42.099  -->  00:05:44.370
just by selecting these data points we

284

00:05:44.370  -->  00:05:44.380

285

00:05:44.380  -->  00:05:46.140
can see that this is the previous trend

286

00:05:46.140  -->  00:05:46.150

287

00:05:46.150  -->  00:05:49.200
and this is the new trend and it is a

288

00:05:49.200  -->  00:05:49.210

289

00:05:49.210  -->  00:05:51.180
much steeper so meaning that this

290

00:05:51.180  -->  00:05:51.190

291

00:05:51.190  -->  00:05:53.760
industry is accelerating the growth is

292

00:05:53.760  -->  00:05:53.770

293

00:05:53.770  -->  00:05:56.010
increasing in and in the past five years

294

00:05:56.010  -->  00:05:56.020

295

00:05:56.020  -->  00:05:58.379
the growth has been much more

296

00:05:58.379  -->  00:05:58.389

297

00:05:58.389  -->  00:06:01.680
significant than it has generally being

298

00:06:01.680  -->  00:06:01.690

299

00:06:01.690  -->  00:06:04.500
over the past 15 years.

300

00:06:04.500  -->  00:06:04.510

301

00:06:04.510  -->  00:06:07.500
Another example let's look at Queensland

302

00:06:07.500  -->  00:06:07.510

303

00:06:07.510  -->  00:06:11.129
so if we highlight these data points you

304

00:06:11.129  -->  00:06:11.139

305

00:06:11.139  -->  00:06:15.600
can see that the trend is less deeper

306

00:06:15.600  -->  00:06:15.610

307

00:06:15.610  -->  00:06:18.240
than the trend for the past 15 years so

308

00:06:18.240  -->  00:06:18.250

309

00:06:18.250  -->  00:06:19.860
meaning that this industry in this state

310

00:06:19.860  -->  00:06:19.870

311

00:06:19.870  -->  00:06:23.430
has probably been slowing down. You can

312

00:06:23.430  -->  00:06:23.440

313

00:06:23.440  -->  00:06:25.320
select more circumspect bit more years

314

00:06:25.320  -->  00:06:25.330

315

00:06:25.330  -->  00:06:28.230
from 2007 it's pretty much it's about

316

00:06:28.230  -->  00:06:28.240

317

00:06:28.240  -->  00:06:29.850
the same but if you start from

318

00:06:29.850  -->  00:06:29.860

319

00:06:29.860  -->  00:06:34.260
2005 you can see that is a even steeper

320

00:06:34.260  -->  00:06:34.270

321

00:06:34.270  -->  00:06:36.930
decline here because there's a like a

322

00:06:36.930  -->  00:06:36.940

323

00:06:36.940  -->  00:06:37.620
significant

324

00:06:37.620  -->  00:06:37.630

325

00:06:37.630  -->  00:06:39.300
growth in the industry in these years

326

00:06:39.300  -->  00:06:39.310

327

00:06:39.310  -->  00:06:42.570
and then it started to drop off. So

328

00:06:42.570  -->  00:06:42.580

329

00:06:42.580  -->  00:06:44.520
that's how this feature can be helpful

330

00:06:44.520  -->  00:06:44.530

331

00:06:44.530  -->  00:06:48.450
when you're selecting different subsets

332

00:06:48.450  -->  00:06:48.460

333

00:06:48.460  -->  00:06:49.830
of your data sometimes it might not

334

00:06:49.830  -->  00:06:49.840

335

00:06:49.840  -->  00:06:51.480
be helpful so then you switch it off but

336

00:06:51.480  -->  00:06:51.490

337

00:06:51.490  -->  00:06:52.560
in this case we're going to leave it on

338

00:06:52.560  -->  00:06:52.570

339

00:06:52.570  -->  00:06:54.450
because that might be something that we

340

00:06:54.450  -->  00:06:54.460

341

00:06:54.460  -->  00:06:56.070
might want to report in our analysis

342

00:06:56.070  -->  00:06:56.080

343

00:06:56.080  -->  00:06:57.600
might be something useful.

344

00:06:57.600  -->  00:06:57.610

345

00:06:57.610  -->  00:07:00.390
Alright so we can see some preliminary

346

00:07:00.390  -->  00:07:00.400

347

00:07:00.400  -->  00:07:05.370
kind of conclusion, so maybe you might be

348

00:07:05.370  -->  00:07:05.380

349

00:07:05.380  -->  00:07:08.730
able to include this in your analysis as

350

00:07:08.730  -->  00:07:08.740

351

00:07:08.740  -->  00:07:10.980
is you might say okay so then just this

352

00:07:10.980  -->  00:07:10.990

353

00:07:10.990  -->  00:07:14.430
industry is growing. This industry is

354

00:07:14.430  -->  00:07:14.440

355

00:07:14.440  -->  00:07:17.850
kind of growing slower. This industry or

356

00:07:17.850  -->  00:07:17.860

357

00:07:17.860  -->  00:07:20.580
sorry this state in Victoria's is

358

00:07:20.580  -->  00:07:20.590

359

00:07:20.590  -->  00:07:22.680
growing even faster by the looks of it

360

00:07:22.680  -->  00:07:22.690

361

00:07:22.690  -->  00:07:24.600
and so on but the thing that we're not

362

00:07:24.600  -->  00:07:24.610

363

00:07:24.610  -->  00:07:27.120
taking into account here is that these

364

00:07:27.120  -->  00:07:27.130

365

00:07:27.130  -->  00:07:29.460
states have different populations right?

366

00:07:29.460  -->  00:07:29.470

367

00:07:29.470  -->  00:07:32.700
So you can see the turnover here is 600

368

00:07:32.700  -->  00:07:32.710

369

00:07:32.710  -->  00:07:35.070
million so that the turnover ranges up

370

00:07:35.070  -->  00:07:35.080

371

00:07:35.080  -->  00:07:39.090
to 600 million plus here is 300 million

372

00:07:39.090  -->  00:07:39.100

373

00:07:39.100  -->  00:07:41.940
plus and 600 million, 150

374

00:07:41.940  -->  00:07:41.950

375

00:07:41.950  -->  00:07:44.940
million but that is also partially

376

00:07:44.940  -->  00:07:44.950

377

00:07:44.950  -->  00:07:47.490
attributed to or in largely attributed

378

00:07:47.490  -->  00:07:47.500

379

00:07:47.500  -->  00:07:49.470
to the fact that the population of these

380

00:07:49.470  -->  00:07:49.480

381

00:07:49.480  -->  00:07:51.450
states is different. So New South Wales

382

00:07:51.450  -->  00:07:51.460

383

00:07:51.460  -->  00:07:53.370
has a lot of people,

384

00:07:53.370  -->  00:07:53.380

385

00:07:53.380  -->  00:07:54.690
Victoria is also a large state,

386

00:07:54.690  -->  00:07:54.700

387

00:07:54.700  -->  00:07:57.360
Queensland is a bit small than Australia is

388

00:07:57.360  -->  00:07:57.370

389

00:07:57.370  -->  00:08:00.000
also a small, smaller state compared to

390

00:08:00.000  -->  00:08:00.010

391

00:08:00.010  -->  00:08:03.630
these other ones. So how do we account

392

00:08:03.630  -->  00:08:03.640

393

00:08:03.640  -->  00:08:05.190
for population?

394

00:08:05.190  -->  00:08:05.200

395

00:08:05.200  -->  00:08:07.560
Well we need to connect to our

396

00:08:07.560  -->  00:08:07.570

397

00:08:07.570  -->  00:08:09.330
population data and of course we

398

00:08:09.330  -->  00:08:09.340

399

00:08:09.340  -->  00:08:11.070
could just take the average population

400

00:08:11.070  -->  00:08:11.080

401

00:08:11.080  -->  00:08:13.830
for in-state for those years and just

402

00:08:13.830  -->  00:08:13.840

403

00:08:13.840  -->  00:08:15.810
divide this number by that population

404

00:08:15.810  -->  00:08:15.820

405

00:08:15.820  -->  00:08:18.720
and get the like a proxy for per capital

406

00:08:18.720  -->  00:08:18.730

407

00:08:18.730  -->  00:08:21.180
consumption but really population also

408

00:08:21.180  -->  00:08:21.190

409

00:08:21.190  -->  00:08:22.980
grows population also changes over time

410

00:08:22.980  -->  00:08:22.990

411

00:08:22.990  -->  00:08:26.190
and perhaps there's a

412

00:08:26.190  -->  00:08:26.200

413

00:08:26.200  -->  00:08:27.720
chance that this trend that we're seeing

414

00:08:27.720  -->  00:08:27.730

415

00:08:27.730  -->  00:08:30.210
is increase is actually not only

416

00:08:30.210  -->  00:08:30.220

417

00:08:30.220  -->  00:08:31.890
because people are consuming more but

418

00:08:31.890  -->  00:08:31.900

419

00:08:31.900  -->  00:08:35.310
also because the population is growing

420

00:08:35.310  -->  00:08:35.320

421

00:08:35.320  -->  00:08:37.230
so people there are more people and

422

00:08:37.230  -->  00:08:37.240

423

00:08:37.240  -->  00:08:38.700
therefore were all they're consuming

424

00:08:38.700  -->  00:08:38.710

425

00:08:38.710  -->  00:08:40.560
more maybe on average people are

426

00:08:40.560  -->  00:08:40.570

427

00:08:40.570  -->  00:08:43.920
consuming less and that is something we

428

00:08:43.920  -->  00:08:43.930

429

00:08:43.930  -->  00:08:46.230
also need to investigate so we want to

430

00:08:46.230  -->  00:08:46.240

431

00:08:46.240  -->  00:08:49.230
take the trend for population and then

432

00:08:49.230  -->  00:08:49.240

433

00:08:49.240  -->  00:08:50.310
divide the trend

434

00:08:50.310  -->  00:08:50.320

435

00:08:50.320  -->  00:08:52.770
and for this industry by the trend by

436

00:08:52.770  -->  00:08:52.780

437

00:08:52.780  -->  00:08:56.280
the population so to speak to get the

438

00:08:56.280  -->  00:08:56.290

439

00:08:56.290  -->  00:08:58.500
figures. So the per capita consumption

440

00:08:58.500  -->  00:08:58.510

441

00:08:58.510  -->  00:09:01.470
how it is changing so that way we're

442

00:09:01.470  -->  00:09:01.480

443

00:09:01.480  -->  00:09:03.930
kind of going to normalize our data

444

00:09:03.930  -->  00:09:03.940

445

00:09:03.940  -->  00:09:06.630
and then we'll be able to compare the

446

00:09:06.630  -->  00:09:06.640

447

00:09:06.640  -->  00:09:07.980
states against each other. Right now we

448

00:09:07.980  -->  00:09:07.990

449

00:09:07.990  -->  00:09:09.390
can't really compare them because they

450

00:09:09.390  -->  00:09:09.400

451

00:09:09.400  -->  00:09:10.770
have a different number of people, the people

452

00:09:10.770  -->  00:09:10.780

453

00:09:10.780  -->  00:09:13.410
are kind might be consuming in different

454

00:09:13.410  -->  00:09:13.420

455

00:09:13.420  -->  00:09:15.360
rates. Populations are growing in

456

00:09:15.360  -->  00:09:15.370

457

00:09:15.370  -->  00:09:17.310
different rates but once we normalize it

458

00:09:17.310  -->  00:09:17.320

459

00:09:17.320  -->  00:09:19.680
so we divide every data point by the

460

00:09:19.680  -->  00:09:19.690

461

00:09:19.690  -->  00:09:22.650
associated population and then we get

462

00:09:22.650  -->  00:09:22.660

463

00:09:22.660  -->  00:09:24.900
how the per capita consumption is

464

00:09:24.900  -->  00:09:24.910

465

00:09:24.910  -->  00:09:27.450
changing in each state then we'll be

466

00:09:27.450  -->  00:09:27.460

467

00:09:27.460  -->  00:09:30.930
able to identify in which industry in

468

00:09:30.930  -->  00:09:30.940

469

00:09:30.940  -->  00:09:33.270
which state this industry is growing the

470

00:09:33.270  -->  00:09:33.280

471

00:09:33.280  -->  00:09:35.490
fastest. So not just which state is

472

00:09:35.490  -->  00:09:35.500

473

00:09:35.500  -->  00:09:37.530
growing the fastest which pop which

474

00:09:37.530  -->  00:09:37.540

475

00:09:37.540  -->  00:09:40.140
states population is growing fastest but

476

00:09:40.140  -->  00:09:40.150

477

00:09:40.150  -->  00:09:41.610
we're going to take that out of the

478

00:09:41.610  -->  00:09:41.620

479

00:09:41.620  -->  00:09:44.250
equation we're going to eliminate how

480

00:09:44.250  -->  00:09:44.260

481

00:09:44.260  -->  00:09:46.860
popular changes in population and we're

482

00:09:46.860  -->  00:09:46.870

483

00:09:46.870  -->  00:09:48.960
going to actually see alright so in

484

00:09:48.960  -->  00:09:48.970

485

00:09:48.970  -->  00:09:51.990
which of these states are people willing

486

00:09:51.990  -->  00:09:52.000

487

00:09:52.000  -->  00:09:53.820
to spend more in this industry and

488

00:09:53.820  -->  00:09:53.830

489

00:09:53.830  -->  00:09:55.050
that's important because that's what we

490

00:09:55.050  -->  00:09:55.060

491

00:09:55.060  -->  00:09:57.540
want to get to the bottom of that's our

492

00:09:57.540  -->  00:09:57.550

493

00:09:57.550  -->  00:10:00.210
goal. We want to see which in which state

494

00:10:00.210  -->  00:10:00.220

495

00:10:00.220  -->  00:10:02.940
has the biggest potential for this

496

00:10:02.940  -->  00:10:02.950

497

00:10:02.950  -->  00:10:05.100
industry. So where are people spending

498

00:10:05.100  -->  00:10:05.110

499

00:10:05.110  -->  00:10:07.470
more and more and more and more so where

500

00:10:07.470  -->  00:10:07.480

501

00:10:07.480  -->  00:10:09.780
is this industry growing the fastest not

502

00:10:09.780  -->  00:10:09.790

503

00:10:09.790  -->  00:10:10.680
anything else.

504

00:10:10.680  -->  00:10:10.690

505

00:10:10.690  -->  00:10:13.350
Alright so that's why we need to get to

506

00:10:13.350  -->  00:10:13.360

507

00:10:13.360  -->  00:10:15.060
per capita consumption because it will

508

00:10:15.060  -->  00:10:15.070

509

00:10:15.070  -->  00:10:17.010
give us a more insights more relevant

510

00:10:17.010  -->  00:10:17.020

511

00:10:17.020  -->  00:10:19.740
insights to our challenge and therefore

512

00:10:19.740  -->  00:10:19.750

513

00:10:19.750  -->  00:10:21.240
we're going to need to connect to our

514

00:10:21.240  -->  00:10:21.250

515

00:10:21.250  -->  00:10:24.600
next data set which is the population

516

00:10:24.600  -->  00:10:24.610

517

00:10:24.610  -->  00:10:27.630
growth and statistics on population and

518

00:10:27.630  -->  00:10:27.640

519

00:10:27.640  -->  00:10:29.880
we'll do that in the next tutorial. I

520

00:10:29.880  -->  00:10:29.890

521

00:10:29.890  -->  00:10:31.110
look forward to seeing you next time.

522

00:10:31.110  -->  00:10:31.120

523

00:10:31.120  -->  00:10:37.680
Until then, happy analyzing.
