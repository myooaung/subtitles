00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.950
Welcome back everyone to your challenge tasks for these select where statement.

2
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.290
We just learned how to combine the select clause which allows us to grab columns along with the where

3
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.020
statement which allows us to actually specify conditions based off those columns using logical operators

4
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.770
and comparison operators.

5
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.720
So we have just three quick tasks to make sure you understood everything something I want to point out

6
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.090
though is that we now know enough to answer more realistic business questions and tasks instead of just

7
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.910
directly asking for specific sequel tasks.

8
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.920
So from now on the challenges we're going to try our best to focus more on directly asking the business

9
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.370
related questions to more realistically model a typical task you would see as a sequel developer in

10
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.230
a real world workplace.

11
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.560
So what I mean by that is from now on our challenge examples will focus more on something like how many

12
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.720
customers have the first named Gerard.

13
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.180
Instead of asking a question such as you select where to find Gerard in the first name column in the

14
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.260
customer table.

15
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.320
So we're going to focus much more on trying to have you build the skills of translating a business question

16
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.320
or business related task to an actual sequel query since that's really where a lot of the work takes

17
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.920
place.

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.590
OK one last thing.

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.390
Keep in mind is that as you continue to learn more about sequel especially now that we're kind of past

20
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.770
this hump of the Select where statement you're going to soon realize there are usually many different

21
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.800
ways to arrive at the same solution.

22
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.910
So you should be verifying your work mainly against the expected result instead of our example sequel

23
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.540
solution since your sequel solution may begin to vary just a little bit from ours.

24
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.920
But as long as you're getting the same expected result then you're totally OK so let's get started.

25
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.490
So we'll go over the business situation and question.

26
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.930
Sure you'd expect the result.

27
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.740
So show you some hints if you need them and then show you our solution so the first challenge a customer

28
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.560
forgot their wallet at our store and we need to track down their email to inform them.

29
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.740
So the question is what is the e-mail for the customer with the name Nancy Thomas.

30
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.060
So we open up the wallet.

31
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.290
We see that their name is Nancy Thomas and we want to figure out what is the e-mail so we can inform

32
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.930
them OK.

33
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.060
Coming up next as the expected result so the expected answer should look something like this.

34
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.320
You should eventually realize it's Nancy that Thomas secure customer dot org.

35
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.370
OK here come some hints if you need them so the hints are to use the customer table.

36
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.920
You should also make sure the capitalization and spelling of the names is correct.

37
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.250
You may need to use and to combine conditions for the first and last name and make sure to use single

38
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.670
quotes around the string.

39
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.710
Here comes the solution so our solution for challenge number one was to select the e-mail column from

40
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.340
the customer table where first name is equal to Nancy.

41
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.270
And last name is equal to Thomas.

42
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.320
If you take a closer look at that customer table you'll realize that there's actually only one person

43
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.500
with the first name Nancy and that means you could just technically go off the first name but realistically

44
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.960
you want to make sure to go off first name and last name.

45
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.580
And luckily for us there's only one person named Nancy Thomas in our database stuff would definitely

46
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.990
get more challenging if we had multiple Nancy Thomases which means we probably have to send multiple

47
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.640
emails.

48
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.590
OK.

49
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.410
Here comes Challenge number two.

50
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.440
So a customer wants to know what the movie outlaw hanky is about.

51
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.350
Could you give them the description for the movie outlaw hanky.

52
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.130
OK.

53
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.780
Here comes the expected result so they expect the answer is this description which is kind of wacky

54
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.750
but outlaw Key is a thoughtful story of an astronaut and a composer who must conquer a dog in the Sahara

55
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.110
desert.

56
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.440
All right.

57
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.710
So here come some hints in case you need them hints for Challenge number two is to use the film table.

58
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.450
Make sure the capitalization and spelling and spacing of the movie name is correct in case you're getting

59
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.430
an error on that.

60
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.470
And make sure to use single quotes around the string.

61
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.220
Here comes our example solution so here would just select the description column from film table where

62
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.100
title is equal to outlaw hanky.

63
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.660
You have to make sure that capitalization is correct.

64
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.190
Since it will actually check for capitalization matching up OK here comes your next and last challenge

65
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.410
for this little lecture so challenge number three is a customer is late on their movie Return and we've

66
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.040
mailed them a letter to their address at 2 5 9 IPO drive and we should also call them on the phone to

67
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.790
let them know.

68
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.940
So we want to do is can you get us the phone number for the customer who lives at this address of 2

69
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.460
5 9 IPO drive all right.

70
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.590
Here comes the expected result so the expected answer for Challenge Number Three should be this phone

71
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.670
number here.

72
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.810
Here comes some hints in case you need them so he should be using the address table.

73
00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.030
Make sure to capitalization and spelling of the address is correct and use single quotes around the

74
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.450
string and finally here's the solution.

75
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.360
The solution is simply select PHONE FROM address WHERE address is equal to 2 5 9 IPO drive.

76
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.670
Something to keep in mind here is that the table can't share a name with the column.

77
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.190
So notice here that the column is address as well as a table name is address so don't get too confused

78
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.500
here thinking it's referring to the same thing.

79
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.900
The from is asking for the address table.

80
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.140
The where is addressing the address column.

81
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.550
All right that's it for your select where challenges and I'll see you at the next lecture.
