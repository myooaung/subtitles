Welcome everyone to this lecture on right joins a right join is essentially exact same thing as a left

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:20,440
join or LEFT OUTER JOIN except that the tables are switched and often beginners get confused when first

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,150
starting to learn sequel especially when they hit that left outer join which is the most difficult joint

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,100
to learn about because it's asymmetrical and then suddenly they're introduced to this concept of a right

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,710
join.

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,470
And students often get confused because it seems like the right join is a completely different thing.

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,780
But the reason I don't want to dwell on it too much is because a right join is essentially the exact

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,120
same thing as the Left Join except you just switch the tables around.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,510
So this would be the exact same thing as switching the table order in a left outer join and in fact

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,150
you can pretty much go on just using a left join for two tables and just switching up the order of the

11
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,120
tables in order to satisfy whatever need you have.

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,580
So it really depends on how you think about the tables and what order they come in in your mind whether

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,550
table A is on the left.

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,770
Table B's on the right or if table B's on the left and table is on the right sort of quickly show you

15
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,130
some examples three Venn diagram so a right outer join.

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,650
Notice this looks a lot like a left out or join except it's just flipped along the axes.

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,120
So we're saying select everything from table A A RIGHT OUTER JOIN ON TABLE B where A table has a column

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,140
match equal to Table B.

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,530
So what this is saying is essentially the exact reverse of a left join.

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,440
And what they're saying is return back rows that can be found either exclusively in Table B or in both

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,550
table B and table a and do not return back rows that are exclusively only found in Table A.

22
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,460
Notice how this would have been the exact same thing as a left join.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,370
Had we just switched around the table order.

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:54,910
OK.

25
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,300
So again this is pretty much the exact same thing as a left join except you're switching those tables

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,260
around and you can actually get back these same results by doing a left join and selecting first from

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,070
Table B with the left join on table a.

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,470
So keep in mind really the right outer join is just to help you keep the same tables in the same order

29
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,550
in your mind of tables on the left and table B's on the right.

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,780
But switching up the results you get and keep in mind you can do either right outer join or right join.

31
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,570
They both work fine and just like we could have a left outer join.

32
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,770
You can also add a clarifying where statement to say something like where table a that I.D. is null

33
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,830
in order to clarify they only want tables that can be found exclusively in Table B and are not found

34
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,210
in table a okay.

35
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,480
So it's really up to you and how you how the tables organize quote unquote in your mind when it comes

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,610
to choosing a left versus a right join since depending on the table order you specifying the join you

37
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,950
could perform duplicate joins with either method.

38
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:06,290
So if two tables can be joined and you can get results with a left outer join you should also be able

39
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,110
to get the exact same results if a right outer join or right join by switching the table order and playing

40
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,700
around with that table ordering or playing around of any table ordering in the where results depending

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:23,660
on the exact query you're doing so really take your time to understand the left outer join extremely

42
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:31,640
well and then if you want you can begin to use the right join if the moment calls for it or if you want

43
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,520
you can always just stick to left join and switch around the table order there.

44
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,360
OK so again hopefully if you understand left outer join well enough you can see how right outer join

45
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,640
IS REALLY THE BROTHER OR SISTER OF LEFT JOIN.

46
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,830
You're just kind of flipping that and just keeping the table or do the same in the query itself but

47
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,870
flipping the results around and if you wanted to you could just flip the tables in the query in order

48
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,270
to keep the left join call and I'll have to switch to a right join call so take your time with these

49
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,950
two slides.

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,880
This pretty much just answers the question of what a right join IS and if these slides are confusing

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,530
to you they need to go back and really take your time to review the left join a left outer join.

52
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,600
Because once you understand that really well then these two slides should be very clear in the fact

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,780
that it's just the left join with the tables flipped.

54
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,370
Okay thanks.

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,900
And I will see you at the next lecture.
