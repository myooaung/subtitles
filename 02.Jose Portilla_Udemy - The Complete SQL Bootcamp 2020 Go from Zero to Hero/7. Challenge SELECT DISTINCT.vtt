Welcome back everyone to this quick challenge to test your skills on SELECT DISTINCT calls.

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.530
We'll go over an example situation correspond that to a sequel challenge then show the expected results.

3
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.990
And if you need them we'll show you hints.

4
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.310
And the solution to the situation is we have a visitor who isn't from the USA They're from Australia

5
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.980
and so they're not familiar with the Motion Picture Association of America's movie rating system such

6
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.730
as PDP 13 are et cetera.

7
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.820
So you need to know what are the types of ratings we have in our database.

8
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.120
So what ratings do we have available.

9
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.250
See if you can actually change that question and correspond it to the correct sequel challenge.

10
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.680
OK so the sequel challenges usually learned about select the stink to retrieve the distinct rating types

11
00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.610
are films could have in our database coming up next is the expect the solution or expected result so

12
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.710
the expected result should look something like this.

13
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.300
It may not be in this exact order but you should get the ratings G P G P G 13 R and NC 17 OK.

14
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.030
Here are some hints if you need them so the hints are to use the film table and you can use select Asterix

15
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.460
from film to see what columns are available or use the dropdown table menu and P.G. admin to see what

16
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.660
the appropriate columnist actually query from the film table.

17
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.650
Coming up next.

18
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.910
Is the solution so the solution is actually very simple just select distinct rating from film.

19
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.500
OK.

20
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.380
And you can go ahead and run that in PGI.

21
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.700
I mean if you want to just run the solution for yourself.

22
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.900
OK.

23
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.880
Coming up next we're going to start talking about one of the most useful sequel fundamentals which is

24
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670
the Select where statement.

25
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.260
I'll see you there.
