00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,320
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:13,210
In this lecture we're going to give you some challenge tasks that focus on the having class as always

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,450
we have the challenge the expected result.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,900
Some hints in case you need them.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,280
And then the solution.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,610
Let's get started.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,570
We are launching a platinum service for our most loyal customers.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,800
We will assign platinum status to customers that have had 40 or more transaction payments.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,600
What customer I.D. are eligible for platinum status okay.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,650
Here comes the expected result so the expected results are these three customer I.D. And if you want

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,270
You can also show how many transactions they had.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,850
We can see here that there's three people that have had 40 or more transactions.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,020
Here are some hints in case you need them so the hint is to use the payment table and to recall that

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,060
any column can be passed into account.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,600
Call.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,260
Coming up next there's a solution so the solution pretty straightforward here.

17
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,330
We're going to select the customer I.D. and then we're going to count and you can either pass in a column

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,560
here specific to the amount or just pass an asterisk.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,580
And then we're gonna grab this from the payment table group by the customer I.D. and then we're going

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,490
to say having a count greater than or equal to 40 essentially answering a question that they've had

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,250
40 or more payment rows associated with that particular customer I.D. thus earning them that platinum

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,650
status.

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,140
All right your next challenge is to answer the following.

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,000
What are the customer I.D. of customers who have spent more than one hundred dollars in payment transactions

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,540
with our staff by the member number two.

26
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,940
Again that's customer I.D. of people who have spent more than one hundred dollars in payment transactions

27
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,870
but only with the payment transactions that occurred with the staff I.D. member.

28
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:58,030
Number two here comes the expected result so there should be only five customers that have done this.

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,250
And then here's the associated sum.

30
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,110
So they're all over a hundred dollars here upcoming or some hints so the hint is to use the payment

31
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,410
table and to remember to use the where statement to first filter based on the staff I.D. column and

32
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,640
then use the group by clause.

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,620
And then finally let's see the solution so a solution.

34
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,580
Here we select the customer I.D. and we take this sum of the amount in order to calculate who has more

35
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,740
than a hundred dollars from the payment table.

36
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,350
We first however filter where staff I.D. is equal to two that way when we do the group buy on the customer

37
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:32,730
I.D..

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,710
We're only considering people where the actual payment transaction occurred with the staff I.D. equal

39
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,400
to two.

40
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,550
And then we check for having a sum amount of greater than 100.

41
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,140
All right.

42
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,060
And that's it for your challenge tasks.

43
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,080
I'll see you at the next lecture.
