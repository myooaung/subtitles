00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:11,170
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on the in operator in certain cases.

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,600
You want to check for multiple possible value options.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,460
For example if a user's name shows up in a list of known names.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,860
So instead of having to write a bunch of or statements such as name as equal to David or name is equal

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,000
declare or name is equal to Zach.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,300
We could use the in operator to just create a condition that quickly checks to see if the value is included

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,960
in a list of multiple options.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,640
So you can check something like We're name in Zach David and Claire.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,970
So the general syntax would be something like this value in and then a bunch of options.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:51,790
So for example an example query could be select the color column from table where color in red blue.

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,740
So note here that the options are in this little list in parentheses.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,990
And then we use the in operator to basically specify that we're checking for the color condition that

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,180
happens to be either red or blue.

14
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,640
These are bunch of or statements so anything red and anything blue will be returned to us and we can

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,720
always expand this to more options quickly so we can say now where the color is red or blue or green.

16
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,560
So essentially there's a little or statement in between all these.

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,910
Keep in mind you can also combine this with the not operator to essentially do this excluding these

18
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,260
values.

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,480
So our color is not in red or blue.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,670
So essentially every color that is not red or blue let's go ahead and quickly see some examples in P.G.

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:40,300
Adam here at the query Ed. I'm going to take a look at the payment column or a payment table.

22
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:47,620
Well it's just like everything from payments which limit this to zero so we can take a look at the result

23
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,630
here and notice we have an amount column.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,480
Let's first figure out what are the actual distinct values that are available to me in the amount column.

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:03,180
So what are the unique amounts that we're charging so we can say distinct amounts from payment and I'm

26
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,250
not going to limit this.

27
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,600
I want everything back.

28
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:13,020
I run this and I can say I have 10 8 and 9 1 any 9 etc. and what I could also do just for clarity is

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,730
order this by amount as we've seen before and I can order amount 0 ninety nine et cetera so maybe I

30
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:27,780
want to figure out all the orders that happen to be ninety nine cents one ninety eight and one ninety

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,050
nine.

32
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,690
So how could I do that.

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,510
Well what I could do is I could select any columns I want or everything from payment and then we'll

34
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:49,150
say where the amount is in and here we'll go ahead and specify ninety nine cents one ninety eight one

35
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,000
ninety nine.

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,100
Note here that I'm not using strings or quotes because there's a numeric data type.

37
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:03,150
So if we go ahead and run this we get back a bunch of values where the amounts happen to be in one in

38
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,090
a nine ninety nine cents or later on one ninety eight.

39
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,160
And if I wanted to figure out how many payments actually occurred that happened to be one of these three

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,430
values I could run this and I'll get back that there are three thousand three hundred one payments.

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,470
Now let's imagine I wanted the actual opposite information.

42
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:27,560
I wanted to count out how many payments were not 99 cents one dollar 98 cents or one ninety nine.

43
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,220
Well there's a couple of things I have to do here.

44
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,520
First notice here I'm going to have the parentheses of that list of options if I just add not in front

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,370
of this and run this then I get back the amount that is not in 99 cents one ninety eight and one ninety

46
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,010
nine.

47
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:52,460
So there's eleven thousand two hundred ninety five payments that are not these three values and let's

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,480
go ahead and explore this on a string column to finish this off.

49
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,540
We'll just say select everything from customer.

50
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,900
Take a quick look at this.

51
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,990
I have the first name and last name.

52
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:11,030
So let's go ahead and select all the columns from customer where the first name is in and let's just

53
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:19,360
give some options like John Jake and Julie we'll go ahead and run this.

54
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:24,090
And here I can see there was no one named Jake in this particular table but we did have a Julie.

55
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,190
And we did have a John.

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,920
OK so that's the way the operator works.

57
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,710
Main things keep in mind is that you're using parentheses here and then commas to separate out your

58
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,780
options and your options should be matching the general syntax of the column.

59
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,220
So we want to make sure that for numeric we're providing numerical analyst for strings for providing

60
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,210
these string of single quote strings here and we can always say not in if we wanted to see essentially

61
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,860
the exact opposite.

62
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,420
All right.

63
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,680
That's it for this lecture.

64
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,460
I'll see you at the next one.
