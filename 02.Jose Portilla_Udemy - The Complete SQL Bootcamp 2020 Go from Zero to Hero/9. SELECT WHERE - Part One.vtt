00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.030
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on the Select where statement in part one we're just going to

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.640
be learning the basic syntax structure and then in part two will actually jump over to P.G. admin and

3
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.610
code out some examples so they select and where statements are really the most fundamental sequel statements

4
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.510
and you're gonna find yourself using them in almost every sequel query you do.

5
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.840
So the where statement allows us to specify conditions on columns for the rows to be returned the basic

6
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.820
syntax would look something like this.

7
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.060
We decide on what columns we want back.

8
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.860
So we'll say select column one column two etc. and then we decide what table we want those columns from

9
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.840
and then after that we can describe conditions.

10
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.490
So we'll say where and then some manner of conditions.

11
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.700
So let's actually go into detail of what those conditions are like the WHERE clause appears immediately

12
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.310
after that from clause of the select statement and then the conditions are used to filter the rows returned

13
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.220
from the select statement and plus Chris equal provides a variety of standard operators to construct

14
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.290
those conditions.

15
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.130
And I want to make it clear that the conditions we show here are available in any major sequel engine.

16
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.380
So it's not just unique to postgrad sequel so we first have the comparison operators and the comparison

17
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.720
operators allow us to compare a column value to something essentially allowing us to answer questions

18
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.200
or queries such as a where's the price greater than three dollars or whereas the pet's name equal to

19
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.990
Sam.

20
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.350
So those kind of statements of greater than or equal to or less than those with the comparison operators

21
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.150
and you're probably familiar with the base syntax operators at least the operator syntax signs because

22
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.170
they're just basic math.

23
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.700
So for example if we want to check for equality we just use the equals sign.

24
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.530
Then we also have the greater than and less than sign the greater than equal to signs and then even

25
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.990
the not equal to.

26
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.850
And there's two ways of doing not equal to impose cross equal.

27
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.320
You can have a less than greater than sign right next to each other or the more common way is a new

28
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.040
exclamation mark and then equal sine.

29
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.120
In addition to those we have the logical operators and that allows us to combine multiple comparison

30
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.200
operators or affect comparison operators.

31
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.910
So you're also probably familiar if these ideas have and or not and they essentially allow you to use

32
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.130
multiple comparison operators you can do something like condition one has to be true and condition two

33
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.250
has to be true or condition one is true or condition to two is true and then you have the not operator

34
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.770
which essentially means the opposite of whatever condition you're specifying.

35
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.290
So where this condition is not true so it's actually walk through the very basic syntax of what this

36
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.210
would look like and we'll do this for the example table we saw before where we have some names and some

37
00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.450
color choices so in order to get back both columns from the table we could just say something like select

38
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.600
the name common choice columns from table.

39
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.810
So now let's try to get only the people named David.

40
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.410
So there's a condition there where I want the name column to be equal to the string.

41
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.500
DAVID So the way I do this as I say select the name column and the choice column from table where it

42
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.020
name is equal to David.

43
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.820
And note here plus Chris equal use single quotes in order to denote these strings and also more checking

44
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.490
for equality here the capitalization does matter also keep in mind that I selected both the name and

45
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.050
the choice column here.

46
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.910
I could if I wanted to just select the name column from table where names equal to David and then I

47
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.290
would just get back the entries on the name column.

48
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.170
So it's not terribly useful.

49
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.250
So keep in mind you're probably gonna ask for more than just a column where you're filtering these conditions

50
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:59.190
on just as asking for name and choice let's imagine I wanted to do multiple conditions so previously

51
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.570
I have to David's here where we have green and red I can use those logical operators such as the end

52
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.710
keyboard to test for multiple conditions.

53
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.650
So here I'm grabbing the name and choice column from this table where the name is equal to David and

54
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.790
the choice is equal to red returning back the single row where both those conditions have to be true.

55
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.990
OK let's go ahead and see you in the next lecture in part 2 or we jumped the PGI admin and worked through

56
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.920
a bunch of examples available to us inside the DVD rental database.

57
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.520
I'll see you there.
