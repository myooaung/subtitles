Welcome everyone to this lecture on views often.

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.410
There are specific combinations of tables and conditions that you find yourself using over and over

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.030
again for a project.

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.270
So instead of having to perform that same query again and again as a starting point and making sure

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.000
all your statements are correct then having to rewrite that syntax manually what you can do is you can

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.450
create a view that will allow you to quickly see the query which is a simple call as if it were a table

7
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.720
that already existed.

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.330
For example let's imagine that you have a database and you're working on a project that has something

9
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.520
to do if this database and as you're working on this project and writing reports you notice that there's

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.970
two tables that you're always joining together.

11
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.300
So you're always having to write this query of selecting these columns from these tables joined for

12
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.790
each other and so on now instead of having to rewrite that same query over and over again.

13
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.700
Well you can do is you can transform that into a view that way you can instead just say select everything

14
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.340
from The View and begin working from there.

15
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.730
So what a view is it's a database object that it's essentially just a stored query and a view can be

16
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.160
accessed as a virtual table in post press equal.

17
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.330
And the reason I call it a virtual table is that the view is not actually storing that data physically

18
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.040
in another part.

19
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.760
Instead it's simply storing the query in a way that allows you to easily execute that query as if you

20
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.670
were just selecting from an already existing table.

21
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.460
So essentially transforms a complex query that if you're going to use it over and over again just call

22
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460
it as if it was some table.

23
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.990
So we'll select that from The View OK.

24
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.920
So another important thing to note is that you can also update and alter existing views.

25
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.080
Let's explore these views and P.G. Adelman.

26
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.740
OK.

27
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.960
Here I am in P.G. admin.

28
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.850
I've created a new query editor and I have matrix to connect it to my DVD rental database since I'm

29
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.240
going to be using tables from the DVD rental database.

30
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.880
Let's imagine we're doing a project within our DVD rental store where we need to constantly be asking

31
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.940
information about the customer names and their addresses.

32
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.040
Well in that case I know if I select all the information from my customer table I can see I have a first

33
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.600
name and last name.

34
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.280
And if I keep scrolling down there's an address I.D. which corresponds to their entry in the address

35
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.760
table which if I search for this notice there's an address I.D. here and an address.

36
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:53.110
So let's go ahead and join these together so I'm going to say select the first name last name and address

37
00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:04.080
from and then we're going to select this from go ahead and select it from the customer table INNER JOIN

38
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:17.490
address on and we'll say customer the address I.D. is equal to make sure respond address correctly and

39
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.630
then we'll say address that address I.D..

40
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.000
So if we go ahead and run this notice now we have the first name the last name and address.

41
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.450
So notice that this sort of query can start to get complicated very quickly so it might be useful to

42
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.810
save or store this query as a view instead of having to write this over and over again.

43
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.000
And luckily for us creating a view is super simple in post press equal the way we do this is once you

44
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.140
have the query that you want to store ready or you're going to do is use the keyword create view and

45
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.840
then decide what you actually want to call this view.

46
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.950
So we can call this something like customer info and we'll save that as.

47
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.980
And then the query below.

48
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.160
So it's just create view the name of your view as and then whatever you are interested in.

49
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.080
So we go ahead and run this.

50
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.440
You should see CREATE VIEW is successfully return which means now instead of having to rewrite this

51
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:29.080
entire query I can simply say select everything from and the new View we created customer info run that

52
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.360
and returns back the same output.

53
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.410
Keep in mind not duplicating any information internally.

54
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.810
Instead you're really just saving the query and it will be automatically called for you.

55
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.410
That way you can expand on this by adding things like where calls or having statements or group buys

56
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.990
and so on really helps you simplify things for complex queries.

57
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.400
Now if you find yourself needing to alter view and basically change the under lying query information

58
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.350
from it that's actually also pretty easy to do.

59
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.270
You simply call the.

60
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.530
CREATE OR REPLACE command.

61
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:13.210
So the way we do that is let's go ahead and say CREATE OR REPLACE view customer info as.

62
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.910
And then I won't go into my query history and let's scroll down here and in your query history it's

63
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.750
going to be a little different than mine but you should be able to find the original query we created

64
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.940
so I copied it.

65
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.890
Let's go ahead and put it in here.

66
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.440
So recall here is our original view query.

67
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.230
Let's add in a new column.

68
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.830
It's got an add in district here.

69
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.090
So what that's going to do is say select first name last name address and then we want to add in the

70
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.530
district column to my customer info view.

71
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.880
So I'm going to run this now and outside CREATE VIEW query return successfully.

72
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:56.620
So let's say select everything from customer info again we'll say select everything from customer info

73
00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.440
run that again.

74
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.820
Now notice the district is also included there.

75
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.720
If you ever want to remove a post crest equal view what you can do is just like dropping a table you'll

76
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.430
say drop view and then the view itself just like a table you can also check if it exists first.

77
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.010
To prevent errors you can say drop view if exists.

78
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:26.170
Customer info OK if you ever find yourself wanting to change the name of a view you can say alter view

79
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.560
the name of your view and then say rename to and then the new name so we can say something like let's

80
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.910
say C underscore info run that that has alter the view which means customer info is no longer available

81
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.660
for me.

82
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.990
So if I try if I try saying select everything from customer info run that they'll say won't exist but

83
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.100
if I say select everything from C info run that now it does exist.

84
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.540
And if I ever want to drop this then I can say just drop view see info run that.

85
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.090
And now the view no longer exists.

86
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.740
OK.

87
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.860
So that's the very basics of creating views for your convenience in post press equal.

88
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.940
I'll see you at the next lecture.
