00:00:03,632  -->  00:00:04,875
I am Jose Portilla
3

3

00:00:04,875  -->  00:00:07,241
and I've taught thousands of students on Udemy
4

4

00:00:07,241  -->  00:00:08,998
the most in-demand tech skills
5

5

00:00:08,998  -->  00:00:10,853
such as Python, Data Science,

00:00:12,979  -->  00:00:15,247
And now I'm excited to launch this new course

using SQL to interact with database and analyse your data.
10

10

00:00:22,637  -->  00:00:23,731
I've designed this course

11

00:00:23,731  -->  00:00:26,282
to take you from zero to hero of SQL

00:00:26,282  -->  00:00:29,932
so no prior programming experience is necessary.
