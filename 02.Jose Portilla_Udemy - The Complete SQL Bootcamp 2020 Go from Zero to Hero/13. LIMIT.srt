00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,630
Welcome back everyone to this lecture discussion on the limit.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:15,120
Keyword the limit command allows us to limit the number of rows returned for a query.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,200
It's useful for not wanting to return every single row in a table but only view maybe the top few rows

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,270
to get an idea of the table layout limit also becomes extremely useful in combination of the ordered

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:34,190
by statement that we just learned about limit goes at the very bottom end of a query request and is

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,040
the last command to be executed because essentially what the limit does is after you're done filtering

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,830
with the where statement ordering with order by and sorting and any other sort of conditions or any

8
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,530
filters you want to do in your query.

9
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,610
The limit is just going to say All right how many rows do you want at the end of the day.

10
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,900
So let's learn the basic syntax limit through some examples.

11
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,800
This should be pretty straightforward and you should really be thinking about this in conjunction with

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,620
order by.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,470
In order to answer certain business questions let's jump over to P.G. admin okay.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Here we are in P.G. admin.

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,590
Let's go ahead and explore this payment table again.

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,740
First what we could do is just select everything from the payment table so I can say select everything

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:22,460
from payment and I get this variety of payment I.D. customer I.D. stuff i.e. the rental I.D. etc. and

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,230
then I also get a payment date which has a timestamp without a time zone.

19
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,270
Essentially just a day and then the hour minute and then second and milliseconds where this payment

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,080
actually occurred what we could do is order by this payment date in order to see either the oldest payments

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,950
or the most recent payments.

22
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:48,370
So what I can do is say select everything from payment and then say order by payment date.

23
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:53,350
And if we run this on a timestamp what's going to happen if we refresh this notice we get two thousand

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,800
seven zero to 14.

25
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,970
So this is in American formatting meaning it's year month and then day.

26
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:07,210
And if I want I can either order this by default ascending to get two thousand seven two and then 14

27
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,320
or I could say descending.

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,250
Run this and I see two thousand seven 514 essentially 14th of May instead of 14th of February.

29
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:25,360
So what this actually means is I can use order by in conjunction with limit to get the top end rows

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,410
of something.

31
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,690
So for example I can answer the business question what were the 10 most recent purchases in the payment

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,450
table.

33
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:39,730
So after I conduct my order buy I call in the limit keyword and then provide how many rows do you actually

34
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,600
want.

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,280
So if I just say five you'll notice here that right now it's returning everything if I scroll down here

36
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,240
if I say five run this I keep scrolling down but I only get five rows.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,820
So essentially what this answers is.

38
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:01,320
What were the five most recent rows or payments based off the payment date.

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,590
So we can see the payment date here.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,930
And right now we're returning the five most recent payments.

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,120
So this will allow you to get the top end of anything based off some column.

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,690
So what we do here is just order by some column and then limit it to the top end results that we want.

43
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,790
And it's up to you whether you want to do ascending or descending depending on the actual data type

44
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,480
that we're looking at.

45
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,200
So we can see here in fact some of these payment amounts or zeros.

46
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,930
So what I could end up doing is also filtering it where the amount isn't zero.

47
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,340
So we can start to get really nice complex queries here so I can say select everything from the payment

48
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,680
table saying select all the calls from this payment table and then right here we're limiting it to the

49
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,560
top five most recent ones based off payment day in descending order.

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,900
So starting from most recent descending to the historical data and it could also then say where amount

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,880
is not equal to zero.

52
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:06,150
So we run this and now I can see the five most recent payments where there was actually a monetary transaction

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,200
and it wasn't just a zero dollar amount.

54
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,100
So this is where we start to see much more realistic sequel queries given just the few commands we know

55
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,920
we can already answer lots of business questions we can in this case select everything from the most

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,280
five recent payments where the amount wasn't zero.

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,620
All right.

58
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,100
So hopefully that gives you an idea of the power of limit and sometimes if you want you can simply do

59
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,700
something like SELECT everything from payment limit one to just quickly get an idea of what this table

60
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,690
actually looks like.

61
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,230
This would show you what data types there are such as integer small integers timestamps etc. in an example

62
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,680
of what these actually look like.

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,560
So some people like to quickly run this sort of command in order to just see the general layout of a

64
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:49,980
table.

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
OK.

66
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,570
So that's it for this lecture on limit.

67
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,980
It's a pretty straightforward thing.

68
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,320
Let me just comes at the end and you can limit the number of rows return.

69
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
Very useful in conjunction of order by.

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,060
So let's test your skills in the next lecture where we talk about some order by challenges.

71
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,660
I'll see you there.
