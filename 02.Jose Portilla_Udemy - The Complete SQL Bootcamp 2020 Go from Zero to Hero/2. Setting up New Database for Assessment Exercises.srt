00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,290
Welcome everyone to this quick lecture on restoring the exercises database.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,900
This database is slightly different than what we've encountered before with the DVD rental database

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,450
so we'll quickly guide you through it.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,060
And we're gonna be using this database for a series of exercise questions so we're gonna use this new

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,230
database for a set of exercise questions.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,810
We've pretty much exhausted all the questions we can think of that are relevant to you in that DVD rental

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,450
database.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,440
So we're going to do is restore a brand new database.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,180
And the important thing to know that we haven't encountered before is this database actually has two

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,820
schemas a public schema and then something called a C D schema which is the name of the schema.

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,790
And because our tables exist within the C D schema instead of the public one we just have to specify

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,920
in our queries.

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,190
So this means the queries for the from table's part will have a C D in front of them.

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,430
So there's two tables that you're gonna be using.

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,100
So one is bookings and the other one is facilities.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,530
And so you'll be doing things like select everything from C D that bookings or select everything from

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,600
C D that facilities instead of just writing from bookings or from facilities and we'll give you a quick

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,120
little tour of the actual schema and tables after we're done restoring.

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,080
So let's go ahead and restore that database.

20
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,100
We have two options for downloading the actual dot tar file.

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,450
One is the exercise that tower file directly uploaded to You to me in case you have any issues with

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:26,720
that.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,410
I've also provided a permanent Google Drive link you can download from.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,560
So go ahead and in the resources you should see two links one for the direct thought tar file and another

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,670
one for the Google Drive that you can use either one I'm going to click on that Google Drive link to

26
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,070
show you what it looks like.

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,390
So if you click on that Google Drive link it looks something like this.

28
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,870
It'll say something like woops there was a problem with the preview.

29
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,990
That's totally ok.

30
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,400
You can't really preview a dot tar file within Google Drive.

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,710
So just click the download button here and it'll eventually download.

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,330
Notice I've already downloaded it underneath exercises dot tar.

33
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,090
The only thing we have to remember is where exactly this dot tar file is.

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,630
And you can just show in folder and eventually you'll find it if you explore it's most likely underneath

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,360
your Downloads folder actually have it here myself so I can see I have exercised that tar and I can

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,590
see the full file path to it.

37
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,660
OK so let's go ahead and restore that.

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,570
Now hop over to PGE admin.

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,330
OK here I am in PGA admin.

40
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,620
Very zoomed in right now just to show you I'm going to right click on databases.

41
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,830
After I've already connected to a Postgres SQL Server if you're starting P.G. admin you'll just have

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,620
to click on servers click on post graphs reconnect and then we'll go ahead and just like we did last

43
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,450
time right click on databases hit create and then select database.

44
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,520
Go ahead and name this database.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,250
Technically whatever you want I'll just name exercises.

46
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,180
Same as the top tier file and then let me zoom out a little bit so I can select that save button.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,290
So I'm pretty zoomed in for filming purposes that we go so I'll save this.

48
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:57,830
There we go.

49
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,540
Let's go ahead and click on exercises so we can connect to it and then we're going to do is right click

50
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,490
on exercises and then we will select restore and then restore.

51
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,050
We have this custom or tar format and then you have two options.

52
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,970
As always you can either manually type in the file name which we discussed before in the DVD rental

53
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,020
install lecture.

54
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,720
So if you have any issues finding these three dots just manually type out the full file path but you

55
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,260
can also hit the three dots and go to wherever you happen to save it.

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,680
So I have downloads here I need to change my format to show all files and then you can also show hidden

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,830
files and folders.

58
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,710
Let's go ahead and select this based off when I downloaded it.

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,500
Here it is exercised not tar.

60
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,540
Go ahead and select if you have any issues especially if you're on Mac OS or Linux with these three

61
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,060
buttons just manually type out the full file path.

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,310
You can easily google search to find the full file path for any file on your computer.

63
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,050
So if I couldn't find it through the three dots I just simply pass on the full file path.

64
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,870
OK.

65
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:04,170
Just like last time I'm going to restore with pre data and post data that's all we need to do there.

66
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,760
And let's go ahead and restore USA restore a job created successfully complete in some older versions

67
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,870
of postcard sequel.

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,490
You may find a failed exit code one that's totally ok.

69
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,850
You can go ahead and ignore that failed executed.

70
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,690
It just means that it accidentally tried to restore it twice.

71
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,510
This only happens on some versions of Postgres sequel combined with a certain version of sometimes Mac

72
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,320
OS or even Windows older operating systems.

73
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,880
However it looks like successfully completed.

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,060
So I had no issues there.

75
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,360
If you get failed exit code one you can ignore it safely for now.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
Go ahead and exit that then.

77
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,580
Important step here.

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,220
We want to refresh to actually apply those changes now if we go get down here to schemas.

79
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,640
You'll literally have to schemas a public schema and a C.D. schema the C.D. schema is actually the one

80
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,450
we're using.

81
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:56,300
Where if we expand on this we have actually three tables bookings facilities and members.

82
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,040
So show you what these actually look like.

83
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,370
I'm going to right click and let's open up a query tool on exercises.

84
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,020
So be careful to make sure you actually right click on exercise is not the old DVD rental one.

85
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,840
So I see here exercises.

86
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm ready to run my query Ed. And as I mentioned in order to actually grab stuff from the table you'll

87
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:22,190
say select from and then don't just type in bookings otherwise you'll get an error you'll say hey bookings

88
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,440
doesn't exist you need a type C dot bookings because it's under the C these schema you run that.

89
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,130
And here we have the bookings.

90
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,130
So essentially the way this works is to give you a quick tour of this database.

91
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,840
We have facilities in this and we have a facility I.D. the name of that facility you can think of.

92
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,870
This is kind of like a resort or a gym and we have tennis courts massage rooms squash courts snooker

93
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,250
table pool table.

94
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,160
We have the member cost so how much it costs.

95
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,060
If you remember we have a guest costs.

96
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,590
If you're not a member of our particular gym or facility they'll cost you extra.

97
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,730
Some initial outlay parameter and then the monthly maintenance costs.

98
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,710
How much does it cost us as the owners of these facilities to actually run the tennis court every month.

99
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,750
So cost us 200 bucks a month.

100
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,410
The guests cost is twenty five dollars.

101
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,080
Member cost is five dollars.

102
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,580
OK.

103
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,860
Less facilities.

104
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,900
Let's go ahead and take a look at bookings so bookings is essentially someone or like a member booking

105
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,100
a facility.

106
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:26,610
So we have the booking I.D. the facility I.D. the member I.D. the start time and then how many slots

107
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,570
were necessary.

108
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,830
So if they're doing something like tennis maybe they book two slots or maybe they're just there to practice

109
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:38,880
so they book one slot et cetera and then finally we have members see these members go ahead and run

110
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,830
that we can see we have the member I.D. the surname first name.

111
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,550
Notice that if they're a guest we'll just say guest guest as well as their address a zip code telephone.

112
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,780
Note some of these telephones are fake.

113
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,150
Well technically all known these people are real recommended by could be null.

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,440
So we have some possibility for empty values.

115
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,770
And then the date they joined.

116
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,580
OK.

117
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,980
So we do have some things that are a little bit tricky here we have some null values depending on whether

118
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,180
a guest maybe we have a membership but we have some null values for other information et cetera.

119
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,660
But that's it the three relationships between the tables are actual facilities booking those facilities

120
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,420
and then members who actually book those facilities.

121
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,130
OK.

122
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,970
That's all you should need to know.

123
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,470
And coming up next it's gonna be a bunch of questions for you to answer on this database.

124
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,070
Best of luck.
