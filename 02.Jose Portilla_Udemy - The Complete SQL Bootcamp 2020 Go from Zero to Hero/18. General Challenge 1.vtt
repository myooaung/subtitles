00:00:01.195  -->  00:00:02.259
<v Instructor>Hello everyone, and welcome</v>
2

2

00:00:02.259  -->  00:00:05.373
to your first general challenge lecture.
3

3

00:00:05.373  -->  00:00:06.886
So, I'm really excited for you to take on
4

4

00:00:06.886  -->  00:00:08.393
this first general challenge,
5

5

00:00:08.393  -->  00:00:10.397
because these general challenge tests
6

6

00:00:10.397  -->  00:00:14.189
are gonna utilise all the skills that you've learned so far.
7

7

00:00:14.189  -->  00:00:16.107
You'll receive the general challenge task
8

8

00:00:16.107  -->  00:00:17.696
and you'll get hints to the challenge and then
9

9

00:00:17.696  -->  00:00:19.579
the solution to the challenge.
10

10

00:00:19.579  -->  00:00:21.338
These challenges are gonna be a little more difficult
11

11

00:00:21.338  -->  00:00:23.271
than what you've seen earlier so try breaking down
12

12

00:00:23.271  -->  00:00:25.482
the problem into individual tasks
13

13

00:00:25.482  -->  00:00:28.048
in order to solve the task completely.
14

14

00:00:28.048  -->  00:00:30.255
So, let's go ahead and get started.
15

15

00:00:30.255  -->  00:00:32.416
Your first challenge and business task
16

16

00:00:32.416  -->  00:00:34.699
that I want you to answer is this,
17

17

00:00:34.699  -->  00:00:36.166
how many payment transactions
18

18

00:00:36.166  -->  00:00:38.488
were greater than $5?
19

19

00:00:38.488  -->  00:00:40.950
Again, just, what's the number of accounts
20

20

00:00:40.950  -->  00:00:45.074
of how many payment transactions were greater than $5?
21

21

00:00:45.074  -->  00:00:46.828
Okay, coming up next are the hints,
22

22

00:00:46.828  -->  00:00:48.052
so go ahead and pause the video now
23

23

00:00:48.052  -->  00:00:49.764
if you don't wanna see the hints yet.
24

24

00:00:49.764  -->  00:00:51.847
Moving onto the hints,
25

25

00:00:51.847  -->  00:00:53.965
so you'll need to use the payment table
26

26

00:00:53.965  -->  00:00:56.491
and you'll also need to use count and where
27

27

00:00:56.491  -->  00:00:59.425
along with some sort of comparison operator
28

28

00:00:59.425  -->  00:01:01.262
in order to distinguish what's greater than $5.
29

29

00:01:01.262  -->  00:01:03.509
So just keep that in mind.
30

30

00:01:03.509  -->  00:01:06.592
Okay, coming up next is the solution.
31

31

00:01:07.594  -->  00:01:09.550
So, the solution is actually pretty straightforward.
32

32

00:01:09.550  -->  00:01:13.799
You wanna select count amount from the payment table
33

33

00:01:13.799  -->  00:01:16.203
where the amount is greater than five.
34

34

00:01:16.203  -->  00:01:17.836
So let's take it a couple of concepts,
35

35

00:01:17.836  -->  00:01:20.328
just a general concept of selecting from,
36

36

00:01:20.328  -->  00:01:21.999
that very first thing we learn.
37

37

00:01:21.999  -->  00:01:24.940
Then the concept of counting the amount column
38

38

00:01:24.940  -->  00:01:28.081
and then using where along some sort of comparison operator
39

39

00:01:28.081  -->  00:01:31.670
to filter out which amounts we were looking for.
40

40

00:01:31.670  -->  00:01:34.541
So again, that was select the counts amount column
41

41

00:01:34.541  -->  00:01:37.474
from payment table where amount is greater than five.
42

42

00:01:37.474  -->  00:01:41.426
Remember to put that semi-colon in to end your query.
43

43

00:01:41.426  -->  00:01:44.038
Okay, next business task.
44

44

00:01:44.038  -->  00:01:46.571
How many actors have a first name that starts
45

45

00:01:46.571  -->  00:01:48.405
with the letter P?
46

46

00:01:48.405  -->  00:01:50.811
Again, how many actors have a first name
47

47

00:01:50.811  -->  00:01:52.976
that starts with the letter P.
48

48

00:01:52.976  -->  00:01:55.217
Okay, coming up next is a hint.
49

49

00:01:55.217  -->  00:01:56.850
So go ahead and pause the video now
50

50

00:01:56.850  -->  00:01:58.730
if you don't want to see the hint yet.
51

51

00:01:58.730  -->  00:02:00.983
Okay, here comes the hint.
52

52

00:02:00.983  -->  00:02:03.634
So, you'll to use the actor table in order
53

53

00:02:03.634  -->  00:02:05.227
to answer this question and you'll also need
54

54

00:02:05.227  -->  00:02:08.029
to use the like statements and some sort
55

55

00:02:08.029  -->  00:02:10.737
of wildcard operator such as the percent sign
56

56

00:02:10.737  -->  00:02:12.112
or the underscore.
57

57

00:02:12.112  -->  00:02:13.990
So, go ahead and review the like lecture
58

58

00:02:13.990  -->  00:02:16.524
if you need any refreshment, or refresher
59

59

00:02:16.524  -->  00:02:21.039
on how to use that % sign or underscore wildcard operators.
60

60

00:02:21.039  -->  00:02:24.963
Okay, coming up next is the solutions to this challenge.
61

61

00:02:24.963  -->  00:02:26.927
So, here it comes.
62

62

00:02:26.927  -->  00:02:29.457
So the solution is select counts and in this case
63

63

00:02:29.457  -->  00:02:32.352
I'm just selecting all the rows,
64

64

00:02:32.352  -->  00:02:33.987
you can see an asterisk here
65

65

00:02:33.987  -->  00:02:35.911
and that's because I just want to count basically
66

66

00:02:35.911  -->  00:02:39.340
all the rows from actor where the first name column
67

67

00:02:39.340  -->  00:02:42.042
is like, and this is where it gets a little tricky,
68

68

00:02:42.042  -->  00:02:45.464
but you have to say like, single quote, capital P,
69

69

00:02:45.464  -->  00:02:47.131
percent sigh, quote.
70

70

00:02:48.403  -->  00:02:49.888
And that's because, what's good happen here
71

71

00:02:49.888  -->  00:02:52.802
is you're gonna say select the count asterisks,
72

72

00:02:52.802  -->  00:02:56.604
meaning just count all the rows from actor where your first
73

73

00:02:56.604  -->  00:03:00.485
underscore name column is like P percent sign,
74

74

00:03:00.485  -->  00:03:03.915
meaning where the value of first thing column starts
75

75

00:03:03.915  -->  00:03:04.748
with a P.
76

76

00:03:06.319  -->  00:03:08.364
OK, so go ahead an review that solution,
77

77

00:03:08.364  -->  00:03:09.944
makes sure you type it out yourself, in case you weren't
78

78

00:03:09.944  -->  00:03:11.183
able to get it.
79

79

00:03:11.183  -->  00:03:14.456
But coming up next is one other challenge task.
80

80

00:03:14.456  -->  00:03:15.623
So here comes.
81

81

00:03:17.358  -->  00:03:20.535
OK, your next challenge is how many unique districts
82

82

00:03:20.535  -->  00:03:23.197
are our customers from?
83

83

00:03:23.197  -->  00:03:27.497
That's many unique districts are our customers from.
84

84

00:03:27.497  -->  00:03:30.077
OK, coming up next are some hints on how
85

85

00:03:30.077  -->  00:03:31.841
to solve this challenge.
86

86

00:03:31.841  -->  00:03:34.665
So here comes the hints slide.
87

87

00:03:34.665  -->  00:03:37.114
so you'll need to use the address table,
88

88

00:03:37.114  -->  00:03:39.937
and you'll also need to use counts and distinct.
89

89

00:03:39.937  -->  00:03:42.658
So go ahead and use the distinct lecture in case you don't
90

90

00:03:42.658  -->  00:03:44.741
remember how to use distinct.
91

91

00:03:44.741  -->  00:03:48.138
But you'll that in order to solve the challenge which was,
92

92

00:03:48.138  -->  00:03:51.861
how many unique districts are our customers from.
93

93

00:03:51.861  -->  00:03:54.086
OK, so coming up next is the solution.
94

94

00:03:54.086  -->  00:03:55.245
So go ahead and paused the video now
95

95

00:03:55.245  -->  00:03:57.171
if you don't wanna see the solution yet.
96

96

00:03:57.171  -->  00:03:59.340
OK, here comes the solution for it.
97

97

00:03:59.340  -->  00:04:03.290
So the solution was to select count distinct
98

98

00:04:03.290  -->  00:04:05.457
district from address.
99

99

00:04:05.457  -->  00:04:07.918
So, this gonna basically do this,
100

100

00:04:07.918  -->  00:04:11.228
it's gonna say select, and if we start from the inside here,
101

101

00:04:11.228  -->  00:04:13.850
it's gonna grab all the distinct districts.
102

102

00:04:13.850  -->  00:04:16.716
So that means if you have, for instance,
103

103

00:04:16.716  -->  00:04:19.705
a district called, Alberta, if you have it several times
104

104

00:04:19.705  -->  00:04:21.709
throughout that column, so several rows have
105

105

00:04:21.709  -->  00:04:25.346
the value of Alberta, and that this district column,
106

106

00:04:25.346  -->  00:04:28.862
what distinct gonna do is just select all the unique ones.
107

107

00:04:28.862  -->  00:04:32.016
so it means I'll just filter it down so Alberta
108

108

00:04:32.016  -->  00:04:34.511
only shows up once, or that particular district
109

109

00:04:34.511  -->  00:04:35.666
always shows up once.
110

110

00:04:35.666  -->  00:04:38.227
And then, what count is gonna do is just count
111

111

00:04:38.227  -->  00:04:39.950
all those distinct districts.
112

112

00:04:39.950  -->  00:04:41.591
And that's basically gonna give you the answer
113

113

00:04:41.591  -->  00:04:44.857
of how many districts, or unique districts
114

114

00:04:44.857  -->  00:04:47.055
are the customers from.
115

115

00:04:47.055  -->  00:04:50.203
And you have to get that from the address table.
116

116

00:04:50.203  -->  00:04:52.370
OK, so one more challenge.
117

117

00:04:53.850  -->  00:04:57.037
I want you to retrieve the list of names for those
118

118

00:04:57.037  -->  00:05:00.394
distinct districts from the previous question.
119

119

00:05:00.394  -->  00:05:03.221
So this is gonna be be a really similar question.
120

120

00:05:03.221  -->  00:05:05.179
I just want you to make sure you really flush out
121

121

00:05:05.179  -->  00:05:07.658
your understanding fully and just retrieve the list
122

122

00:05:07.658  -->  00:05:09.867
of names for those distinct districts
123

123

00:05:09.867  -->  00:05:12.368
from the previous question.
124

124

00:05:12.368  -->  00:05:14.982
OK, here comes the hints.
125

125

00:05:14.982  -->  00:05:16.856
So again you need to use the address table
126

126

00:05:16.856  -->  00:05:19.965
and really strong hands, this is gonna be very similar
127

127

00:05:19.965  -->  00:05:21.972
to the previous challenge solution.
128

128

00:05:21.972  -->  00:05:24.215
So, you should really only be editing,
129

129

00:05:24.215  -->  00:05:25.882
basically, one word.
130

130

00:05:27.080  -->  00:05:29.775
OK, so hopefully can get it but if you don't,
131

131

00:05:29.775  -->  00:05:32.109
go ahead and pause the video now and try to get it.
132

132

00:05:32.109  -->  00:05:33.620
And now are we're gonna do the solution
133

133

00:05:33.620  -->  00:05:36.195
so here comes the solution for it.
134

134

00:05:36.195  -->  00:05:39.428
The solution is to basically just remove that count.
135

135

00:05:39.428  -->  00:05:42.404
So if you just say select distinct district from address,
136

136

00:05:42.404  -->  00:05:43.921
you won't get the actual number count,
137

137

00:05:43.921  -->  00:05:46.286
you'll just get that list of the distinct districts
138

138

00:05:46.286  -->  00:05:48.484
that the customers are from.
139

139

00:05:48.484  -->  00:05:51.430
OK, hopefully you're able to get that.
140

140

00:05:51.430  -->  00:05:55.617
Another challenge here is how many films have a rating
141

141

00:05:55.617  -->  00:05:59.534
of R and a replacement cost between $5 and $15?
142

142

00:06:01.107  -->  00:06:03.444
That's how many films with the rating of R
143

143

00:06:03.444  -->  00:06:07.941
and the replacement cost between $5 and $15.
144

144

00:06:07.941  -->  00:06:09.951
OK, go ahead and pause the video now,
145

145

00:06:09.951  -->  00:06:12.324
try to solve this challenge on your own using
146

146

00:06:12.324  -->  00:06:15.176
your SQL querying skills and up next are some hints
147

147

00:06:15.176  -->  00:06:17.264
on how to solve this challenge.
148

148

00:06:17.264  -->  00:06:19.725
OK, here comes the hints.
149

149

00:06:19.725  -->  00:06:22.572
So the hint is you'll need to use the film table
150

150

00:06:22.572  -->  00:06:26.013
and you may also need to use between and a where statement
151

151

00:06:26.013  -->  00:06:28.751
with some sort of comparison operator in order to solve
152

152

00:06:28.751  -->  00:06:32.105
that issue of between five and $15.
153

153

00:06:32.105  -->  00:06:34.437
Hopefully, word between earlier was a clue for you too,
154

154

00:06:34.437  -->  00:06:37.893
in order for you to figure that out on your own.
155

155

00:06:37.893  -->  00:06:39.565
OK, so those are the hints, go ahead and pause
156

156

00:06:39.565  -->  00:06:41.332
the video now, if you want to attempt
157

157

00:06:41.332  -->  00:06:44.848
the problem on your own, but coming up next is the solution.
158

158

00:06:44.848  -->  00:06:47.623
OK, here comes the solution.
159

159

00:06:47.623  -->  00:06:50.573
So the solution was to select count asterisks,
160

160

00:06:50.573  -->  00:06:53.510
so just select the count of all the rows from film,
161

161

00:06:53.510  -->  00:06:56.005
where the rating is equal to that string R.
162

162

00:06:56.005  -->  00:06:57.669
So single quote R, single quote,
163

163

00:06:57.669  -->  00:06:59.918
and replacement underscore cost column,
164

164

00:06:59.918  -->  00:07:01.835
is between five and 15.
165

165

00:07:02.706  -->  00:07:05.847
Notice I don't put strings between five and 15 because
166

166

00:07:05.847  -->  00:07:08.959
they're both just the numeric datatypes.
167

167

00:07:08.959  -->  00:07:10.133
OK, so it's go ahead and break this down
168

168

00:07:10.133  -->  00:07:11.440
just a little further.
169

169

00:07:11.440  -->  00:07:14.273
Sometimes it confuses people why you have to just select
170

170

00:07:14.273  -->  00:07:18.943
count asterisks here instead of title or something.
171

171

00:07:18.943  -->  00:07:21.884
and that's because by saying count asterisks,
172

172

00:07:21.884  -->  00:07:23.713
you're basically just saying, count the number
173

173

00:07:23.713  -->  00:07:26.651
of rows returned, which makes sense because
174

174

00:07:26.651  -->  00:07:27.953
it doesn't matter what column you select
175

175

00:07:27.953  -->  00:07:29.511
you're still gonna be counting the same number
176

176

00:07:29.511  -->  00:07:31.069
of rows there.
177

177

00:07:31.069  -->  00:07:33.476
So you're saying just select the count of the number
178

178

00:07:33.476  -->  00:07:36.671
of rows from film that get return when you select
179

179

00:07:36.671  -->  00:07:39.498
the rating is equal to R and the replacement cost
180

180

00:07:39.498  -->  00:07:42.849
has to be between five and $15.
181

181

00:07:42.849  -->  00:07:44.932
OK, so another challenge.
182

182

00:07:46.571  -->  00:07:47.993
This one's gonna maybe a little trickier,
183

183

00:07:47.993  -->  00:07:51.232
testing your own pattern matching skills.
184

184

00:07:51.232  -->  00:07:53.686
How many films have the word Truman
185

185

00:07:53.686  -->  00:07:55.445
somewhere in the title?
186

186

00:07:55.445  -->  00:07:57.491
So that's how many films have the word Truman
187

187

00:07:57.491  -->  00:07:59.542
somewhere in the title.
188

188

00:07:59.542  -->  00:08:02.734
OK, so coming up next are some hints,
189

189

00:08:02.734  -->  00:08:03.923
go ahead and pause the video now if you don't want
190

190

00:08:03.923  -->  00:08:05.686
see those hints yet.
191

191

00:08:05.686  -->  00:08:07.362
Here comes the hints.
192

192

00:08:07.362  -->  00:08:09.484
So you'll need to use the film table in order
193

193

00:08:09.484  -->  00:08:12.145
to solve this and you'll also need to use like
194

194

00:08:12.145  -->  00:08:14.315
with some sort of wildcard operator.
195

195

00:08:14.315  -->  00:08:17.656
So again, you can review the like lecture in order to
196

196

00:08:17.656  -->  00:08:19.994
get an understanding of how to use those wildcard operators
197

197

00:08:19.994  -->  00:08:22.029
in case you've forgotten.
198

198

00:08:22.029  -->  00:08:24.612
Right, coming up next is the solution.
199

199

00:08:24.612  -->  00:08:26.331
Here it comes.
200

200

00:08:26.331  -->  00:08:29.853
so the solution is to select count asterisks.
201

201

00:08:29.853  -->  00:08:31.959
Again, we just want to select the count of the number
202

202

00:08:31.959  -->  00:08:36.213
of rows returned from film, where the title column
203

203

00:08:36.213  -->  00:08:38.716
is like and this is where maybe it was
204

204

00:08:38.716  -->  00:08:39.942
a little tricky for you.
205

205

00:08:39.942  -->  00:08:42.159
But remember, the question asked, if we just go back
206

206

00:08:42.159  -->  00:08:45.467
to slides here, it asked how many films have the word
207

207

00:08:45.467  -->  00:08:47.609
Truman somewhere in the title.
208

208

00:08:47.609  -->  00:08:49.123
So not the beginning, not at the end,
209

209

00:08:49.123  -->  00:08:51.905
just anywhere in the title.
210

210

00:08:51.905  -->  00:08:53.990
And that means we had to use wildcard operators
211

211

00:08:53.990  -->  00:08:56.200
on both ends of Truman,
212

212

00:08:56.200  -->  00:08:58.331
meaning any number of characters or any sequence
213

213

00:08:58.331  -->  00:09:00.212
of characters can come before Truman
214

214

00:09:00.212  -->  00:09:03.210
and that includes spaces, and any sequence characters
215

215

00:09:03.210  -->  00:09:05.872
can come after Truman.
216

216

00:09:05.872  -->  00:09:07.672
OK, so that was the solution.
217

217

00:09:07.672  -->  00:09:09.933
So select count asterisks from film
218

218

00:09:09.933  -->  00:09:14.195
where the title is like, and then single quote,
219

219

00:09:14.195  -->  00:09:16.609
percent sign, Truman, percent sign, single quote,
220

220

00:09:16.609  -->  00:09:19.349
semi colon to end that query.
221

221

00:09:19.349  -->  00:09:20.492
Alright, great job.
222

222

00:09:20.492  -->  00:09:24.815
Hopefully you found those challenges straightforward,
223

223

00:09:24.815  -->  00:09:26.371
a little tricky but not too hard.
224

224

00:09:26.371  -->  00:09:28.130
It should've been pretty basic.
225

225

00:09:28.130  -->  00:09:29.849
What we're gonna learn from now on
226

226

00:09:29.849  -->  00:09:32.684
is going to really up your skill level in SQL,
227

227

00:09:32.684  -->  00:09:34.582
learn how to do joints and GroupWise,
228

228

00:09:34.582  -->  00:09:37.097
which are some really powerful SQL statements
229

229

00:09:37.097  -->  00:09:38.946
and that'll really take you to a much more
230

230

00:09:38.946  -->  00:09:42.381
professional level understanding of SQL and the ability
231

231

00:09:42.381  -->  00:09:44.928
to use poster SQL database in order to do some
232

232

00:09:44.928  -->  00:09:47.095
real professional queries.
233

233

00:09:48.124  -->  00:09:51.118
OK, thanks everyone, hope you enjoy those challenges
234

234

00:09:51.118  -->  00:09:53.084
and I will see you at the next lecture.
235

235

00:09:53.084  -->  00:09:53.917
Thanks.
