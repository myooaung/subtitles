Welcome everyone to this section on creating databases and tables.

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,470
So far we've really only focused on querying and reading data from an existing database and an existing

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,430
table.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,660
We are now going to shift our focus to creating our own databases and tables using sequel commands so

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,840
if this section Well first going to discuss a few theoretical concepts such as choosing a data type

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,540
primary and foreign key as well as constraints.

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,550
Then we're gonna move into actual SQL commands to perform the creation of a database or a table using

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:48,070
create INSERT UPDATE delete alter and drop so as I mentioned we're first going to focus learning a few

9
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,780
theoretical concepts such as choosing the correct data type first stored value and setting possible

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,010
constraints on it which means the first few lectures in the section are just going to be slide lectures.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,900
Then we'll also learn about things like primary and foreign keys.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,240
Once we learn these theoretical concepts we'll move on to actually learning the cycle commands to implement

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,080
them.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,210
Okay with that being said let's get started.

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,560
I'll see you at the next lecture.
