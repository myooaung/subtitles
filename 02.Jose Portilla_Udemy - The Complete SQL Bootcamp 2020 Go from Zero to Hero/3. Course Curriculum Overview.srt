<v Instructor>Hello everyone and welcome</v>
2

2

00:00:01,858  -->  00:00:03,425
to the course curriculum lecture
3

3

00:00:03,425  -->  00:00:05,569
for the complete SQL bootcamp.
4

4

00:00:05,569  -->  00:00:07,061
In this lecture, we're gonna go over
5

5

00:00:07,061  -->  00:00:09,036
the entire course's curriculum and understand
6

6

00:00:09,036  -->  00:00:12,353
the building blocks that make up this course.
7

7

00:00:12,353  -->  00:00:14,584
To begin, you'll start off by installing
8

8

00:00:14,584  -->  00:00:17,044
PostgreSQL and PG Admin.
9

9

00:00:17,044  -->  00:00:18,973
We have full installation walkthroughs
10

10

00:00:18,973  -->  00:00:22,515
for both Windows and Mac computer systems.
11

11

00:00:22,515  -->  00:00:24,871
Once we've done that, we'll start off
12

12

00:00:24,871  -->  00:00:26,666
with some basic sections.
13

13

00:00:26,666  -->  00:00:30,219
The first section will cover databases and table basics.
14

14

00:00:30,219  -->  00:00:33,525
Then, we'll learn about SQL statement fundamentals.
15

15

00:00:33,525  -->  00:00:34,912
In that section of the course,
16

16

00:00:34,912  -->  00:00:36,893
you'll finally begin to use SQL syntax
17

17

00:00:36,893  -->  00:00:38,697
to query the database and the tables
18

18

00:00:38,697  -->  00:00:41,544
you created in the previous section.
19

19

00:00:41,544  -->  00:00:43,040
Then, we'll step it up a notch
20

20

00:00:43,040  -->  00:00:45,696
by learning about the GROUP BY clause
21

21

00:00:45,696  -->  00:00:46,924
and once we've finished that,
22

22

00:00:46,924  -->  00:00:48,560
you'll have your first assessment test
23

23

00:00:48,560  -->  00:00:50,628
during the course.
24

24

00:00:50,628  -->  00:00:53,102
Once you've completed that first assessment test,
25

25

00:00:53,102  -->  00:00:54,844
you'll learn about JOINS, some
26

26

00:00:54,844  -->  00:00:56,882
more advanced SQL commands, and then
27

27

00:00:56,882  -->  00:00:58,364
you'll have a second assessment test
28

28

00:00:58,364  -->  00:01:00,905
to test your understanding of everything you've learned
29

29

00:01:00,905  -->  00:01:03,488
up to this point in the course.
30

30

00:01:05,059  -->  00:01:07,600
After that, you'll have your final sections.
31

31

00:01:07,600  -->  00:01:09,073
You'll learn how to create databases
32

32

00:01:09,073  -->  00:01:11,703
and tables directly through a SQL syntax.
33

33

00:01:11,703  -->  00:01:13,542
Then you'll have your third assessment test
34

34

00:01:13,542  -->  00:01:15,145
that will test your knowledge
35

35

00:01:15,145  -->  00:01:18,843
on creating databases and tables directly through SQL.
36

36

00:01:18,843  -->  00:01:21,282
Then we also have some extra bonus lectures.
37

37

00:01:21,282  -->  00:01:23,661
The lectures and these topics include views,
38

38

00:01:23,661  -->  00:01:26,548
using PostgreSQL with the Python programming language
39

39

00:01:26,548  -->  00:01:28,253
as well as some special discount offers
40

40

00:01:28,253  -->  00:01:30,003
for my other courses.
41

41

00:01:31,608  -->  00:01:33,470
With that all being said, let's go ahead
42

42

00:01:33,470  -->  00:01:35,333
and get started with the entire course
43

43

00:01:35,333  -->  00:01:37,452
so we can build up our knowledge.
44

44

00:01:37,452  -->  00:01:38,555
Thanks everyone, and I'll see you
45

45

00:01:38,555  -->  00:01:40,305
at the next lecture.
