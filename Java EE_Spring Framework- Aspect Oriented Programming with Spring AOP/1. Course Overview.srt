[Autogenerated] Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,380
My name is cattle into dosa and welcome to my aspect

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,120
oriented programming with spring GOP course.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,940
I am a Java and wept the guards expert at LAX at Romania and I have

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,400
more than 20 years of experience in the field.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,930
More than 15 of them have been dedicated to job and the technologies around it.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,640
In this course,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,540
we're going to discover one interesting and very useful programming technique.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,330
The course will show how to develop applications that separate the real

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,980
business logic from the cross cutting functional thing.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,890
The main topics that we're going to approach will be

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,990
what is aspect oriented programming.

13
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,740
Introducing spring aspect oriented programming,

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,170
implementing crosscutting concerns for normal execution,

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,400
implementing crosscutting concerns for cashing and exceptions using spring a O.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,670
P.

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,440
Introductions.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,990
By the end of this course,

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,480
you will know how to develop Java applications that will easily separate

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,400
the business logic and the cross cutting concerns.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,820
Before beginning the course,

22
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,940
you should be familiar with object oriented programming concepts,

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,460
be proficient in writing job, back or coat,

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,190
and have a basic understanding of the spring core framework

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,900
and the dependency injection concept.

26
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:30,000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn spring GOP with the aspect oriented programming with spring GOP course at your side
