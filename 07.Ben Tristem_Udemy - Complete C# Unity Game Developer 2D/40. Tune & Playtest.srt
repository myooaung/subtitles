00:00:04,032  -->  00:00:04,770
Hello again!
3

3

00:00:04,770  -->  00:00:07,037
In this video,
I'm going to be tuning my game so
4

4

00:00:07,037  -->  00:00:10,450
that it has a more of a final tuning
of the gameplay that I'm happy with.
5

5

00:00:10,450  -->  00:00:13,381
I'm still terrible at it, but
I'm looking for fast and furious, and
6

6

00:00:13,381  -->  00:00:14,633
I feel I get fast and furious.
7

7

00:00:14,633  -->  00:00:18,884
So I want you to be tuning your game to
the point where you're happy with how
8

8

00:00:18,884  -->  00:00:19,510
it plays.
9

9

00:00:19,510  -->  00:00:22,620
So let's jump in and
talk about game tuning and playtesting.
10

10

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:25,240
Let's start by talking a little
bit about playtesting.
11

11

00:00:25,240  -->  00:00:29,403
When you're playtesting your game,
always tune to your "Player Experience".
12

12

00:00:29,403  -->  00:00:32,320
That means always think about
your player experience.
13

13

00:00:32,320  -->  00:00:35,452
And make sure that whatever you change
in your game is creating that player
14

14

00:00:35,452  -->  00:00:36,068
experience.
15

15

00:00:36,068  -->  00:00:38,634
Just a reminder of what
my player experience was,
16

16

00:00:38,634  -->  00:00:42,670
this is the slide from way back in
lecture number two in this section.
17

17

00:00:42,670  -->  00:00:45,319
We had a Player Experience
of Quick reactions, so
18

18

00:00:45,319  -->  00:00:48,545
I wanted my player to feel like
the game was fast and furious.
19

19

00:00:48,545  -->  00:00:53,202
And that is what I need to bear in
mind with every single tweak I do,
20

20

00:00:53,202  -->  00:00:55,910
am I creating fast and furious?
21

21

00:00:55,910  -->  00:01:00,187
Also, when you're playtesting, make sure
you aim for challenging but winnable.
22

22

00:01:00,187  -->  00:01:02,796
We play our game over and
over and over and over.
23

23

00:01:02,796  -->  00:01:06,253
And sometimes I see a lot
of people create really
24

24

00:01:06,253  -->  00:01:10,410
difficult games because
that's their own skill level.
25

25

00:01:10,410  -->  00:01:13,176
So just remember that your player
hasn't played 1,000 times,
26

26

00:01:13,176  -->  00:01:15,854
so your players haven't played
the game as many times as you have.
27

27

00:01:15,854  -->  00:01:20,103
And also look for bugs and problems as
you're tuning, that's really important as
28

28

00:01:20,103  -->  00:01:23,350
you're playtesting,
you're playtesting to improve.
29

29

00:01:23,350  -->  00:01:26,276
In the last lecture,
we were playing around, just be crazy,
30

30

00:01:26,276  -->  00:01:28,885
think of whatever you want,
think of extreme tuning.
31

31

00:01:28,885  -->  00:01:31,240
Now we're looking to narrow it down.
32

32

00:01:31,240  -->  00:01:35,776
We're looking to find the bugs,
the problems, and to get a tight tuning so
33

33

00:01:35,776  -->  00:01:39,882
that it feels like a compelling game,
and then ask a friend to play.
34

34

00:01:39,882  -->  00:01:43,447
This is an important part of playtesting,
is to ask someone else to play so
35

35

00:01:43,447  -->  00:01:44,660
it's not just you.
36

36

00:01:44,660  -->  00:01:47,342
So you can see straightaway if
they don't know what's going on or
37

37

00:01:47,342  -->  00:01:49,650
if it's too difficult or
if they get bored very easily.
38

38

00:01:49,650  -->  00:01:52,495
That's a key part of playtesting.
39

39

00:01:52,495  -->  00:01:54,747
Okay, so I'm just going to jump
back into my game over here, and
40

40

00:01:54,747  -->  00:01:56,519
quickly show you the tuning
that I'm going to do.
41

41

00:01:56,519  -->  00:01:59,311
I've been playing around with
it a little bit off camera, so
42

42

00:01:59,311  -->  00:02:00,955
I've got some conclusions.
43

43

00:02:00,955  -->  00:02:03,146
I am going to go for
a one ball system for now,
44

44

00:02:03,146  -->  00:02:07,429
just because we haven't created our code
to accommodate ten balls bouncing around.
45

45

00:02:07,429  -->  00:02:10,515
I think that would be really cool,
but I don't want to do that and
46

46

00:02:10,515  -->  00:02:13,677
then have to go off and
reinvent all the code that we've created.
47

47

00:02:13,677  -->  00:02:16,799
So it assumes one ball in a lot of places,
so, we'll just do the one ball.
48

48

00:02:16,799  -->  00:02:17,921
And then my paddle,
49

49

00:02:17,921  -->  00:02:21,490
I think I'm going to return that
back to the scale it was before.
50

50

00:02:21,490  -->  00:02:24,766
Again, just for the sake of simplicity,
where I'm going through and
51

51

00:02:24,766  -->  00:02:26,328
teaching you guys how to do this.
52

52

00:02:26,328  -->  00:02:30,453
And for you, you can evolve and change,
and push it in all crazy directions,
53

53

00:02:30,453  -->  00:02:33,020
but I want to keep mine
a little bit vanilla.
54

54

00:02:33,020  -->  00:02:36,945
In other words, a little bit neutral so
that you can change it however you want,
55

55

00:02:36,945  -->  00:02:38,537
now, what else do we need to do?
56

56

00:02:38,537  -->  00:02:42,949
The ball, I'm giving the ball an almighty
shove with a 50 on the Y Push,
57

57

00:02:42,949  -->  00:02:45,170
I'm going to turn that down to 12.
58

58

00:02:45,170  -->  00:02:48,464
So it's a good fast paced game,
but not out of control fast, and
59

59

00:02:48,464  -->  00:02:50,238
then what else do I need to do here?
60

60

00:02:50,238  -->  00:02:54,328
My Random Factor, I'm going to put that
up to 1, because that was kind of fun,
61

61

00:02:54,328  -->  00:02:55,929
between 1 and 2 is kinda fun.
62

62

00:02:55,929  -->  00:02:59,660
But sometimes the ball goes too slow with
the randomness, it hits something and
63

63

00:02:59,660  -->  00:03:02,229
then it goes really slow,
and again, we can fix that.
64

64

00:03:02,229  -->  00:03:03,069
My challenge for
65

65

00:03:03,069  -->  00:03:07,209
you would be, how could you create a piece
of code in there that would stop your ball
66

66

00:03:07,209  -->  00:03:10,516
going super slow in those situations
from a random point of view?
67

67

00:03:10,516  -->  00:03:12,946
But I want to jump into the next
section of course pretty soon, so
68

68

00:03:12,946  -->  00:03:14,712
I'm not going to go and
dig into those things.
69

69

00:03:14,712  -->  00:03:17,021
But great challenge for
you to take your game and
70

70

00:03:17,021  -->  00:03:20,209
evolve on it if you see any of
these things you're interested in.
71

71

00:03:20,209  -->  00:03:24,860
Make sure we turn for our play space,
I'm going to turn my collider back on,
72

72

00:03:24,860  -->  00:03:28,650
my Lose Collider, and then,
the score, where is our score?
73

73

00:03:28,650  -->  00:03:31,763
That's on Game Session,
the score per points, per block,
74

74

00:03:31,763  -->  00:03:34,216
well, let's put that back to 83, shall we?
75

75

00:03:34,216  -->  00:03:35,785
And I'll apply that to the prefab,
76

76

00:03:35,785  -->  00:03:38,935
make sure you're applying all these
things to your prefab, the ball.
77

77

00:03:38,935  -->  00:03:41,090
I'll apply this to the prefab as well, so
78

78

00:03:41,090  -->  00:03:44,770
it's relevent in our other
sections throughout other levels.
79

79

00:03:44,770  -->  00:03:48,310
And then the last thing I would do in
my level just here to make sure it's
80

80

00:03:48,310  -->  00:03:51,440
interesting and cool,
I just throw a few more blocks in here.
81

81

00:03:51,440  -->  00:03:56,320
Probably just the level one breakable
blocks, just to make it interesting.
82

82

00:03:56,320  -->  00:04:01,049
Duplicate and then move it across,
while holding control, duplicate,
83

83

00:04:01,049  -->  00:04:02,738
duplicate, duplicate.
84

84

00:04:02,738  -->  00:04:05,473
And bring it all the way down to here,
85

85

00:04:05,473  -->  00:04:10,780
duplicate just to add a little bit
more spice in this particular level.
86

86

00:04:11,810  -->  00:04:15,834
I think that's pretty good, I think I only
just made one more extra block, so for
87

87

00:04:15,834  -->  00:04:18,866
symmetry's sake,
I'll put this block over just in there.
88

88

00:04:18,866  -->  00:04:23,690
Okay, so I've got my level with some
blocks, I think the tuning is pretty good.
89

89

00:04:23,690  -->  00:04:27,155
I'd then play my game a whole bunch of
times over to see whether I think it's
90

90

00:04:27,155  -->  00:04:30,240
interesting, and the right speed,
and is it too easy, too hard?
91

91

00:04:30,240  -->  00:04:34,360
[SOUND] [LAUGH] Okay, maybe I just
answered the question of too hard.
92

92

00:04:34,360  -->  00:04:38,533
But I'm going for quick reactions,
I wanted people to be playing my game,
93

93

00:04:38,533  -->  00:04:40,331
going, what, that was crazy!
94

94

00:04:40,331  -->  00:04:44,410
But I don't want them to be playing
the game saying, aah, this is impossible!
95

95

00:04:44,410  -->  00:04:47,871
So, you can see that I'm still pushing
the ball out way too quickly or
96

96

00:04:47,871  -->  00:04:50,508
what's my game speed at the moment,
is it set at 1?
97

97

00:04:50,508  -->  00:04:54,050
Okay, it's set to 2.61,
that could be an issue.
98

98

00:04:54,050  -->  00:04:58,434
So I'll put it to 1, and then make sure
that the game speed isn't crazy out of
99

99

00:04:58,434  -->  00:05:01,480
control fast, and
now it's way too slow and boring.
100

100

00:05:01,480  -->  00:05:04,599
So I'm going to give the ball
a stronger push, this is the thing,
101

101

00:05:04,599  -->  00:05:07,970
it's backwards and forwards,
tune one thing, tune another thing.
102

102

00:05:07,970  -->  00:05:11,138
Make sure you haven't accidentally
broken something when you tune it, and
103

103

00:05:11,138  -->  00:05:13,178
apply it to the prefab,
just so I don't forget.
104

104

00:05:13,178  -->  00:05:16,511
Click on play, this should be fast and
furious, but not fast and
105

105

00:05:16,511  -->  00:05:19,250
ridiculous, let's see if I
can slow the ball a bit.
106

106

00:05:19,250  -->  00:05:23,098
Okay, that's feeling pretty close, I'm
happy with that amount of, my goodness,
107

107

00:05:23,098  -->  00:05:23,626
where am I?
108

108

00:05:23,626  -->  00:05:27,247
That's going on with my game,
one ball, regular size paddle,
109

109

00:05:27,247  -->  00:05:31,830
it gets up in there, this is cool, I want
the player to fail a number of times.
110

110

00:05:31,830  -->  00:05:34,544
The particle effects are kind of
getting in the way of seeing the ball,
111

111

00:05:34,544  -->  00:05:36,350
I think that's nifty as well,
so I like that.
112

112

00:05:36,350  -->  00:05:40,421
And then, [SOUND], when I hit that last
one, okay, boink, game over, cool,
113

113

00:05:40,421  -->  00:05:41,240
that was good.
114

114

00:05:41,240  -->  00:05:43,928
That was the right sort of pace of
what I'm going for for my game, so
115

115

00:05:43,928  -->  00:05:44,936
I'm going to save that.
116

116

00:05:44,936  -->  00:05:48,813
Make sure that my hierarchy
is arranged nice and neatly,
117

117

00:05:48,813  -->  00:05:53,433
breakable blocks, drop that into blocks,
all looks pretty good.
118

118

00:05:53,433  -->  00:05:56,673
Okay, playspace, great, so
I'm going to save, and for now,
119

119

00:05:56,673  -->  00:05:58,482
I'm just looking at the game play.
120

120

00:05:58,482  -->  00:06:01,837
I'm not looking at the level flow from
level to level to level to make sure
121

121

00:06:01,837  -->  00:06:02,780
that's all tight.
122

122

00:06:02,780  -->  00:06:05,752
I'll do that in upcoming playtesting,
but for now,
123

123

00:06:05,752  -->  00:06:08,402
I'm just looking at
the core gameplay moment.
124

124

00:06:08,402  -->  00:06:11,242
So the challenge for you,
as always, here's my challenge,
125

125

00:06:11,242  -->  00:06:13,166
this is what I'd love
to see you get up to.
126

126

00:06:13,166  -->  00:06:15,753
Tune and playtest your game,
find the turning that you like,
127

127

00:06:15,753  -->  00:06:18,004
as I did, go through that process of,
is it too fast?
128

128

00:06:18,004  -->  00:06:19,150
Is it too slow?
129

129

00:06:19,150  -->  00:06:19,944
Is it too crazy?
130

130

00:06:19,944  -->  00:06:20,849
Do I like it?
131

131

00:06:20,849  -->  00:06:24,730
Get to the point where, yes,
you've learned from your extreme tuning.
132

132

00:06:24,730  -->  00:06:29,063
But you don't necessary have to leave the
extreme-ness in there if it's not helping
133

133

00:06:29,063  -->  00:06:29,677
your game.
134

134

00:06:29,677  -->  00:06:33,910
Make sure the game isn't impossible,
as I said, make sure the game
135

135

00:06:33,910  -->  00:06:38,460
isn't boringly easy, that's no fun either,
and ask a friend to play.
136

136

00:06:38,460  -->  00:06:41,440
That would be the big challenge,
I'd highly recommend you do that.
137

137

00:06:41,440  -->  00:06:45,740
This is the stage of the course where
you should be a little bit vulnerable.
138

138

00:06:45,740  -->  00:06:48,817
And ask a friend, someone that you
trust or a family member or a parent or
139

139

00:06:48,817  -->  00:06:50,837
a sibling, say, hey,
just give this a play.
140

140

00:06:50,837  -->  00:06:53,197
And see if you can survive for
more than ten seconds, or
141

141

00:06:53,197  -->  00:06:55,728
whatever the challenge might
be that you give to someone.
142

142

00:06:55,728  -->  00:06:58,070
So there's the challenge,
jump in, take that on.
143

143

00:06:58,070  -->  00:07:02,079
In the next video, I'm going to give you a
tool, a little technique that will help us
144

144

00:07:02,079  -->  00:07:04,744
playtest through our levels
a little bit more quickly.
145

145

00:07:04,744  -->  00:07:06,947
And to be able to test
out different scenarios.
146

146

00:07:06,947  -->  00:07:09,100
So great work, and
I'll see you again soon.
