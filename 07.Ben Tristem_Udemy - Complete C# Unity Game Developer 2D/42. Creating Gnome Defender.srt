00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,365
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,365  -->  00:00:07,700
In this video,
we're creating ourselves a third defender.
3

3

00:00:07,700  -->  00:00:10,200
It's the gnome who's gonna sit there and
blink.
4

4

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:12,500
I'm assuming because it's kind
of funny the way he blinks.
5

5

00:00:12,500  -->  00:00:13,030
Blink, blink, blink.
6

6

00:00:13,030  -->  00:00:15,331
And then he's gonna bounce and
shoot, fire his ax.
7

7

00:00:15,331  -->  00:00:18,952
The ax is gonna explode the lizards,
and everything is gonna be amazing!
8

8

00:00:18,952  -->  00:00:20,510
So let's jump in and get started.
9

9

00:00:20,510  -->  00:00:22,231
Okay we need more defenders!
10

10

00:00:22,231  -->  00:00:23,276
What defenders do we need?
11

11

00:00:23,276  -->  00:00:25,043
Well, here's the defenders
I'm going to have.
12

12

00:00:25,043  -->  00:00:26,064
Just four of them for me.
13

13

00:00:26,064  -->  00:00:28,060
You can five or 10 or a 100!
14

14

00:00:28,060  -->  00:00:29,630
But I've got trophy, cactus,
15

15

00:00:29,630  -->  00:00:33,800
we've made already gnome, and a gravestone
we're also putting into the game.
16

16

00:00:33,800  -->  00:00:37,300
I've just got a little table here
to show the purpose of them, so
17

17

00:00:37,300  -->  00:00:39,700
we're not just kind of
slapping them in willy nilly.
18

18

00:00:39,700  -->  00:00:45,470
You can see that we've got cost, medium,
low, high, medium, damage, and health.
19

19

00:00:45,470  -->  00:00:46,960
So let's see.
20

20

00:00:46,960  -->  00:00:50,490
The difference between these is
going to be my two projectile
21

21

00:00:50,490  -->  00:00:51,830
defenders at the moment.
22

22

00:00:51,830  -->  00:00:54,650
So the cactus is basically low and
cheap and squishy and
23

23

00:00:54,650  -->  00:00:57,880
the gnome is expensive and
does a ton of damage.
24

24

00:00:57,880  -->  00:01:02,374
The gravestone is gonna be something
that doesn't shoot but just acts as
25

25

00:01:02,374  -->  00:01:06,941
a block to block the attackers so that
it buys you some time so that your guys
26

26

00:01:06,941  -->  00:01:11,819
behind the line can shoot them and
obviously the trophy generates resources.
27

27

00:01:11,819  -->  00:01:14,589
So I'm gonna issue you
a big old challenge.
28

28

00:01:14,589  -->  00:01:17,731
This is gonna be a mega challenge
that brings all your knowledge and
29

29

00:01:17,731  -->  00:01:20,700
learning together,
is to make the gnome from scratch.
30

30

00:01:20,700  -->  00:01:24,890
And if you don't have it,
you might wanna go grab the gnome.
31

31

00:01:24,890  -->  00:01:25,790
Let's see, where is it?
32

32

00:01:25,790  -->  00:01:27,840
The Gnome Sprite.
33

33

00:01:27,840  -->  00:01:31,710
I've got Gnome Idle just here that I'll
be using for, obviously the idle, and
34

34

00:01:31,710  -->  00:01:35,570
also the Gnome Hop that I'll be using for
when the gnome is attacking.
35

35

00:01:35,570  -->  00:01:36,900
So Just to point that out.
36

36

00:01:36,900  -->  00:01:40,530
I've got it in my Sprite folder
that I gave you way back early on
37

37

00:01:40,530  -->  00:01:42,590
in this section of the course,
so you should have that as well.
38

38

00:01:42,590  -->  00:01:44,750
If you're not using the gnome,
you can use whatever you want.
39

39

00:01:44,750  -->  00:01:46,930
You can go find your own sprite sheet for
that.
40

40

00:01:46,930  -->  00:01:50,620
But here is the big old challenge,
and here are the steps as a reminder.
41

41

00:01:50,620  -->  00:01:53,270
If you wanna just go ahead and
create it now without a reminder of
42

42

00:01:53,270  -->  00:01:56,090
the steps to see how good your
memory's been, that's awesome.
43

43

00:01:56,090  -->  00:01:59,940
But if you want the steps, here they are,
so create the game object,
44

44

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:03,950
add the animator, collider and the scripts
that we've created for our defenders.
45

45

00:02:03,950  -->  00:02:07,970
Create the child object with
renderer that will be called body.
46

46

00:02:07,970  -->  00:02:11,610
Create the Animator Controller, create
required animations with events, for
47

47

00:02:11,610  -->  00:02:13,820
example, the idol and the shooting.
48

48

00:02:13,820  -->  00:02:17,880
Add the animations and
transitions to the Animator Controller.
49

49

00:02:17,880  -->  00:02:21,870
Create the parameters and
conditions for the transitions.
50

50

00:02:21,870  -->  00:02:23,070
It's all rhyming.
51

51

00:02:23,070  -->  00:02:26,670
And to add the button to the UI
with the image and script so
52

52

00:02:26,670  -->  00:02:29,740
you can buy that particular defender.
53

53

00:02:29,740  -->  00:02:33,140
Finally to tune the health,
the damage and the cost.
54

54

00:02:33,140  -->  00:02:37,126
And obviously if you get stuck or
want a reminder, then go check out what we
55

55

00:02:37,126  -->  00:02:41,262
did for the cactus and if you look at
that, and say, I could not be bothered.
56

56

00:02:41,262  -->  00:02:44,674
Well, first of all, tsk,
tsk, but no problem,
57

57

00:02:44,674  -->  00:02:50,143
you could just copy your cactus and change
its color to yellow and call it gnome.
58

58

00:02:50,143  -->  00:02:51,068
So there you go.
59

59

00:02:51,068  -->  00:02:52,580
You've finished the task.
60

60

00:02:52,580  -->  00:02:56,350
You can do that if you want, you can cheat
or if you want some excellent practice to
61

61

00:02:56,350  -->  00:03:01,260
really cement this knowledge, then go
ahead and create your gnome defender now.
62

62

00:03:01,260  -->  00:03:02,280
See you back here when you're done.
63

63

00:03:04,110  -->  00:03:06,330
Okay, let's make ourselves
a Gnome Defender.
64

64

00:03:06,330  -->  00:03:08,260
Right click, create, empty.
65

65

00:03:08,260  -->  00:03:13,276
We'll call this Gnome, and
we'll give the gnome a body at this point.
66

66

00:03:13,276  -->  00:03:15,220
We'll call the body, Body.
67

67

00:03:15,220  -->  00:03:16,480
Great name for body.
68

68

00:03:16,480  -->  00:03:17,820
And what do we need to do on the gnome?
69

69

00:03:17,820  -->  00:03:23,570
Well, we need to add our scripts so
this is a defender.
70

70

00:03:23,570  -->  00:03:26,660
We also need to, let's use the cactus
as a point of inspiration here.
71

71

00:03:26,660  -->  00:03:30,650
We need a shooter, defender,
Box Collider, and animator okay?
72

72

00:03:30,650  -->  00:03:31,920
That's all pretty good.
73

73

00:03:31,920  -->  00:03:34,790
We could duplicate the cactus but for
74

74

00:03:34,790  -->  00:03:37,360
now I'm just gonna go through
all these individual steps.
75

75

00:03:37,360  -->  00:03:42,950
So shooter, because it will be a shooter,
we want to add ourselves a Box Collider.
76

76

00:03:42,950  -->  00:03:46,670
I'm going to do the Box Collider after
I put the Sprite Renderer on because
77

77

00:03:46,670  -->  00:03:49,550
the Sprite Renderer is going to
give us some shape to it and
78

78

00:03:49,550  -->  00:03:52,565
then the Box Collider knows
what it should be going around.
79

79

00:03:52,565  -->  00:03:54,678
Change this to five.
80

80

00:03:54,678  -->  00:03:57,430
The Sprite we need to go and
slice up our Sprite sheet.
81

81

00:03:57,430  -->  00:03:59,030
Let's slice up our Sprite sheet now.
82

82

00:03:59,030  -->  00:04:03,200
We'll start off with the Gnome iIdle
Sprite sheet and block that out of the way
83

83

00:04:03,200  -->  00:04:10,610
the actual Gnome Idle now Sprite mode
this needs to be multiple click apply.
84

84

00:04:10,610  -->  00:04:14,605
And let's have a look at
our sprite 567 by 150, so
85

85

00:04:14,605  -->  00:04:19,282

86
567: one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven gnomes.
86

87

00:04:19,282  -->  00:04:24,567
Let's get our calculator here,
87

88

00:04:24,567  -->  00:04:29,857
calculate 567 divided by 7.
88

89

00:04:29,857  -->  00:04:30,553
81.
89

90

00:04:30,553  -->  00:04:32,737
So we need to have these 81 wide.
90

91

00:04:32,737  -->  00:04:36,811
So click on Sprite Editor up to Slice.
91

92

00:04:36,811  -->  00:04:40,562
Instead of automatic,
we'll slice by cell size and
92

93

00:04:40,562  -->  00:04:47,020
change this to 81 by whatever the size,
150, that's the size of it, slice.
93

94

00:04:47,020  -->  00:04:49,150
Okay, that all looks pretty good.
94

95

00:04:49,150  -->  00:04:54,690
Got our gnome,
then click on apply that one sliced off.
95

96

00:04:54,690  -->  00:04:56,283
Excellent.
Now while I'm here,
96

97

00:04:56,283  -->  00:04:59,568
I'll go slice up the Gnome Hop,
which is going to be used for
97

98

00:04:59,568  -->  00:05:02,349
our new attack change it
from single to multiple.
98

99

00:05:02,349  -->  00:05:04,919
Click on group down here, apply.
99

100

00:05:04,919  -->  00:05:07,770
I'm going to take click on Sprite editor.
100

101

00:05:07,770  -->  00:05:10,159
And I'm going to take a wild guess and
101

102

00:05:10,159  -->  00:05:14,875
say that this is also a 81 by 150
slice and that looks like it is good.
102

103

00:05:14,875  -->  00:05:16,490
Okay, and click on apply.
103

104

00:05:16,490  -->  00:05:20,450
Now, what do we need to do next?
104

105

00:05:20,450  -->  00:05:22,530
Well, we've got the gnome,
we've got the body.
105

106

00:05:22,530  -->  00:05:25,280
Okay, we need to give it a one sprite, so
106

107

00:05:25,280  -->  00:05:28,380
we're gonna find a Gnome Sprite,
one just there.
107

108

00:05:28,380  -->  00:05:30,250
Gnome Hop 6 is the one I'll be using.
108

109

00:05:31,390  -->  00:05:35,040
He is currently sitting right on top of an
ax, that's why it looked a bit funny and
109

110

00:05:35,040  -->  00:05:36,840
we can see facing the wrong way.
110

111

00:05:36,840  -->  00:05:39,870
First of all, I wanna reset
the transforms, pops him down there.
111

112

00:05:39,870  -->  00:05:45,500
Now I can change the scale to -1,
not -11, -1, all the way over there.
112

113

00:05:45,500  -->  00:05:48,330
Check the gnome body, that needs to be
reset to the transform, as well, so
113

114

00:05:48,330  -->  00:05:49,310
it's right in the middle.
114

115

00:05:49,310  -->  00:05:52,880
Looks like it's now at the 0,0 point,
and the gnome has been flipped.
115

116

00:05:52,880  -->  00:05:53,730
Fantastico.
116

117

00:05:53,730  -->  00:05:58,420
While we're here, I'm also going to
create an empty and call this gun.
117

118

00:05:58,420  -->  00:06:00,140
I don't think I had that
in my list of things.
118

119

00:06:00,140  -->  00:06:01,020
Did I have that in my list?
119

120

00:06:01,020  -->  00:06:03,070
I don't have that, so
it's a little bit sneaky.
120

121

00:06:03,070  -->  00:06:06,230
We'll pop this in, gun,
it's just an empty game object.
121

122

00:06:06,230  -->  00:06:08,800
We need to put it wherever we
think the ax should be coming out.
122

123

00:06:08,800  -->  00:06:11,705
Technically, it doesn't really have
any hands [LAUGH] in the way we're
123

124

00:06:11,705  -->  00:06:12,306
using the gnome.
124

125

00:06:12,306  -->  00:06:14,358
So we'll have it come out of his eyeballs,
how's that?
125

126

00:06:14,358  -->  00:06:17,840
An eyeball ax-throwing gnome, perfect.
126

127

00:06:17,840  -->  00:06:19,800
So back over here in the gnome,
we need an animator.
127

128

00:06:21,010  -->  00:06:24,210
Animator, how do I spell animator,
A-N-I-M.
128

129

00:06:24,210  -->  00:06:29,850
And also, our Box Collider 2D that
fits around the gnome pretty well.
129

130

00:06:29,850  -->  00:06:32,890
I'm gonna drag my gnome into
where the center point would be.
130

131

00:06:32,890  -->  00:06:33,910
That gnome's too big, isn't he?
131

132

00:06:33,910  -->  00:06:35,370
He doesn't fit in our spot there.
132

133

00:06:35,370  -->  00:06:36,670
So, how do we change that?
133

134

00:06:36,670  -->  00:06:41,810
Go back to our Gnome Hop and
pixels per unit, we'll make this one 50,
134

135

00:06:41,810  -->  00:06:46,570
and click on apply, and then,
yeah, that looks better.
135

136

00:06:46,570  -->  00:06:47,700
It's just a little gnome there.
136

137

00:06:47,700  -->  00:06:53,166
We'll make sure we change the idle
while we're here to 150, as well,
137

138

00:06:53,166  -->  00:06:58,102
pixels per unit, click apply now,
back to the Gnome game object,
138

139

00:06:58,102  -->  00:07:03,037
we've got our Box Collider which
fits the entire, three and one,
139

140

00:07:03,037  -->  00:07:04,746
fits the entire area.
140

141

00:07:04,746  -->  00:07:05,661
Yep, that's good.
141

142

00:07:05,661  -->  00:07:07,186
Wunderbar.
142

143

00:07:07,186  -->  00:07:11,136
And we have our animator,
we have to now click on the gnome,
143

144

00:07:11,136  -->  00:07:13,640
click on our Animation, Create.
144

145

00:07:13,640  -->  00:07:14,950
We'll create our idle.
145

146

00:07:14,950  -->  00:07:19,910
So find Assets, Animations Defenders, and
146

147

00:07:19,910  -->  00:07:23,750
this will be Gnome Idle.
147

148

00:07:23,750  -->  00:07:28,907
And then click add Property
within our animation window here,
148

149

00:07:28,907  -->  00:07:33,867
surf our way down to body,
Sprite Renderer, find the plus,
149

150

00:07:33,867  -->  00:07:39,117
click on plus for Sprite Renderer,
grab our Gnome Idle 0 to 6,
150

151

00:07:39,117  -->  00:07:42,448
drag those into our animation, Boink!
151

152

00:07:42,448  -->  00:07:42,953
Excellent.
152

153

00:07:42,953  -->  00:07:45,260
Delete these last two down the end
that we don't need anymore.
153

154

00:07:45,260  -->  00:07:48,680
Change the frames to 24 so
it's a similar speed.
154

155

00:07:48,680  -->  00:07:49,491
See how that looks.
155

156

00:07:49,491  -->  00:07:50,593
He's just sitting there blinking.
156

157

00:07:50,593  -->  00:07:51,853
Well, that's kind of neat, isn't it?
157

158

00:07:51,853  -->  00:07:53,924
He did tilt, I wonder what that was about.
158

159

00:07:53,924  -->  00:07:55,780
Is that blinking too fast?
159

160

00:07:55,780  -->  00:07:57,169
Probably blinking a bit too fast.
160

161

00:07:57,169  -->  00:08:01,413
So grab all these, pull the little
blue handily things out a little bit.
161

162

00:08:01,413  -->  00:08:03,040
Blink, blink, blink.
162

163

00:08:03,040  -->  00:08:04,120
That's creepy, isn't it?
163

164

00:08:04,120  -->  00:08:05,595
I like it.
Okay.
164

165

00:08:05,595  -->  00:08:07,643
I'm going to save because I
haven't saved for awhile.
165

166

00:08:07,643  -->  00:08:09,372
I've got him seen in there doing his idle.
166

167

00:08:09,372  -->  00:08:12,671
We need to make another animation, so
167

168

00:08:12,671  -->  00:08:17,440
click on Gnome Idle,
create New Clip, Gnome attack.
168

169

00:08:17,440  -->  00:08:19,060
Attack of the Gnomes, excellent.
169

170

00:08:19,060  -->  00:08:21,260
Change the frames to 24.
170

171

00:08:21,260  -->  00:08:25,110
Now, add Property, surf down to body,
171

172

00:08:25,110  -->  00:08:29,730
click on Sprite Renderer, scroll down to
the bottom, click the plus next to Sprite.
172

173

00:08:30,940  -->  00:08:36,180
Grab all of the frame from the Gnome Hop,
drag those in from the first frame
173

174

00:08:36,180  -->  00:08:40,520
onwards, delete the two down the end,
and this is probably too fast as well.
174

175

00:08:40,520  -->  00:08:42,293
But all that's Baloo doop do doop do doop.
175

176

00:08:42,293  -->  00:08:43,931
We'll see how it goes,
if it's a little bit slower.
176

177

00:08:43,931  -->  00:08:46,952
I could just change the samples here,
but I want to keep them all
177

178

00:08:46,952  -->  00:08:50,043
24 just in case we need to do that for
some reason at some point.
178

179

00:08:50,043  -->  00:08:54,184
So we'll take this up to the full
one second boop be doop be doop.
179

180

00:08:54,184  -->  00:08:57,057
Now that's too slow, looks down,
back to what we had before bouncy bounce.
180

181

00:08:57,057  -->  00:08:57,877
Okay, great.
181

182

00:08:57,877  -->  00:08:58,425
I like it.
182

183

00:08:58,425  -->  00:08:59,295
I'm a gnome.
183

184

00:08:59,295  -->  00:09:00,585
That's what he's gonna be
doing when he's throwing.
184

185

00:09:00,585  -->  00:09:03,900
You could be changing
the color a little bit.
185

186

00:09:03,900  -->  00:09:06,288
As he throws is, so
where is he gonna throw it?
186

187

00:09:06,288  -->  00:09:10,428
He's gonna throw it pretty fast
if we have it every single frame.
187

188

00:09:10,428  -->  00:09:12,140
This one is gonna be throw, throw, throw,
188

189

00:09:12,140  -->  00:09:14,280
so what I might do here,
we haven't done this before.
189

190

00:09:14,280  -->  00:09:18,310
But I'm gonna grab these frames and move
my slider along, I'm gonna go copy, and
190

191

00:09:18,310  -->  00:09:19,450
then paste.
191

192

00:09:19,450  -->  00:09:21,590
So it's copying and
pasting the same frames that we've got.
192

193

00:09:21,590  -->  00:09:23,210
So I'm doing two loops of this.
193

194

00:09:23,210  -->  00:09:26,570
You know what I'm gonna do,
one I'm gonna do two more loops, so
194

195

00:09:26,570  -->  00:09:30,660
I'm gonna highlight all the frames again,
copy, and then paste.
195

196

00:09:30,660  -->  00:09:35,015
So now I have one, two,
three, four loops of it.
196

197

00:09:35,015  -->  00:09:38,475
But the reason I'm doing it this way
instead of just allowing it to loop,
197

198

00:09:38,475  -->  00:09:42,275
and loop, and loop is cuz I wanna have my
animation event somewhere along here is
198

199

00:09:42,275  -->  00:09:44,091
I've got two seconds of animation and
199

200

00:09:44,091  -->  00:09:47,126
this way I can have the gnome
shooting within that two seconds.
200

201

00:09:47,126  -->  00:09:50,940
So, probably near the start
of when he wakes up and says,
201

202

00:09:50,940  -->  00:09:56,272
"I'm now going to attack around about
here." I'll put in animation event.
202

203

00:09:56,272  -->  00:09:59,165
And then when I click here
in that animation event,
203

204

00:09:59,165  -->  00:10:01,397
we will say fire is what we're firing.
204

205

00:10:01,397  -->  00:10:05,765
Excellent, he's gonna be bing
at that point, shooting his ax.
205

206

00:10:05,765  -->  00:10:07,330
We'll have to create for him.
206

207

00:10:07,330  -->  00:10:08,740
So back over into the gnome.
207

208

00:10:08,740  -->  00:10:11,620
I know I'm bouncing around a little bit,
I'm not necessarily following the order
208

209

00:10:11,620  -->  00:10:13,850
that I've given you but
we're getting all the bits and pieces in.
209

210

00:10:13,850  -->  00:10:16,310
And this is often how it works, you're
kind of like, now I need one of these!
210

211

00:10:16,310  -->  00:10:19,680
Now I need one of those so
that all I need a projectile.
211

212

00:10:19,680  -->  00:10:21,282
Click on our selector.
212

213

00:10:21,282  -->  00:10:22,479
Find the ax.
213

214

00:10:22,479  -->  00:10:25,350
You're not gonna drag it in from
I haven't made it as a prefab.
214

215

00:10:25,350  -->  00:10:26,390
Sorry everyone.
215

216

00:10:26,390  -->  00:10:28,250
So here's my projectile's folder.
216

217

00:10:28,250  -->  00:10:31,210
Drag the ax into our prefab's folder.
217

218

00:10:31,210  -->  00:10:34,170
Delete the ax from our scene because
we don't want that kind of hanging
218

219

00:10:34,170  -->  00:10:35,500
around in there.
219

220

00:10:35,500  -->  00:10:38,090
Now, when I click on my
gnome game object for
220

221

00:10:38,090  -->  00:10:42,570
a projectile I am going to drag in the ax
prefab I just created, link in that, and
221

222

00:10:42,570  -->  00:10:50,060
for gun, I'm dragging that in from
the gnome object that we've got to gun.
222

223

00:10:50,060  -->  00:10:54,300
So from hierarchy over into our
inspector we've got ax and we have gun.
223

224

00:10:54,300  -->  00:10:58,050
What we need to do at this point is,
under defender's folder,
224

225

00:10:58,050  -->  00:11:02,010
I'm gonna drag my gnome into
prefab the entire gnome.
225

226

00:11:02,010  -->  00:11:05,090
Okay, great, so let's have a look at his
animator and see what's going on here.
226

227

00:11:05,090  -->  00:11:05,930
Gnome Idle.
227

228

00:11:05,930  -->  00:11:08,460
That's good, but
he's not going into gnome attack.
228

229

00:11:08,460  -->  00:11:12,350
So from Gnome Idle we want
to create a transition.
229

230

00:11:12,350  -->  00:11:13,980
My gnome attack animation's
in there already.
230

231

00:11:13,980  -->  00:11:16,150
If yours is not in there,
you might need to drag it in.
231

232

00:11:16,150  -->  00:11:17,830
But click on Gnome Idol.
232

233

00:11:17,830  -->  00:11:20,130
Right click make transition
over to Gnome Attack.
233

234

00:11:20,130  -->  00:11:24,070
While we're here, right click on Gnome
attack, make transition back to Gnome Idol
234

235

00:11:24,070  -->  00:11:27,050
on the first transition line
that goes from idol to attack,
235

236

00:11:27,050  -->  00:11:31,890
I'm going to open up my settings, find the
transition duration, change that to zero,
236

237

00:11:31,890  -->  00:11:36,530
just so it's snapping nice and neat from
one to the other, turn off has exit time.
237

238

00:11:36,530  -->  00:11:39,180
Remember we don't want it to finish
the attack completely before it
238

239

00:11:39,180  -->  00:11:40,550
transitions back.
239

240

00:11:40,550  -->  00:11:44,620
So click on the plus in my animator
window to add a new parameter,
240

241

00:11:44,620  -->  00:11:49,790
make this a ball click is attacking as
we did last time, so it's the same.
241

242

00:11:49,790  -->  00:11:52,990
Now when I'm over in my inspector,
we've got the conditions down in
242

243

00:11:52,990  -->  00:11:56,630
the bottom right and I click on plus,
his attacking is true.
243

244

00:11:56,630  -->  00:11:58,380
Yes, that's exactly what we want.
244

245

00:11:58,380  -->  00:12:02,160
Now let's do the other transition
from attack back to idle.
245

246

00:12:02,160  -->  00:12:02,920
Click on that.
246

247

00:12:02,920  -->  00:12:05,750
Change your transition duration
to zero as we've done before.
247

248

00:12:05,750  -->  00:12:07,760
Click the plus under conditions.
248

249

00:12:07,760  -->  00:12:09,310
His attacking is what?
249

250

00:12:09,310  -->  00:12:11,070
It's going to be false.
250

251

00:12:11,070  -->  00:12:14,190
Excellent, okay, that seems like
we've got most of it in there.
251

252

00:12:14,190  -->  00:12:17,310
Do a save and click on Play just to see.
252

253

00:12:17,310  -->  00:12:20,612
Actually, you know what, these spawners
are driving me a little bit crazy, so
253

254

00:12:20,612  -->  00:12:22,647
over on spawners,
highlight all the spawners.
254

255

00:12:22,647  -->  00:12:26,762
I'm gonna change this random from 2 to 5.
255

256

00:12:26,762  -->  00:12:30,795
Okay, now click on Play.
256

257

00:12:30,795  -->  00:12:32,930
I'll give it some randomness in here.
257

258

00:12:32,930  -->  00:12:35,950
Somewhere between two and five seconds,
someone in this bottom lane's gonna jump
258

259

00:12:35,950  -->  00:12:39,200
in and bounce bounce bounce, and
he shoots the ax, wonderful.
259

260

00:12:39,200  -->  00:12:41,520
The ax is not hitting and destroying,
260

261

00:12:41,520  -->  00:12:44,078
we probably don't have a collider on
the ax, not a problem at this point.
261

262

00:12:44,078  -->  00:12:47,770
And the ax I think looks pretty good,
might be a little bit high, but
262

263

00:12:47,770  -->  00:12:50,370
I think that's looking
pretty nice at the moment.
263

264

00:12:50,370  -->  00:12:52,320
So what do we need to
do to finish this off?
264

265

00:12:52,320  -->  00:12:56,970
Let's go and have a look at our
ax prefabs, projectile, ax.
265

266

00:12:56,970  -->  00:13:01,475
Do we have, we do not,
we need a Box Collider on our ax.
266

267

00:13:01,475  -->  00:13:03,540
We'll assume that it
put the Collider on ax.
267

268

00:13:03,540  -->  00:13:04,745
Now, let's drag in, have a look.
268

269

00:13:04,745  -->  00:13:05,518
Where's the Collider?
269

270

00:13:05,518  -->  00:13:06,649
That Collider is quite massive.
270

271

00:13:06,649  -->  00:13:07,637
Good thing we had a look at it.
271

272

00:13:07,637  -->  00:13:10,273
Is that ax the right size?
272

273

00:13:10,273  -->  00:13:12,591
Okay, something funky
going on with the ax here.
273

274

00:13:12,591  -->  00:13:15,460
I think it's because it's put way,
way back.
274

275

00:13:15,460  -->  00:13:17,902
I'm in 3D mode, that's not smart, Rick.
275

276

00:13:17,902  -->  00:13:21,470
Okay, so my ax is gone and
been dropped in at a weird spot.
276

277

00:13:21,470  -->  00:13:23,950
That's not a problem because
it's just the prefab,
277

278

00:13:23,950  -->  00:13:29,670
but we'll make it zero, zero,
zero, and then apply that.
278

279

00:13:29,670  -->  00:13:33,440
Okay, now when we have a look at this ax,
Box Collider, that's what we're doing.
279

280

00:13:33,440  -->  00:13:36,750
Click on the Box Collider, bring it
in nice and tight on the ax, just so
280

281

00:13:36,750  -->  00:13:41,030
it's not bumping anything in other
lanes that it's not supposed to.
281

282

00:13:41,030  -->  00:13:45,350
Box wider and box, you could have it as
a spherical Box Collider, like a circle.
282

283

00:13:45,350  -->  00:13:48,130
That'll be fine as well, but
I'm just gonna do it as a box for now.
283

284

00:13:48,130  -->  00:13:51,434
Okay, looking pretty
tight on the ax there.
284

285

00:13:51,434  -->  00:13:54,220
Just delete the ax from the scene.
285

286

00:13:54,220  -->  00:13:58,780
Let's check that the ax works,
save ourselves the upset of if it
286

287

00:13:58,780  -->  00:14:01,420
flies through the creatures later on and
we haven't tested it.
287

288

00:14:01,420  -->  00:14:02,810
He's sitting there blinking.
288

289

00:14:02,810  -->  00:14:04,690
Somebody in my lane excitement alert,
289

290

00:14:04,690  -->  00:14:08,580
alert, bonk, passes right through
probably cuz it's not a trigger.
290

291

00:14:08,580  -->  00:14:10,630
Where is my ax?
291

292

00:14:10,630  -->  00:14:11,751
Drop it into the scene.
292

293

00:14:11,751  -->  00:14:12,870
What do we go going on here?
293

294

00:14:12,870  -->  00:14:16,290
Box Collider we haven't got,
is triggered selected.
294

295

00:14:16,290  -->  00:14:17,400
Okay now!
295

296

00:14:17,400  -->  00:14:22,490
Actually you know our collider
because Rick is a dunderhead,
296

297

00:14:22,490  -->  00:14:24,150
didn't apply to the pre fab.
297

298

00:14:24,150  -->  00:14:26,590
I think we should rename
this entire course
298

299

00:14:26,590  -->  00:14:29,150
Rick forgets to apply
things back to the pre fab.
299

300

00:14:29,150  -->  00:14:30,902
What do you recon?
300

301

00:14:30,902  -->  00:14:33,239
Now we'll apply back to the prefab, and
301

302

00:14:33,239  -->  00:14:36,549
we'll move this ax aside just
in case we do need it again.
302

303

00:14:36,549  -->  00:14:39,702
Hopefully we don't, hopefully we've now
got everything buttoned up with the ax and
303

304

00:14:39,702  -->  00:14:42,360
actually getting to getting
putting the gnome button on there.
304

305

00:14:42,360  -->  00:14:44,110
So that guy is doing his thing down there.
305

306

00:14:44,110  -->  00:14:45,080
He said, I'm an ax.
306

307

00:14:45,080  -->  00:14:46,752
Got his ax is Kaboom!
307

308

00:14:46,752  -->  00:14:47,422
Kapowie.
308

309

00:14:47,422  -->  00:14:48,740
Wonderful, that works.
309

310

00:14:48,740  -->  00:14:52,015
Great, now we can get review,
thanks to your service.
310

311

00:14:52,015  -->  00:14:54,700
Ax, the last thing we're
gonna do is create a what?
311

312

00:14:54,700  -->  00:14:56,610
Create a button.
312

313

00:14:56,610  -->  00:14:57,990
Okay, so how do we do that?
313

314

00:14:57,990  -->  00:15:00,479
Over into our buttons area.
314

315

00:15:00,479  -->  00:15:06,831
I'm going to Click on Background,
open that up.
315

316

00:15:06,831  -->  00:15:08,260
We've got Cactus and Trophy.
316

317

00:15:08,260  -->  00:15:10,470
I'm gonna duplicate this cuz I
think they're pretty similar.
317

318

00:15:10,470  -->  00:15:12,280
So Ctrl+D to duplicate.
318

319

00:15:12,280  -->  00:15:14,970
It's not Trophy, it's a Gnome.
319

320

00:15:14,970  -->  00:15:20,510
And then Sprite Renderer instead of
being Trophy needs to be a gnome,
320

321

00:15:20,510  -->  00:15:23,260
find a gnome, find a gnome.
321

322

00:15:23,260  -->  00:15:25,487
Okay, this Gnome Hop 5 should do us.
322

323

00:15:25,487  -->  00:15:28,540
Double click on that,
drag along to the right.
323

324

00:15:28,540  -->  00:15:32,010
It's a little bit bigger than what we
need, so just within this window here,
324

325

00:15:32,010  -->  00:15:38,620
I'm going to hit my R key, just scroll it
all down a little bit on the entire gnome.
325

326

00:15:38,620  -->  00:15:40,470
The Box Collide has
scrolled down as well so
326

327

00:15:40,470  -->  00:15:46,020
I will make that take up
most of the area of the box.
327

328

00:15:46,020  -->  00:15:47,830
Whoops, goodness me.
328

329

00:15:47,830  -->  00:15:48,770
Goodness me.
329

330

00:15:48,770  -->  00:15:50,910
Click on Edit Collider again.
330

331

00:15:50,910  -->  00:15:51,649
Open up, open up.
331

332

00:15:53,090  -->  00:15:54,400
Okay, cool, you know what?
332

333

00:15:54,400  -->  00:15:57,450
Sprite Renderer, yes, color,
right, Collider, Defender Button.
333

334

00:15:57,450  -->  00:16:01,734
Okay, and then Defender Prefab,
we don't wanna be spawning trophies,
334

335

00:16:01,734  -->  00:16:04,095
we wanna click on that and spawn gnomes.
335

336

00:16:04,095  -->  00:16:07,759
Click Save again, just in case there's a,
I was about to say typhoon.
336

337

00:16:07,759  -->  00:16:09,320
That doesn't make sense, does it?
337

338

00:16:09,320  -->  00:16:10,654
Some sort of blackout is what I meant.
338

339

00:16:10,654  -->  00:16:13,187
Click on gnome,
plonk them around in the scene.
339

340

00:16:13,187  -->  00:16:15,290
Wonderful, they're all
shooting their axes.
340

341

00:16:15,290  -->  00:16:18,950
The axes exploded the lizards, yay,
we've made ourselves another defender.
341

342

00:16:18,950  -->  00:16:21,720
That's really cool, we're starting
to create variety into our game.
342

343

00:16:21,720  -->  00:16:24,680
Let's do a little bit of tuning now so
that we actually have a proper game.
343

344

00:16:24,680  -->  00:16:28,000
We're giving the player tons of
resources at the start, that's okay.
344

345

00:16:28,000  -->  00:16:30,930
What should the cost of our
gnome be at this point?
345

346

00:16:33,240  -->  00:16:37,290
Well maybe I'll go something
like fifty one hundred and
346

347

00:16:37,290  -->  00:16:38,840
two hundred just to see how that feels.
347

348

00:16:38,840  -->  00:16:40,670
The gnome's four times more expensive.
348

349

00:16:40,670  -->  00:16:41,872
Just to see how that goes.
349

350

00:16:41,872  -->  00:16:45,653
So where do we find
the costs of our gnome?
350

351

00:16:45,653  -->  00:16:48,997
I'm pretty sure it's on
the defender itself.
351

352

00:16:48,997  -->  00:16:51,838
So click on Defender, find The Gnome,
352

353

00:16:51,838  -->  00:16:55,722
we're going to have at
the top here star cost 200.
353

354

00:16:55,722  -->  00:16:56,612
Perfect.
354

355

00:16:56,612  -->  00:16:57,480
That's right on the prefab.
355

356

00:16:57,480  -->  00:16:58,820
So we don't need to apply it back.
356

357

00:16:58,820  -->  00:17:02,460
The cactus will now change to 50 and
357

358

00:17:02,460  -->  00:17:06,350
the trophy we will change to,
where's a trophy cost.
358

359

00:17:06,350  -->  00:17:07,620
It is just here.
359

360

00:17:07,620  -->  00:17:09,349
We will leave this a hundred.
360

361

00:17:09,349  -->  00:17:14,471
We'll see how that goes and
then my starting currency.
361

362

00:17:14,471  -->  00:17:18,072
I'm going to leave it as a thousand while
I'm still playing around with it because I
362

363

00:17:18,072  -->  00:17:21,366
don't want you guys to be watching me
not being able to place things down, so
363

364

00:17:21,366  -->  00:17:23,131
we'll leave that at whatever it is now.
364

365

00:17:23,131  -->  00:17:26,532
A thousand, I think we'll just pretend
it's, for example, two hundred so
365

366

00:17:26,532  -->  00:17:28,990
I can place down one gnome and
then I have to sit around and
366

367

00:17:28,990  -->  00:17:32,076
wait and wait and wait and wait or
I could place down say two trophies and
367

368

00:17:32,076  -->  00:17:34,666
wait and wait and wait or
I could place down four cactuses.
368

369

00:17:34,666  -->  00:17:35,438
Okay yes.
369

370

00:17:35,438  -->  00:17:38,640
So that's starting to, we've got some
shape now that things are taking.
370

371

00:17:38,640  -->  00:17:41,190
So good stuff we've got ourselves,
three defenders.
371

372

00:17:41,190  -->  00:17:45,240
I really want that fourth defender so
that we can create a proper system of
372

373

00:17:45,240  -->  00:17:48,170
giving the player choice and having
progressions through a couple of levels.
373

374

00:17:48,170  -->  00:17:52,440
So in the next video, we're gonna create
ourselves a gravestone, or a tombstone,
374

375

00:17:52,440  -->  00:17:55,500
which would be a little bit different
to the shooting defenders, so
375

376

00:17:55,500  -->  00:17:57,470
let's take that on in the next video.
376

377

00:17:57,470  -->  00:17:59,303
Great work, well done!
377

378

00:17:59,303  -->  00:18:02,389
If you've created something that
you think is particularly nifty,
378

379

00:18:02,389  -->  00:18:03,409
then please share it.
379

380

00:18:03,409  -->  00:18:06,495
Now is the perfect time to share in our
discussion so we can have a look at it and
380

381

00:18:06,495  -->  00:18:08,230
see what you've come up with.
381

382

00:18:08,230  -->  00:18:09,900
Okay, great stuff,
I'll see you again shortly.
