00:00:04,366  -->  00:00:09,294
A quick note before we get started, I'm
moving in this section to Unity 2018.2.
3

3

00:00:09,294  -->  00:00:14,226
If you don't have that already then you
can click on Official Releases in the hub
4

4

00:00:14,226  -->  00:00:16,970
and find 2018.2 and download it.
5

5

00:00:16,970  -->  00:00:19,680
You can tell which version we're
using in a section that's up at
6

6

00:00:19,680  -->  00:00:21,800
the top of our slides here, Unity 2018.2.
7

7

00:00:21,800  -->  00:00:26,306
And as I've said a couple of times in
the past, if you're watching this in
8

8

00:00:26,306  -->  00:00:30,885
the future using 2018.3, or
2019, or 2020, no problem,
9

9

00:00:30,885  -->  00:00:35,928
usually things are backwards compatible so
long you have at least 2018.2.
10

10

00:00:35,928  -->  00:00:40,965
Don't try to this course with unity three,
I don't think it will go so well for you.
11

11

00:00:40,965  -->  00:00:44,568
Okay let's jump and talk about the game
design very quickly cuz we've already
12

12

00:00:44,568  -->  00:00:47,528
worked through the core mechanic
of this in a previous section.
13

13

00:00:47,528  -->  00:00:50,920
But if you skip that section, here is
a reminder of the why the core mechanics
14

14

00:00:50,920  -->  00:00:54,471
works, we ask the player to think of
a number between something and something,
15

15

00:00:54,471  -->  00:00:56,420
for example, between 1 and 1,000.
16

16

00:00:56,420  -->  00:01:01,340
Then we give them our guess, which is
basically saying, let's take the upper
17

17

00:01:01,340  -->  00:01:05,460
level and the lower level and divide by 2,
which will guess right in the middle.
18

18

00:01:05,460  -->  00:01:08,920
I'm gonna add a little bit more
sophistication in this section.
19

19

00:01:08,920  -->  00:01:11,090
By adding some randomness to our guest,
20

20

00:01:11,090  -->  00:01:13,810
we'll do that later on in this
section all going to plan.
21

21

00:01:13,810  -->  00:01:17,020
And then we ask the player for
input, we show them our number,
22

22

00:01:17,020  -->  00:01:21,690
we start with 500 and then we say, is it
high, is it low, or did we get it correct?
23

23

00:01:21,690  -->  00:01:22,330
It's a good idea for
24

24

00:01:22,330  -->  00:01:25,990
us to map out our game flow because we'll
have multiple screens, multiple scenes.
25

25

00:01:25,990  -->  00:01:29,780
We start off with our start menu and
you can see I've got some funny images,
26

26

00:01:29,780  -->  00:01:31,180
I'll explain that in a moment.
27

27

00:01:31,180  -->  00:01:34,680
And then we go into our core game,
this is the higher, the lower, or
28

28

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:35,485
you've got it correct.
29

29

00:01:35,485  -->  00:01:39,480
And then we go into our win screen,
once we click play again,
30

30

00:01:39,480  -->  00:01:41,390
we will go back to the start menu.
31

31

00:01:41,390  -->  00:01:44,840
So that's the game flow, it's good to
know how things are flowing in your game,
32

32

00:01:44,840  -->  00:01:46,560
good to know what order things happen in.
33

33

00:01:46,560  -->  00:01:49,090
Our core game design,
the player experience,
34

34

00:01:49,090  -->  00:01:51,420
it's really simple little
game we're creating here but
35

35

00:01:51,420  -->  00:01:55,180
it's always a good idea to think about
what's the experience we're creating.
36

36

00:01:55,180  -->  00:01:58,396
We wanna create something that's joyful,
just fun, just a bit silly,
37

37

00:01:58,396  -->  00:01:59,530
just I guess the thing.
38

38

00:01:59,530  -->  00:02:03,650
And as you can see, I'm going with
some silly images here of myself and
39

39

00:02:03,650  -->  00:02:05,570
Ben, just to spice that up.
40

40

00:02:05,570  -->  00:02:08,700
The core mechanic is think of a number,
we've talked about that already.
41

41

00:02:08,700  -->  00:02:11,530
The theme, a little bit silly,
as I've done here.
42

42

00:02:11,530  -->  00:02:14,670
And then the core game loop,
we now already think of a number,
43

43

00:02:14,670  -->  00:02:15,940
feedback higher and lower.
44

44

00:02:15,940  -->  00:02:19,480
It's good to go through this exercise
even if it's really obvious what you're
45

45

00:02:19,480  -->  00:02:22,590
creating, particularly to think
about what's the player experience.
46

46

00:02:22,590  -->  00:02:25,900
Cuz if all we're doing is
presenting a tech demo to a player,
47

47

00:02:25,900  -->  00:02:27,840
it's not gonna be that interesting.
48

48

00:02:27,840  -->  00:02:30,061
If you're a technical person,
a programmer,
49

49

00:02:30,061  -->  00:02:32,736
you just like getting into the nuts and
bolts of the code.
50

50

00:02:32,736  -->  00:02:37,365
It's good to train a little bit of your
brain to be thinking of, what is joyful,
51

51

00:02:37,365  -->  00:02:42,134
sorry what is the player experience, why
is my player going to enjoy this above and
52

52

00:02:42,134  -->  00:02:44,018
beyond they can click a button?
53

53

00:02:44,018  -->  00:02:45,080
Why are they clicking a button?
54

54

00:02:45,080  -->  00:02:48,950
So this is practicing, in further
sectors we'll get deeper into this, and
55

55

00:02:48,950  -->  00:02:50,703
it will be a lot more relevant, but
56

56

00:02:50,703  -->  00:02:54,222
I just wanted to reinforce this step
of our game design at this point.
57

57

00:02:54,222  -->  00:02:58,044
And your challenge in this lecture,
I want you to come up with a game theme,
58

58

00:02:58,044  -->  00:03:01,698
think of a skin for your game, you can
see why I jump up a few slides here.
59

59

00:03:01,698  -->  00:03:04,417
I've skinned it with Ben and
I with silly wizard hats on,
60

60

00:03:04,417  -->  00:03:08,442
I'm going with this whole kind of wizard
approach fitting with the theme that we've
61

61

00:03:08,442  -->  00:03:10,668
already determined in the past for
this game.
62

62

00:03:10,668  -->  00:03:14,760
It's a wizard approach, so we're these
kind of weird looking wizards with our
63

63

00:03:14,760  -->  00:03:17,820
Elton John got like sunglasses
on I don't know why.
64

64

00:03:17,820  -->  00:03:21,436
Anyway, so I think of the skin for
your game, what is the tone for the voice?
65

65

00:03:21,436  -->  00:03:24,495
So when you have the text on the screen,
66

66

00:03:24,495  -->  00:03:28,589
is it saying I am the supreme
ruler guess the number.
67

67

00:03:28,589  -->  00:03:32,010
Or is it something that's more in
a different character's voice.
68

68

00:03:32,010  -->  00:03:33,800
So what's the tone of the voice?
69

69

00:03:33,800  -->  00:03:37,530
What are the images you're gonna use and
what is the overall style?
70

70

00:03:37,530  -->  00:03:40,515
And if you wanna have a look at
the different colors from our previous
71

71

00:03:40,515  -->  00:03:43,185
section were we talked about colors,
that is all good as well.
72

72

00:03:43,185  -->  00:03:46,145
And then please do share your ideas with
us if you've got something that you think
73

73

00:03:46,145  -->  00:03:47,475
is a bit nifty.
74

74

00:03:47,475  -->  00:03:51,055
If your scratching your head and saying
well I kind of don't really know yet,
75

75

00:03:51,055  -->  00:03:54,780
not a problem, we can implement some of
our game and then you can come up with
76

76

00:03:54,780  -->  00:04:00,140
your skin and your tone and
your approach for it as we move forward.
77

77

00:04:00,140  -->  00:04:03,720
Not a problem, or you can just use
my assets, that is fine as well.
78

78

00:04:03,720  -->  00:04:07,150
Okay great stuff, let's jump into
the next video and start making our game.
