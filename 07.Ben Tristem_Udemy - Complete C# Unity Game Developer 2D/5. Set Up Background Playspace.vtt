00:00:04.006  -->  00:00:08.115
In this video we'll be calculating our
safe zone around our play space and
2

2

00:00:08.115  -->  00:00:12.686
setting up a slightly ugly looking grid,
so we know exactly where our tiles spaces
3

3

00:00:12.686  -->  00:00:15.890
will be, so we know what our
artists should be creating.
4

4

00:00:15.890  -->  00:00:17.440
Let's jump in and get started.
5

5

00:00:17.440  -->  00:00:19.700
Let's start by creating
our game play scene.
6

6

00:00:19.700  -->  00:00:24.335
I'm gonna do that by
duplicating my start scene, and
7

7

00:00:24.335  -->  00:00:27.634
renaming this as Level 1, Level 1.
8

8

00:00:27.634  -->  00:00:30.703
Okay, double-click on that to make sure
that it's the one that we're working on
9

9

00:00:30.703  -->  00:00:31.800
and it's loaded.
10

10

00:00:31.800  -->  00:00:35.221
For now, I don't really need to my Start
Game and Quit, so I'm just gonna hide
11

11

00:00:35.221  -->  00:00:38.800
them, just in case I want to change that
and put some text on the screen later on.
12

12

00:00:38.800  -->  00:00:41.390
Just saves me from having to
recreate them in the future.
13

13

00:00:41.390  -->  00:00:43.890
And the image, rather than
having this frog kind of thing,
14

14

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:48.580
we're going to have our lanes with
our garden kind of theme to it.
15

15

00:00:48.580  -->  00:00:51.975
If you remember our game play screen
from our GDD, we've got our lanes.
16

16

00:00:51.975  -->  00:00:56.781
So five lanes and then by one,
two, three, four, five, six,
17

17

00:00:56.781  -->  00:00:59.420
seven, eight, nine squares.
18

18

00:00:59.420  -->  00:01:02.940
These two squares I intend that
the player can't place within, and
19

19

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:04.260
you can place within these seven.
20

20

00:01:04.260  -->  00:01:07.850
So a little bit of room for resources,
and then room for defenders.
21

21

00:01:07.850  -->  00:01:11.200
And then the attackers are coming in
off-screen, and then going into the base.
22

22

00:01:11.200  -->  00:01:13.460
So for the moment,
I'm just gonna use placeholder art.
23

23

00:01:13.460  -->  00:01:16.603
This image,
I'll click on it on the selector.
24

24

00:01:16.603  -->  00:01:19.675
And then, so I've clicked on
Image over in the Inspector,
25

25

00:01:19.675  -->  00:01:23.615
I've clicked on the selection thingy here,
and then just to click on None.
26

26

00:01:23.615  -->  00:01:25.080
So now it's just white.
27

27

00:01:25.080  -->  00:01:28.830
I'll change this a little bit to green,
just so we remember that it's garden.
28

28

00:01:28.830  -->  00:01:32.580
So there's our green image that we've
got that represents our play space.
29

29

00:01:32.580  -->  00:01:37.090
It's 1920 by 1080, that's our reference
size that we've got for this.
30

30

00:01:37.090  -->  00:01:41.230
Obviously, it's gonna scale up if we're
on a device that has more pixels, and
31

31

00:01:41.230  -->  00:01:43.010
scale down if it's less pixels.
32

32

00:01:43.010  -->  00:01:47.051
What we're mostly interested in,
what is going to happen if we're on
33

33

00:01:47.051  -->  00:01:51.168
a different size, different shape,
so 16:9 goes down to 4:3.
34

34

00:01:51.168  -->  00:01:55.395
It chops off the side because we've got
our canvas setting that we had from our
35

35

00:01:55.395  -->  00:01:58.791
Start Screen we're also using in Level 1,
which is Shrink.
36

36

00:01:58.791  -->  00:02:01.032
I think that's the right way to do this,
so
37

37

00:02:01.032  -->  00:02:03.580
Shrink works well as
chopping off the sides.
38

38

00:02:03.580  -->  00:02:05.780
That means we need to have a safe zone.
39

39

00:02:05.780  -->  00:02:07.561
So just back to 16:9.
40

40

00:02:07.561  -->  00:02:09.510
How do we figure out our safe zone?
41

41

00:02:09.510  -->  00:02:10.960
What exact size do we need?
42

42

00:02:10.960  -->  00:02:12.524
Well, let's jump over here.
43

43

00:02:12.524  -->  00:02:15.437
I've got a little diagram for
calculating our safe zone.
44

44

00:02:15.437  -->  00:02:20.518
We know that our 16:9
is 1920 pixels x 1080.
45

45

00:02:20.518  -->  00:02:23.170
Our 4:3, what is that?
46

46

00:02:23.170  -->  00:02:24.960
How many pixels by how many pixels?
47

47

00:02:24.960  -->  00:02:30.323
Well, we know that for our 16:9,
it's 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080.
48

48

00:02:30.323  -->  00:02:34.347
We know that 4:3 it's also gonna be
1080 cuz it's chopping off the width,
49

49

00:02:34.347  -->  00:02:36.370
it's not chopping off the height.
50

50

00:02:36.370  -->  00:02:38.460
So the height is gonna be 1080.
51

51

00:02:38.460  -->  00:02:43.913
Therefore, what is the length of
our horizontal when we're on 4:3?
52

52

00:02:43.913  -->  00:02:47.925
And once we know that, we know how much
safe zone we need on the right and
53

53

00:02:47.925  -->  00:02:48.950
on the left.
54

54

00:02:48.950  -->  00:02:54.382
So that's gonna be your challenge,
to calculate what exactly
55

55

00:02:54.382  -->  00:03:00.847
in pixels is our width on a 4:3
aspect ratio, if our height is 1080.
56

56

00:03:00.847  -->  00:03:06.296
So take a moment and
calculate that now, if you will.
57

57

00:03:06.296  -->  00:03:09.934
Okay, so if you know the magic formula,
then that's pretty easy to do.
58

58

00:03:09.934  -->  00:03:11.594
But if not, let me explain it.
59

59

00:03:11.594  -->  00:03:16.823
So with 16:9,
another way to say that is as a decimal,
60

60

00:03:16.823  -->  00:03:19.931
as a ratio we can divide 16 by 9.
61

61

00:03:19.931  -->  00:03:24.298
So if I bring up my calculator,
here we say,
62

62

00:03:24.298  -->  00:03:28.202
16 divided by 9 equals 1.777.
63

63

00:03:28.202  -->  00:03:34.797
That's a way of saying that for
every one unit we are high,
64

64

00:03:34.797  -->  00:03:39.249
we are 1.7 units wide for our width.
65

65

00:03:39.249  -->  00:03:41.754
So we get this ratio of 1.77.
66

66

00:03:41.754  -->  00:03:46.698
So then if we were to say,
what is 1,080 times
67

67

00:03:46.698  -->  00:03:50.704
by 1.77777777, it equals,
68

68

00:03:50.704  -->  00:03:56.382
pretty much with some rounding,
it equals 1,920.
69

69

00:03:56.382  -->  00:03:58.845
Okay, so you can see that that works.
70

70

00:03:58.845  -->  00:04:00.165
Now, what does that mean for 4:3?
71

71

00:04:00.165  -->  00:04:04.405
well we take our 1080 So
we take our 4 and we divide by 3.
72

72

00:04:04.405  -->  00:04:06.505
So I think I've got this on my slide.
73

73

00:04:06.505  -->  00:04:10.947
Okay, as a decimal that
is 4/3 = 1.33333333.
74

74

00:04:10.947  -->  00:04:15.120
So that means that our width needs to be
75

75

00:04:15.120  -->  00:04:18.685
1.333333 times as wide as
we are high on the 1080.
76

76

00:04:18.685  -->  00:04:23.540
And if we do our calculation here,
Calc, my calculator keeps going away.
77

77

00:04:23.540  -->  00:04:24.820
No, there it is, good.
78

78

00:04:24.820  -->  00:04:26.170
Now I have two.
79

79

00:04:26.170  -->  00:04:26.670
Excellent.
80

80

00:04:28.050  -->  00:04:30.643
If we do that, we can times this by 1.333.
81

81

00:04:30.643  -->  00:04:37.137
Another way to do it, which I think's
gonna give us less wacky decimals,
82

82

00:04:37.137  -->  00:04:41.260
is to say 1080 times by 4 divided by 3.
83

83

00:04:41.260  -->  00:04:43.605
That's the same as times by 1.33.
84

84

00:04:43.605  -->  00:04:46.340
We're just doing it the manual way,
times by 4.
85

85

00:04:46.340  -->  00:04:49.710
So times by 4 divided by 3.
86

86

00:04:49.710  -->  00:04:55.567
That gives us 1,440 as our width
along our horizontal, 1,440.
87

87

00:04:55.567  -->  00:04:56.610
So that's how we calculate.
88

88

00:04:56.610  -->  00:05:00.806
And so therefore, we need 1920 minus 1440.
89

89

00:05:00.806  -->  00:05:05.874
Again with our calculator, so 1920-
90

90

00:05:05.874  -->  00:05:13.349
1440 means that this plus this
is going to add up to 480.
91

91

00:05:13.349  -->  00:05:16.360
We'll divide that by 2 to
find what each of these are.
92

92

00:05:16.360  -->  00:05:21.909
That means that the right side 240
pixels and the left side is 240
93

93

00:05:21.909  -->  00:05:26.910
pixels cuz 240 plus 1440
plus 240 equals 1920.
94

94

00:05:26.910  -->  00:05:28.538
Okay, there we go.
95

95

00:05:28.538  -->  00:05:29.130
That's cool.
96

96

00:05:29.130  -->  00:05:31.250
The main number we need
to know here now is 1440.
97

97

00:05:31.250  -->  00:05:34.908
Let's jump back over into Unity, and we're
going to make ourselves a little play
98

98

00:05:34.908  -->  00:05:36.723
space, a safe zone we'll put in there.
99

99

00:05:36.723  -->  00:05:41.583
The way we're gonna do that is by
duplicating our image, so I Ctrl+D,
100

100

00:05:41.583  -->  00:05:42.480
duplicate.
101

101

00:05:42.480  -->  00:05:48.262
This one, I'll rename, instead of Image,
I'll say this is Background.
102

102

00:05:48.262  -->  00:05:49.830
Yeah, Background is good for now.
103

103

00:05:49.830  -->  00:05:51.690
And then this other new image
that I've put in there,
104

104

00:05:51.690  -->  00:05:54.640
I'm gonna say this is our Safe Zone.
105

105

00:05:55.770  -->  00:06:00.189
Safe Zone, and we need to change the safe
zone, you can see here we've got width and
106

106

00:06:00.189  -->  00:06:00.704
height.
107

107

00:06:00.704  -->  00:06:04.990
I'm gonna change this to 1440,
and I'm gonna leave it at 1080.
108

108

00:06:04.990  -->  00:06:09.990
Change the Color to be a bluey kind
of color, and drop the transparency.
109

109

00:06:09.990  -->  00:06:12.505
Nah, I'll leave the blue out for
now, for the moment.
110

110

00:06:12.505  -->  00:06:16.965
So there you can see we've got our regular
background and our safe play zone.
111

111

00:06:16.965  -->  00:06:21.425
Now if we were to get in there and
say, hmm, okay, well, how many units?
112

112

00:06:21.425  -->  00:06:24.025
What is the width of one of our squares?
113

113

00:06:24.025  -->  00:06:25.835
So, we need to have our squares.
114

114

00:06:25.835  -->  00:06:27.315
Back to my GDD.
115

115

00:06:27.315  -->  00:06:29.924
[SOUND] Okay.
116

116

00:06:29.924  -->  00:06:34.370
So we wanna have nine
squares in our safe zone.
117

117

00:06:34.370  -->  00:06:37.130
So we know absolutely,
no matter what device the player is on,
118

118

00:06:37.130  -->  00:06:41.070
they will see these squares,
these nine by five.
119

119

00:06:41.070  -->  00:06:42.910
They're gonna see those.
120

120

00:06:42.910  -->  00:06:47.960
Okay, so we need to calculate what is
the width of one of these squares, so
121

121

00:06:47.960  -->  00:06:51.820
that we can tell our
artist what to create or
122

122

00:06:51.820  -->  00:06:54.500
we can create that ourselves
in terms of these squares.
123

123

00:06:54.500  -->  00:06:55.640
So how do we calculate that?
124

124

00:06:55.640  -->  00:06:58.110
Well, that one is going
to be straight forward.
125

125

00:06:58.110  -->  00:07:02.440
If we have nine squares and
we know that the width is 1440,
126

126

00:07:02.440  -->  00:07:05.050
bring up our calculator again.
127

127

00:07:05.050  -->  00:07:06.490
No, now it's disappeared.
128

128

00:07:06.490  -->  00:07:13.795
Okay, calculator, calc, double calc,
there we go [LAUGH], sorry about that.
129

129

00:07:13.795  -->  00:07:18.505
So we say 1,440 divided by 9,
and why is that?
130

130

00:07:18.505  -->  00:07:20.205
Cuz we know this is 1440, and
131

131

00:07:20.205  -->  00:07:23.011
we know we want 9 squares
from gameplay point of view.
132

132

00:07:23.011  -->  00:07:27.780
That equals 160, and
we are going to make these square.
133

133

00:07:27.780  -->  00:07:28.970
These squares are gonna be square.
134

134

00:07:28.970  -->  00:07:29.803
That makes sense, doesn't it?
135

135

00:07:29.803  -->  00:07:32.800
So it's gonna be 160 by 160.
136

136

00:07:32.800  -->  00:07:37.780
And we know this point down the bottom
here, one, two, three, four, five,
137

137

00:07:37.780  -->  00:07:41.036
is gonna be 160 times 5, which equals 800.
138

138

00:07:41.036  -->  00:07:46.832
So our actual grid, our actual play space,
where we want people running around,
139

139

00:07:46.832  -->  00:07:51.463
is 1,440 by 800 with each
of these squares being 160.
140

140

00:07:51.463  -->  00:07:54.658
So let's go back and
just put in one of these squares for
141

141

00:07:54.658  -->  00:07:56.751
now, just to show how it all works.
142

142

00:07:56.751  -->  00:07:59.579
So I'm gonna take Safe Zone and
duplicate that again,
143

143

00:07:59.579  -->  00:08:03.710
just cuz I'm being a little bit lazy with
this, and we'll say this is a Square.
144

144

00:08:03.710  -->  00:08:08.090
We'll change the square to be what color,
145

145

00:08:08.090  -->  00:08:12.970
we'll make this a pretty
brightish kind of color and
146

146

00:08:12.970  -->  00:08:18.140
change the dimensions to be 160 by 160.
147

147

00:08:18.140  -->  00:08:21.845
And there you can see that we've got
one square that we can position,
148

148

00:08:21.845  -->  00:08:23.540
wherever our heart desires.
149

149

00:08:23.540  -->  00:08:25.520
And if we were to duplicate this, and
150

150

00:08:25.520  -->  00:08:30.090
a tricky way to do that is to say,
Ctrl + D or Cmd + D, while I'm on this.
151

151

00:08:30.090  -->  00:08:33.572
And then grab the anchor,
put it to where you want it,
152

152

00:08:33.572  -->  00:08:36.610
Ctrl + D, grab the anchor, and so on.
153

153

00:08:36.610  -->  00:08:39.836
You could lay out your nine squares and
make a little game here.
154

154

00:08:39.836  -->  00:08:44.146
It's a very manual way of doing it for
now, but you could lay it out,
155

155

00:08:44.146  -->  00:08:46.580
play your game and say, is nine good?
156

156

00:08:46.580  -->  00:08:48.240
Do we want ten, do we want five?
157

157

00:08:48.240  -->  00:08:50.890
So you go through this whole
prototyping phase with these squares,
158

158

00:08:50.890  -->  00:08:52.840
you'd probably wanna
checkerboard them actually.
159

159

00:08:52.840  -->  00:08:55.670
Do that one that color and
then that one this color and so.
160

160

00:08:55.670  -->  00:08:59.182
So I duplicate this one,
Ctrl + D, [SOUND].
161

161

00:08:59.182  -->  00:09:01.374
So it's a little bit crappy for
now, it's not snapping,
162

162

00:09:01.374  -->  00:09:02.940
it's kinda a little bit rough and ready,
163

163

00:09:02.940  -->  00:09:05.660
but we've played around with this
in previous sections of the course.
164

164

00:09:05.660  -->  00:09:09.380
You could, if you wanted, lay it out like
that to see if that is the way that you
165

165

00:09:09.380  -->  00:09:13.291
want to have your play space, and run with
this placeholder art the way through.
166

166

00:09:13.291  -->  00:09:16.374
Now, I've gone ahead and
already prototyped this game, so
167

167

00:09:16.374  -->  00:09:18.494
I know that 9 by 5 works out pretty well.
168

168

00:09:18.494  -->  00:09:21.580
So I'm gonna be providing you with
some art for that in the next video.
169

169

00:09:21.580  -->  00:09:24.700
But for now, I just wanted to show
you the process of how I came up with
170

170

00:09:24.700  -->  00:09:27.040
this is what my safe zone needed to be.
171

171

00:09:27.040  -->  00:09:29.030
This is how big I wanted my squares.
172

172

00:09:29.030  -->  00:09:31.410
Does this number of squares
feel good in my game?
173

173

00:09:31.410  -->  00:09:35.529
If I duplicate that and put that
down there, and then do that again.
174

174

00:09:35.529  -->  00:09:37.900
Although, now it needs to be
checkerboarded and offset.
175

175

00:09:37.900  -->  00:09:40.730
Does that feel like it's the right
amount of stuff to have in my game?
176

176

00:09:40.730  -->  00:09:43.605
And it does, it feels,
very good to do it that way.
177

177

00:09:43.605  -->  00:09:45.250
Okay, so that's all for this video.
178

178

00:09:45.250  -->  00:09:47.360
We'll get some graphics in
there in the next video and
179

179

00:09:47.360  -->  00:09:48.920
have it look a little bit prettier.
180

180

00:09:48.920  -->  00:09:50.240
Great work and see you again soon!
