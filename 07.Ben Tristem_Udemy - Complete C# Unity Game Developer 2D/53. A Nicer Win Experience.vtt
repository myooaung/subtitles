2

00:00:03.965  -->  00:00:06.800
Hi, again in this video we're
creating a nicer win experience.
3

3

00:00:06.800  -->  00:00:11.044
So when timer runs out, we kill all
the attackers, we flash Level Complete,
4

4

00:00:11.044  -->  00:00:13.869
play a sound effect, and
then load the next level.
5

5

00:00:13.869  -->  00:00:15.816
Okay, let's jump in and get started,
6

6

00:00:15.816  -->  00:00:19.474
I'm gonna start with a thank you to those
of you that have pointed out in our
7

7

00:00:19.474  -->  00:00:23.378
discussions an inconsistency that I need
to fix which is my LevelLoad script.
8

8

00:00:23.378  -->  00:00:27.139
Should be called LevelLoader and
we've gotta AttackerSpawner, we've
9

9

00:00:27.139  -->  00:00:31.880
got a DamageCollider, DefenderSpawner etc,
so LevelLoad really should be LevelLoader.
10

10

00:00:31.880  -->  00:00:35.394
It doesn't really matter in the grand
scheme of things, but I'm gonna change it
11

11

00:00:35.394  -->  00:00:38.873
to recognize the fact that a few people
have said Rick that doesn't make sense.
12

12

00:00:38.873  -->  00:00:43.866
So I'm gonna find LevelLoad, Ctrl + rr,
and then add an to the end of it,
13

13

00:00:43.866  -->  00:00:47.570
that's two references in two files,
that looks good.
14

14

00:00:47.570  -->  00:00:51.734
Click Apply and
then back over into Unity, right click,
15

15

00:00:51.734  -->  00:00:56.254
I'll right-click once it's
finished doing its updating.
16

16

00:00:56.254  -->  00:01:01.330
Right-click, Rename, add an all good,
I'm also gonna change where it's placed.
17

17

00:01:01.330  -->  00:01:04.600
Previously, we had it on our core game
area cuz that was kinda the only thing we
18

18

00:01:04.600  -->  00:01:05.480
had at the time.
19

19

00:01:05.480  -->  00:01:08.198
But now with this LevelController,
I think that's a better place for it.
20

20

00:01:08.198  -->  00:01:14.000
So, LevelLoader, right-click, Remove
Component, go over to our LevelController,
21

21

00:01:14.000  -->  00:01:18.520
Add Component here, and we're gonna add
out LevelLoader, okay, that's all done.
22

22

00:01:18.520  -->  00:01:22.610
Now let's get some text on our screen
that displays when we win the game,
23

23

00:01:22.610  -->  00:01:24.368
I'm gonna start over in here.
24

24

00:01:24.368  -->  00:01:27.395
Instead of putting it
in my existing Canvas,
25

25

00:01:27.395  -->  00:01:31.152
which I'm gonna rename this
Main Canvas at the moment.
26

26

00:01:31.152  -->  00:01:34.737
Main Canvas hit Apply,
has that changed my prefab?
27

27

00:01:34.737  -->  00:01:39.094
It probably hasn't changed the name of the
prefab so, here we go, Canvas over here,
28

28

00:01:39.094  -->  00:01:42.200
I'm gonna rename this
as well to Main Canvas.
29

29

00:01:42.200  -->  00:01:45.940
Okay so, I'm not gonna use that one,
I'm gonna create a new Canvas.
30

30

00:01:45.940  -->  00:01:49.493
So right-click UI &gt; Canvas, and
31

31

00:01:49.493  -->  00:01:54.638
I will rename this to Wind Condition or
Game Over,
32

32

00:01:54.638  -->  00:01:59.671
maybe Level Complete,
Level Complete Canvas.
33

33

00:02:02.600  -->  00:02:07.034
Okay, Level Complete Canvas,
now within here I'm gonna right-click and
34

34

00:02:07.034  -->  00:02:09.748
add myself a UI,
what are we looking for here?
35

35

00:02:09.748  -->  00:02:13.726
Text, at the top, you could use TextMesh
Pro, that would be awesome as well, but
36

36

00:02:13.726  -->  00:02:16.200
I'm just gonna use Text for the moment.
37

37

00:02:16.200  -->  00:02:20.424
And I will call this Level Complete Text,
38

38

00:02:20.424  -->  00:02:25.622
could call it wintext,
that would be okay as well.
39

39

00:02:25.622  -->  00:02:31.310
Here we're gonna say Level Complete as
the actual text we're gonna create.
40

40

00:02:31.310  -->  00:02:32.140
Now where is that?
41

41

00:02:32.140  -->  00:02:36.820
It's way off in goodness knows where,
so let's click on our Canvas,
42

42

00:02:36.820  -->  00:02:41.030
change first of all
the Canvas Render Mode to be World Space.
43

43

00:02:41.030  -->  00:02:45.670
And then I'm gonna go to my other canvas,
my Main Canvas, find the Rect Transform,
44

44

00:02:45.670  -->  00:02:50.150
right click, copy component,
come back to my Level Complete Canvas.
45

45

00:02:50.150  -->  00:02:53.756
Right click on Rect Transform and
paste component values, and
46

46

00:02:53.756  -->  00:02:55.660
then that would change the size so
47

47

00:02:55.660  -->  00:02:59.620
it's exactly the same as our Main Canvas
fits where we want it to fit.
48

48

00:02:59.620  -->  00:03:02.942
We;re also gonna drag it up in
the order of my hierarchy so
49

49

00:03:02.942  -->  00:03:04.890
it is just below the Main Canvas.
50

50

00:03:04.890  -->  00:03:09.067
So Main Canvas and then
Level Complete Canvas next to each other.
51

51

00:03:09.067  -->  00:03:12.116
And of course, grab Level Complete Canvas,
52

52

00:03:12.116  -->  00:03:16.701
drag it over into my Core Game Prefabs
folder, so it's prefabbed.
53

53

00:03:16.701  -->  00:03:20.020
So back on the Level Complete Canvas,
what do we wanna do in here?
54

54

00:03:20.020  -->  00:03:24.371
Well, lets get our text so
it's readable, just drag my handles so
55

55

00:03:24.371  -->  00:03:28.272
it's nice and large and ready for
us to create bigger text.
56

56

00:03:28.272  -->  00:03:33.266
I'm gonna change the font size to 150,
I think that is pretty good,
57

57

00:03:33.266  -->  00:03:35.272
change the color to yellow.
58

58

00:03:35.272  -->  00:03:38.198
You know how I love yellow text,
and then center,
59

59

00:03:38.198  -->  00:03:42.238
change the font, I've already got
a font we're trying Funky Junk,
60

60

00:03:42.238  -->  00:03:47.160
I think is the one that's gonna work,
yeah, that looks pretty good.
61

61

00:03:47.160  -->  00:03:53.150
Level Complete, I like it,
kinda needs a backing, doesn't it?
62

62

00:03:53.150  -->  00:03:58.169
Cuz it Is getting a little bit lost in the
background there, it's also underneath our
63

63

00:03:58.169  -->  00:04:03.062
other elements, so let's go to Level
Complete Canvas, and find order in layout.
64

64

00:04:03.062  -->  00:04:05.891
I'm gonna make this 10, so
this should be on top of everything,
65

65

00:04:05.891  -->  00:04:07.340
that looks pretty good.
66

66

00:04:07.340  -->  00:04:12.900
Now also, Level Complete Canvas
&gt; Right-click &gt; UI &gt; Image,
67

67

00:04:12.900  -->  00:04:16.970
and this is gonna be an image that will
sit underneath my Level Complete, so
68

68

00:04:16.970  -->  00:04:19.540
that I can see the Level Complete better.
69

69

00:04:19.540  -->  00:04:20.918
So move it around, drag it out,
70

70

00:04:20.918  -->  00:04:24.300
you can see currently it's sitting over
the top is the order in the hierarchy.
71

71

00:04:24.300  -->  00:04:26.893
If we drag that above Level Complete text,
72

72

00:04:26.893  -->  00:04:31.736
now that will sit underneath white's not
so good, change it to a darker color.
73

73

00:04:31.736  -->  00:04:36.160
Give it some transparency, there we go,
now you can read that font.
74

74

00:04:36.160  -->  00:04:40.520
And a lot of other options if you use
Text Mesh Pro, to do outlines and whatnot.
75

75

00:04:40.520  -->  00:04:42.220
That's probably a better way to do it, but
76

76

00:04:42.220  -->  00:04:45.760
I'm doing this because it's a little bit
quicker so you don't have to watch me
77

77

00:04:45.760  -->  00:04:49.515
fiddling around with font for five minutes
trying to get that beautiful looking font.
78

78

00:04:49.515  -->  00:04:52.202
That looking pretty good,
it's doing what we need to do.
79

79

00:04:54.134  -->  00:04:55.278
Level Complete Canvas,
80

80

00:04:55.278  -->  00:04:58.380
click Apply to make sure this is
all applied back to the prefab.
81

81

00:04:58.380  -->  00:05:03.291
The image, I'm gonna rename that to be
Background so it's clear what's going on,
82

82

00:05:03.291  -->  00:05:06.071
and then once again,
Apply back to the prefab.
83

83

00:05:06.071  -->  00:05:09.880
Okay, now we need a way of turning on and
off our level complete.
84

84

00:05:09.880  -->  00:05:12.520
So, jump over to Level Controller,
85

85

00:05:12.520  -->  00:05:16.040
Level Loader is, Level Controller,
sorry, Level Controller script.
86

86

00:05:16.040  -->  00:05:20.700
So, I haven't moved that into my
scripts photos, our level controller,
87

87

00:05:20.700  -->  00:05:23.930
drag that over into scripts photo,
all good.
88

88

00:05:23.930  -->  00:05:27.615
And level controller,
we're gonna open that up, Visual Studio.
89

89

00:05:29.091  -->  00:05:33.790
First up I need a way of assigning that
Canvas we just created into something.
90

90

00:05:33.790  -->  00:05:38.110
So I'm gonna SerializeField,
it's a game object and
91

91

00:05:38.110  -->  00:05:43.290
I will call this winLabel,
I think it's a good name for the winLabel.
92

92

00:05:44.540  -->  00:05:50.600
Okay, and now I'm gonna add back in my
start menu, start method, sorry, Start.
93

93

00:05:50.600  -->  00:05:55.930
Within Start, I'm gonna create a mechanism
that we can turn off the game objects so
94

94

00:05:55.930  -->  00:05:57.650
that when you start the game,
it's not there.
95

95

00:05:57.650  -->  00:05:59.156
You want it to be, where are we?
96

96

00:05:59.156  -->  00:06:02.722
Level Complete Canvas,
you want it to be not there, like that,
97

97

00:06:02.722  -->  00:06:04.650
okay, so we'll do that in Start.
98

98

00:06:04.650  -->  00:06:10.800
We'll say, winLabel.SetActive,
and in parentheses we put, what?
99

99

00:06:10.800  -->  00:06:15.690
We put false, that should turn it off,
now we need to go and assign that.
100

100

00:06:15.690  -->  00:06:19.630
We find our LevelController,
it should have winlabel is empty.
101

101

00:06:19.630  -->  00:06:24.590
We will grab our level complete canvas,
drag that on over into our WinLabel, and
102

102

00:06:24.590  -->  00:06:25.870
then on Level Controller,
103

103

00:06:25.870  -->  00:06:30.350
we will click Apply back to prefab,
so it is all buttoned up.
104

104

00:06:31.566  -->  00:06:35.477
Save this out, let's just make sure that
works so that when we start the game,
105

105

00:06:35.477  -->  00:06:37.152
our Level Complete is not there.
106

106

00:06:37.152  -->  00:06:41.277
Yeah, great, not there, excellent, because
if we pause the game and click on it,
107

107

00:06:41.277  -->  00:06:43.947
you can see that the check
box has been clicked off, and
108

108

00:06:43.947  -->  00:06:45.970
we need a mechanism to turn it back on.
109

109

00:06:45.970  -->  00:06:46.990
So it goes boink, and
110

110

00:06:46.990  -->  00:06:51.140
then when we un-pause, you see our level
complete, okay how are we gonna do that?
111

111

00:06:51.140  -->  00:06:56.460
Well, that's gonna be a challenge that I
set for you, to handle the win condition.
112

112

00:06:56.460  -->  00:06:58.900
So all the things we wanna
do when we win the game,
113

113

00:06:58.900  -->  00:07:00.910
that we're setting up now last video.
114

114

00:07:00.910  -->  00:07:05.385
And I'm going to create a coroutine that
I'll call HandleWindCondition(), so I need
115

115

00:07:05.385  -->  00:07:09.216
StartCoroutine handle wind condition
to put that at the moment that we win.
116

116

00:07:09.216  -->  00:07:12.666
And then,
I'm gonna play it "finished level" SFX,
117

117

00:07:12.666  -->  00:07:16.716
we've got a few that we brought
in previously if you kinda recall
118

118

00:07:16.716  -->  00:07:19.570
that I brought in sounds
from now Asset pack.
119

119

00:07:19.570  -->  00:07:23.123
I'm gonna use Quest Complete but you can
use whatever you like to match your game.
120

120

00:07:23.123  -->  00:07:28.940
Just a hint on that, make sure you add an
audio source, set the win label to true.
121

121

00:07:28.940  -->  00:07:32.582
Yield for tunable length of time, so
within our coroutine we wanna wait so
122

122

00:07:32.582  -->  00:07:36.456
we have time for our sound effect to play
and for out text to be on the screen, and
123

123

00:07:36.456  -->  00:07:37.888
then to load the next scene.
124

124

00:07:37.888  -->  00:07:40.968
And I'm not gonna go through
the steps in our hints just here, but
125

125

00:07:40.968  -->  00:07:43.656
remember there's a couple of
things you need to do to make
126

126

00:07:43.656  -->  00:07:46.735
sure your next scene is actually
available and that it works.
127

127

00:07:46.735  -->  00:07:49.635
So there's a nice big chunky challenge for
you, take that on,
128

128

00:07:49.635  -->  00:07:51.345
see you back here when you're done.
129

129

00:07:53.050  -->  00:07:55.260
Okay welcome back,
how'd you do with that challenge?
130

130

00:07:55.260  -->  00:07:59.260
Well I hope, let's create ourselves
the handle win condition so,
131

131

00:07:59.260  -->  00:08:00.680
where do we need to put that?
132

132

00:08:00.680  -->  00:08:02.590
Start, attacker killed, okay,
133

133

00:08:02.590  -->  00:08:05.810
in here instead of doing debug we're
gonna start our co routine in here.
134

134

00:08:05.810  -->  00:08:09.117
So Start(coroutine( and we're gonn call it
135

135

00:08:09.117  -->  00:08:14.036
(HandleWinCondition()) now that
hasn't been created yet, so
136

136

00:08:14.036  -->  00:08:18.886
I'm just gonna copy my text in here so
I don't have to type it again.
137

137

00:08:18.886  -->  00:08:22.646
Just down below,
attacker killed line 30 for
138

138

00:08:22.646  -->  00:08:26.970
me, I'm gonna type IInumerator,
IInumerator, and
139

139

00:08:26.970  -->  00:08:32.120
then paste my handle win condition,
put in my curly braces.
140

140

00:08:32.120  -->  00:08:36.758
Okay first of all,
I will sit my winLabel, so
141

141

00:08:36.758  -->  00:08:40.065
winLabel.SetActive is what?
142

142

00:08:40.065  -->  00:08:44.470
It's gonna be true, and
Save on that, looks good.
143

143

00:08:44.470  -->  00:08:47.295
And we've got the red squiggly line
because we haven't got our yield condition
144

144

00:08:47.295  -->  00:08:48.829
in yet, but we'll get to that in a moment.
145

145

00:08:48.829  -->  00:08:54.734
We'll do some audio, so first of all,
let's go create the audio source,
146

146

00:08:54.734  -->  00:08:59.920
we'll find our Level Controller
&gt; Add Component Audio source.
147

147

00:08:59.920  -->  00:09:02.260
So we have something that
can actually play our audio,
148

148

00:09:02.260  -->  00:09:06.080
and I'll find quest_complete,
drag that over into Audio Clip.
149

149

00:09:06.080  -->  00:09:07.594
Make sure I turn off Play On Awake or
150

150

00:09:07.594  -->  00:09:11.106
else it will go [NOISE] right at the very
start, and that's looking pretty good.
151

151

00:09:11.106  -->  00:09:14.082
All right, back over into
LevelController save this up,
152

152

00:09:14.082  -->  00:09:15.790
what else do we need to do in here?
153

153

00:09:15.790  -->  00:09:19.027
We need to say GetComponent What
are we getting?
154

154

00:09:19.027  -->  00:09:25.712
The Audio Source, &lt;AudioSource&gt;().Play,
cuz when we do our win condition or
155

155

00:09:25.712  -->  00:09:29.772
when we have the win moment
we wanna play out audio.
156

156

00:09:31.621  -->  00:09:37.590
Next I'm gonna yield, so
yield return new WaitForSeconds.
157

157

00:09:37.590  -->  00:09:38.850
How many seconds we wanna wait for?
158

158

00:09:38.850  -->  00:09:43.645
Well, we could just hard code this but
I'm gonna create a variable waitToLoad.
159

159

00:09:43.645  -->  00:09:50.281
And I'm gonna copy that, head up to
the top of my class, [SerializeField] and
160

160

00:09:50.281  -->  00:09:55.910
this will be a float just in case
I wanna do like 2.5 seconds.
161

161

00:09:55.910  -->  00:09:59.820
And waitToLoad,
we'll start that off at 4 seconds, so 4F.
162

162

00:10:00.820  -->  00:10:03.706
Save, back down into
my HandleWinCondition,
163

163

00:10:03.706  -->  00:10:07.840
one last thing that I need to do in
here which is to load the next scene.
164

164

00:10:07.840  -->  00:10:09.850
Okay, where are we handling scene loading?
165

165

00:10:09.850  -->  00:10:14.563
Let's just go to remind ourselves of that,
we'll look for
166

166

00:10:14.563  -->  00:10:18.530
our scripts go to our LevelLoader,
open that up.
167

167

00:10:18.530  -->  00:10:20.817
So it's in LevelLoader and
we're going to be looking for
168

168

00:10:20.817  -->  00:10:22.639
LoadNextScene I think is what we're after.
169

169

00:10:22.639  -->  00:10:29.062
Okay so, back into LevelVontroller,
find ObjectiveofType.
170

170

00:10:29.062  -->  00:10:34.936
We're looking for
the LevelLoader.LoadNextScene();,
171

171

00:10:34.936  -->  00:10:41.480
that looks pretty good, but
we don't have a next scene at the moment.
172

172

00:10:41.480  -->  00:10:45.970
So let's save all this up, make sure
everything's prefabbed, looks pretty good.
173

173

00:10:45.970  -->  00:10:51.310
I'm gonna go to my Scenes folder, find
Level 1, duplicate that to make a Level 2.
174

174

00:10:51.310  -->  00:10:55.930
It's gonna have all the same sort of
play testing prototyping stuff in there.
175

175

00:10:55.930  -->  00:10:58.700
But that's fine, we can type all this up
a little later on when we're doing out
176

176

00:10:58.700  -->  00:11:02.470
tuning and our up to file build settings.
177

177

00:11:04.140  -->  00:11:05.014
Where are we here?
178

178

00:11:05.014  -->  00:11:09.495
We wanna drag Level 2 underneath Level 1,
it's now build index three for me, great,
179

179

00:11:09.495  -->  00:11:10.595
so that's in there.
180

180

00:11:10.595  -->  00:11:15.632
Let's open Level 2, we need to make
sure we go to the LevelController,
181

181

00:11:15.632  -->  00:11:19.030
and Level Complete Canvas
is already paired up.
182

182

00:11:19.030  -->  00:11:21.470
It's been dragged in, so
if that hasn't been done for you,
183

183

00:11:21.470  -->  00:11:23.670
you need to do that,
that's looking pretty good.
184

184

00:11:23.670  -->  00:11:26.209
Back to Level 1,
now we'll see, am I on Level 1?
185

185

00:11:26.209  -->  00:11:30.001
Yes I am, now we'll see if this works,
click on play expecting some errors and
186

186

00:11:30.001  -->  00:11:31.210
some issues.
187

187

00:11:31.210  -->  00:11:35.880
But I will see how it goes,
put down a couple of over-powered gnomes.
188

188

00:11:35.880  -->  00:11:40.728
Time is finished, just gonna kill the last
couple of attackers that are coming in
189

189

00:11:40.728  -->  00:11:43.883
[SOUND] bloink,
sound effect [SOUND] Level Complete.
190

190

00:11:43.883  -->  00:11:48.374
Load the next level, excellent,
just placed down a couple dudes, great,
191

191

00:11:48.374  -->  00:11:50.773
and just out old warnings and no errors.
192

192

00:11:50.773  -->  00:11:54.916
Okay cool, so that's all looking good,
we've got to the [LAUGH] [SOUND] okay,
193

193

00:11:54.916  -->  00:11:55.570
calm down.
194

194

00:11:55.570  -->  00:11:57.266
[SOUND] It wants to beat all the levels.
195

195

00:11:57.266  -->  00:12:01.226
It got to the point now where we can
finish our scene, finish our level,
196

196

00:12:01.226  -->  00:12:03.882
it's a pretty good experience for
the player.
197

197

00:12:03.882  -->  00:12:07.860
We've got some feedback for them, which is
super important, we've got a little bit of
198

198

00:12:07.860  -->  00:12:11.540
a delay so all good, well done, great
work, and I'll see you in the next video.
