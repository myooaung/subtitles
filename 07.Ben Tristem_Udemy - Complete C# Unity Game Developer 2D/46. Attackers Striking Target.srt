00:00:00,025  -->  00:00:05,284
[NOISE] In this video we're
giving our defenders health with
2

2

00:00:05,284  -->  00:00:10,235
asking our attacker to attack and
deplete that health.
3

3

00:00:10,235  -->  00:00:14,200
And once we've destroyed
the defender to continue walking.
4

4

00:00:14,200  -->  00:00:15,620
So let's jump in and get started.
5

5

00:00:15,620  -->  00:00:19,360
Let's start by jumping over into
our Attacker script, within here,
6

6

00:00:19,360  -->  00:00:20,070
what do we need to do?
7

7

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:24,840
Well, we need to create a method that
we can call from our animation, so
8

8

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:26,840
we need to be making an animation event.
9

9

00:00:26,840  -->  00:00:32,080
So let us, underneath Set Movement Speed,
underneath attack,
10

10

00:00:32,080  -->  00:00:36,860
we will create a new public method,
public void and
11

11

00:00:36,860  -->  00:00:40,650
we'll call the strike current target.
12

12

00:00:40,650  -->  00:00:46,790
And then here we need to create a float
because we want to know the damage.
13

13

00:00:46,790  -->  00:00:52,568
And that will be created or that damage
will be specified on the attacker
14

14

00:00:52,568  -->  00:00:57,940
that is doing the attacking,
okay so, what do we need in here?
15

15

00:00:57,940  -->  00:01:02,138
Well, let's create ourselves a mechanism
that if we currently don't have a target,
16

16

00:01:02,138  -->  00:01:05,761
which could happen if I'm attacking
something and something else attacks
17

17

00:01:05,761  -->  00:01:09,726
something, that I can get in this state
where I think I'm attacking something but
18

18

00:01:09,726  -->  00:01:11,130
someone else has killed it.
19

19

00:01:11,130  -->  00:01:15,985
So, just saying here that if
there's no current target,
20

20

00:01:15,985  -->  00:01:20,254
so if not currentTarget,
then what do we wanna do?
21

21

00:01:20,254  -->  00:01:23,783
We'll do this all on one line,
curly braces,
22

22

00:01:23,783  -->  00:01:27,172
return at return and then semicolon.
23

23

00:01:27,172  -->  00:01:30,210
Okay, so just saying if you don't
have a current target, then return,
24

24

00:01:30,210  -->  00:01:31,280
get out of here.
25

25

00:01:31,280  -->  00:01:34,330
Now what we're looking for in here
does the thing we're attacking have
26

26

00:01:34,330  -->  00:01:37,748
a health component if it has a health
component, that means it can be harmed.
27

27

00:01:37,748  -->  00:01:41,920
Now, we wanna create ourselves
a handle to the health component, so
28

28

00:01:41,920  -->  00:01:46,320
we'll say of type health,
our variable will be called health and
29

29

00:01:46,320  -->  00:01:51,720
that equals currentTarget
dot get component.
30

30

00:01:51,720  -->  00:01:55,870
And the component we're looking for,
you guessed it, is health, parentheses,
31

31

00:01:55,870  -->  00:01:56,860
semicolon.
32

32

00:01:56,860  -->  00:02:02,140
Now, we're gonna say, if a particular
thing has health, has a health component,
33

33

00:02:02,140  -->  00:02:05,670
then we want to access
that health component.
34

34

00:02:05,670  -->  00:02:07,770
And what are we looking for in here?
35

35

00:02:07,770  -->  00:02:12,850
DealDamage is the method that we've
created already to do some damage,
36

36

00:02:12,850  -->  00:02:14,480
and then obviously,
we're passing in damage.
37

37

00:02:14,480  -->  00:02:15,730
Let's just have a look
in our health script,
38

38

00:02:15,730  -->  00:02:17,520
remind ourselves of what
we've done over there.
39

39

00:02:17,520  -->  00:02:22,090
DealDamage, it's the same DealDamage that
the defenders are doing to the attackers.
40

40

00:02:22,090  -->  00:02:26,290
DealDamage, and it's looking to
pass in a float of type damage,
41

41

00:02:26,290  -->  00:02:28,500
and we're saying health minus damage.
42

42

00:02:30,570  -->  00:02:32,940
Okay, back to our Attacker script here.
43

43

00:02:32,940  -->  00:02:35,410
So now we're hitting and
we're doing some damage.
44

44

00:02:35,410  -->  00:02:40,090
What I want you to do is go into
the lizard, create an animation event and
45

45

00:02:40,090  -->  00:02:43,400
in that animation event,
call strike current target
46

46

00:02:43,400  -->  00:02:47,600
at the point where you think that
the lizard should be hitting the defender.
47

47

00:02:47,600  -->  00:02:51,500
So there's a little challenge for you, no
it's a challenge to take on so jump in and
48

48

00:02:51,500  -->  00:02:52,090
do that now.
49

49

00:02:54,398  -->  00:02:58,483
Okay, our slide less challenge,
let's find our Lizard, and
50

50

00:02:58,483  -->  00:03:02,190
on our Lizard,
we're going to have an animation.
51

51

00:03:02,190  -->  00:03:07,038
On the animation, here it is,
we need to find the Attack animation.
52

52

00:03:07,038  -->  00:03:12,622
Attack [SOUND] probably around about,
I don't think the very moment it reaches.
53

53

00:03:12,622  -->  00:03:15,950
We'll give it a right about there,
his hand comes up to his mouth,
54

54

00:03:15,950  -->  00:03:18,400
he's grabbed a piece,
and he's having a bite.
55

55

00:03:18,400  -->  00:03:21,694
This is where we'll add a new
animation event, and I will change
56

56

00:03:21,694  -->  00:03:25,360
this event to be strike currentTarget,
how much damage do we wanna do?
57

57

00:03:25,360  -->  00:03:29,921
Well, we haven't really worked out our
damage system from attackers back to
58

58

00:03:29,921  -->  00:03:34,640
defenders, but I'm gonna say twenty damage
just to see how that feels for now.
59

59

00:03:34,640  -->  00:03:38,020
And then on my Lizard,
it doesn't need to be applied back.
60

60

00:03:38,020  -->  00:03:39,050
Let me just double check that.
61

61

00:03:39,050  -->  00:03:40,630
I'll click apply anyway.
62

62

00:03:40,630  -->  00:03:44,650
I think it's fine because it's just on
the animation that we've created on
63

63

00:03:44,650  -->  00:03:45,610
our attack here.
64

64

00:03:45,610  -->  00:03:46,490
It's all good, okay.
65

65

00:03:46,490  -->  00:03:49,130
So we've given ourselves
a Lizard animation event.
66

66

00:03:49,130  -->  00:03:52,020
So what I'll need to do is add the health
component to all of my defenders
67

67

00:03:52,020  -->  00:03:56,070
which it doesn't look like we have that at
the moment so add component and health.
68

68

00:03:57,140  -->  00:03:59,720
Great, how much health
do we want it to have?
69

69

00:03:59,720  -->  00:04:04,040
I gonna give it gravestone,
probably 200 health for that.
70

70

00:04:04,040  -->  00:04:06,720
See how that feels, and
then find the Gnome.
71

71

00:04:06,720  -->  00:04:08,230
The Gnome's a little bit squishier.
72

72

00:04:08,230  -->  00:04:11,450
So where is the add component button here,
73

73

00:04:11,450  -->  00:04:14,015
add health,
how much health do we wanna say?
74

74

00:04:14,015  -->  00:04:16,590
Mm-mm, I'll say 100 for the gnome for now.
75

75

00:04:16,590  -->  00:04:18,790
These are all returnable,
you'll change yourself, I'm sure.
76

76

00:04:18,790  -->  00:04:21,130
Cactus is going to be the most squishy.
77

77

00:04:21,130  -->  00:04:23,669
Actually, sorry,
click on Gnome, click apply.
78

78

00:04:23,669  -->  00:04:27,739
Remember I said change it's course
to be rigged doesn't click on Apply,
79

79

00:04:27,739  -->  00:04:32,090
click on Apply for the gravestone as well,
find our trophy, what was I doing?
80

80

00:04:32,090  -->  00:04:34,560
I was doing the cactus, wasn't I?
81

81

00:04:34,560  -->  00:04:41,150
Click on the cactus,
add a health component, and change cactus.
82

82

00:04:41,150  -->  00:04:45,910
I'm gonna change this to 75
just to be a bit different.
83

83

00:04:45,910  -->  00:04:50,340
Apply that back to the prefab and
then find our Trophy.
84

84

00:04:50,340  -->  00:04:51,500
Trophy, what should we make that?
85

85

00:04:51,500  -->  00:04:54,150
Health, we'll make it
the squishiest of all.
86

86

00:04:54,150  -->  00:04:56,530
If you reach the Trophy,
it is in serious trouble.
87

87

00:04:56,530  -->  00:05:01,830
We'll give it 30 health just to
see how that feels, click Apply.
88

88

00:05:01,830  -->  00:05:07,550
Okay now, we should have a mechanism where
I'll click on my Gravestone just here so
89

89

00:05:07,550  -->  00:05:10,010
we can see it,
It's health is currently 200.
90

90

00:05:10,010  -->  00:05:12,389
We'll wait until someone
spawns in it's lane.
91

91

00:05:12,389  -->  00:05:17,403
The stone's coming along
[NOISE] 180 [NOISE] 140,
92

92

00:05:17,403  -->  00:05:23,731
jump down a couple in one go,
120, 100, 80, okay, cool.
93

93

00:05:23,731  -->  00:05:27,548
Okay, it's because there's a few
characters in there at the same time.
94

94

00:05:27,548  -->  00:05:30,680
They're all munching on it,
that's why it's going down.
95

95

00:05:30,680  -->  00:05:33,110
At a non consistent pace,
because multiple people eating at it.
96

96

00:05:33,110  -->  00:05:34,840
Okay, so this is looking really good.
97

97

00:05:34,840  -->  00:05:39,250
The one thing we need to check in here,
I don't know if it was happening or not.
98

98

00:05:39,250  -->  00:05:42,210
What happens after they're
finished eating something.
99

99

00:05:42,210  -->  00:05:45,760
We'll put down a Trophy, cuz it doesn't
have many points, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
100

100

00:05:47,210  -->  00:05:50,960
Once it's eaten, Trophy's gone,
he's still hanging around eating.
101

101

00:05:50,960  -->  00:05:52,120
So I've got a challenge for
102

102

00:05:52,120  -->  00:05:55,950
you on this one, what I want you to
do is update the animation state.
103

103

00:05:55,950  -->  00:05:59,590
So once an attacker has killed
the defender, continue walking.
104

104

00:05:59,590  -->  00:06:01,840
I'm not gonna give you
any more clues than that.
105

105

00:06:01,840  -->  00:06:04,200
This is one of those ones where
want you to get in there.
106

106

00:06:04,200  -->  00:06:06,900
It's within the attackers script
that you need to be looking at.
107

107

00:06:06,900  -->  00:06:11,000
There's something that we need to do
in here so that the attacker continues
108

108

00:06:11,000  -->  00:06:14,540
walking after it's killed the defender, so
take that on, give that your best shot.
109

109

00:06:14,540  -->  00:06:16,619
Give this your best shot and
I'll see you back here when you're done.
110

110

00:06:18,649  -->  00:06:21,590
Right, so let's think about this
logically, what do we need to do in here?
111

111

00:06:21,590  -->  00:06:25,720
Well, it's something that I believe we
need to be updating on every frame so
112

112

00:06:25,720  -->  00:06:27,730
I'll be looking to put
something into update.
113

113

00:06:27,730  -->  00:06:28,730
What do we want to update?
114

114

00:06:28,730  -->  00:06:30,870
Well we want to update
the animation state, so
115

115

00:06:30,870  -->  00:06:35,230
let's create a new method in here,
update animation state.
116

116

00:06:35,230  -->  00:06:38,720
And more the point I'm calling my method
in here that I haven't created just yet.
117

117

00:06:38,720  -->  00:06:43,600
I'm gonna right click, and then quick
actions and refactors, generate method.
118

118

00:06:43,600  -->  00:06:47,780
And then right below here we've
got our update animations state,
119

119

00:06:47,780  -->  00:06:49,120
and what are we saying in here?
120

120

00:06:49,120  -->  00:06:52,420
Well, we're saying if there's no target
anymore, if we've killed the target
121

121

00:06:52,420  -->  00:06:57,110
then is Attacking should be false,
It's as simple as that.
122

122

00:06:57,110  -->  00:07:02,160
If you're attacking and then your target
disappears, then don't attack any more.
123

123

00:07:02,160  -->  00:07:09,034
So we'll say, if there is not current
target then what do we wanna do?
124

124

00:07:09,034  -->  00:07:15,729
Well, we want to get the animator
component, get animator.
125

125

00:07:19,552  -->  00:07:24,209
We wanna set the bool, so setBool, and
then isAttacking, do I have that in here,
126

126

00:07:24,209  -->  00:07:27,518
yeah, I'm just gonna copy my
isAttacking from there, so
127

127

00:07:27,518  -->  00:07:31,458
I know I get it exactly correct,
string references that we dislike.
128

128

00:07:31,458  -->  00:07:36,836
("isAttacking", false);.
129

129

00:07:36,836  -->  00:07:42,590
Okay, so
update the animation state on every frame.
130

130

00:07:42,590  -->  00:07:47,330
Call update animation state,
if there's no target, then stop attacking.
131

131

00:07:47,330  -->  00:07:49,500
Jump back over in here, see how this goes.
132

132

00:07:50,720  -->  00:07:53,900
Pretty on a couple of Trophies cuz
they're easy to kill quiet quickly.
133

133

00:07:53,900  -->  00:07:59,050
Trophy, trophy, trophy and munch, munch,
munch, munch, munch, munch, munch, munch.
134

134

00:07:59,050  -->  00:08:01,500
And then it continues walking,
munch, munch, munch.
135

135

00:08:01,500  -->  00:08:02,320
Awesome okay, and
136

136

00:08:02,320  -->  00:08:05,320
we'll just check that it can back
into the attack state one more time.
137

137

00:08:05,320  -->  00:08:08,510
Great, so we've got the transitioning
in and out of attacking.
138

138

00:08:08,510  -->  00:08:10,600
We've got our defenders withheld.
139

139

00:08:10,600  -->  00:08:14,030
We've got ourselves a real live
action tower defense game.
140

140

00:08:14,030  -->  00:08:15,650
So great work and
I'll see you in our next video.
