00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,944
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:03,944  -->  00:00:07,788
In this video we're making our character
jump and fall with a little bit more
3

3

00:00:07,788  -->  00:00:10,805
velocity so that he can get back
up again when he falls down.
4

4

00:00:10,805  -->  00:00:13,780
And we're gonna play around with
the tuning of the jump speed and
5

5

00:00:13,780  -->  00:00:14,561
of the gravity.
6

6

00:00:14,561  -->  00:00:17,070
So let's jump in and get started.
7

7

00:00:17,070  -->  00:00:21,269
As a reminder of what's going
on with our player here,
8

8

00:00:21,269  -->  00:00:26,677
I'm going to add a line in my run
method that is print playerVelocity.
9

9

00:00:26,677  -->  00:00:29,195
So that we can print out on the screen
exactly what's happening with
10

10

00:00:29,195  -->  00:00:31,283
the playerVelocity,
which is going to be a vector two.
11

11

00:00:31,283  -->  00:00:34,884
So it'll have two numbers in there,
something comma something,
12

12

00:00:34,884  -->  00:00:38,049
the first something is an X and
the second something is a Y.
13

13

00:00:38,049  -->  00:00:42,310
And you can see as it starts off
at 00 I'm standing still, 00.
14

14

00:00:42,310  -->  00:00:45,280
And then my velocity,
when I push left, becomes -50.
15

15

00:00:45,280  -->  00:00:48,560
My velocity when I push right becomes 50.
16

16

00:00:48,560  -->  00:00:54,331
Because we've got a very high
sensitivity on our X throw, on our key.
17

17

00:00:54,331  -->  00:00:56,857
So I'm push it down,
there's not a lot of ramp up or ramp down,
18

18

00:00:56,857  -->  00:00:58,247
it's happening pretty quickly.
19

19

00:00:58,247  -->  00:01:02,700
You can see that it goes from 0 to 5 and
5 back to 0 pretty fast.
20

20

00:01:02,700  -->  00:01:05,750
So, from a logic point of view
what we're trying to do with jump,
21

21

00:01:05,750  -->  00:01:08,350
I'm just gonna click on my pin tool here.
22

22

00:01:08,350  -->  00:01:11,774
What we're trying to do
with jump is take this 00,
23

23

00:01:11,774  -->  00:01:18,080
the something ,0 that
the player will have.
24

24

00:01:18,080  -->  00:01:23,150
The something is the X so
X zero and we want to add a value
25

25

00:01:23,150  -->  00:01:29,450
to the Y velocity, so
the Y Vector2 velocity here.
26

26

00:01:29,450  -->  00:01:33,962
So that immediately, the player
goes from having no Y velocity to
27

27

00:01:33,962  -->  00:01:37,171
a something Y velocity, for example, to 5.
28

28

00:01:37,171  -->  00:01:39,718
And then because we're using a dynamic,
29

29

00:01:39,718  -->  00:01:43,722
rigid body we're allowing
the physics engine to apply gravity,
30

30

00:01:43,722  -->  00:01:47,665
the force of gravity is constantly
applying down on the player.
31

31

00:01:47,665  -->  00:01:51,576
Until they are touching the collider, in
which case they can't go down any further.
32

32

00:01:51,576  -->  00:01:56,038
That downwards force,
obviously known as gravity,
33

33

00:01:56,038  -->  00:02:01,091
is going to immediately be
reducing this 5 down to a 4, 3,
34

34

00:02:01,091  -->  00:02:06,363
2, 1, and all the steps in
between with the decimal places.
35

35

00:02:06,363  -->  00:02:10,007
So, once it gets to 0 that
should be at the top,
36

36

00:02:10,007  -->  00:02:14,490
the peak of our jump up here is
0 in terms of the Y velocity.
37

37

00:02:14,490  -->  00:02:18,400
So y = 0 at the top,
not going up and not going down.
38

38

00:02:18,400  -->  00:02:24,277
And then we start to head back down
into the minuses, -1, -1.1, and so on.
39

39

00:02:24,277  -->  00:02:28,906
And then eventually, we hit the ground and
we stop moving, and Y returns back to 0.
40

40

00:02:28,906  -->  00:02:33,654
[COUGH] So what we're trying to do
in this particular lecture is apply
41

41

00:02:33,654  -->  00:02:38,005
this upwards velocity to the player,
push them up in the air.
42

42

00:02:38,005  -->  00:02:40,935
And then we'll get a little bit more
complicated in upcoming videos in
43

43

00:02:40,935  -->  00:02:44,085
terms of when you're allowed to jump and
how that works.
44

44

00:02:44,085  -->  00:02:46,835
So that's the logic we're gonna
go through here at the moment.
45

45

00:02:46,835  -->  00:02:52,431
So we'll hop over into our Player
script here, what do we need to do?
46

46

00:02:52,431  -->  00:02:54,978
Well first of all we need to
create ourselves a jump method.
47

47

00:02:54,978  -->  00:02:59,610
I'll put this underneath run, just tidy
up a little bit of my white space here.
48

48

00:02:59,610  -->  00:03:04,394
So we're gonna create
ourselves private void Jump().
49

49

00:03:04,394  -->  00:03:06,838
And then what do we need to do in here?
50

50

00:03:06,838  -->  00:03:09,440
Well we need to get some sort of input,
some sort of command.
51

51

00:03:09,440  -->  00:03:12,338
We're gonna use our
CrossPlatformInput Manager, and
52

52

00:03:12,338  -->  00:03:16,340
the reason we're doing this is so that if
we want to make this game for mobile or
53

53

00:03:16,340  -->  00:03:19,809
for Xbox or for PC we can,
using the CrossPlatformInputManager.
54

54

00:03:19,809  -->  00:03:22,700
Similar to what we set
out with argonne assault.
55

55

00:03:22,700  -->  00:03:25,970
So rather than having a control throw,
which is setting ourselves up.
56

56

00:03:25,970  -->  00:03:29,850
If the player runs we say well maybe
the player wants to walk and therefore we
57

57

00:03:29,850  -->  00:03:33,950
wanna give this ability by using this
access that they can have a little bit of
58

58

00:03:33,950  -->  00:03:38,360
pressure on the joy pad or they can tilt
their phone a little bit to the side.
59

59

00:03:38,360  -->  00:03:39,870
That's why we're using this access.
60

60

00:03:39,870  -->  00:03:43,130
But when it comes to Jump,
that's either you jump or you do not.
61

61

00:03:43,130  -->  00:03:45,340
You can't jump a little
bit in our current design.
62

62

00:03:45,340  -->  00:03:48,550
We're not saying slowly ramp up to jump.
63

63

00:03:48,550  -->  00:03:52,250
It's just jump right now in
the way that we execute this.
64

64

00:03:52,250  -->  00:03:55,710
So rather than looking to
create a control throw,
65

65

00:03:55,710  -->  00:03:57,790
we're just gonna have a button down.
66

66

00:03:57,790  -->  00:04:02,467
So, if CrossPlatformInputManager.,
67

67

00:04:02,467  -->  00:04:08,740
we'll use GetButtonDown, so GetButtonDown.
68

68

00:04:08,740  -->  00:04:09,962
Because this is a one time thing,
69

69

00:04:09,962  -->  00:04:12,860
we're not interested in whether
they're hoarding it down or not.
70

70

00:04:12,860  -->  00:04:15,930
And then the key we will
use to define that is Jump.
71

71

00:04:16,950  -->  00:04:20,450
And I broke the rule [LAUGH] I talked
about it in the last video in terms of
72

72

00:04:20,450  -->  00:04:21,360
going and getting that.
73

73

00:04:21,360  -->  00:04:24,060
I think Jump is pretty easy
to spell correctly but
74

74

00:04:24,060  -->  00:04:27,000
let's quickly hop over here and
make Ben very happy.
75

75

00:04:27,000  -->  00:04:29,600
We're gonna go over to
Project Settings &gt; Input,
76

76

00:04:29,600  -->  00:04:34,270
we will find on the vertical axis here
there's vertical, there's also a jump.
77

77

00:04:34,270  -->  00:04:37,470
Which is what we're looking for and
you can see the name of jump is Jump.
78

78

00:04:37,470  -->  00:04:41,538
We're gonna copy that at the moment
the button on the keyboard is space.
79

79

00:04:41,538  -->  00:04:45,490
So we're gonna copy Jump,
come back into here and paste it in there.
80

80

00:04:45,490  -->  00:04:47,075
There we go, it's exactly the same but
81

81

00:04:47,075  -->  00:04:50,350
that is the right process to go through
because if we mess that up sometimes we
82

82

00:04:50,350  -->  00:04:53,230
have no idea what has gone
wrong if we've messed that up.
83

83

00:04:53,230  -->  00:04:56,290
Okay, so Jump,
we don't need that semicolon on the end.
84

84

00:04:56,290  -->  00:04:58,780
And then, what are we doing?
85

85

00:04:58,780  -->  00:05:03,097
If we're pressing down on the jump key,
well, first of all,
86

86

00:05:03,097  -->  00:05:06,098
we need to give ourselves
a new Y velocity.
87

87

00:05:06,098  -->  00:05:13,438
So Vector2,
we'll call it jumpVelocityToAdd.
88

88

00:05:13,438  -->  00:05:15,465
So we're going from 0 on the Y, and
89

89

00:05:15,465  -->  00:05:19,160
then we're gonna suddenly say
now add 5 to your Y velocity.
90

90

00:05:19,160  -->  00:05:24,950
That = a new Vector2, and we don't
need to add anything to the X axis,
91

91

00:05:24,950  -->  00:05:29,730
we're gonna keep that the same,
to the X velocity there.
92

92

00:05:29,730  -->  00:05:31,710
But we need to add something in here.
93

93

00:05:31,710  -->  00:05:33,820
Something, what should
we call our something?
94

94

00:05:33,820  -->  00:05:38,640
We'll call it jumpSpeed,
which we haven't defined yet.
95

95

00:05:38,640  -->  00:05:40,560
So we don't have a jump speed,
we'll go out and grab that now.
96

96

00:05:40,560  -->  00:05:44,772
So copy jumpSpeed, head on up to
the top under our config here,
97

97

00:05:44,772  -->  00:05:46,920
well SerializeField.
98

98

00:05:46,920  -->  00:05:49,860
We need to create a float,
which is called jumpSpeed, and
99

99

00:05:49,860  -->  00:05:54,940
we'll start that off at 5 as well,
5f cuz it is a float.
100

100

00:05:54,940  -->  00:05:56,650
Now back down into our jump method.
101

101

00:05:57,680  -->  00:06:02,750
So just as we did up here with
run we need myRigidBody.velocity.
102

102

00:06:02,750  -->  00:06:10,650
And then we are going to have
that += jumpVelocityToAdd.
103

103

00:06:10,650  -->  00:06:14,360
So it's the same as itself
plus jumpVelocity as well
104

104

00:06:14,360  -->  00:06:15,980
when this jump key is pressed.
105

105

00:06:15,980  -->  00:06:19,640
Let's save that,
hop back over into our scene.
106

106

00:06:19,640  -->  00:06:26,510
Hit Play, hit Play again and
then jump, nothing happens.
107

107

00:06:26,510  -->  00:06:27,130
Why is that?
108

108

00:06:27,130  -->  00:06:28,928
Here's a micro-challenge for you and
109

109

00:06:28,928  -->  00:06:32,840
it's not dissimilar to the [LAUGH]
micro-challenge when we're creating run.
110

110

00:06:32,840  -->  00:06:36,390
We need to add this into our update.
111

111

00:06:36,390  -->  00:06:40,310
Jump(); then back into our build,
112

112

00:06:41,880  -->  00:06:45,450
back into our scene, and
what happens here when we push space?
113

113

00:06:45,450  -->  00:06:48,030
We do a nice floaty jump,
floaty mc jump jump.
114

114

00:06:48,030  -->  00:06:50,556
[NOISE] And
you can see him floating a long way.
115

115

00:06:50,556  -->  00:06:53,170
So this is a good starting point.
116

116

00:06:53,170  -->  00:06:55,750
This is excellent, we're moving up and
then we're floating back down.
117

117

00:06:55,750  -->  00:06:58,630
And you can see in our
velocity over here when I push
118

118

00:06:58,630  -->  00:07:02,650
up it reaches around about
just under five it looks.
119

119

00:07:02,650  -->  00:07:04,690
And then floats back down using gravity.
120

120

00:07:04,690  -->  00:07:10,860
So what we need to do next, you can see
if we jump out of that jump out of play.
121

121

00:07:10,860  -->  00:07:15,240
Hop over into Edit, Project Settings and
122

122

00:07:15,240  -->  00:07:19,140
Physics 2D we need to have a look at
what's going on with our gravity.
123

123

00:07:19,140  -->  00:07:21,910
So you can see here right at
top we have a gravity setting.
124

124

00:07:21,910  -->  00:07:23,830
And with the gravity setting and
125

125

00:07:23,830  -->  00:07:28,000
when your player's Y velocity, it's the
perfect time for us to have a challenge.
126

126

00:07:29,030  -->  00:07:31,780
The challenge is to tune your jump.
127

127

00:07:31,780  -->  00:07:36,390
So use gravity and jump speed to tune
your jump so that it feels good for you.
128

128

00:07:36,390  -->  00:07:39,830
So this is a little bit more of
flexing your game designer muscles.
129

129

00:07:39,830  -->  00:07:44,670
I want you to decide how many tiles you
want your player to be able to jump up.
130

130

00:07:44,670  -->  00:07:46,830
And, I know it's early days,
we can change this for sure.
131

131

00:07:46,830  -->  00:07:50,420
You can have them jump higher or lower
later on, but this is the first point.
132

132

00:07:50,420  -->  00:07:53,345
Do you want your player to be
able to jump up, for example,
133

133

00:07:53,345  -->  00:07:57,373
three tiles as I've got here, or two
tiles as I've got here, or only one tile?
134

134

00:07:57,373  -->  00:08:00,856
This is part of the reason that I set
up this little level the way I have,
135

135

00:08:00,856  -->  00:08:03,983
to make sure that I've got a one and
a three or maybe it's four or
136

136

00:08:03,983  -->  00:08:05,540
maybe it's seventeen tiles.
137

137

00:08:05,540  -->  00:08:07,638
So when I say tiles I mean these blocks,
138

138

00:08:07,638  -->  00:08:09,810
the tiles that we've added
into our tile map here.
139

139

00:08:09,810  -->  00:08:11,800
So how high do you want
your player to jump?
140

140

00:08:11,800  -->  00:08:15,880
That's a starting point, and then also
decide how far you're okay with your
141

141

00:08:15,880  -->  00:08:18,350
player floating horizontally when jumping.
142

142

00:08:18,350  -->  00:08:21,787
So at the moment my player
floats a long way when we jump,
143

143

00:08:21,787  -->  00:08:23,480
which I'm not happy with.
144

144

00:08:23,480  -->  00:08:25,776
Whoops, I'm gonna start again,
145

145

00:08:25,776  -->  00:08:27,400
cuz [LAUGH] I wanna be able
to jump back up that ledge.
146

146

00:08:28,440  -->  00:08:29,196
He fell down.
147

147

00:08:29,196  -->  00:08:32,380
This time it'll be a little bit
more smooth, so just to there.
148

148

00:08:32,380  -->  00:08:35,625
Currently, my player can jump,
whoa, quite a distance.
149

149

00:08:35,625  -->  00:08:38,169
[NOISE] Nearly that whole way across,
which is way to much.
150

150

00:08:38,169  -->  00:08:41,535
I don't want the player to be able
to do these massive jumps like that,
151

151

00:08:41,535  -->  00:08:42,780
that's too far.
152

152

00:08:42,780  -->  00:08:44,763
So, for you,
how far do you want your player to jump?
153

153

00:08:44,763  -->  00:08:47,567
How quickly do you want them
to drop with the gravity?
154

154

00:08:47,567  -->  00:08:51,910
And how many tiles up do
you want them to jump up?
155

155

00:08:51,910  -->  00:08:55,096
So pause the video and
tune you're jumping now.
156

156

00:08:57,728  -->  00:09:00,930
Okay, welcome back,
I hope you have your game feeling good.
157

157

00:09:00,930  -->  00:09:04,368
This is the part where your game actually
starts to feel like a game cuz having your
158

158

00:09:04,368  -->  00:09:06,611
character just bounce
around should be enjoyable.
159

159

00:09:06,611  -->  00:09:10,799
For me when I go into gravity,
Project Settings, Physics 2D,
160

160

00:09:10,799  -->  00:09:13,992
I'm gonna put the gravity
up pretty agressive.
161

161

00:09:13,992  -->  00:09:15,842
I'm gonna put mine up to 100 so
162

162

00:09:15,842  -->  00:09:19,092
that when I fall off this ledge
I really fall off the ledge.
163

163

00:09:19,092  -->  00:09:22,423
I want my game to feel zippy, so
blunk, down like that, blunk.
164

164

00:09:22,423  -->  00:09:24,100
I think that feels pretty good.
165

165

00:09:24,100  -->  00:09:26,980
This is excellent if you've got
this collision problem we'll
166

166

00:09:26,980  -->  00:09:29,710
get to that in just a moment
after we've tuned our jump.
167

167

00:09:29,710  -->  00:09:33,580
So I've got this good falling that I like,
pretty strong gravity.
168

168

00:09:33,580  -->  00:09:36,510
If I jump now, blup, blup, blup, doesn't
really get off the ground, kind of an old
169

169

00:09:36,510  -->  00:09:39,690
man, a little bit how I feel a lot
of the days when I'm trying to jump.
170

170

00:09:39,690  -->  00:09:42,200
But let's make him
a little bit more agile.
171

171

00:09:42,200  -->  00:09:45,550
Let's make him like Rick in his 20s
rather than like Rick in his 40s.
172

172

00:09:45,550  -->  00:09:47,610
Jump speed here,
I'm going to put my jump speed up.
173

173

00:09:47,610  -->  00:09:51,210
I've played around with this a little bit
already, I tried to start off with 10,
174

174

00:09:51,210  -->  00:09:55,790
then I went to 15, I found that 28 is
a pretty good [LAUGH] jump speed for
175

175

00:09:55,790  -->  00:09:56,960
my character.
176

176

00:09:56,960  -->  00:10:00,860
Let's just have a look at that because
bloink, bloink, up and down pretty quick.
177

177

00:10:00,860  -->  00:10:04,430
I like that pace,
if we do the how far can you jump test,
178

178

00:10:04,430  -->  00:10:06,570
I'm gonna make my speed
a little bit faster.
179

179

00:10:06,570  -->  00:10:12,370
I think how fast he can run horizontally,
but I'll get to that a bit later on yet,
180

180

00:10:12,370  -->  00:10:17,250
and you can see jumping about halfway
up so three and a half tiles.
181

181

00:10:17,250  -->  00:10:20,620
You don't wanna have it exactly
on three it's a bit hard
182

182

00:10:20,620  -->  00:10:21,790
to get up on to the next level.
183

183

00:10:21,790  -->  00:10:26,850
But that's enough to have my player
jump up three levels pretty comfortably.
184

184

00:10:26,850  -->  00:10:28,730
Cool, we've had that happen twice now, so
185

185

00:10:28,730  -->  00:10:30,580
let's go on and
figure out what's going on there.
186

186

00:10:30,580  -->  00:10:32,860
If you have a look at your character,
187

187

00:10:32,860  -->  00:10:35,590
your character has some
collision information on it.
188

188

00:10:35,590  -->  00:10:38,610
Captural collider, rigid 2D,
we have a look at our tilemap,
189

189

00:10:38,610  -->  00:10:43,422
we've got our foreground has collision on
it in terms of our Composite Collider.
190

190

00:10:43,422  -->  00:10:46,350
Sort of a little of a mini challenge for
you, if you wanna go dig around and
191

191

00:10:46,350  -->  00:10:47,900
see if you can figure out what's going on.
192

192

00:10:47,900  -->  00:10:51,500
Why do you think our player is
falling through the cracks like that?
193

193

00:10:51,500  -->  00:10:53,040
Why is he falling through the world?
194

194

00:10:53,040  -->  00:10:55,688
We don't have little cracks in our tile,
195

195

00:10:55,688  -->  00:11:00,615
cuz in our collision we've go in and
changed that but why do you think that is?
196

196

00:11:00,615  -->  00:11:02,935
Well, it's a little bit of a tricky
question, you'd need to go and
197

197

00:11:02,935  -->  00:11:04,251
search through the docs a little bit.
198

198

00:11:04,251  -->  00:11:07,459
But unity docs you'll
see Collision Detection,
199

199

00:11:07,459  -->  00:11:10,523
we have the option of Discrete and
Continuous.
200

200

00:11:10,523  -->  00:11:13,701
And I've given you a link in
the resources, against this lecture,
201

201

00:11:13,701  -->  00:11:15,786
in terms of the difference
between the two.
202

202

00:11:15,786  -->  00:11:18,917
Basically you use discreet
if your character or
203

203

00:11:18,917  -->  00:11:24,500
if your units are moving quite slowly and
collision is happening quite easily.
204

204

00:11:24,500  -->  00:11:26,060
If you've got things
that are moving quickly,
205

205

00:11:26,060  -->  00:11:29,530
you need to have continuous
collision detection so
206

206

00:11:29,530  -->  00:11:32,840
that it doesn't accidentally fall through
the cracks like was happening there.
207

207

00:11:32,840  -->  00:11:35,041
Continuous is a bit more expensive, so
208

208

00:11:35,041  -->  00:11:37,719
that's the reason that
discreet is an option.
209

209

00:11:37,719  -->  00:11:41,714
So now, if we click Play we have should
have it that our character can jump down
210

210

00:11:41,714  -->  00:11:43,932
here, and this has been the problem area.
211

211

00:11:43,932  -->  00:11:48,550
Yep, no problem, so sometimes, if you're
moving too fast then that very initial,
212

212

00:11:48,550  -->  00:11:52,146
this capsule collider touching
this collision doesn't happen,
213

213

00:11:52,146  -->  00:11:56,760
cuz we're moving too fast,
it doesn't happen in the particular frame.
214

214

00:11:56,760  -->  00:12:00,600
So therefore we need to switch to
continuous collision detection.
215

215

00:12:00,600  -->  00:12:05,110
I'm just gonna remove my print statement I
added in there so I don't forget later on.
216

216

00:12:05,110  -->  00:12:08,470
Remove that, and there is our run, sorry,
217

217

00:12:08,470  -->  00:12:11,880
running and our jumping, and
our flipping, we now have in our game.
218

218

00:12:11,880  -->  00:12:13,650
Well done,
I will see you in the next video.
