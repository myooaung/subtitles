00:00:00,025  -->  00:00:04,133
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,133  -->  00:00:06,979
In this video, we're gonna create
some vulnerability for the player, so
3

3

00:00:06,979  -->  00:00:09,979
that when the player runs up and bonks
into the enemy here, they go flying off.
4

4

00:00:09,979  -->  00:00:14,919
[LAUGH] That's a little bit too dramatic,
flying off and into a death state, and
5

5

00:00:14,919  -->  00:00:16,712
we have no control for the play.
6

6

00:00:16,712  -->  00:00:18,570
You can't move the player around anymore.
7

7

00:00:18,570  -->  00:00:21,041
So let's jump in and
make our player perish, and
8

8

00:00:21,041  -->  00:00:23,224
I'm gonna do a little
bit of tidy up first.
9

9

00:00:23,224  -->  00:00:27,411
Some of you have been raising some really
good points about what's going on in our
10

10

00:00:27,411  -->  00:00:30,994
scene here where we've got this
weird kind of gap between our tiles.
11

11

00:00:30,994  -->  00:00:35,878
That's easily fixed by jumping into
your Sprite sheets, Sprite sheet here,
12

12

00:00:35,878  -->  00:00:40,466
and instead of having Pixels Per Unit 32,
we have Pixels Per Unit 31,
13

13

00:00:40,466  -->  00:00:43,522
just makes the whole thing
a little bit tighter.
14

14

00:00:43,522  -->  00:00:46,740
So we'll do that for the background and
see those lines go away, and
15

15

00:00:46,740  -->  00:00:49,700
then we do that for
the foreground layer as well.
16

16

00:00:49,700  -->  00:00:51,249
That goes away.
We don't need to do that for the enemy and
17

17

00:00:51,249  -->  00:00:52,886
the player cuz we're not
seeing this same issue.
18

18

00:00:52,886  -->  00:00:57,850
But if I hit play now, we'll see that all
of those annoying gaps have gone away and
19

19

00:00:57,850  -->  00:01:00,230
everything's nice and smooth.
20

20

00:01:00,230  -->  00:01:01,700
That's so much nicer now.
21

21

00:01:01,700  -->  00:01:04,563
The other thing I'm gonna do is just
tidy up my folders a little bit, and
22

22

00:01:04,563  -->  00:01:06,349
put my enemy script
into my Scripts folder.
23

23

00:01:06,349  -->  00:01:13,020
And I am going to prefab a couple of
things that we haven't prefabbed yet.
24

24

00:01:13,020  -->  00:01:15,490
Click on my Prefab folder here,
just do a little bit of thinking.
25

25

00:01:15,490  -->  00:01:20,720
And I'm going to drag my camera,
or Cameras
26

26

00:01:20,720  -->  00:01:25,360
folder down here to prefab that, and also
my enemy, so we now have an Enemy prefab.
27

27

00:01:25,360  -->  00:01:27,870
You might see a couple of
warnings from time to time.
28

28

00:01:27,870  -->  00:01:31,380
I tend to get them if I've been
jumping between various different
29

29

00:01:31,380  -->  00:01:33,860
versions of my project,
and other project, and
30

30

00:01:33,860  -->  00:01:37,940
other versions of Unity as I'm trying out
different things to see what's working.
31

31

00:01:37,940  -->  00:01:41,940
You'll also see it if you have something
in your script that you're not using like
32

32

00:01:41,940  -->  00:01:42,790
the player is alive.
33

33

00:01:42,790  -->  00:01:45,500
We're gonna use that in this very video,
so
34

34

00:01:45,500  -->  00:01:47,462
we don't need to worry
about that at the moment.
35

35

00:01:47,462  -->  00:01:50,780
And the myCollider, I think we're
gonna use that as well in this video.
36

36

00:01:50,780  -->  00:01:54,550
So there's a couple of warnings in there,
that just based upon my code where
37

37

00:01:54,550  -->  00:01:57,242
I put some things in, saying,
we'll use this later.
38

38

00:01:57,242  -->  00:01:59,930
And Unity's saying, but
don't forget to use them.
39

39

00:01:59,930  -->  00:02:03,380
Thank you, Unity,
don't worry, I shan't forget.
40

40

00:02:03,380  -->  00:02:04,980
Okay, so we've got our player here.
41

41

00:02:04,980  -->  00:02:08,846
And our player has on,
him or her, has a collision.
42

42

00:02:08,846  -->  00:02:13,611
And this collision, this Capsule Collider
is what we're gonna use to say,
43

43

00:02:13,611  -->  00:02:17,408
if that Capsule Collider comes
into contact with the enemy,
44

44

00:02:17,408  -->  00:02:22,220
then we have some issues and we need
to trigger some sort of nasty death.
45

45

00:02:22,220  -->  00:02:26,020
So I have a challenge that I'm going
to issue to you early in this video and
46

46

00:02:26,020  -->  00:02:29,220
you can follow along with me at
any point in time if you think,
47

47

00:02:29,220  -->  00:02:30,410
aha, I can do the rest of this.
48

48

00:02:30,410  -->  00:02:31,790
Or if at any point, you think,
49

49

00:02:31,790  -->  00:02:35,590
I've got this particular bit, please
the pause the video and jump into that.
50

50

00:02:35,590  -->  00:02:39,360
So the dramatic death that we're gonna
trigger if the player touches the enemy
51

51

00:02:39,360  -->  00:02:41,650
to stop the ability to move.
52

52

00:02:41,650  -->  00:02:45,119
So stop the player as in
the person who's playing.
53

53

00:02:45,119  -->  00:02:46,370
It's confusing, isn't it?
54

54

00:02:46,370  -->  00:02:47,823
The player who's sitting
at their computer and
55

55

00:02:47,823  -->  00:02:49,539
the player who is our little
character running around.
56

56

00:02:49,539  -->  00:02:52,380
It's just the way video
games talk about themselves.
57

57

00:02:52,380  -->  00:02:56,850
But stop the person playing the game
ability to move the character that
58

58

00:02:56,850  -->  00:03:01,440
they're controlling in the game, to change
the player state so that animation state.
59

59

00:03:01,440  -->  00:03:05,837
We don't have a whole big
death animation that's been
60

60

00:03:05,837  -->  00:03:08,618
created in our Sprite sheet here.
61

61

00:03:08,618  -->  00:03:12,839
But we've got enough to kind of
find something that we can use when
62

62

00:03:12,839  -->  00:03:14,007
the player dies.
63

63

00:03:14,007  -->  00:03:17,100
I'm just gonna use one
frame of death animation.
64

64

00:03:18,250  -->  00:03:21,170
And then we want to trigger
some sort of dramatic death.
65

65

00:03:21,170  -->  00:03:21,730
And for me,
66

66

00:03:21,730  -->  00:03:25,790
I'm gonna have my character just kind of
go flying off in a particular direction
67

67

00:03:25,790  -->  00:03:29,480
and make use of our physics system logo,
and boink off in a particular direction.
68

68

00:03:29,480  -->  00:03:32,462
So we'll go through that together, or
you can pause the video and jump in and
69

69

00:03:32,462  -->  00:03:32,980
do that now.
70

70

00:03:34,790  -->  00:03:36,757
First thing I'm going to do
is open up my Player script.
71

71

00:03:40,097  -->  00:03:43,412
And we can see that, as I was
mentioning at the start of the video,
72

72

00:03:43,412  -->  00:03:45,180
we have this bool isAlive = true.
73

73

00:03:45,180  -->  00:03:48,450
And at the moment,
it is true because the player is alive.
74

74

00:03:48,450  -->  00:03:51,860
What we want to do is use
that as a mechanism to say,
75

75

00:03:51,860  -->  00:03:56,955
if it's not true,
then the player is basically dead.
76

76

00:03:56,955  -->  00:03:58,380
[LAUGH] That makes sense, doesn't it?
77

77

00:03:58,380  -->  00:03:59,884
If you're not alive,
then you're dead, makes sense.
78

78

00:03:59,884  -->  00:04:04,440
What I'm gonna do at the start is to go
down to our Update here, Update method.
79

79

00:04:04,440  -->  00:04:07,938
You can see we're allowed to do all
these things, Run, ClimbLadder, Jump.
80

80

00:04:07,938  -->  00:04:11,080
Most of these, these three,
have player input.
81

81

00:04:11,080  -->  00:04:15,090
If we weren't calling those on Update,
then the player would lose their input.
82

82

00:04:15,090  -->  00:04:20,978
So we're gonna have right at
the start of our Update method here,
83

83

00:04:20,978  -->  00:04:25,902
we're going to say if is not,
so not, is not isAlive,
84

84

00:04:25,902  -->  00:04:30,416
that makes sense, so
not isAlive, then return.
85

85

00:04:30,416  -->  00:04:34,483
And what we're saying there,
return with a semicolon.
86

86

00:04:34,483  -->  00:04:39,471
What we're saying there is, if you get
to the point where the player state has
87

87

00:04:39,471  -->  00:04:44,180
changed, the state is now something
other than isAlive, then return.
88

88

00:04:44,180  -->  00:04:45,430
Don't do these things down there.
89

89

00:04:45,430  -->  00:04:49,490
And that should immediately turn off the
player's ability to control the character
90

90

00:04:49,490  -->  00:04:50,380
running around in the world.
91

91

00:04:50,380  -->  00:04:54,030
So that's step one of our process here,
stop the ability to move.
92

92

00:04:54,030  -->  00:04:57,893
Now we need to create ourselves a method,
which is going to be the die method, or
93

93

00:04:57,893  -->  00:04:59,800
the death method.
94

94

00:04:59,800  -->  00:05:03,431
I know it all sounds terribly dramatic
when you use those words, doesn't it?
95

95

00:05:03,431  -->  00:05:05,770
Hey, that's video games for you.
96

96

00:05:05,770  -->  00:05:08,227
We use those words, so
I'm going to say, void Die.
97

97

00:05:08,227  -->  00:05:12,385
Actually, I'm gonna call it a private
void, just to make sure we're nice and
98

98

00:05:12,385  -->  00:05:15,360
clear on what's going on here,
private void Die().
99

99

00:05:15,360  -->  00:05:18,250
And what are we doing in here?
100

100

00:05:18,250  -->  00:05:24,410
Well, we want to say if
the player's collider
101

101

00:05:24,410  -->  00:05:30,260
is touching something else,
then start doing this death sequence.
102

102

00:05:30,260  -->  00:05:32,696
Let's have a look at what we're grabbing
at the moment for the collider.
103

103

00:05:32,696  -->  00:05:34,287
We have a Capsule Collider.
104

104

00:05:34,287  -->  00:05:38,011
So myBodyCollider that we set up before
when we differentiated the feet and
105

105

00:05:38,011  -->  00:05:41,337
the body, we left in this myBodyCollider
so that we can use it now.
106

106

00:05:41,337  -->  00:05:44,220
So that's the one we need
to access at the moment,
107

107

00:05:44,220  -->  00:05:46,497
myBodyCollider back down to Die here.
108

108

00:05:46,497  -->  00:05:50,278
We're gonna make this as an if statement.
109

109

00:05:50,278  -->  00:05:55,482
If myBodyCollider IsTouchingLayers,
and we've done this previously
110

110

00:05:55,482  -->  00:06:00,609
when we're looking at the player
being at a jump, IsTouchingLayers.
111

111

00:06:00,609  -->  00:06:02,700
And then what's our layer mask?
112

112

00:06:02,700  -->  00:06:08,870
LayerMask.GetMask().
113

113

00:06:08,870  -->  00:06:12,870
Well, we set this up in the previous video
where we said our enemy has a layer mask
114

114

00:06:12,870  -->  00:06:13,370
called Enemy.
115

115

00:06:15,160  -->  00:06:18,560
And let me just double check that to
make sure I haven't typed in the wrong
116

116

00:06:18,560  -->  00:06:19,200
thing in here.
117

117

00:06:19,200  -->  00:06:23,442
Click on Enemy, and we'll see that
the enemy is on layer over here.
118

118

00:06:23,442  -->  00:06:24,650
We'll go to Add Layer.
119

119

00:06:24,650  -->  00:06:25,840
We don't actually need to add a layer, but
120

120

00:06:25,840  -->  00:06:28,210
we're going in to see that
the layer is called Enemy.
121

121

00:06:28,210  -->  00:06:30,640
Yes, it is, I remembered that correctly.
122

122

00:06:30,640  -->  00:06:33,195
So I will go through the process
of pasting in there,
123

123

00:06:33,195  -->  00:06:37,144
although we did have it right already
that if you're touching, if the player's
124

124

00:06:37,144  -->  00:06:40,591
touching the mask that is known as Enemy,
then what are we going to do?
125

125

00:06:40,591  -->  00:06:43,405
Well, we're gonna do
a couple of things in here.
126

126

00:06:43,405  -->  00:06:46,719
This is a good spot that,
if you're ready, you can pause the video.
127

127

00:06:46,719  -->  00:06:51,852
Let me remind you of our challenge in
here, is to change the player state and
128

128

00:06:51,852  -->  00:06:55,206
trigger some sort of
dramatic death animation.
129

129

00:06:55,206  -->  00:06:58,200
Well, not animation, per se, but
some sort of dramatic death.
130

130

00:06:58,200  -->  00:07:00,418
I'm gonna fling my enemy
off in the distance.
131

131

00:07:00,418  -->  00:07:03,590
You might wanna have them spiral around,
or change colors, or
132

132

00:07:03,590  -->  00:07:05,870
grow huge, or
do something with the camera,.
133

133

00:07:05,870  -->  00:07:10,332
So any particular dramatic sort of thing
you would like to do when the player dies,
134

134

00:07:10,332  -->  00:07:11,376
so to do those too.
135

135

00:07:11,376  -->  00:07:14,238
So there's a challenge again,
an opportunity to dive into the challenge,
136

136

00:07:14,238  -->  00:07:15,321
if you're ready to do that.
137

137

00:07:15,321  -->  00:07:17,730
And if so, I'll see you in a moment.
138

138

00:07:19,310  -->  00:07:21,000
Otherwise, let's continue on together.
139

139

00:07:21,000  -->  00:07:25,252
So in here, I'm gonna say if
the player is touching the enemy,
140

140

00:07:25,252  -->  00:07:29,986
then first of all, I'm gonna create for
my animation, myAnimator,
141

141

00:07:29,986  -->  00:07:34,264
sorry, myAnimator.SetTrigger SetTrigger,
SetTrigger.
142

142

00:07:34,264  -->  00:07:38,374
And we haven't created this yet, but
I will go and create this in a moment, and
143

143

00:07:38,374  -->  00:07:40,560
I'll call it Die when I do create it.
144

144

00:07:40,560  -->  00:07:43,503
This is why the string reference is such
a pain, cuz I have to make sure this
145

145

00:07:43,503  -->  00:07:45,798
is correct with what we've
got in our animation system.
146

146

00:07:45,798  -->  00:07:47,814
So strings, in general,
are not so good, but
147

147

00:07:47,814  -->  00:07:49,950
we're kind of forced to
use it in this instance.
148

148

00:07:49,950  -->  00:07:53,130
But we're gonna set the animator to
a trigger that we will call Die, and
149

149

00:07:53,130  -->  00:07:55,311
then I'm gonna do something
a little bit wacky.
150

150

00:07:55,311  -->  00:07:58,860
I'm gonna get the component for
the myRigidBody.
151

151

00:07:58,860  -->  00:08:02,748
So I'm gonna get the rigid body
of the player, RigidBody2D.
152

152

00:08:02,748  -->  00:08:03,760
And what shall I do here?
153

153

00:08:03,760  -->  00:08:06,106
Well, I said,
I'm just gonna sort of fling the player.
154

154

00:08:06,106  -->  00:08:12,622
So velocity =,
I'm gonna serialize this, actually.
155

155

00:08:12,622  -->  00:08:16,079
I'm gonna parameterize something that I'll
call deathKick, and we'll go up the top.
156

156

00:08:16,079  -->  00:08:19,940
We'll grab deathKick here,
scroll all the way up to the top.
157

157

00:08:19,940  -->  00:08:24,799
We will SerializeField up at
the very top of our script up here,
158

158

00:08:24,799  -->  00:08:28,925
SerializeField, and
this is gonna be, not a float,
159

159

00:08:28,925  -->  00:08:34,850
it's gonna be type Vector2,
Vector2 deathKick, as we've called it.
160

160

00:08:34,850  -->  00:08:43,814
And this new Vector2 will be new Vector2,
And where do we want to push it?
161

161

00:08:43,814  -->  00:08:47,363
So basically, we wanna give the player a
ton of velocity in a particular direction.
162

162

00:08:47,363  -->  00:08:53,200
Let's just sort of throw it up in the air,
maybe 25f, 25f, see how that goes.
163

163

00:08:54,380  -->  00:08:58,430
So to recap, what we've created down here
in our Die method, we're saying to get
164

164

00:08:58,430  -->  00:09:03,010
the Rigidbody2D, something isn't liking
it here, I've left out my parentheses.
165

165

00:09:04,850  -->  00:09:08,956
To get this Rigidbody and throw if off in
a particular direction, and at the same
166

166

00:09:08,956  -->  00:09:13,326
time, set the animation to a state of Die,
which I'm gonna go and create right now.
167

167

00:09:13,326  -->  00:09:16,663
Again, good chance to pause the video
if you think you know how to do this.
168

168

00:09:16,663  -->  00:09:20,903
If you haven't paused the video yet, pause
the video and create yourself a die state.
169

169

00:09:23,389  -->  00:09:26,780
I'm gonna go do through it the same
process that we've done before.
170

170

00:09:26,780  -->  00:09:29,170
Find my Sprite sheet for the player.
171

171

00:09:29,170  -->  00:09:30,752
Just find one that I think
could represent die.
172

172

00:09:30,752  -->  00:09:34,790
That looks like a bit of a die just there,
so that's _10.
173

173

00:09:34,790  -->  00:09:37,710
Right click on that &gt; Create Animation.
174

174

00:09:37,710  -->  00:09:39,460
I know there's only one
frame in this animation,
175

175

00:09:39,460  -->  00:09:42,940
but we'll use this mechanism in case we
want to put more frames in in the future.
176

176

00:09:42,940  -->  00:09:49,521
We'll call this die, or death,
die, dying, dying, there we go.
177

177

00:09:49,521  -->  00:09:52,960
Use the active mechanism,
the active process, the verb.
178

178

00:09:52,960  -->  00:09:54,800
Is that what it is, is a verb?
179

179

00:09:54,800  -->  00:09:55,840
Now, we've got our dying.
180

180

00:09:55,840  -->  00:09:57,120
Let's go back to our enemy.
181

181

00:09:59,180  -->  00:10:02,303
Where we are, let's put our
animation into our Animation folder.
182

182

00:10:02,303  -->  00:10:03,660
Let's tidy up as we go.
183

183

00:10:03,660  -->  00:10:07,220
Look at this mess I've created here,
just things in the wrong folder.
184

184

00:10:07,220  -->  00:10:11,921
And we go to Animations, find the player,
animation controller here.
185

185

00:10:11,921  -->  00:10:15,555
Now, we want to have death
possible from any state, so
186

186

00:10:15,555  -->  00:10:18,715
I'm gonna grab this blue
Any State over here and
187

187

00:10:18,715  -->  00:10:22,760
move that just in the middle, so
I can see it nice and easily.
188

188

00:10:22,760  -->  00:10:25,230
Let's give ourselves a bit
more screen real estate here.
189

189

00:10:25,230  -->  00:10:30,127
So from this Any State,
I want to transition into Death, and
190

190

00:10:30,127  -->  00:10:31,770
our Dying, sorry.
191

191

00:10:31,770  -->  00:10:33,960
So our Dying that we've got here,
drag that in.
192

192

00:10:33,960  -->  00:10:35,590
We don't need to have it looping.
193

193

00:10:35,590  -->  00:10:38,000
So that's one of the things that we
often look at, so we don't need to loop.
194

194

00:10:38,000  -->  00:10:39,710
It's just a one time thing.
195

195

00:10:39,710  -->  00:10:43,223
And we will right click,
make transition from Any State into Dying.
196

196

00:10:43,223  -->  00:10:47,766
At the moment,
we don't have a transition parameter.
197

197

00:10:47,766  -->  00:10:50,980
I'm gonna click on the + here,
and we'll make this a trigger.
198

198

00:10:50,980  -->  00:10:54,400
It's just trigger dying, yes or no.
199

199

00:10:56,520  -->  00:10:59,073
Dying when we trigger that,
that should happen, and
200

200

00:10:59,073  -->  00:11:01,579
then that should make our
one frame come into state.
201

201

00:11:01,579  -->  00:11:05,776
As with before,
we need to come into our transition.
202

202

00:11:05,776  -->  00:11:10,483
So I'll click on Transition here,
and drag that guy out of the way.
203

203

00:11:10,483  -->  00:11:14,960
Plus on the Conditions,
Dying is a trigger, so
204

204

00:11:14,960  -->  00:11:17,980
there's not a true or false, and
dying is what's happening in there.
205

205

00:11:17,980  -->  00:11:22,460
I'm going to tidy up my overlap here,
so it's not a fixed duration.
206

206

00:11:22,460  -->  00:11:27,590
In the future, we'll use a mechanism.
207

207

00:11:27,590  -->  00:11:31,226
We'll use probably
a co-routine with a wait for
208

208

00:11:31,226  -->  00:11:33,995
seconds to say how long death lasts.
209

209

00:11:33,995  -->  00:11:35,525
But for now,
we're just gonna trigger it and
210

210

00:11:35,525  -->  00:11:37,205
then the player will get
stuck in that state.
211

211

00:11:37,205  -->  00:11:38,795
That's fine,
we'll tidy that up in the future.
212

212

00:11:38,795  -->  00:11:41,625
For now, we just wanna make sure
this mechanism actually happens and
213

213

00:11:41,625  -->  00:11:42,175
actually works.
214

214

00:11:42,175  -->  00:11:43,375
So we have Dying just here.
215

215

00:11:43,375  -->  00:11:46,593
I'm gonna copy that cuz I typed
it in incorrectly in my script.
216

216

00:11:46,593  -->  00:11:48,928
I was saying before about strings.
217

217

00:11:48,928  -->  00:11:52,740
It is called Dying that we decided
to go with, save all that up.
218

218

00:11:52,740  -->  00:11:55,760
Back into our editor, click play,
and if all goes to plan,
219

219

00:11:55,760  -->  00:11:58,930
our player should fling off in
the distance and I should lose control.
220

220

00:11:58,930  -->  00:12:03,100
Here we go, big dramatic moment,
nope, didn't do that.
221

221

00:12:03,100  -->  00:12:06,230
So when we look at our Collisions, there's
gonna be something going on here in terms
222

222

00:12:06,230  -->  00:12:11,410
of our Collision relationship,
usually because of triggers.
223

223

00:12:11,410  -->  00:12:14,670
So let's have a look, our Box Collider,
our Capsule Collider here, Is Trigger.
224

224

00:12:14,670  -->  00:12:17,054
We hadn't turned that on, let's try
that again, now that it is a trigger.
225

225

00:12:19,538  -->  00:12:22,870
Run, run, run, run, run, and boink.
226

226

00:12:22,870  -->  00:12:26,250
Okay, still running,
that didn't work either, so
227

227

00:12:26,250  -->  00:12:28,740
let's put in a print statement
here to see what's going on.
228

228

00:12:28,740  -->  00:12:32,223
Print, should be dying.
229

229

00:12:35,395  -->  00:12:40,027
So here's how we do a little bit of active
debugging to see why our player is not
230

230

00:12:40,027  -->  00:12:42,030
doing what it's supposed to do.
231

231

00:12:43,050  -->  00:12:46,650
We haven't yet
turned off the controls, let's see.
232

232

00:12:46,650  -->  00:12:51,193
Okay, so when I run up here on
the console, okay, that's not getting
233

233

00:12:51,193  -->  00:12:56,122
triggered, so the problem is that this
collision is not happening in here.
234

234

00:12:56,122  -->  00:12:59,897
Player should be dying, if myBodyCollider,
235

235

00:12:59,897  -->  00:13:04,960
yes, IsTouchingLayers,
Enemy, then we want to die.
236

236

00:13:04,960  -->  00:13:06,730
Aha, here we go.
237

237

00:13:06,730  -->  00:13:09,272
We haven't added die into the list
of things that we can do.
238

238

00:13:09,272  -->  00:13:14,180
Die, There we go.
239

239

00:13:14,180  -->  00:13:15,300
I think that is gonna be it.
240

240

00:13:15,300  -->  00:13:15,877
And you know what?
241

241

00:13:15,877  -->  00:13:19,244
This seems to be a habit of mine,
I forget to put things in the update,
242

242

00:13:19,244  -->  00:13:21,300
maybe make a mental note of that.
243

243

00:13:21,300  -->  00:13:23,780
Not sure if you missed that as well,
but I definitely miss that often.
244

244

00:13:23,780  -->  00:13:24,592
That and triggers,
245

245

00:13:24,592  -->  00:13:28,044
they're the two things that I seem to miss
a lot when I'm going through these things.
246

246

00:13:28,044  -->  00:13:30,021
Now, run along, run along, and boink.
247

247

00:13:30,021  -->  00:13:33,840
Hey, and I can still drive
the player though, so that's good,
248

248

00:13:33,840  -->  00:13:35,340
we've made progress.
249

249

00:13:35,340  -->  00:13:40,640
I now need to go and
see why we are able to move around,
250

250

00:13:40,640  -->  00:13:44,030
because as a last step,
absolutely, have you guessed it?
251

251

00:13:44,030  -->  00:13:46,759
As a last step, if we are dying, so
252

252

00:13:46,759  -->  00:13:51,668
as soon as we call this method of Die,
we want to say, in here.
253

253

00:13:51,668  -->  00:13:54,443
Instead of is should be dying,
254

254

00:13:54,443  -->  00:13:59,364
we wanna point out the truth which,
isAlive = false.
255

255

00:13:59,364  -->  00:14:03,752
Okay, so
because we're saying isAlive is false,
256

256

00:14:03,752  -->  00:14:08,354
then it will tell our Update
method isAlive is false.
257

257

00:14:08,354  -->  00:14:10,777
Therefore, return,
then let the player run, climb, and
258

258

00:14:10,777  -->  00:14:12,400
do those other good things.
259

259

00:14:12,400  -->  00:14:14,674
Jump back into our building here,
click on play.
260

260

00:14:17,749  -->  00:14:19,392
[SOUND] Run up there, boink!
261

261

00:14:19,392  -->  00:14:24,150
Okay, and can't move and can't jump,
can't any of those things, fantastic.
262

262

00:14:24,150  -->  00:14:27,460
Okay, and the last thing we wanna do is to
give our player a little bit more of a big
263

263

00:14:27,460  -->  00:14:30,850
kick up into the air cuz it seems
there's not enough force going on.
264

264

00:14:30,850  -->  00:14:34,120
So let's add a zero to the end
of this Death Kick on the X and
265

265

00:14:34,120  -->  00:14:38,430
on the Y to see if that
satisfactorily flings the player.
266

266

00:14:38,430  -->  00:14:42,180
It might be that our death kick to gravity
relationship was not strong enough.
267

267

00:14:42,180  -->  00:14:43,810
Whoa, there we go, boing.
268

268

00:14:43,810  -->  00:14:44,780
That was pretty dramatic.
269

269

00:14:44,780  -->  00:14:46,630
I quite liked that one.
270

270

00:14:46,630  -->  00:14:48,748
So one more time, just for the cameras.
271

271

00:14:48,748  -->  00:14:51,552
Smile, Mr. Player,
when you bloink and die.
272

272

00:14:51,552  -->  00:14:55,814
So we now have it that the player
has collisioned, it is a trigger.
273

273

00:14:55,814  -->  00:14:59,308
When the player collides with the enemy,
we remove controls for the player.
274

274

00:14:59,308  -->  00:15:01,776
The player goes flinging
off in the distance and
275

275

00:15:01,776  -->  00:15:05,912
has their new death animation state, which
is just lying there in the corner and
276

276

00:15:05,912  -->  00:15:08,395
having a bit of a cry,
which is what he's good.
277

277

00:15:08,395  -->  00:15:11,492
Until we restart the level, which
we'll be doing in upcoming videos and
278

278

00:15:11,492  -->  00:15:13,289
bringing your player back to life again.
279

279

00:15:13,289  -->  00:15:14,770
So great work, well done.
280

280

00:15:14,770  -->  00:15:17,530
I hope you're excited that your
player now is vulnerable, and
281

281

00:15:17,530  -->  00:15:18,670
I will see you in the next video.
