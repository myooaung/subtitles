2

00:00:04.040  -->  00:00:04.958
Hello, again,
3

3

00:00:04.958  -->  00:00:09.349
in this video we're gonna unravel the
mysteries of the Animator Controller and
4

4

00:00:09.349  -->  00:00:13.888
create our GameObject Lizard that is
walking using our sprite sheet animations.
5

5

00:00:13.888  -->  00:00:16.245
So let's jump in and get started.
6

6

00:00:16.245  -->  00:00:19.355
I'm gonna start off by tidying up my
new sprite, just get rid of that.
7

7

00:00:19.355  -->  00:00:23.711
That was a placeholder, don't need it any
more, what we do need to do though is
8

8

00:00:23.711  -->  00:00:26.750
right-click, Create Empty,
and call this Lizard.
9

9

00:00:27.880  -->  00:00:29.940
And then just reset the transform.
10

10

00:00:29.940  -->  00:00:33.050
Okay, now I've been calling it Lizard.
11

11

00:00:33.050  -->  00:00:36.737
If you downloaded this or if you're
looking to download from the main
12

12

00:00:36.737  -->  00:00:39.228
asset pack, it's called the deimaginator.
13

13

00:00:39.228  -->  00:00:40.842
I've just recalled it Lizard,
14

14

00:00:40.842  -->  00:00:44.489
because deimaginator is a bit tricky
to say throughout this course, but
15

15

00:00:44.489  -->  00:00:48.260
that's where it is if you're looking
in the official glitch assets.
16

16

00:00:48.260  -->  00:00:52.370
Deimaginator is the Lizard, now to see
our Lizard we need to add a component,
17

17

00:00:52.370  -->  00:00:53.920
which is the Sprite Renderer.
18

18

00:00:53.920  -->  00:00:56.780
Sprite Renderer, great, and
we've done this before.
19

19

00:00:56.780  -->  00:01:01.476
Let's find one of the frames from
the Lizard Walk, just Lizard Walk 7.
20

20

00:01:01.476  -->  00:01:06.508
Drop that into the sprite in here and
now it knows what to show.
21

21

00:01:06.508  -->  00:01:10.694
We're gonna change the order in layer to
five so it sits on top of my background.
22

22

00:01:10.694  -->  00:01:14.457
And just with my W key,
move the Lizard, or deimaginator,
23

23

00:01:14.457  -->  00:01:16.428
into the middle of the screen.
24

24

00:01:16.428  -->  00:01:17.910
There we go, it looks pretty good.
25

25

00:01:17.910  -->  00:01:22.114
So the Sprite Renderer is needed to
actually display it on the screen.
26

26

00:01:22.114  -->  00:01:24.380
Now we're gonna be dealing with animation,
so
27

27

00:01:24.380  -->  00:01:28.130
first of all make sure you have the
animator and animation windows somewhere.
28

28

00:01:28.130  -->  00:01:31.680
You can go up to Window,
they've changed this recently in Unity.
29

29

00:01:31.680  -->  00:01:33.400
These windows change around every now and
again.
30

30

00:01:33.400  -->  00:01:37.488
If you find the Animation tab,
wherever that might be for you, and
31

31

00:01:37.488  -->  00:01:41.361
then make sure you open up
the Animation and Animator windows.
32

32

00:01:41.361  -->  00:01:43.129
Okay, I've got mine placed
down the bottom here.
33

33

00:01:43.129  -->  00:01:46.329
Now let's talk about a little bit of
terminology so we're crystal clear.
34

34

00:01:46.329  -->  00:01:50.950
First of all, the Animator Component
assigns animations to GameObjects
35

35

00:01:50.950  -->  00:01:53.118
through an Animator Controller.
36

36

00:01:53.118  -->  00:01:56.457
Okay, so that doesn't
necessarily make things clearer,
37

37

00:01:56.457  -->  00:02:00.396
but we'll be adding a component onto
our GameObject which allows that
38

38

00:02:00.396  -->  00:02:03.953
GameObject to say, right,
you need to have some animations.
39

39

00:02:03.953  -->  00:02:06.816
And they'll be driven through
the Animated Controller.
40

40

00:02:06.816  -->  00:02:07.903
What is the Animated Controller?
41

41

00:02:07.903  -->  00:02:12.343
Well, it's the arrangement of
animations and transitions, and
42

42

00:02:12.343  -->  00:02:17.191
it's a state machine so it could have
a walk state, or a walk animation.
43

43

00:02:17.191  -->  00:02:21.847
And then a transition that says if
the player holds down the sprint key,
44

44

00:02:21.847  -->  00:02:25.090
then we transition into the run animation.
45

45

00:02:25.090  -->  00:02:28.067
So that's all handled in
the Animator Controller, and
46

46

00:02:28.067  -->  00:02:30.995
then we need our individual animations,
obviously.
47

47

00:02:30.995  -->  00:02:36.270
These are specific pieces of motion, the
run, the jump, the shoot, the fall over.
48

48

00:02:36.270  -->  00:02:39.110
And then also as we've added already
we need the Sprite Renderer, and
49

49

00:02:39.110  -->  00:02:43.030
this is what we need to actually
display the sprites onto the screen.
50

50

00:02:43.030  -->  00:02:45.310
So there's some terminology for you, and
51

51

00:02:45.310  -->  00:02:47.070
now what I'm gonna do is
something a little bit different.
52

52

00:02:47.070  -->  00:02:50.778
I'm gonna go through the process of
creating the Animated Controller and
53

53

00:02:50.778  -->  00:02:52.822
some animations for my character here.
54

54

00:02:52.822  -->  00:02:57.626
What I'd like you to do as a challenge, is
to just watch and absorb and then see if
55

55

00:02:57.626  -->  00:03:02.130
you can do all of this yourself when
we get to the time of the challenge.
56

56

00:03:02.130  -->  00:03:06.270
So the steps of the challenge will be,
when we get to it, will be, well,
57

57

00:03:06.270  -->  00:03:08.860
first of all watch [LAUGH], and
then do it on your own later on.
58

58

00:03:08.860  -->  00:03:12.172
It will be to create
an Animated Component,
59

59

00:03:12.172  -->  00:03:17.183
to create an Animator Controller,
to add the Animator Controller
60

60

00:03:17.183  -->  00:03:22.029
to Lizard Game Object, and
to create an animation for the walk.
61

61

00:03:22.029  -->  00:03:24.730
And then obviously we need to
do a little bit of tuning to
62

62

00:03:24.730  -->  00:03:27.923
the speed of the animation so
that it looks good and makes sense.
63

63

00:03:27.923  -->  00:03:32.457
So that will be the challenge shortly,
after I take you through all the steps.
64

64

00:03:32.457  -->  00:03:36.363
I'm going to give you that challenge and
if you get stuck on the challenge you can
65

65

00:03:36.363  -->  00:03:38.825
come back and rewatch for
any hints that you want.
66

66

00:03:38.825  -->  00:03:41.205
So there's the challenge,
you can do it right now, or
67

67

00:03:41.205  -->  00:03:44.510
you can wait until after I've done it,
okay.
68

68

00:03:44.510  -->  00:03:46.930
So let's jump in and get started on this.
69

69

00:03:46.930  -->  00:03:49.575
We have our Lizard,
we need to add a component,
70

70

00:03:49.575  -->  00:03:52.740
and this will be the Animator Component.
71

71

00:03:52.740  -->  00:03:55.800
Okay, now it's saying, okay,
I'm ready to do some animations, but
72

72

00:03:55.800  -->  00:03:58.990
I need to know what is the controller,
what is the thing that's gonna
73

73

00:03:58.990  -->  00:04:03.200
be determining when you run and
when you jump and what jump is?
74

74

00:04:03.200  -->  00:04:04.950
So we need to create one of those.
75

75

00:04:04.950  -->  00:04:07.256
I've got an animations folder.
76

76

00:04:07.256  -->  00:04:09.622
I was playing around just before
a bit naughty off screen.
77

77

00:04:09.622  -->  00:04:13.539
Let me delete that and do it so
we can do it together, okay?
78

78

00:04:13.539  -->  00:04:16.704
In my Assets folder,
I'm gonna create surprise,
79

79

00:04:16.704  -->  00:04:19.508
surprise, a new folder called Animations.
80

80

00:04:19.508  -->  00:04:25.926
And in our Animations folder, right-click
and create Animator Controller.
81

81

00:04:25.926  -->  00:04:31.930
We'll call this Lizard and you can see
it's now populated in our animator.
82

82

00:04:31.930  -->  00:04:33.940
We have some stuff in there.
83

83

00:04:33.940  -->  00:04:35.967
You can drag these and move them around.
84

84

00:04:35.967  -->  00:04:39.032
These are the states at the moment,
it doesn't quite make sense,
85

85

00:04:39.032  -->  00:04:40.520
there's isn't a lot going on.
86

86

00:04:40.520  -->  00:04:44.110
We just have an entry state,
the first thing that happens and the exit.
87

87

00:04:44.110  -->  00:04:47.750
This is when we exit out of
this Animated Controller.
88

88

00:04:47.750  -->  00:04:50.634
We need some animations in here.
89

89

00:04:50.634  -->  00:04:53.840
Now I'm gonna show you my preferred
way to create animations.
90

90

00:04:53.840  -->  00:04:57.020
There's a lot of different ways to do it,
but I'll show you the way that I like to
91

91

00:04:57.020  -->  00:04:59.090
do it which is to find
the thing we want to animate.
92

92

00:04:59.090  -->  00:05:04.134
So go to your sprites and
find your Lizard Walk or whatever it is
93

93

00:05:04.134  -->  00:05:09.954
that you've created, highlight all
of the frames of your animation,
94

94

00:05:09.954  -->  00:05:14.716
and then right-click Create
&gt; Find Animation, blink.
95

95

00:05:14.716  -->  00:05:19.000
And now you see down the bottom
we can rename our new
96

96

00:05:19.000  -->  00:05:21.554
animation to be Lizard Walk.
97

97

00:05:21.554  -->  00:05:26.045
And we now have a Lizard Walk animation
that if we click on our Animation tab
98

98

00:05:26.045  -->  00:05:28.869
here, you can see it has
all of these frames and
99

99

00:05:28.869  -->  00:05:31.735
these individual frames are corresponding.
100

100

00:05:31.735  -->  00:05:37.440
All these key frames are corresponding to
each of our images from our spreadsheet.
101

101

00:05:37.440  -->  00:05:38.440
Now we can't see it at the moment.
102

102

00:05:38.440  -->  00:05:41.083
If we click on Play there's
nothing to preview,
103

103

00:05:41.083  -->  00:05:44.827
cuz it doesn't know what the model is or
what the representation is.
104

104

00:05:44.827  -->  00:05:49.623
We've already created ourselves
a Lizard GameObject, so we'll grab that,
105

105

00:05:49.623  -->  00:05:51.667
drag it on over into our preview.
106

106

00:05:51.667  -->  00:05:54.941
Now when we click the Preview button,
we see it walking.
107

107

00:05:54.941  -->  00:05:58.718
And in the preview, we can slow it
down [SOUND] to see how it goes, or
108

108

00:05:58.718  -->  00:06:00.597
speed it up to see how that goes.
109

109

00:06:00.597  -->  00:06:03.185
But that's not changing the speed
of the animation in the game.
110

110

00:06:03.185  -->  00:06:05.250
That's just changing
the speed of the preview.
111

111

00:06:05.250  -->  00:06:10.203
What we can do to change the speed
of the actual animation itself
112

112

00:06:10.203  -->  00:06:12.169
is you see here samples.
113

113

00:06:12.169  -->  00:06:16.740
At the moment what that's saying
is 12 samples per second.
114

114

00:06:16.740  -->  00:06:20.416
We know that our Lizard has 16 frames.
115

115

00:06:20.416  -->  00:06:23.603
So it's going to get through those,
all of those 16 frames,
116

116

00:06:23.603  -->  00:06:24.935
in a little over a second.
117

117

00:06:24.935  -->  00:06:26.446
So 12 frames per second.
118

118

00:06:26.446  -->  00:06:29.371
This is taking us up to a second,
and there's another three or
119

119

00:06:29.371  -->  00:06:30.790
four frames at the end there.
120

120

00:06:30.790  -->  00:06:34.685
I'm gonna change this to say 100,
just to be silly.
121

121

00:06:34.685  -->  00:06:38.885
So in this instance, we're getting through
our frames really quickly if I click Play.
122

122

00:06:38.885  -->  00:06:43.065
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
that's funny, [LAUGH] it's kinda cool, but
123

123

00:06:43.065  -->  00:06:45.649
it's not quite what the artist
was going for, I'm sure.
124

124

00:06:45.649  -->  00:06:49.123
I think the happy medium here,
just from playing around with it,
125

125

00:06:49.123  -->  00:06:51.597
is 24 frames per second for
this character.
126

126

00:06:51.597  -->  00:06:55.179
That's a nice,
gentle meander that our Lizard's doing.
127

127

00:06:55.179  -->  00:07:00.007
Okay, so
we now have an animation that's comprised
128

128

00:07:00.007  -->  00:07:03.749
of our sprite sheet individual frames.
129

129

00:07:03.749  -->  00:07:07.869
I'm gonna grab this animation and drag it
into my Animations folder so it's nice and
130

130

00:07:07.869  -->  00:07:09.386
tidy, I know where to find it.
131

131

00:07:09.386  -->  00:07:14.098
Now we have our Lizard Animator Controller
and our Lizard Walk.
132

132

00:07:14.098  -->  00:07:16.529
And if we click on Lizard as a GameObject,
133

133

00:07:16.529  -->  00:07:20.426
now we can say under Controller
what's the Animator Controller?
134

134

00:07:20.426  -->  00:07:24.330
Let's click the selector and say it's
going to be the Lizard, excellent.
135

135

00:07:24.330  -->  00:07:28.114
It now knows the Lizard Animated
Controller is gonna drive me.
136

136

00:07:28.114  -->  00:07:33.140
If we click on the Lizard Animator
Controller and then click on the Animator
137

137

00:07:33.140  -->  00:07:37.864
window, we can see that our Lizard Walk
animation is not yet in there.
138

138

00:07:37.864  -->  00:07:40.793
So what we're gonna do if I can
resize my window a little bit here,
139

139

00:07:40.793  -->  00:07:43.213
it's being a bit problematic,
there we go, got it.
140

140

00:07:43.213  -->  00:07:48.261
Is to grab Lizard Walk and
drag it into my Animator Controller.
141

141

00:07:48.261  -->  00:07:51.774
It comes in as this orange
state called Lizard Walk.
142

142

00:07:51.774  -->  00:07:55.095
And it's got some details in the inspector
that we'll play around with a little bit
143

143

00:07:55.095  -->  00:07:55.954
in upcoming videos.
144

144

00:07:55.954  -->  00:07:59.108
And it has this line that is created,
which is a transition.
145

145

00:07:59.108  -->  00:08:04.218
What it's saying in this instance is the
entry, so the very moment anything says,
146

146

00:08:04.218  -->  00:08:08.452
hey, I need you to pay attention
to the Lizard Animator Controller,
147

147

00:08:08.452  -->  00:08:12.330
which is probably when our Lizard
is spawned or instantiated.
148

148

00:08:12.330  -->  00:08:13.053
And in this case,
149

149

00:08:13.053  -->  00:08:16.400
it's right from the very start of the game
cuz we've dropped it in our hierarchy.
150

150

00:08:16.400  -->  00:08:19.416
It will go from entry [SOUND]
straight along the transition,
151

151

00:08:19.416  -->  00:08:21.052
immediately into Lizard Walk.
152

152

00:08:21.052  -->  00:08:22.234
And there's no other transitions.
153

153

00:08:22.234  -->  00:08:24.510
There's not a transition to die or
to jump,
154

154

00:08:24.510  -->  00:08:27.338
so it will just stay on Lizard Walk over,
and over, and
155

155

00:08:27.338  -->  00:08:31.900
over in this case, cuz there's only
one animation that we have in there.
156

156

00:08:31.900  -->  00:08:33.188
So let's see if that works.
157

157

00:08:33.188  -->  00:08:34.740
We've got our Lizard GameObject.
158

158

00:08:34.740  -->  00:08:37.402
It has the Lizard Animator Controller.
159

159

00:08:37.402  -->  00:08:43.580
The Lizard Animator Controller knows
about the Lizard Walk animation.
160

160

00:08:43.580  -->  00:08:47.100
So if we click Play in our game now,
what do we see?
161

161

00:08:48.360  -->  00:08:51.410
We see that our Lizard does a bit of
a walk, but you see it walked and
162

162

00:08:51.410  -->  00:08:52.110
then stopped.
163

163

00:08:52.110  -->  00:08:54.130
That looked like it went
through its 16 frames and
164

164

00:08:54.130  -->  00:08:56.980
then stopped,
which to me says we're not looping.
165

165

00:08:56.980  -->  00:08:58.840
Let's have a look and
see where we need to loop.
166

166

00:08:58.840  -->  00:09:03.480
Well, the simplest way to do this is
to click on the Lizard Walk animation
167

167

00:09:03.480  -->  00:09:04.700
we have in our folder here.
168

168

00:09:04.700  -->  00:09:08.056
And you can see in our inspector
we have the loop time.
169

169

00:09:08.056  -->  00:09:11.534
If you click Yes on looped time,
now when we click Play,
170

170

00:09:11.534  -->  00:09:15.984
that animation should know that by
default it just loops over and over.
171

171

00:09:15.984  -->  00:09:19.115
So there we go loopy, loop, loop, loop,
I'll go to the same view so we can see.
172

172

00:09:19.115  -->  00:09:24.306
And our guy is walking in our game
fully animated, looking amazing.
173

173

00:09:24.306  -->  00:09:28.590
And obviously as time goes on, and
we implement more features in our game,
174

174

00:09:28.590  -->  00:09:32.404
we can tell it to move across
the screen as the animation's going.
175

175

00:09:32.404  -->  00:09:35.519
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, so
it looks like it's actually walking.
176

176

00:09:35.519  -->  00:09:37.105
Okay, so that's the full process.
177

177

00:09:37.105  -->  00:09:38.913
Back to the challenge for you.
178

178

00:09:38.913  -->  00:09:42.395
If you haven't been following along, or
sorry, if you haven't been creating as
179

179

00:09:42.395  -->  00:09:44.978
you've been going,
this is the challenge for you to do now.
180

180

00:09:44.978  -->  00:09:47.621
And if you were following along,
you might want to go and
181

181

00:09:47.621  -->  00:09:51.224
create another Animated Controller
animation just to practice this to make
182

182

00:09:51.224  -->  00:09:52.645
sure it's really embedded.
183

183

00:09:52.645  -->  00:09:54.390
Some of the terms are a bit confusing.
184

184

00:09:54.390  -->  00:09:57.970
Create an Animator Component,
create the Animator Controller,
185

185

00:09:57.970  -->  00:10:00.350
add the Animator Controller
to the Lizard Game Object.
186

186

00:10:00.350  -->  00:10:04.069
Create an animation, tune the speed
of the animation as we've done.
187

187

00:10:04.069  -->  00:10:08.988
And then once you've done that, once you
have your Lizard or whatever you're using
188

188

00:10:08.988  -->  00:10:13.438
in your game walking on the screen for
an animation, great work, job done.
189

189

00:10:13.438  -->  00:10:17.443
And you can go along to the next video and
we'll continue along with our animation.
190

190

00:10:17.443  -->  00:10:20.010
So great stuff and
I'll see you again real soon.
