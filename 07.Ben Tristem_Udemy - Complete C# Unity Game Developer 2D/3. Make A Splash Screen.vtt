2

00:00:00.769  -->  00:00:04.780
Hello again, in this video,
we're creating a splash screen.
3

3

00:00:04.780  -->  00:00:09.356
That is a screen we will make which,
after implementing a code routine,
4

4

00:00:09.356  -->  00:00:12.969
will then jump into my other scene here,
our start menu.
5

5

00:00:12.969  -->  00:00:17.760
So we'll give ourselves a little bit
of a delay, play a sound effect, and
6

6

00:00:17.760  -->  00:00:19.709
then get into the start menu.
7

7

00:00:19.709  -->  00:00:22.634
So let's jump in and
get started, okay, as always,
8

8

00:00:22.634  -->  00:00:25.172
let's start by creating
a new Unity project.
9

9

00:00:25.172  -->  00:00:27.186
I'm calling mine Glitch Garden, and
10

10

00:00:27.186  -->  00:00:30.007
make sure you've changed
it to 2D as the template.
11

11

00:00:30.007  -->  00:00:34.033
It's not a big problem if you don't,
and being a bit of a numpty myself,
12

12

00:00:34.033  -->  00:00:36.685
I just set it up in 3D
when I created my project.
13

13

00:00:36.685  -->  00:00:39.202
So while yours is loading in 2D,
hopefully,
14

14

00:00:39.202  -->  00:00:42.761
I'm gonna show you what to do if
you accidentally set it up in 3D.
15

15

00:00:42.761  -->  00:00:47.084
It's not a big problem, there's the toggle
up here which changes the view,
16

16

00:00:47.084  -->  00:00:48.426
you can put it on to 2D.
17

17

00:00:48.426  -->  00:00:52.797
At any time, you can go have a look at how
it looks in 3D, but got it on 2D there.
18

18

00:00:52.797  -->  00:00:57.282
Up to Edit and then Project Settings,
and we're looking for Editor.
19

19

00:00:57.282  -->  00:01:01.633
Over on the right here,
default behavior mode, just from 3D to 2D.
20

20

00:01:01.633  -->  00:01:06.596
And hen when I go and start a new scene so
File &gt; New Scene, which I'd like for
21

21

00:01:06.596  -->  00:01:08.934
to do now, is to create a new scene.
22

22

00:01:08.934  -->  00:01:14.138
And we have our 2D looking scene in here,
and there's no extra light, and the camera
23

23

00:01:14.138  -->  00:01:18.564
is set up as orthographic instead
of perspective, so that's all good.
24

24

00:01:18.564  -->  00:01:22.184
Okay, now I'm gonna save the scene,
File &gt; Save Scene As.
25

25

00:01:22.184  -->  00:01:27.401
We'll put it in our scenes folder,
we're gonna call this the splash screen.
26

26

00:01:27.401  -->  00:01:31.640
And that is what we'll be creating
shortly, so splash screen.
27

27

00:01:31.640  -->  00:01:35.652
And I'm just gonna go ahead and delete my
sample scene cuz I don't wanna have that
28

28

00:01:35.652  -->  00:01:38.252
in there anymore,
I've only got my splash screen.
29

29

00:01:38.252  -->  00:01:40.964
Excellent, now throughout
this section of the course,
30

30

00:01:40.964  -->  00:01:43.288
we're using assets from
a place called Glitch.
31

31

00:01:43.288  -->  00:01:47.591
This was a game, you can see,
2009 to 2012, it's no longer around.
32

32

00:01:47.591  -->  00:01:51.738
At Glitchthegame.com, we're grabbing
these assets, they're open source.
33

33

00:01:51.738  -->  00:01:55.997
If you click on the download link,
you can see there's tons of downloads,
34

34

00:01:55.997  -->  00:01:58.374
all the sprite sheets
is a good one to get.
35

35

00:01:58.374  -->  00:02:02.603
For now, we are going to, just gonna go
back to the previous screen by hitting
36

36

00:02:02.603  -->  00:02:05.809
back on my backy button, and
then over here to downloads.
37

37

00:02:05.809  -->  00:02:10.165
Now if this is no longer around, if for
some reason in the future, they're like,
38

38

00:02:10.165  -->  00:02:13.026
well, we don't wanna have
this website up anymore.
39

39

00:02:13.026  -->  00:02:17.347
I've given you all the resources I'm gonna
use in this video and in this section
40

40

00:02:17.347  -->  00:02:21.620
against this lecture, so no worries if
you can't find this website anymore.
41

41

00:02:21.620  -->  00:02:26.023
You can see in here, there's a whole bunch
of wallpapery type things we can use,
42

42

00:02:26.023  -->  00:02:29.741
there's music that we'll use as ringtones,
lots of great stuff.
43

43

00:02:29.741  -->  00:02:33.059
First of all, I'm gonna go and
get this as my splash screen.
44

44

00:02:33.059  -->  00:02:36.782
I'll find the 1920 by 1080,
and click on that to download.
45

45

00:02:36.782  -->  00:02:38.864
Okay, while that's downloading,
46

46

00:02:38.864  -->  00:02:42.432
I'm gonna have a look at what I'd
like to have as my start menu.
47

47

00:02:42.432  -->  00:02:45.935
So we're gonna have the start button and
the quit button.
48

48

00:02:45.935  -->  00:02:50.154
And I think I'm gonna go for this frog
here, download full size as well.
49

49

00:02:50.154  -->  00:02:54.116
Okay, excellent, so I'm gonna find
the files that have downloaded,
50

50

00:02:54.116  -->  00:02:55.050
show in folder.
51

51

00:02:55.050  -->  00:02:59.797
Let's see, we've got the frog, and
my preview image is taking awhile.
52

52

00:02:59.797  -->  00:03:02.341
What's going on with you, crazy program?
53

53

00:03:02.341  -->  00:03:06.323
Let me fire up Unity here, and
I will find the assets folder.
54

54

00:03:06.323  -->  00:03:10.373
Right-click &gt; Create &gt; Folder,
make something in here which
55

55

00:03:10.373  -->  00:03:14.207
is called images as a folder,
so I've got an images folder.
56

56

00:03:14.207  -->  00:03:16.492
Open that up, and now I can find, okay,
57

57

00:03:16.492  -->  00:03:20.002
there's my splash screen that
I'm gonna use, drag that in.
58

58

00:03:20.002  -->  00:03:24.005
And while I'm here,
I'm gonna drag in the image I'll use for
59

59

00:03:24.005  -->  00:03:26.015
my start screen, there we go.
60

60

00:03:26.015  -->  00:03:29.527
And while I'm here as well,
[LAUGH] I'm saying while I'm here a lot.
61

61

00:03:29.527  -->  00:03:32.523
While I'm here,
I must have that on my mind at the moment.
62

62

00:03:32.523  -->  00:03:36.203
I'm going to rename, so
right-click &gt; Rename, there we go.
63

63

00:03:36.203  -->  00:03:40.234
Rename this to splash image, and
also while I'm here, [LAUGH],
64

64

00:03:40.234  -->  00:03:42.858
I'm gonna stop saying that, I promise.
65

65

00:03:42.858  -->  00:03:47.856
I'll get a whole bunch of people in
the comments, why is Rick saying while I'm
66

66

00:03:47.856  -->  00:03:52.051
here over and over, and
I'll rename this to start screen image.
67

67

00:03:52.051  -->  00:03:57.288
Okay, so we have our splash screen as
a scene that we're in at the moment,
68

68

00:03:57.288  -->  00:04:00.672
and we have a couple of images,
what to do next?
69

69

00:04:00.672  -->  00:04:06.913
Well, we need to create ourselves some
way of displaying our splash image.
70

70

00:04:06.913  -->  00:04:12.270
So up in our hierarchy, right-click,
and we will create while we're here.
71

71

00:04:12.270  -->  00:04:16.260
[LAUGH] No, I'm just joking,
[LAUGH] we will create a UI and
72

72

00:04:16.260  -->  00:04:19.181
canvas, right down at the bottom there.
73

73

00:04:19.181  -->  00:04:22.832
Okay, so we've got a canvas in here,
right-click, UI,
74

74

00:04:22.832  -->  00:04:24.887
we will throw into here an image.
75

75

00:04:24.887  -->  00:04:31.709
And the image, we will drag our splash
image, [SOUND] over onto the splash image.
76

76

00:04:31.709  -->  00:04:36.744
If we double-click on the canvas,
it's big cuz it's saying, this is the UI.
77

77

00:04:36.744  -->  00:04:40.068
It's gonna fit over whatever
the player can see,
78

78

00:04:40.068  -->  00:04:42.451
no matter how big we make the world.
79

79

00:04:42.451  -->  00:04:47.052
And I want to click on my image and
say, within here, preserve aspect and
80

80

00:04:47.052  -->  00:04:48.191
set native size.
81

81

00:04:48.191  -->  00:04:52.837
[SOUND] And there we go, it's filling up
my entire canvas, is exactly what I want.
82

82

00:04:52.837  -->  00:04:55.688
At some point,
we'll change our game camera size, so
83

83

00:04:55.688  -->  00:04:58.794
what our camera thinks is where
the game is gonna be played.
84

84

00:04:58.794  -->  00:05:03.222
But that's pretty good for now in terms of
where we think our canvas is going to be.
85

85

00:05:03.222  -->  00:05:06.441
It's not accurately 1920 by 1080 for
our canvas.
86

86

00:05:06.441  -->  00:05:08.920
Okay, what are we gonna
do as well in here, well,
87

87

00:05:08.920  -->  00:05:10.528
we will add a little bit of text.
88

88

00:05:10.528  -->  00:05:13.856
So I'm going to click on canvas,
right-click &gt; UI &gt; Text, and
89

89

00:05:13.856  -->  00:05:15.199
drag this up a little bit.
90

90

00:05:15.199  -->  00:05:19.977
What I want to have in here is, underneath
Glitch, which is where we're getting these
91

91

00:05:19.977  -->  00:05:24.310
assets from, the Glitch game, we're
gonna call it Garden underneath here.
92

92

00:05:24.310  -->  00:05:28.573
You can call yours whatever you want,
you can call it Glitch Rick is awesome,
93

93

00:05:28.573  -->  00:05:31.994
if you have that desire,
it's up to you, you don't have to.
94

94

00:05:31.994  -->  00:05:36.082
[LAUGH] Making a few jokes today,
okay, and we'll drag that out.
95

95

00:05:36.082  -->  00:05:39.535
You might look at the font and say,
that font is ridiculous, Rick,
96

96

00:05:39.535  -->  00:05:40.757
what are you thinking?
97

97

00:05:40.757  -->  00:05:43.496
Let's go find ourselves
a better font on a website,
98

98

00:05:43.496  -->  00:05:46.991
let's go to dafont.com,
what sort of font shall we go for today?
99

99

00:05:46.991  -->  00:05:50.613
Now I haven't thought about this
at all until coming in here,
100

100

00:05:50.613  -->  00:05:54.594
I'm just gonna search for funky,
and see what comes up with funky.
101

101

00:05:54.594  -->  00:05:59.111
And then I'm gonna do a Ctrl+F,
type in 100%, and Funky Chunky,
102

102

00:05:59.111  -->  00:06:02.150
I like the name of it, Funky Muskrat, no.
103

103

00:06:02.150  -->  00:06:07.013
That's interesting, that looks kinda
similar to what we have already.
104

104

00:06:07.013  -->  00:06:12.202
Okay, we'll go and grab that one, that
is Funky Junk, and download Funky Junk.
105

105

00:06:12.202  -->  00:06:17.085
So as always, find whatever font takes
your fancy for your particular game.
106

106

00:06:17.085  -->  00:06:21.121
I'm going to show that in folder,
gonna extract that here.
107

107

00:06:21.121  -->  00:06:25.339
So I've got my files, where is it,
Funky Junk, double-click on that.
108

108

00:06:25.339  -->  00:06:29.993
That should allow me to use
Windows Font Viewer, if I'm on Windows.
109

109

00:06:29.993  -->  00:06:34.858
If you're on Mac then you'll use
the Windows Mac Font Viewer [LAUGH].
110

110

00:06:34.858  -->  00:06:39.561
Click on Install, I know that Mac
people love when I make Mac jokes.
111

111

00:06:39.561  -->  00:06:43.371
Okay, install, that should be
installed on my computer, and
112

112

00:06:43.371  -->  00:06:48.237
then more importantly than doing that,
is that we wanna drop it into Unity.
113

113

00:06:48.237  -->  00:06:53.125
So going to create myself
a new folder in assets called,
114

114

00:06:53.125  -->  00:06:56.141
Create &gt; Folder, called fonts.
115

115

00:06:56.141  -->  00:07:03.410
Open up fonts, find my windowy thing, and
then drop in Funky Junk into my fonts.
116

116

00:07:03.410  -->  00:07:07.388
Okay, so now I have it installed on
my computer, and more importantly,
117

117

00:07:07.388  -->  00:07:09.053
it's sitting within Unity.
118

118

00:07:09.053  -->  00:07:13.385
So I can go back to my text, and I will
call this, where are we here in our font,
119

119

00:07:13.385  -->  00:07:17.291
drag over Funky Junk instead of Arial,
[SOUND] and then it changes it.
120

120

00:07:17.291  -->  00:07:20.770
[LAUGH] And it looks like I kind of
hand scrawled that myself, that's good,
121

121

00:07:20.770  -->  00:07:22.330
that's the look I'm going for.
122

122

00:07:22.330  -->  00:07:26.481
Make it nice and big,
change the color to, I don't know,
123

123

00:07:26.481  -->  00:07:30.315
yellow, green,
gardens are green, aren't they?
124

124

00:07:30.315  -->  00:07:34.580
There we go, Glitch Garden,
looks like a three-year-old drew it,
125

125

00:07:34.580  -->  00:07:37.197
that's exactly what I'm going for here.
126

126

00:07:37.197  -->  00:07:42.180
[LAUGH] Wonderful, this one will change
from text to be called garden text.
127

127

00:07:42.180  -->  00:07:49.642
And the next one, duplicate,
drag on down, so hit W, drag on down.
128

128

00:07:49.642  -->  00:07:55.532
Then within the text field here,
we'll type in,
129

129

00:07:55.532  -->  00:08:01.510
Loading..., change this to loading text.
130

130

00:08:01.510  -->  00:08:02.710
Okay.
131

131

00:08:02.710  -->  00:08:05.950
Loading text.
Instead of green we'll make it purple.
132

132

00:08:05.950  -->  00:08:08.120
There we go.
Glitch Garden loading.
133

133

00:08:08.120  -->  00:08:09.330
I want to make it a little bit smaller,
134

134

00:08:09.330  -->  00:08:11.890
cuz we don't want to
make it too overwhelming.
135

135

00:08:11.890  -->  00:08:13.240
There we go, okay?
136

136

00:08:13.240  -->  00:08:15.550
Center it roughly in the middle.
137

137

00:08:15.550  -->  00:08:16.250
Pretty good.
138

138

00:08:16.250  -->  00:08:19.950
Glitch Garden loading,
made by a three year old i.e.
139

139

00:08:19.950  -->  00:08:21.945
Rick.
The other thing I wanna do with my loading
140

140

00:08:21.945  -->  00:08:24.899
screen, so my splash screen,
is have a little bit of a sound effect.
141

141

00:08:24.899  -->  00:08:28.960
So I'm gonna jump back over
into the Glitch website,
142

142

00:08:28.960  -->  00:08:33.202
find ringtones,
we'll have a listen to a couple here,
143

143

00:08:33.202  -->  00:08:36.920
[SOUND] Enable my audio so
you can hear it.
144

144

00:08:36.920  -->  00:08:40.090
That's a full on song.
145

145

00:08:40.090  -->  00:08:40.875
Where are we here?
146

146

00:08:40.875  -->  00:08:42.365
Alert, game loaded.
147

147

00:08:42.365  -->  00:08:44.875
[SOUND] That sounds pretty good,
doesn't it?
148

148

00:08:44.875  -->  00:08:46.551
We'll just check one other thing.
149

149

00:08:46.551  -->  00:08:47.485
Level up kazoo.
150

150

00:08:47.485  -->  00:08:53.250
[SOUND] [LAUGH] Okay,
that is so awesome, I like it.
151

151

00:08:53.250  -->  00:08:55.897
I'm gonna use that one,
even though it doesn't quite make sense.
152

152

00:08:55.897  -->  00:08:57.854
But I like the sound of it so download.
153

153

00:08:57.854  -->  00:08:59.372
[MUSIC]
154

154

00:08:59.372  -->  00:09:01.990
Thanks, we get the picture,
where's my download?
155

155

00:09:03.310  -->  00:09:07.120
Download button just there, okay.
156

156

00:09:07.120  -->  00:09:10.320
And then again show in folder,
just pop the folder to the side so
157

157

00:09:10.320  -->  00:09:15.310
I can grab unity, and
then drag the folder back over.
158

158

00:09:15.310  -->  00:09:17.700
Now we need another folder,
speaking of folders.
159

159

00:09:17.700  -->  00:09:23.020
Create folder sounds,
double click on sounds.
160

160

00:09:23.020  -->  00:09:26.340
Back to my window,
drag in level up kazoo or
161

161

00:09:26.340  -->  00:09:28.380
whatever it is that you chose into here.
162

162

00:09:28.380  -->  00:09:31.110
So lots of kind of setup fiddly
diddly things in this video.
163

163

00:09:31.110  -->  00:09:33.410
But there will be some code so be patient.
164

164

00:09:33.410  -->  00:09:34.860
The code is coming any moment.
165

165

00:09:34.860  -->  00:09:36.870
How about level up kazoo.
166

166

00:09:36.870  -->  00:09:38.720
Now a little mini-challenge for you.
167

167

00:09:38.720  -->  00:09:40.790
I want you to set up so
168

168

00:09:40.790  -->  00:09:45.380
that the level up kazoo plays once
immediately that this scene loads up.
169

169

00:09:45.380  -->  00:09:47.220
So there's your mini-challenge.
170

170

00:09:47.220  -->  00:09:51.010
Jump into that and
hopefully you jumped into that with gusto.
171

171

00:09:51.010  -->  00:09:52.760
Right click on the hierarchy.
172

172

00:09:52.760  -->  00:09:54.260
We're going to create an empty.
173

173

00:09:54.260  -->  00:09:55.090
Just out of habit,
174

174

00:09:55.090  -->  00:09:59.330
I'm going to reset the, transform
doesn't matter too much at the moment.
175

175

00:09:59.330  -->  00:10:06.120
I will rename this game object to be load
sound, and then load sound, add component,
176

176

00:10:06.120  -->  00:10:11.020
the component we need to add here is
an audio source, so we can play it.
177

177

00:10:11.020  -->  00:10:12.120
The audio source plays and
the audio listener listens for it,
178

178

00:10:12.120  -->  00:10:16.300
the audio listener is going to be
on our main camera by default.
179

179

00:10:16.300  -->  00:10:18.410
Play on awake is what will make it play.
180

180

00:10:18.410  -->  00:10:21.680
If we have loop clicked on it will go
over and over, which we don't want to do.
181

181

00:10:21.680  -->  00:10:26.000
And turn it down a little bit, because it
seemed like it was a pretty loud piece of
182

182

00:10:26.000  -->  00:10:30.630
kazoo, and then drag in the level
up kazoo into our audio clip.
183

183

00:10:30.630  -->  00:10:32.320
Click on save,
because I haven't saved for awhile.
184

184

00:10:32.320  -->  00:10:37.883
Click on save, I mean control S or command
S I click on play is what I meant to say,
185

185

00:10:37.883  -->  00:10:44.320
and we should Mute audio is on,
there we go, we'll try that one more time.
186

186

00:10:44.320  -->  00:10:46.246
If mute audio is on you
won't hear anything at all.
187

187

00:10:46.246  -->  00:10:50.482
[NOISE] That's amazing.
188

188

00:10:50.482  -->  00:10:51.700
Love it.
189

189

00:10:51.700  -->  00:10:52.950
Love it, love it, fantastic.
190

190

00:10:52.950  -->  00:10:54.910
So we have a load sound, save that up.
191

191

00:10:54.910  -->  00:10:59.480
Now, we are ready and
raring to create ourselves a start screen.
192

192

00:10:59.480  -->  00:11:03.596
So, over in our scenes folder, we have our
splash screen, I'm gonna duplicate that.
193

193

00:11:03.596  -->  00:11:07.720
So Ctrl+D, or Cmd+D,
rename it from splash screen 1,
194

194

00:11:07.720  -->  00:11:14.010
to start screen,
you can call it screen or scene or level.
195

195

00:11:14.010  -->  00:11:16.050
These things are all
pretty interchangeable,
196

196

00:11:16.050  -->  00:11:18.990
but I see them as screens
when they're menus and stuff.
197

197

00:11:18.990  -->  00:11:22.790
I see them as scenes when there's
a lot of things going on in it.
198

198

00:11:22.790  -->  00:11:24.950
So that's why I'm calling
it a start screen.
199

199

00:11:24.950  -->  00:11:25.770
Double click on that so
200

200

00:11:25.770  -->  00:11:29.410
that we make that we've opened it,
find where we currently have our image.
201

201

00:11:29.410  -->  00:11:31.270
The image is our Glitch Garden-y thing.
202

202

00:11:31.270  -->  00:11:33.310
I'm gonna change my image.
203

203

00:11:33.310  -->  00:11:34.680
From my image folder.
204

204

00:11:34.680  -->  00:11:37.540
Let's see, I will [SOUND] over here.
205

205

00:11:37.540  -->  00:11:40.267
From instead of splash image,
I'll click my selector and
206

206

00:11:40.267  -->  00:11:42.390
choose the start screen image.
207

207

00:11:42.390  -->  00:11:44.880
Wonderful, [FOREIGN] as we might say.
208

208

00:11:44.880  -->  00:11:48.310
Set native size has already been clicked,
so that's all pretty good.
209

209

00:11:48.310  -->  00:11:51.970
The glitch.com interestingly doesn't
take you to these assets, but
210

210

00:11:51.970  -->  00:11:53.720
I will ignore that for a moment.
211

211

00:11:53.720  -->  00:11:57.495
Just something to be mindful of if you're
giving out this assets in a game to other
212

212

00:11:57.495  -->  00:12:01.343
people and they go check it out, they're
like that wasn't what I was expecting.
213

213

00:12:01.343  -->  00:12:02.840
Okay, so, we have our, whoopsie-do.
214

214

00:12:02.840  -->  00:12:07.760
We need to grab on our, click on our
garden text, drag it up to the top and
215

215

00:12:07.760  -->  00:12:09.990
I'm gonna turn this into a button.
216

216

00:12:09.990  -->  00:12:12.090
So, the text is very easy
to turn into a button.
217

217

00:12:12.090  -->  00:12:15.170
I'm gonna change the color
of the font first.
218

218

00:12:15.170  -->  00:12:16.410
Color, there we go.
219

219

00:12:16.410  -->  00:12:19.980
And we change into a button by
scrolling down, add component.
220

220

00:12:19.980  -->  00:12:22.120
Do you reckon you know what
the component is that we add?
221

221

00:12:23.400  -->  00:12:24.410
It is button.
222

222

00:12:24.410  -->  00:12:27.180
There we go, I gave you a moment
to yell out button at the screen.
223

223

00:12:27.180  -->  00:12:29.300
Hopefully you were doing
appropriate yelling.
224

224

00:12:29.300  -->  00:12:31.580
Now that's a button,
and instead of garden,
225

225

00:12:31.580  -->  00:12:36.565
we wish to call this, well I have
the text in here will be start game.
226

226

00:12:36.565  -->  00:12:41.570
It's not quite fitting, so
we need to hit our rect tool.
227

227

00:12:41.570  -->  00:12:42.960
Drag it over a little bit.
228

228

00:12:42.960  -->  00:12:45.580
There we go.
And actually, you know,
229

229

00:12:45.580  -->  00:12:47.300
it's probably a bit too big, so, 120.
230

230

00:12:47.300  -->  00:12:49.350
Again, a lot of these fiddly things I do,
231

231

00:12:49.350  -->  00:12:52.640
I rush through it because I don't want to
take too much of your time with fiddly
232

232

00:12:52.640  -->  00:12:54.940
things that I know that
you can be doing yourself.
233

233

00:12:54.940  -->  00:12:57.580
So if I am going too fast,
apologies for that.
234

234

00:12:57.580  -->  00:13:01.310
But these are all things that you
already know super duper well.
235

235

00:13:01.310  -->  00:13:04.690
And our loading we will change to quit,
236

236

00:13:04.690  -->  00:13:08.530
and also we will add a component,
which will be a button.
237

237

00:13:08.530  -->  00:13:13.450
And also we will change it to white font,
and I think that size might be okay it's
238

238

00:13:13.450  -->  00:13:16.610
kind of saying don't quit,
you don't really wanna quit.
239

239

00:13:16.610  -->  00:13:17.510
Okay.
240

240

00:13:17.510  -->  00:13:19.680
Start game and quit, we'll tidy
that up a little bit more later on.
241

241

00:13:19.680  -->  00:13:20.920
But we now have a start scene.
242

242

00:13:20.920  -->  00:13:26.560
The point here is we have something
to load into from our splash screen.
243

243

00:13:26.560  -->  00:13:28.800
And this forms the challenge for
244

244

00:13:28.800  -->  00:13:32.510
what I would like you to do
in this particular video.
245

245

00:13:32.510  -->  00:13:34.330
Let me just set up my challenge for you.
246

246

00:13:35.550  -->  00:13:40.560
Okay, and this challenge is to load
the start scene, from the splash scene,
247

247

00:13:40.560  -->  00:13:41.580
with a little bit of a caveat.
248

248

00:13:41.580  -->  00:13:43.250
A little bit of extra flavor.
249

249

00:13:43.250  -->  00:13:45.418
So you create yourself,
here's how to do it,
250

250

00:13:45.418  -->  00:13:48.650
create yourself a level loader game
object and level loader script.
251

251

00:13:48.650  -->  00:13:51.000
You know how to do that, so
that should be no problem.
252

252

00:13:51.000  -->  00:13:53.400
And then from the splash scene,
253

253

00:13:53.400  -->  00:13:58.400
load the start scene automatically
with a three second delay.
254

254

00:13:58.400  -->  00:14:02.880
So when you start the game on the splash
screen, it'll say one cat and dog, two cat
255

255

00:14:02.880  -->  00:14:07.190
and dog, three cat and dog, and then it
will load the start scene straight away.
256

256

00:14:07.190  -->  00:14:09.580
It could be a four second delay if
your sound goes a little bit longer,
257

257

00:14:09.580  -->  00:14:13.470
I think I remember my sound was four
seconds, so there is the challenge.
258

258

00:14:13.470  -->  00:14:17.640
Make sure you set up the build settings,
and if you want a hint,
259

259

00:14:17.640  -->  00:14:21.020
coroutine is your hint, and you should
be pretty comfortable with those by now.
260

260

00:14:21.020  -->  00:14:22.720
So jump in, take on that challenge, and
261

261

00:14:22.720  -->  00:14:24.610
I'll see you back here
when you have nailed it.
262

262

00:14:27.760  -->  00:14:28.770
Okay, welcome back.
263

263

00:14:28.770  -->  00:14:31.290
Let's have a look at the scenes.
264

264

00:14:31.290  -->  00:14:33.710
We want to jump over to our splash screen.
265

265

00:14:33.710  -->  00:14:36.600
This is where we're gonna
be adding our level loader.
266

266

00:14:36.600  -->  00:14:39.520
Right click, create empty game object.
267

267

00:14:39.520  -->  00:14:44.310
We'll call this level loader.
268

268

00:14:44.310  -->  00:14:45.090
Okay.
269

269

00:14:45.090  -->  00:14:47.170
Reset the transform out of habit.
270

270

00:14:47.170  -->  00:14:48.220
It's a good habit to have.
271

271

00:14:48.220  -->  00:14:49.540
And now we need a script, so
272

272

00:14:49.540  -->  00:14:52.480
while clicking on level loader
i'm gonna add a component.
273

273

00:14:52.480  -->  00:14:56.120
I'll call this Level Loader,
capital L, capital L, no spaces,
274

274

00:14:56.120  -->  00:14:58.720
create script, create and add.
275

275

00:14:58.720  -->  00:15:00.550
Excellent i'm going to fire that up.
276

276

00:15:00.550  -->  00:15:02.974
So start Visual Studio,
pop out of the way assets folder,
277

277

00:15:02.974  -->  00:15:05.210
[LAUGH] I don't know what it's doing here.
278

278

00:15:05.210  -->  00:15:09.040
Because I want to drag the script into,
I need to create another folder.
279

279

00:15:09.040  -->  00:15:10.625
Look at all these folders in this video.
280

280

00:15:10.625  -->  00:15:12.737
So new folder, scripts.
281

281

00:15:12.737  -->  00:15:13.619
Organizations.
282

282

00:15:13.619  -->  00:15:16.600
Good, drag level load
into my scripts folder.
283

283

00:15:16.600  -->  00:15:18.660
Cool.
Over to level load.
284

284

00:15:18.660  -->  00:15:22.470
Now we're working in loading scene, so
the first thing we need to do is using
285

285

00:15:22.470  -->  00:15:27.800
unity engine dot scene management.
286

286

00:15:27.800  -->  00:15:31.720
So we can access the scene management
methods, it's a very useful thing to do.
287

287

00:15:31.720  -->  00:15:32.930
What do we wanna do,
288

288

00:15:32.930  -->  00:15:38.140
well we need to give ourselves a concept
of what scene index would currently on.
289

289

00:15:38.140  -->  00:15:41.130
So if I go over into file, build settings.
290

290

00:15:41.130  -->  00:15:44.380
This is a step that I nearly
always forget to do and
291

291

00:15:44.380  -->  00:15:48.510
then we click on ad open scenes
that'll drop in the splash screen.
292

292

00:15:48.510  -->  00:15:52.520
The sample scene no longer exists,
you can see it's been deleted, and
293

293

00:15:52.520  -->  00:15:56.440
let's see my other scene is
the start screen, drag that in.
294

294

00:15:56.440  -->  00:15:57.945
Okay I wonder if I can remove this?
295

295

00:15:57.945  -->  00:16:00.000
Yep just hit delete and
it gets out of there.
296

296

00:16:00.000  -->  00:16:04.480
Okay so the splash screen I know
is always going to be index zero.
297

297

00:16:04.480  -->  00:16:05.530
I'm not going to change that around.
298

298

00:16:05.530  -->  00:16:07.066
It's always going to be the very, very,
299

299

00:16:07.066  -->  00:16:11.980
very The first thing that my game shows
in terms of my Unity scenes in the build.
300

300

00:16:11.980  -->  00:16:13.041
So I know that's going to be 0.
301

301

00:16:13.041  -->  00:16:16.065
And then after that it's gonna go
straight into the start screen,
302

302

00:16:16.065  -->  00:16:19.372
which I know it's going to be 1 or
I know it's going to be right after it.
303

303

00:16:19.372  -->  00:16:22.851
Okay, so we use that information for
good not for evil,
304

304

00:16:22.851  -->  00:16:25.376
jump back over into our LevelLoad.cs.
305

305

00:16:25.376  -->  00:16:33.060
I'm gonna start off by creating an integer
which we will call currentSceneIndex.
306

306

00:16:33.060  -->  00:16:37.670
So we wanna have a way of storing
what scene am I currently on?
307

307

00:16:37.670  -->  00:16:39.370
And then within our start method,
308

308

00:16:39.370  -->  00:16:44.690
we need to say what the currentSceneIndex
is when our LevelLoad starts up.
309

309

00:16:44.690  -->  00:16:50.149
So do that, we'll type currentSceneIndex
310

310

00:16:50.149  -->  00:16:55.462
= SceneManager.GetActiveScene(),
311

311

00:16:55.462  -->  00:16:59.900
that's a method, .buildIndex.
312

312

00:16:59.900  -->  00:17:03.240
So it's getting for us, it's going and
grabbing from the SceneManager,
313

313

00:17:03.240  -->  00:17:07.880
it's grabbing what is the buildIndex
of whenever this script was called,
314

314

00:17:07.880  -->  00:17:11.740
that's called on our splash screen,
then it's gonna be zero.
315

315

00:17:11.740  -->  00:17:14.520
So now it's gonna be zero
which is very handy to have.
316

316

00:17:14.520  -->  00:17:16.280
And then we want to say what?
317

317

00:17:16.280  -->  00:17:23.295
Well, I'm gonna say if
the currentSceneIndex ==, so if we type in
318

318

00:17:23.295  -->  00:17:29.860
== to say if the currentSceneIndex is 0,
then what do we wanna have happen?
319

319

00:17:29.860  -->  00:17:34.110
Well, if it is 0 then we want to wait for
a few seconds.
320

320

00:17:34.110  -->  00:17:35.410
Why am I putting in this now?
321

321

00:17:35.410  -->  00:17:39.351
Well, in the future we're gonna be loading
from the start scene to the next scene, or
322

322

00:17:39.351  -->  00:17:42.330
from level one to level two, or
two to three, and three to four.
323

323

00:17:42.330  -->  00:17:44.520
It's only on this very first one,
324

324

00:17:44.520  -->  00:17:48.880
at this point in time,
that I wanna fix in a certain time delay.
325

325

00:17:48.880  -->  00:17:54.741
And so, if the currentSceneIndex is 0,
I wanna start a coroutine.
326

326

00:17:54.741  -->  00:17:56.673
StartCoroutine, what should we call this?
327

327

00:17:56.673  -->  00:18:03.155
We'll call it WaitForTime,
open close parenthesis, semi colon.
328

328

00:18:03.155  -->  00:18:05.915
Let's go create our WaitForTime.
329

329

00:18:05.915  -->  00:18:10.756
So remember with Coroutine,
we need IEnumerator,
330

330

00:18:10.756  -->  00:18:17.145
IEnumerator is the return type,
we're calling this WaitForTime.
331

331

00:18:17.145  -->  00:18:18.060
What's within this?
332

332

00:18:18.060  -->  00:18:23.594
Well, we need to yield, yield return new,
I'm sure you're pros at this by now,
333

333

00:18:23.594  -->  00:18:27.703
WaitForSeconds, and
we wanna wait for, say, 4 seconds.
334

334

00:18:27.703  -->  00:18:32.306
But instead of just
hard-coding this in here,
335

335

00:18:32.306  -->  00:18:36.680
create this as a variable, waitInSeconds,
336

336

00:18:36.680  -->  00:18:41.181
waitInSeconds, or timeToWait timeToWait.
337

337

00:18:41.181  -->  00:18:42.843
Okay, that looks pretty good.
338

338

00:18:42.843  -->  00:18:47.206
timeToWait, semicolon, and now we're
getting the red squiggly line because this
339

339

00:18:47.206  -->  00:18:49.726
variable doesn't exist,
so up to the very top,
340

340

00:18:49.726  -->  00:18:53.115
this is a parameter that we can tune so
I'll put it at the very top.
341

341

00:18:53.115  -->  00:18:56.990
And we will say SerializedField,
what do we need this to be?
342

342

00:18:56.990  -->  00:18:59.370
We'll make it an integer,
I don't think we need to have it a float,
343

343

00:18:59.370  -->  00:19:05.017
we'll just have it at whole numbers,
and this is called timeTowWait.
344

344

00:19:05.017  -->  00:19:09.160
Initialized at 4,
I know I told you, sorry, 4 not f.
345

345

00:19:09.160  -->  00:19:12.110
I just said let's not do a float and
then I put an f on the end.
346

346

00:19:12.110  -->  00:19:16.460
And I also said 3, but I'm gonna make
mine 4 cuz I feel that might be the right
347

347

00:19:16.460  -->  00:19:18.870
amount of time for
the sound effect that I put in there.
348

348

00:19:18.870  -->  00:19:22.600
Might be a little bit long to watch that
every time, but we'll start off with that.
349

349

00:19:22.600  -->  00:19:24.794
Okay, so let's have a look at this.
350

350

00:19:24.794  -->  00:19:29.330
We are getting out index, we are starting
our coroutine, if we're at 0,
351

351

00:19:29.330  -->  00:19:30.778
WaitForTime, yield.
352

352

00:19:30.778  -->  00:19:34.137
And then what do we want to have
happen after we've yielded for
353

353

00:19:34.137  -->  00:19:35.590
x number of seconds?
354

354

00:19:35.590  -->  00:19:38.930
Then we want to load the next scene,
and the way we do that is let's
355

355

00:19:38.930  -->  00:19:41.630
create ourselves a little method
that we'll use again in the future.
356

356

00:19:41.630  -->  00:19:44.640
LoadNextScene, parentheses.
357

357

00:19:45.850  -->  00:19:47.940
And this will be a method.
358

358

00:19:47.940  -->  00:19:51.478
We'll make it a public method so
that any other script can say, hey,
359

359

00:19:51.478  -->  00:19:53.198
I want you to load the next scene.
360

360

00:19:53.198  -->  00:20:00.574
So public void LoadNextScene.
361

361

00:20:00.574  -->  00:20:03.665
And what is within here that's gonna
be pretty straightforward, I think.
362

362

00:20:03.665  -->  00:20:07.904
It will be SceneManager.LoadScene, and
363

363

00:20:07.904  -->  00:20:13.201
then we wanna say whatever
scene we are currently on,
364

364

00:20:13.201  -->  00:20:16.397
currentSceneIndex plus what?
365

365

00:20:16.397  -->  00:20:20.756
Plus 1, currentSceneIndex + 1.
366

366

00:20:20.756  -->  00:20:23.125
Okay, so I know that was a lot of
me typing and going through that.
367

367

00:20:23.125  -->  00:20:26.828
But we've created coroutine a few times
now and we've worked through our loading
368

368

00:20:26.828  -->  00:20:30.220
a few times, so hopefully that
challenge was not too tricky for you.
369

369

00:20:30.220  -->  00:20:33.350
And that's not too much of me just
typing and you following along.
370

370

00:20:33.350  -->  00:20:35.270
I'm sure you nailed it and
you're like, Rick, we know all this,
371

371

00:20:35.270  -->  00:20:37.440
I'm such a champion, I got it already.
372

372

00:20:37.440  -->  00:20:39.490
Show us whether or not it works.
373

373

00:20:39.490  -->  00:20:41.160
Okay, back into my splash screen.
374

374

00:20:41.160  -->  00:20:43.100
Save everything up, click on Play.
375

375

00:20:43.100  -->  00:20:45.670
You should hear a sound effect.
376

376

00:20:45.670  -->  00:20:48.393
[MUSIC]
377

377

00:20:48.393  -->  00:20:50.111
It's probably way too loud.
378

378

00:20:50.111  -->  00:20:50.763
And then,
379

379

00:20:50.763  -->  00:20:51.650
[MUSIC]
380

380

00:20:51.650  -->  00:20:53.120
And it loads, awesome.
381

381

00:20:53.120  -->  00:20:55.460
So why did it load the sound effect again?
382

382

00:20:55.460  -->  00:20:56.430
Let's go have a look at that.
383

383

00:20:57.640  -->  00:21:02.250
It was on the splash screen,
we had the LoadSound, play on awake,
384

384

00:21:02.250  -->  00:21:03.840
that looks pretty good.
385

385

00:21:03.840  -->  00:21:08.230
And then over on to my start screen,
I think I had the LoadSound there as well,
386

386

00:21:08.230  -->  00:21:08.980
I'm gonna take that off.
387

387

00:21:08.980  -->  00:21:11.540
We don't need the load sound,
what we do need to do
388

388

00:21:12.580  -->  00:21:17.430
is back over into our splash screen,
the LevelLoader.
389

389

00:21:17.430  -->  00:21:20.360
I'm gonna create myself a prefabs folder.
390

390

00:21:20.360  -->  00:21:24.440
Should rename this lecture to
be folders [LAUGH] prefabs.
391

391

00:21:25.510  -->  00:21:30.320
And within prefabs,
I will drag in my LevelLoader
392

392

00:21:30.320  -->  00:21:32.870
because we're going to be using
that a bunch more in the future.
393

393

00:21:32.870  -->  00:21:36.680
Okay, there it is, we have ourselves
a splash screen that loads into our start
394

394

00:21:36.680  -->  00:21:38.860
menu, we're ready to put
in some more functionality.
395

395

00:21:38.860  -->  00:21:42.810
Great work, I know this is a long video,
I will see you in the next video.
