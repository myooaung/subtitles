00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,994
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:03,994  -->  00:00:07,522
In this video we're going to move
our Zucchini across the screen so
3

3

00:00:07,522  -->  00:00:09,920
it actually looks like
a proper projectile.
4

4

00:00:09,920  -->  00:00:12,460
Here we go, [SOUND] here we go,
let's jump in and get started.
5

5

00:00:12,460  -->  00:00:16,578
Ultimately, I'll be moving my Zucchini
through code but I wanna show you first
6

6

00:00:16,578  -->  00:00:20,550
how I would move it if I was just
straight up using the animation system.
7

7

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:25,670
So I'm gonna drop my Zucchini Prefab
into my scene so that I can work on it.
8

8

00:00:25,670  -->  00:00:27,410
There is a Zucchini Prefab.
9

9

00:00:27,410  -->  00:00:31,850
Now I need to add a component on
the Zucchini which is an Animator.
10

10

00:00:31,850  -->  00:00:34,800
I've already typed that in,
so type in animator.
11

11

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:35,810
We now have our Animator.
12

12

00:00:35,810  -->  00:00:37,830
What do we need to make
our Animator make sense?
13

13

00:00:37,830  -->  00:00:39,680
We need an Animator Controller.
14

14

00:00:39,680  -->  00:00:43,640
So over in my Animations,
Defenders, right click, Create,
15

15

00:00:43,640  -->  00:00:48,123
Animator Controller, which I will
call Zucchini, Zuckerberg, no,
16

16

00:00:48,123  -->  00:00:51,507
that's not how we spell it,
Zucchini, there we go.
17

17

00:00:51,507  -->  00:00:56,310
I was in the middle of typing Zuckerberg,
I don't know why.
18

18

00:00:56,310  -->  00:00:58,410
It must have influenced my brain.
19

19

00:00:58,410  -->  00:01:02,700
Okay, so we've got our Zuckerbergcchini
that we're gonna throw across the screen.
20

20

00:01:02,700  -->  00:01:05,720
And as our Animator Controller,
now we need some animations.
21

21

00:01:05,720  -->  00:01:09,540
So we right click, Create, Animation.
22

22

00:01:09,540  -->  00:01:14,408
And I'll call this Zucchini.
23

23

00:01:14,408  -->  00:01:17,140
Zucchini, no dumb jokes
about Facebook founders.
24

24

00:01:17,140  -->  00:01:18,640
Okay, Zucchini in there.
25

25

00:01:18,640  -->  00:01:21,940
Now clicking back on my
Zucchini in the hierarchy,
26

26

00:01:21,940  -->  00:01:24,024
I need to assign my Animator Controller.
27

27

00:01:24,024  -->  00:01:26,322
So we click on the selector,
find Zucchini.
28

28

00:01:26,322  -->  00:01:28,718
We have now hooked up
the Animator Controller.
29

29

00:01:28,718  -->  00:01:33,910
There is no animation within this, so
I'll drag in my Zucchini animation, plop!
30

30

00:01:33,910  -->  00:01:34,630
There we go.
31

31

00:01:34,630  -->  00:01:36,950
So it's going straight into
the Zucchini animation.
32

32

00:01:36,950  -->  00:01:39,380
At the moment,
there's no animation within that.
33

33

00:01:39,380  -->  00:01:42,660
So let's click on our
Zucchini in the hierarchy.
34

34

00:01:42,660  -->  00:01:45,120
Click on our Animation window.
35

35

00:01:45,120  -->  00:01:49,230
Now when we click on Record, we can
move around our Zucchini and do stuff.
36

36

00:01:49,230  -->  00:01:54,114
So let's say within our window here at
the one second point, I want it to go from
37

37

00:01:54,114  -->  00:01:58,776
wherever it spawns, [SOUND] to the end
of its trajectory within one second.
38

38

00:01:58,776  -->  00:02:03,264
So I move my play head down to one second,
[SOUND] and then hit W and
39

39

00:02:03,264  -->  00:02:07,356
move the Zucchini all the way
down to where I want it to go.
40

40

00:02:07,356  -->  00:02:09,480
And you can see that's
inserted a key frame.
41

41

00:02:09,480  -->  00:02:12,920
Now if I scrub up and down you can
see that it is moving literally,
42

42

00:02:12,920  -->  00:02:14,272
[SOUND] along the screen.
43

43

00:02:14,272  -->  00:02:17,160
I will get out of Record mode.
44

44

00:02:17,160  -->  00:02:20,130
Okay, and then you might need to click
off, yeah, that will work for me.
45

45

00:02:20,130  -->  00:02:23,380
Now I can apply back to the Prefab.
46

46

00:02:23,380  -->  00:02:26,496
I'm gonna delete the Zucchini that
we've got in the scene just to make it
47

47

00:02:26,496  -->  00:02:30,090
very clear what is being instantiated and
what's being thrown across the screen.
48

48

00:02:30,090  -->  00:02:34,870
And then when we click Play, it should
do its little dance, [SOUND] and then,
49

49

00:02:34,870  -->  00:02:36,074
[SOUND] there we go.
50

50

00:02:36,074  -->  00:02:38,810
There's the Zucchini
flying across the screen.
51

51

00:02:38,810  -->  00:02:40,936
And of course from within the animation,
52

52

00:02:40,936  -->  00:02:44,654
when I'm gonna put my Zucchini back in
again so I can play around with it.
53

53

00:02:44,654  -->  00:02:47,550
From within this animation you
can do other nifty things.
54

54

00:02:47,550  -->  00:02:49,507
You could change the rotation.
55

55

00:02:49,507  -->  00:02:52,437
So I move the play head down
to the one second point, and
56

56

00:02:52,437  -->  00:02:55,648
do a whole bunch of rotation on there,
blah, blah, blah.
57

57

00:02:55,648  -->  00:03:00,190
And then so as we are scrubbing through,
we can see that it's gonna rotate as well.
58

58

00:03:00,190  -->  00:03:04,081
So that's a way first to hand animate
our Zucchini, there's some pros and
59

59

00:03:04,081  -->  00:03:05,210
there's some cons.
60

60

00:03:05,210  -->  00:03:07,150
I think this gives us
a lot more flexibility.
61

61

00:03:07,150  -->  00:03:09,730
I could have the Zucchini for
example at the start.
62

62

00:03:09,730  -->  00:03:11,002
It could do a little of
a backwards move like.
63

63

00:03:11,002  -->  00:03:13,792
So to go backwards a little bit, and
64

64

00:03:13,792  -->  00:03:17,980
then up in the air a little bit,
and then go like that.
65

65

00:03:17,980  -->  00:03:22,470
So we can handcraft all this like
very specific pieces of animation
66

66

00:03:22,470  -->  00:03:24,700
to give a lot more depth to our game,
which is cool.
67

67

00:03:24,700  -->  00:03:27,990
If you're into animation, then it's
a really good approach to do that.
68

68

00:03:27,990  -->  00:03:31,240
We can also be doing these things
from our code to say well,
69

69

00:03:31,240  -->  00:03:35,270
let's move it across the screen,
let's rotate it as it's moving.
70

70

00:03:35,270  -->  00:03:37,840
And that will be the challenge for
the video.
71

71

00:03:37,840  -->  00:03:40,540
So I'm not going to keep this
animation that I've created in here.
72

72

00:03:40,540  -->  00:03:42,010
I will get rid of that.
73

73

00:03:42,010  -->  00:03:43,215
So let's find out.
74

74

00:03:43,215  -->  00:03:47,230
Defenders, Zucchini,
I'm gonna delete all that.
75

75

00:03:47,230  -->  00:03:49,835
I don't need this animation, there we go.
76

76

00:03:49,835  -->  00:03:53,036
[SOUND] And
we just have our Zucchini Prefab.
77

77

00:03:53,036  -->  00:03:53,804
Apply that back.
78

78

00:03:53,804  -->  00:03:55,300
I don't need the Animator Controller.
79

79

00:03:55,300  -->  00:03:56,850
That was all just me showing you.
80

80

00:03:56,850  -->  00:03:58,070
That's one way that you could do it.
81

81

00:03:58,070  -->  00:04:00,800
If you want you can absolutely
leave all that on there.
82

82

00:04:00,800  -->  00:04:02,270
Apply this back to the Prefab.
83

83

00:04:02,270  -->  00:04:05,360
But we're gonna do it as a code challenge.
84

84

00:04:05,360  -->  00:04:08,240
And that will be the challenge for you,
is to move the projectile through code.
85

85

00:04:08,240  -->  00:04:10,820
And we'll start by adding a component, so
86

86

00:04:10,820  -->  00:04:13,620
a script,
that turns things into a projectile.
87

87

00:04:13,620  -->  00:04:15,432
So wherever we place this script,
88

88

00:04:15,432  -->  00:04:18,436
the projectile script will
make the thing a projectile.
89

89

00:04:18,436  -->  00:04:21,706
And then we need to use
transform.Translate(),
90

90

00:04:21,706  -->  00:04:26,700
which we've used already in this section
of the course to move the projectile.
91

91

00:04:26,700  -->  00:04:29,240
So they are your hints,
they are your clues.
92

92

00:04:29,240  -->  00:04:33,280
Move your Zucchini using code bonus
points if you make it rotate.
93

93

00:04:33,280  -->  00:04:36,520
But for now, you only need to
make it translate from left or
94

94

00:04:36,520  -->  00:04:37,170
right of the screen.
95

95

00:04:37,170  -->  00:04:42,113
So jump in and take that on and
I'll see you back here shortly Okay, so
96

96

00:04:42,113  -->  00:04:45,590
first up we need a script
which we will call Projectile.
97

97

00:04:45,590  -->  00:04:48,092
So Create and, Câ™¯ Script.
98

98

00:04:48,092  -->  00:04:51,280
Call this Projectile with a capital P.
99

99

00:04:52,440  -->  00:04:58,120
Drop the Projectile onto the Zucchini
that we still have in our, it's thinking,
100

100

00:04:58,120  -->  00:05:01,890
it's loading, it's compiling, it's saying
I'm generating you a script, there we go.
101

101

00:05:01,890  -->  00:05:04,910
And my computer's going a little
bit slow at the moment.
102

102

00:05:04,910  -->  00:05:07,870
Drag the Projectile,
drop it over onto Zucchini.
103

103

00:05:07,870  -->  00:05:10,870
Now the Zucchini has a component,
which is Projectile.
104

104

00:05:10,870  -->  00:05:15,740
So that makes the Zucchini a Projectile
because of this component Projectile.
105

105

00:05:15,740  -->  00:05:18,650
Play that back to the Prefab while
we remember, and let's go and
106

106

00:05:18,650  -->  00:05:20,040
open this up in Visual Studio.
107

107

00:05:21,970  -->  00:05:24,960
Right, I'm gonna remove Start for
now, I just don't need that.
108

108

00:05:24,960  -->  00:05:29,449
I'm also gonna remove the comment telling
me what an update is, I know what that is.
109

109

00:05:29,449  -->  00:05:33,530
Now, within Update,
we want to be moving our Projectile.
110

110

00:05:33,530  -->  00:05:35,950
So as per the hint that I gave you,
111

111

00:05:35,950  -->  00:05:41,060
we're gonna type in transform.Translate(),
with a capital T.
112

112

00:05:42,170  -->  00:05:43,860
And then, what are we doing in here?
113

113

00:05:43,860  -->  00:05:48,060
Well, we're looking for
a Vector3 translation, or
114

114

00:05:48,060  -->  00:05:50,480
we can use Vector2 which
is what we're gonna use.
115

115

00:05:50,480  -->  00:05:53,357
So Vector2 dot, and we talked before.
116

116

00:05:53,357  -->  00:05:57,428
Previously we had Vector2.left
where you're gonna use
117

117

00:05:57,428  -->  00:06:02,340
Vector2.right because we want it
to right on the screen, times by.
118

118

00:06:02,340  -->  00:06:06,065
Well, I wanna have it times by a speed
variable which I'll create in a moment.
119

119

00:06:06,065  -->  00:06:10,739
And then of course, Time.deltaTime.
120

120

00:06:16,388  -->  00:06:17,500
Let's create our speed variable.
121

121

00:06:17,500  -->  00:06:21,540
We'll serialize that so
we can access it quite easily.
122

122

00:06:21,540  -->  00:06:27,350
Serializefield, and
this needs to be a float I believe.
123

123

00:06:27,350  -->  00:06:30,796
Speed, and we'll initialize that at 1f.
124

124

00:06:30,796  -->  00:06:34,020
Okay, that looks pretty good.
125

125

00:06:34,020  -->  00:06:37,325
Save that up, jump back over into Unity.
126

126

00:06:37,325  -->  00:06:39,065
And then let's check
that it all works out.

127

00:06:39,065  -->  00:06:39,995
Click on Play.
128

128

00:06:39,995  -->  00:06:43,585
We should have our first Zucchini that's
just the game object in the scene.
129

129

00:06:43,585  -->  00:06:47,155
We'll go zinging very,
very slowly off the screen and
130

130

00:06:47,155  -->  00:06:48,955
then we'll shoot another one out.
131

131

00:06:48,955  -->  00:06:49,549
So there we go.
132

132

00:06:49,549  -->  00:06:52,035
We're instantiating and
moving across the screen.
133

133

00:06:52,035  -->  00:06:56,825
Now the reason I prefer this particular,
and this instance to be using code,
134

134

00:06:56,825  -->  00:06:58,825
is I'm wanting the Projectile
just to go straight.
135

135

00:06:58,825  -->  00:06:59,945
I don't need any magic.
136

136

00:06:59,945  -->  00:07:03,710
I might have it Rotate as well,
that'll be a cool thing to do.
137

137

00:07:03,710  -->  00:07:06,220
But it gives me flexibility
to easily tune it.
138

138

00:07:06,220  -->  00:07:12,160
So now I can go into my Zucchini, find the
speed and change it to say for example 10.
139

139

00:07:12,160  -->  00:07:13,566
Click on Play.
140

140

00:07:13,566  -->  00:07:16,900
And then it will do 10 speed for
our Zucchini.
141

141

00:07:16,900  -->  00:07:19,556
And if we have other things
that we're spawning,
142

142

00:07:19,556  -->  00:07:22,160
we can drop this script
onto those other things.
143

143

00:07:22,160  -->  00:07:25,127
Maybe it's an, [LAUGH] okay,
I didn't apply that to the Prefab.
144

144

00:07:25,127  -->  00:07:26,930
But you get the picture there.
145

145

00:07:26,930  -->  00:07:28,560
There we go.
We're moving the Projectile.
146

146

00:07:28,560  -->  00:07:32,480
Next up we need to be doing some damage
and colliding with our attackers.
147

147

00:07:32,480  -->  00:07:33,820
So I'll see you in the next video.
