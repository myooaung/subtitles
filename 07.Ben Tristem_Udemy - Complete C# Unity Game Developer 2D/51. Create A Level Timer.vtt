2

00:00:04.376  -->  00:00:05.600
Welcome, exciting video.
3

3

00:00:05.600  -->  00:00:08.660
You can see we've got our
animated timer that says how much
4

4

00:00:08.660  -->  00:00:09.790
time is left on the level.
5

5

00:00:09.790  -->  00:00:11.390
Fox, don't get down there yet.
6

6

00:00:11.390  -->  00:00:15.610
And we want to have when the fox
reaches the end of the timer,
7

7

00:00:15.610  -->  00:00:19.700
we print out a debug message that says
that we've reached the end of our timer.
8

8

00:00:19.700  -->  00:00:21.520
So let's jump in and get started.
9

9

00:00:21.520  -->  00:00:25.450
If you jump over to canvas, open that
up so we can see what's going on.
10

10

00:00:25.450  -->  00:00:29.920
Right click, go down to UI, you see we
have an option here which is slider.
11

11

00:00:29.920  -->  00:00:32.932
Click on that and a slider will
appear in the middle of the screen.
12

12

00:00:32.932  -->  00:00:36.295
You can hit W, drag it up to the top
right, where I think I'll put mine.
13

13

00:00:36.295  -->  00:00:40.270
We can stop doing some fiddling with it,
which is gonna be awesome.
14

14

00:00:40.270  -->  00:00:42.980
Okay, so first of all, I'll just
make it a little bit bigger for now.
15

15

00:00:42.980  -->  00:00:46.040
So in the Rect Transform,
I'll click on my scale,
16

16

00:00:46.040  -->  00:00:49.270
3 and, well, that's 33, Rect 3 and 3.
17

17

00:00:49.270  -->  00:00:53.510
I put three on zed, not that it does
anything, but I just like that symmetry.
18

18

00:00:53.510  -->  00:00:54.520
Move it a little bit to the left,
19

19

00:00:54.520  -->  00:00:58.010
make sure that it's gonna fit
within our safe zone, yes.
20

20

00:00:58.010  -->  00:01:00.880
It's got a nice big timer
on the screen there.
21

21

00:01:00.880  -->  00:01:03.272
Pretty obvious what's going on with it.
22

22

00:01:03.272  -->  00:01:05.860
Okay and a few things we can play around
with here, pretty similar to buttons,
23

23

00:01:05.860  -->  00:01:08.140
we've got the color,
highlighted color, etc.
24

24

00:01:08.140  -->  00:01:11.590
If you go down and have a look at value
down there, if you slide that right and
25

25

00:01:11.590  -->  00:01:15.250
left you can see that the handle is
moving to the right and to the left.
26

26

00:01:15.250  -->  00:01:19.340
We can switch the direction to make it
right to left instead of left to right,
27

27

00:01:19.340  -->  00:01:21.140
and then you can see it goes backwards.
28

28

00:01:21.140  -->  00:01:24.170
I'm gonna do it that way, just because
that's the same way that our attackers
29

29

00:01:24.170  -->  00:01:25.880
are coming in from off the screen.
30

30

00:01:25.880  -->  00:01:26.890
And heading to the left.
31

31

00:01:26.890  -->  00:01:30.070
So kind of feels natural for them to be
left, left, left, left, left, left and
32

32

00:01:30.070  -->  00:01:32.800
then when we get to here,
we've reached the end.
33

33

00:01:34.290  -->  00:01:37.820
We can also change the values, so
we can have it from 0 to 1, so
34

34

00:01:37.820  -->  00:01:40.250
it's a, oops, accidentally clicked there.
35

35

00:01:40.250  -->  00:01:43.740
From 0 to 1, if we wanna have it
a percentage of 1, we can have 0 to 100,
36

36

00:01:43.740  -->  00:01:44.930
for example.
37

37

00:01:44.930  -->  00:01:47.480
We can click on the whole numbers so
then like click, click, click,
38

38

00:01:47.480  -->  00:01:49.724
along the whole numbers here,
so a few things we can do.
39

39

00:01:49.724  -->  00:01:52.290
I'll just leave it at 1 for now, unless we
40

40

00:01:52.290  -->  00:01:56.130
feel we want to change it to 100 later on
to make it feel more like a percentage.
41

41

00:01:56.130  -->  00:01:59.610
Also, if you go into the hierarchy,
you can see that the slider came in with
42

42

00:01:59.610  -->  00:02:02.890
background, fill area and
handle slide area.
43

43

00:02:02.890  -->  00:02:06.340
If you open those up, then we have
a little bit more control over what it is
44

44

00:02:06.340  -->  00:02:08.210
that we can do with each of these things.
45

45

00:02:08.210  -->  00:02:10.790
And one thing we can do
is change the handle.
46

46

00:02:10.790  -->  00:02:13.550
At the moment,
you see the Source Image is Knob.
47

47

00:02:13.550  -->  00:02:17.860
I can change that Source Image to,
for example, our star.
48

48

00:02:17.860  -->  00:02:20.650
And now you can see,
I'll zoom in a bit, you can see
49

49

00:02:20.650  -->  00:02:24.410
that the little icon that's gonna go from
left to right or right to left for us.
50

50

00:02:24.410  -->  00:02:26.510
I'm just gonna click back on the slider.
51

51

00:02:26.510  -->  00:02:28.470
And then twiddle the value.
52

52

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:30.460
It's gonna go along like that, very cool.
53

53

00:02:30.460  -->  00:02:34.250
So you've got something that's
a little bit more of an icon so
54

54

00:02:34.250  -->  00:02:36.320
the player can immediately
see what's happening.
55

55

00:02:36.320  -->  00:02:38.350
Star doesn't quite make sense, I think.
56

56

00:02:38.350  -->  00:02:40.810
So if I go back to Handle,
change it from star.
57

57

00:02:40.810  -->  00:02:44.900
I'm gonna change it to,
I think I'll change it to the fox.
58

58

00:02:44.900  -->  00:02:46.370
If I can find one of the foxes.
59

59

00:02:46.370  -->  00:02:47.370
Just the fox running.
60

60

00:02:48.720  -->  00:02:49.225
There we go.
61

61

00:02:49.225  -->  00:02:53.910
Fox running, actually that was fox jump,
but it looks fine nonetheless.
62

62

00:02:53.910  -->  00:02:59.330
Okay and then I can click, while I'm
clicked on my handle still, I can scale.
63

63

00:02:59.330  -->  00:03:04.370
So I can change scale here, I'll just
click on my R tool and scale that up.
64

64

00:03:04.370  -->  00:03:08.130
Up up up and then W tool,
move it up a little bit as well, So
65

65

00:03:08.130  -->  00:03:12.491
that we have a nice big
representation that can move along,
66

66

00:03:12.491  -->  00:03:15.940
clicking on slider, that can move
along as our slider moves along.
67

67

00:03:15.940  -->  00:03:20.320
I'm going to make it even clearer what's
going on here by clicking on the fill
68

68

00:03:20.320  -->  00:03:24.830
area, or underneath fill area,
change the color to yellow.
69

69

00:03:26.050  -->  00:03:26.970
So you can see,
70

70

00:03:26.970  -->  00:03:31.100
as we are progressing along, that it is
going to go from yellow to something.
71

71

00:03:31.100  -->  00:03:35.350
If I go to background and click on
the color underneath background and
72

72

00:03:35.350  -->  00:03:39.070
change it to a darker blue gray thing.
73

73

00:03:40.070  -->  00:03:42.130
Yeah.
There we go, okay.
74

74

00:03:42.130  -->  00:03:44.790
I want it a little bit more blue I think.
75

75

00:03:44.790  -->  00:03:46.070
There we go.
76

76

00:03:46.070  -->  00:03:50.290
Now when I slide my slider,
you can see it's progressing
77

77

00:03:50.290  -->  00:03:54.160
from yellow along the blue, and
it's represented by the fox.
78

78

00:03:54.160  -->  00:03:57.650
Now we're gonna do something that I only
just figured out when I was getting ready
79

79

00:03:57.650  -->  00:03:58.620
to film this video.
80

80

00:03:58.620  -->  00:04:00.250
I though, you know,
I'm gonna try something here,
81

81

00:04:00.250  -->  00:04:01.980
I'm gonna try something crazy.
82

82

00:04:01.980  -->  00:04:02.910
And I figured it out.
83

83

00:04:02.910  -->  00:04:05.600
So if I can figure it out,
anyone can figure it out.
84

84

00:04:05.600  -->  00:04:06.940
Therefore, I've got a challenge for you.
85

85

00:04:06.940  -->  00:04:10.290
And that's to animate your slider handle.
86

86

00:04:10.290  -->  00:04:10.940
What?
87

87

00:04:10.940  -->  00:04:12.890
You might be asking, or you might not.
88

88

00:04:12.890  -->  00:04:14.380
You might say, that's easy, Rick.
89

89

00:04:14.380  -->  00:04:17.560
But what I mean is this fox here.
90

90

00:04:17.560  -->  00:04:20.764
I want this fox to look like
it is running or walking.
91

91

00:04:20.764  -->  00:04:24.600
So try to figure out how
to add an animated attacker
92

92

00:04:24.600  -->  00:04:28.730
as the progress slider handle instead of
the circle that we have right there now.
93

93

00:04:28.730  -->  00:04:31.030
And then, of course,
share what you come up with,
94

94

00:04:31.030  -->  00:04:33.360
particularly if you come up with
something nifty that you're happy with.
95

95

00:04:33.360  -->  00:04:35.430
So jump in, see if you can
figure out how to do that, and
96

96

00:04:35.430  -->  00:04:37.061
I'll see you back here when you're done.
97

97

00:04:39.058  -->  00:04:41.650
Right, so let's click on handle.
98

98

00:04:41.650  -->  00:04:44.890
And a few things should be starting
to look really familiar in here.
99

99

00:04:44.890  -->  00:04:45.890
We've got an image.
100

100

00:04:45.890  -->  00:04:47.660
We've got a renderer.
101

101

00:04:47.660  -->  00:04:50.400
What do we need to add to animate stuff?
102

102

00:04:50.400  -->  00:04:52.170
We need to add an animator.
103

103

00:04:52.170  -->  00:04:55.530
Animator, if we click on that, great.
104

104

00:04:55.530  -->  00:04:59.260
Now we can see, while clicked on
the handle, we've got our animation and
105

105

00:04:59.260  -->  00:05:00.990
our animator, currently empty.
106

106

00:05:00.990  -->  00:05:06.435
We'll click Create into our Assets,
Animations, Attackers.
107

107

00:05:06.435  -->  00:05:09.190
There's not really any of this, so we'll
create a new folder, which I'll call UI.
108

108

00:05:10.390  -->  00:05:18.690
And within UI I will place
in my slider handle Fox Run.
109

109

00:05:18.690  -->  00:05:20.270
I think it's going to be
a run that I'm using.
110

110

00:05:20.270  -->  00:05:22.990
So we have that there now,
we need to add some frames.
111

111

00:05:22.990  -->  00:05:27.950
So let us find our sprites,
fox, and I've got fox running.
112

112

00:05:27.950  -->  00:05:30.480
Walking might be a little bit better,
but I've got running in there.
113

113

00:05:30.480  -->  00:05:31.280
I've sliced it up.
114

114

00:05:31.280  -->  00:05:34.470
So if you want to do walking or
something else, one of the creatures,
115

115

00:05:34.470  -->  00:05:37.160
then, please, go ahead and
do something cool.
116

116

00:05:37.160  -->  00:05:38.770
Change the samples to 24.
117

117

00:05:38.770  -->  00:05:41.780
Now, if I click play,
look at him, up there.
118

118

00:05:41.780  -->  00:05:42.410
He's running.
119

119

00:05:42.410  -->  00:05:43.510
That's so cool.
120

120

00:05:43.510  -->  00:05:48.091
I'm gonna change it to 12,
to make it kind of a slow amble, [SOUND].
121

121

00:05:48.091  -->  00:05:50.201
Okay, that's looking pretty good just so
122

122

00:05:50.201  -->  00:05:53.670
it doesn't look exactly like
the creatures I got in the level itself.
123

123

00:05:53.670  -->  00:05:56.190
I want to have them look a little bit
different, and we will see what if I
124

124

00:05:56.190  -->  00:06:01.360
change, I'll click on handle and
then we've got image and then color.
125

125

00:06:01.360  -->  00:06:07.660
If I change the color a little bit more
yellowy so it matches the the slider bar.
126

126

00:06:07.660  -->  00:06:09.440
Okay, and then click play.
127

127

00:06:09.440  -->  00:06:11.110
That yellow stays there.
128

128

00:06:11.110  -->  00:06:12.440
Okay, yeah, it's looking pretty good.
129

129

00:06:12.440  -->  00:06:14.282
Again just so people don't get confused,
130

130

00:06:14.282  -->  00:06:16.820
why is there a fox running up
in the very top lane up there?
131

131

00:06:16.820  -->  00:06:17.510
It's not a lane.
132

132

00:06:17.510  -->  00:06:19.310
It's the UI.
Okay, I like it.
133

133

00:06:19.310  -->  00:06:20.550
I think it's feeling good.
134

134

00:06:20.550  -->  00:06:22.490
Now let's give some
functionality to our slider.
135

135

00:06:22.490  -->  00:06:27.390
So we're gonna add it right on
the slider if we find our scripts.
136

136

00:06:27.390  -->  00:06:31.200
And add ourselves a new,
give myself a bit more space here.
137

137

00:06:31.200  -->  00:06:34.620
Have myself right-click,
create a C# script.
138

138

00:06:34.620  -->  00:06:37.460
This we will call Game Timer.
139

139

00:06:37.460  -->  00:06:40.970
I nearly called it Slider,
but this is our Game Timer.
140

140

00:06:40.970  -->  00:06:42.036
Let's open that up.
141

141

00:06:42.036  -->  00:06:44.870
Actually, you know what, before we do
that, let's drag it onto Slider just so
142

142

00:06:44.870  -->  00:06:47.530
later on I'm not sitting there saying,
why does this not work?
143

143

00:06:47.530  -->  00:06:50.090
It's cuz you didn't add it to
the place it needs to be, Rick.
144

144

00:06:50.090  -->  00:06:51.380
That's probably why.
145

145

00:06:51.380  -->  00:06:54.810
So we'll drag game timer onto Slider.
146

146

00:06:54.810  -->  00:06:56.280
There we go, now I'll open it up.
147

147

00:06:57.920  -->  00:07:01.110
I'm not going to need Start,
let's get rid of that.
148

148

00:07:01.110  -->  00:07:04.710
What I do need to start off with is
an amount of time for the level.
149

149

00:07:04.710  -->  00:07:10.270
So, it's serialize field, we'll make it
a float, cuz it's gonna be ticking away.
150

150

00:07:10.270  -->  00:07:16.050
I will call this levelTime,
levelTime, I think.
151

151

00:07:16.050  -->  00:07:19.590
And I'll initialize that at how
long do we want for our level.
152

152

00:07:19.590  -->  00:07:23.190
You know while I'm just testing this out,
I'm going to make it just 10.
153

153

00:07:23.190  -->  00:07:26.730
Cause that will make it 10 seconds.
154

154

00:07:26.730  -->  00:07:27.640
How do I know it's seconds?
155

155

00:07:27.640  -->  00:07:30.770
Well I know that this is going to be
calculated, the calculations we'll do
156

156

00:07:30.770  -->  00:07:34.020
will relate to seconds but how do I
know it's seconds in a month's time?
157

157

00:07:34.020  -->  00:07:37.740
Well I could say level of
time in seconds here or
158

158

00:07:37.740  -->  00:07:42.250
we could do something that I don't think
we've done yet and that is a Tooltip.
159

159

00:07:42.250  -->  00:07:47.030
And let me just show you very briefly the
documentation for this TooltipAttribute.
160

160

00:07:47.030  -->  00:07:50.560
Sometimes you can get some clues by
going into the code, here it is.
161

161

00:07:50.560  -->  00:07:51.640
This is what it's going to look like, so
162

162

00:07:51.640  -->  00:07:54.310
I'm going to highlight this you don't
need to do this but you can if you wish.
163

163

00:07:54.310  -->  00:07:59.140
And I'm going to copy that,
jump back over into my script,
164

164

00:07:59.140  -->  00:08:01.840
my game timer script, paste that in and
you can see the structure.
165

165

00:08:01.840  -->  00:08:05.350
We put square brackets and
then ToolTip and
166

166

00:08:05.350  -->  00:08:08.760
then in quotation marks we say
what the ToolTip is gonna be.
167

167

00:08:08.760  -->  00:08:16.580
And this will be our level
timer in SECONDS, nice and big.
168

168

00:08:16.580  -->  00:08:20.570
And then no semicolon and then whatever
it is that we're putting our Tooltip
169

169

00:08:20.570  -->  00:08:25.000
on to and then that whole statement
is going to end at the semicolon.
170

170

00:08:25.000  -->  00:08:28.200
And I saved that up just to make that
works and show you what it looks like.
171

171

00:08:28.200  -->  00:08:31.750
So back over into Unity,
wait for it to do its compiling.
172

172

00:08:34.180  -->  00:08:38.720
Now when I go and mouse-over game timer
level time, it's currently set at ten.
173

173

00:08:38.720  -->  00:08:39.945
Now what does ten mean?
174

174

00:08:39.945  -->  00:08:43.420
Mouse-over it, and
it'll say our level timer in seconds.
175

175

00:08:43.420  -->  00:08:45.890
That's how you can create
tool tips to give yourself or
176

176

00:08:45.890  -->  00:08:49.450
anyone else on your team a lot more
information about what's going on.
177

177

00:08:49.450  -->  00:08:52.210
Okay, that is looking sharp.
178

178

00:08:52.210  -->  00:08:55.380
Okay, the first thing we want to do
is we want to tell our slider to have
179

179

00:08:55.380  -->  00:08:56.540
a particular value.
180

180

00:08:56.540  -->  00:09:01.670
And we want value of the slider to be
equal to how much time has elapsed in
181

181

00:09:01.670  -->  00:09:07.250
seconds as a proportion of
our total amount of time.
182

182

00:09:07.250  -->  00:09:10.290
So if one second has
elapsed on our timer and
183

183

00:09:10.290  -->  00:09:14.380
we want our game level timer,
our level timer, to be ten seconds.
184

184

00:09:14.380  -->  00:09:15.410
One second's elapsed then.
185

185

00:09:15.410  -->  00:09:18.870
It should be, this indicator
should be 10% of the way along.
186

186

00:09:18.870  -->  00:09:23.270
So the way that we're gonna do that
is by getting the slider component.
187

187

00:09:23.270  -->  00:09:25.720
Get component, Slider.
188

188

00:09:26.860  -->  00:09:28.670
And then parentheses dot.
189

189

00:09:28.670  -->  00:09:31.500
And you can see we've got the red squiggly
line which means that we're not using
190

190

00:09:31.500  -->  00:09:32.120
the namespace.
191

191

00:09:32.120  -->  00:09:33.130
You can mouse over there.
192

192

00:09:33.130  -->  00:09:34.250
We forgot the namespace.
193

193

00:09:34.250  -->  00:09:35.800
Highlight this one here.
194

194

00:09:35.800  -->  00:09:42.320
You're gonna copy using UnityEngine,
Paste, .UI.
195

195

00:09:42.320  -->  00:09:46.290
Okay, so now when we come down here and
hit our dot, you can see options.
196

196

00:09:46.290  -->  00:09:47.500
We're looking for value.
197

197

00:09:47.500  -->  00:09:50.170
So what is the value of this
slider right at the moment?
198

198

00:09:50.170  -->  00:09:55.720
The value of the slider should
be Time.timeSinceLevelLoad
199

199

00:09:55.720  -->  00:09:58.680
is this call thing that we can call
upon here, timeSinceLevelLoad.
200

200

00:09:58.680  -->  00:10:04.900
And that's gonna be
divided by levelTime; so
201

201

00:10:04.900  -->  00:10:07.980
levelTime is how much time we said,
10 seconds.
202

202

00:10:07.980  -->  00:10:10.020
timeSinceLevelLoad, this
is gonna be in seconds.
203

203

00:10:10.020  -->  00:10:12.080
So, five seconds has gone by.
204

204

00:10:12.080  -->  00:10:14.350
Five divided by ten is what?
205

205

00:10:14.350  -->  00:10:18.590
It's gonna be 0.5 and
then if we were to go back to our slider.
206

206

00:10:18.590  -->  00:10:20.160
And where is our slider?
207

207

00:10:20.160  -->  00:10:21.660
Just here slider.
208

208

00:10:21.660  -->  00:10:25.120
Slider, and if we were to set this 0.5,
209

209

00:10:25.120  -->  00:10:29.120
then it's gonna look like it's
halfway through our loading.
210

210

00:10:29.120  -->  00:10:30.250
Which is exactly what we want.
211

211

00:10:30.250  -->  00:10:32.440
5 seconds, half way to 10.
212

212

00:10:32.440  -->  00:10:35.044
Now let's figure out what we wanna
do when the timer has finished.
213

213

00:10:35.044  -->  00:10:38.236
Again we'll be doing this on update,
so make ourselves a bool, so
214

214

00:10:38.236  -->  00:10:40.289
it's either half finished or we have not.
215

215

00:10:40.289  -->  00:10:45.420
And the bool would be
called timer finished,
216

216

00:10:45.420  -->  00:10:51.660
and that would be
time.time since level load.
217

217

00:10:51.660  -->  00:10:54.590
Is greater than or equal to what?
218

218

00:10:56.570  -->  00:11:01.110
Time since level load is
greater than level time.
219

219

00:11:01.110  -->  00:11:04.470
So the first one we're just representing
it on the slider and the next one we're
220

220

00:11:04.470  -->  00:11:08.990
calculating have we actually had more
time than we wanted to have in our level.
221

221

00:11:11.060  -->  00:11:14.820
So that our bool, and
then if timerFinished.
222

222

00:11:14.820  -->  00:11:16.910
And we've just created timerFinished.
223

223

00:11:16.910  -->  00:11:18.250
Then what do we want to do?
224

224

00:11:18.250  -->  00:11:22.830
Well, for now we're just gonna put in
225

225

00:11:22.830  -->  00:11:27.566
a debug.Log and what was saying here?
226

226

00:11:27.566  -->  00:11:30.308
Level timer expired!
227

227

00:11:32.724  -->  00:11:34.970
Okay, just to make sure this all works.
228

228

00:11:34.970  -->  00:11:35.710
So save that up.
229

229

00:11:35.710  -->  00:11:37.370
We're looking for
a couple of things in here.
230

230

00:11:37.370  -->  00:11:40.420
We're looking that our slider moves
appropriately, and we're looking that,
231

231

00:11:40.420  -->  00:11:44.970
after ten seconds,
that our console prints that message out.
232

232

00:11:44.970  -->  00:11:48.480
Now I'm gonna get my lizard, and
get my lizard way back there so
233

233

00:11:48.480  -->  00:11:50.860
we don't accidentally lose
the game before we should.
234

234

00:11:50.860  -->  00:11:54.980
Click on Play, We'll see if
we've got this all buttoned up.
235

235

00:11:54.980  -->  00:11:58.570
Actually we're gonna place down
a bunch of cactuses, cacti.
236

236

00:11:58.570  -->  00:12:00.740
Well, gee, that fox gets thrown quickly,
doesn't it?
237

237

00:12:01.880  -->  00:12:02.610
Here we go.
Here we go.
238

238

00:12:02.610  -->  00:12:03.350
This is moving.
239

239

00:12:03.350  -->  00:12:03.990
So that's great.
240

240

00:12:03.990  -->  00:12:05.450
Moving, moving, moving, and then bump.
241

241

00:12:05.450  -->  00:12:10.170
Do we get a message in our
console level timer expired?
242

242

00:12:10.170  -->  00:12:12.570
Fantastic, okay.
243

243

00:12:12.570  -->  00:12:15.630
So we've completed our task of making our
244

244

00:12:15.630  -->  00:12:18.330
slider move to show that there's time for
our level.
245

245

00:12:18.330  -->  00:12:21.320
We've successfully logged
that up to the console.
246

246

00:12:21.320  -->  00:12:25.440
So now in the next video, we're gonna
be in a position to do something
247

247

00:12:25.440  -->  00:12:28.380
when our level finishes its timer.
248

248

00:12:28.380  -->  00:12:30.010
So great work, and
I'll see you in the next video.
