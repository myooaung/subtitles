00:00:00.025  -->  00:00:04.527
[SOUND] In this video,
we are exploding out enemies,
2

2

00:00:04.527  -->  00:00:10.478
creating a cool particle effect
using some spreadsheet animation.
3

3

00:00:10.478  -->  00:00:13.166
And then,
we're gonna hook it all up in our code so
4

4

00:00:13.166  -->  00:00:15.280
that we trigger it when the enemy dies.
5

5

00:00:15.280  -->  00:00:19.030
So let's jump in and create some
cool particles and death explosion.
6

6

00:00:19.030  -->  00:00:21.835
So if you go into the folder that
you've downloaded previously,
7

7

00:00:21.835  -->  00:00:25.205
the Kenny's Assets Folder, I've given
you a couple of Easter eggs in there.
8

8

00:00:25.205  -->  00:00:28.981
I've got an explosion sprite
that shows three images,
9

9

00:00:28.981  -->  00:00:31.966
three stars on it, so
you can correct that.
10

10

00:00:31.966  -->  00:00:35.691
If you don't have that or if you didn't
download the Kenney Asset folder that
11

11

00:00:35.691  -->  00:00:39.440
I provided for you then I've attached
that same image against this lecture.
12

12

00:00:39.440  -->  00:00:41.618
So whether you find it,
grab it and downloaded it or
13

13

00:00:41.618  -->  00:00:45.342
if you've already got it in your project,
we're going to create ourselves an asset.
14

14

00:00:45.342  -->  00:00:50.370
We'll right-click Create a folder
which I will call VFX, visual effects.
15

15

00:00:50.370  -->  00:00:51.630
Back into my Kenny Assets,
16

16

00:00:51.630  -->  00:00:56.300
drag the explosions sprite into my
VFX folder that I just created.
17

17

00:00:56.300  -->  00:00:59.870
So we can't just go applying out image
directly on to our particle effects.
18

18

00:00:59.870  -->  00:01:03.460
We need to create a material and
then assign this image from the material,
19

19

00:01:03.460  -->  00:01:06.080
and then assign the material
to the particles.
20

20

00:01:06.080  -->  00:01:08.200
That's a pretty standard way
of doing things in Unity,
21

21

00:01:08.200  -->  00:01:11.510
where we make a material that has a whole
bunch of great information on it and
22

22

00:01:11.510  -->  00:01:13.810
then we apply that material
to various places.
23

23

00:01:13.810  -->  00:01:18.280
So it's right-click,
up to Create and then Material.
24

24

00:01:18.280  -->  00:01:23.363
We'll call this, explosion, Stars.
25

25

00:01:24.774  -->  00:01:28.676
And with our explosion stars,
we will click on explosion stars and
26

26

00:01:28.676  -->  00:01:33.150
then find the albedo, click on
the selector and search for explosion.
27

27

00:01:33.150  -->  00:01:38.370
You can see our three stars from our
sprite sheet, click on that, and
28

28

00:01:38.370  -->  00:01:39.590
now that's been assigned.
29

29

00:01:39.590  -->  00:01:42.710
At the top of the Inspector, you'll
see Shader, click on the where it says
30

30

00:01:42.710  -->  00:01:46.380
Standard, and change it from Standard to,
let's see Particles and
31

31

00:01:46.380  -->  00:01:49.250
then Alpha blended, you can play
around with these if you like.
32

32

00:01:49.250  -->  00:01:51.830
I'm gonna start with Alpha blended,
that's pretty standard.
33

33

00:01:51.830  -->  00:01:54.345
Okay, now for
creating our particle effect itself,
34

34

00:01:54.345  -->  00:01:57.710
right-click on the Hierarchy,
find effects particle system.
35

35

00:01:57.710  -->  00:02:02.545
I'll rename mine to explosion particles.
36

36

00:02:02.545  -->  00:02:06.804
Explosion particles, great, now we're
gonna apply the texture that we just
37

37

00:02:06.804  -->  00:02:10.750
created, and you can see at the moment
we've got this default texture.
38

38

00:02:10.750  -->  00:02:14.387
If you scroll all the way down the bottom
of the Inspector, you click on renderer,
39

39

00:02:14.387  -->  00:02:15.310
open that up.
40

40

00:02:15.310  -->  00:02:18.148
You can see that the material
currently is default material.
41

41

00:02:18.148  -->  00:02:20.630
What we're gonna be doing is
applying three sprites and
42

42

00:02:20.630  -->  00:02:24.680
then cycling through them,
using the texture sheet animation.
43

43

00:02:24.680  -->  00:02:28.200
So first step, next to material,
click on the selector and
44

44

00:02:28.200  -->  00:02:31.950
we'll find our explosion stars,
double click on that.
45

45

00:02:31.950  -->  00:02:34.150
Now we have our three
explosion stars coming out.
46

46

00:02:34.150  -->  00:02:35.070
Doesn't look so good?
47

47

00:02:35.070  -->  00:02:39.260
That's because we're not telling it to
loop through these as an animation.
48

48

00:02:39.260  -->  00:02:43.010
So, just up a little bit above
renderer is a texture sheet animation.
49

49

00:02:43.010  -->  00:02:46.300
Open that up, make sure you
click on the circle next to it,
50

50

00:02:46.300  -->  00:02:51.080
that's how we turn things on and
off on the selector, so we'll turn it on.
51

51

00:02:51.080  -->  00:02:53.400
Let's see in here,
mode is cool, the tiles.
52

52

00:02:53.400  -->  00:02:55.912
Now you can see we've got,
I'm gonna scroll in here so
53

53

00:02:55.912  -->  00:02:58.237
we can see this nice and close.
54

54

00:02:58.237  -->  00:03:01.571
We've got three images
side-by-side on a grid.
55

55

00:03:01.571  -->  00:03:04.647
So our grid is x is 3 and y is 1.
56

56

00:03:04.647  -->  00:03:07.753
So in effect,
we've got three columns and one row.
57

57

00:03:07.753  -->  00:03:12.469
Now that we've done that,
you can see that it's starting off
58

58

00:03:12.469  -->  00:03:17.280
with just one of our images
coming out of our emitter.
59

59

00:03:17.280  -->  00:03:19.980
But it's the same one
coming out first each time.
60

60

00:03:19.980  -->  00:03:24.730
So we wanna change our start frame
to random between two constants and
61

61

00:03:24.730  -->  00:03:26.840
we'll say it's from 1 to 3.
62

62

00:03:26.840  -->  00:03:30.860
Cuz we've got three frames, so we wanna
say randomly between frame 1 and frame 3.
63

63

00:03:30.860  -->  00:03:33.490
So what comes out is going
to be a bit different.
64

64

00:03:33.490  -->  00:03:37.400
Now cycles, if you mouse over any of these
you'll get a description of what it means.
65

65

00:03:37.400  -->  00:03:40.106
This specifies how many times the
animation will loop during the lifetime of
66

66

00:03:40.106  -->  00:03:40.930
the particle.
67

67

00:03:40.930  -->  00:03:44.130
So let's increase this to say 20 and
see how that looks.
68

68

00:03:44.130  -->  00:03:46.695
Okay, now we've got this kind of
blinking effect, it doesn't look so
69

69

00:03:46.695  -->  00:03:48.941
good when we've got things coming
out just slowly like this.
70

70

00:03:48.941  -->  00:03:53.778
But as we do the rest of our tuning of our
particle system, it's gonna look better
71

71

00:03:53.778  -->  00:03:58.110
than just having the single book
particle being pushed out like that.
72

72

00:03:58.110  -->  00:04:02.390
Now, up to the top of our particle system,
let's play around with some things here.
73

73

00:04:02.390  -->  00:04:07.890
Duration is how long one cycle or
one emission of our particle system lasts.
74

74

00:04:07.890  -->  00:04:09.250
At the moment, it's five seconds, so
75

75

00:04:09.250  -->  00:04:12.140
it's basically,
I'm gonna stop this for a moment.
76

76

00:04:12.140  -->  00:04:16.175
If I hit Play, actually,
I'll turn off looping for a second and
77

77

00:04:16.175  -->  00:04:18.288
I'll change the duration to 1.
78

78

00:04:18.288  -->  00:04:21.699
Okay, duration to 1,
looping off, when I click Play,
79

79

00:04:21.699  -->  00:04:26.054
we'll have one second of emission and
then the particle system is done.
80

80

00:04:26.054  -->  00:04:30.091
Okay, cuz this is an explosion, we want
it to be pretty short and sharp and fast.
81

81

00:04:30.091  -->  00:04:34.090
So I'm gonna turn this down to 0.2,
and I'll turn looping back on just so
82

82

00:04:34.090  -->  00:04:36.350
I can see the effect, I'll click on Play.
83

83

00:04:37.520  -->  00:04:39.885
When we have this in the game,
we'll turn looping off,
84

84

00:04:39.885  -->  00:04:42.750
cuz we don't want it to loop over and
over, we want it to just burst once.
85

85

00:04:42.750  -->  00:04:45.120
But now, while we're playing
around with it and tuning it,
86

86

00:04:45.120  -->  00:04:49.010
we will have looping on so we can see it
over and over and see how our effect.
87

87

00:04:49.010  -->  00:04:51.770
The next start,
we're gonna look at the star lifetime,
88

88

00:04:51.770  -->  00:04:54.680
these things are lasting too long, they
are going way off into the distance and
89

89

00:04:54.680  -->  00:04:56.310
explosion, it is short and
sharp, remember.
90

90

00:04:56.310  -->  00:04:57.650
So star lifetime,
91

91

00:04:57.650  -->  00:05:01.730
click on the little selected to
the right random between two constants.
92

92

00:05:01.730  -->  00:05:05.700
My lifetime between 0.1 and 0.2, so
93

93

00:05:05.700  -->  00:05:09.840
they're just very quick in terms
of how long they're lasting for.
94

94

00:05:09.840  -->  00:05:12.390
The speed, we need to change
the speed a little bit as well.
95

95

00:05:12.390  -->  00:05:17.120
So it's a bit faster, right in between
two constants, other between 5 and 10.
96

96

00:05:17.120  -->  00:05:19.678
And we're not seeing enough
coming out at the moment, so
97

97

00:05:19.678  -->  00:05:23.365
I'm gonna go straight down to emission
now and turn emission way up, say 100.
98

98

00:05:23.365  -->  00:05:26.369
Okay, [SOUND] you can see this
kind of sparkly effect going on.
99

99

00:05:26.369  -->  00:05:30.126
It's getting a little bit better,
a little bit nicer, and
100

100

00:05:30.126  -->  00:05:33.570
back up to our speed,
5 to 10, that's good.
101

101

00:05:33.570  -->  00:05:37.430
Our size, I think a little bit smaller,
so start sizing again, random between two
102

102

00:05:37.430  -->  00:05:40.680
constants, gives us that good variability,
it's not so uniform.
103

103

00:05:40.680  -->  00:05:45.271
And for our start size,
we'll say between 0.2 and 1.
104

104

00:05:45.271  -->  00:05:48.740
Okay, it's good looking in
the ballpark now, starting to like it.
105

105

00:05:48.740  -->  00:05:50.690
Start color,
that's the next one we'll play around.
106

106

00:05:50.690  -->  00:05:54.040
We've here, do whatever you like,
do whatever fits your game.
107

107

00:05:54.040  -->  00:05:58.890
I'm gonna do mine from, actually, click
at that, I don't want it, just one color.
108

108

00:05:58.890  -->  00:06:01.370
I want it to have randomization of color.
109

109

00:06:01.370  -->  00:06:04.500
So again, click the little selector,
gradient, and
110

110

00:06:04.500  -->  00:06:06.850
then click on the white bar now.
111

111

00:06:06.850  -->  00:06:09.260
And we will give ourselves
just a little space.
112

112

00:06:09.260  -->  00:06:11.800
You can see I've created
presets in the past.
113

113

00:06:11.800  -->  00:06:15.940
If you create something in here that you
like, for example, I'm just gonna change,
114

114

00:06:15.940  -->  00:06:19.360
I'll explain this in a moment, change
my color, then you can click new and
115

115

00:06:19.360  -->  00:06:20.220
create a preset.
116

116

00:06:20.220  -->  00:06:21.690
So you might not have all these presets,
117

117

00:06:21.690  -->  00:06:24.330
that's cuz I've created them
all already previously.
118

118

00:06:24.330  -->  00:06:28.580
Now how does our selector here
work the top is going to relate to
119

119

00:06:28.580  -->  00:06:32.240
the transparency, and
the bottom is gonna relate to the color.
120

120

00:06:32.240  -->  00:06:36.850
So I think we want to have,
in terms of our gradient,
121

121

00:06:36.850  -->  00:06:41.620
I'll put in maybe, 3 or 4, or 5, so okay,
122

122

00:06:41.620  -->  00:06:46.050
so we got 6 all up, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 6 color tabs.
123

123

00:06:46.050  -->  00:06:49.410
And my transparency at the top,
I'll go and change that now,
124

124

00:06:49.410  -->  00:06:51.225
the first one I'll do it 144.
125

125

00:06:51.225  -->  00:06:53.810
And the next one,
I'll do it pretty similar, basically,
126

126

00:06:53.810  -->  00:06:56.410
I just want this to go,
to stay transparent the whole time.
127

127

00:06:56.410  -->  00:07:00.400
I don't want it too dominant, I don't
want it to look like it's an enemy,
128

128

00:07:00.400  -->  00:07:03.120
I want it to look softer than that,
so you can see.
129

129

00:07:03.120  -->  00:07:05.340
Already the impact is looking a lot nicer,
or
130

130

00:07:05.340  -->  00:07:07.802
the effects looking a lot
nicer having it softer.
131

131

00:07:07.802  -->  00:07:10.138
Now in terms of the colors,
well, what shall we do here?
132

132

00:07:10.138  -->  00:07:15.464
I think I'll do a maybe a yellowy
kind of color at the start,
133

133

00:07:15.464  -->  00:07:21.950
and then maybe a, what's this,
we'll do a bluish kind of color.
134

134

00:07:21.950  -->  00:07:25.619
Bit of a blue, that's gonna blend
into the background, that's fine.
135

135

00:07:25.619  -->  00:07:29.712
And then another color,
we will do as more of a brighter blue,
136

136

00:07:29.712  -->  00:07:32.810
okay, a little bit of
a punch within there.
137

137

00:07:32.810  -->  00:07:35.770
You see I'm clicking on the selector,
and then it's highlighted,
138

138

00:07:35.770  -->  00:07:37.930
click on the color,
change the color to what I want.
139

139

00:07:37.930  -->  00:07:42.060
We'll do another set of yellowy-green,
orangey-type color.
140

140

00:07:42.060  -->  00:07:45.030
Okay, that's not too bad, right?
141

141

00:07:45.030  -->  00:07:49.130
And the reason we're doing a gradient is
the randomization is gonna choose a color
142

142

00:07:49.130  -->  00:07:50.710
anywhere along our gradient.
143

143

00:07:50.710  -->  00:07:54.180
So we get a whole bunch of different
colors, it's not gonna look so uniform.
144

144

00:07:54.180  -->  00:07:56.560
There's a lot of variation in
the colors we get out there.
145

145

00:07:56.560  -->  00:07:58.777
First, add another point in here and
146

146

00:07:58.777  -->  00:08:01.780
to change this point to say
more of a purple color,
147

147

00:08:01.780  -->  00:08:07.170
then a certain percentage of my explosion
particles are gonna be a purple color.
148

148

00:08:07.170  -->  00:08:11.660
And if I wanna get rid of this, then I
just highlight and then hit delete, and
149

149

00:08:11.660  -->  00:08:13.470
we get rid of one point in there.
150

150

00:08:13.470  -->  00:08:17.526
Okay, and then as I said before, click
on new, now we'll save this a preset,
151

151

00:08:17.526  -->  00:08:21.098
there we go, down at the bottom there,
not as a prefab, as a preset.
152

152

00:08:21.098  -->  00:08:23.900
[LAUGH] Okay, next thing,
we want to do is to change the shape.
153

153

00:08:23.900  -->  00:08:26.000
At the moment we've got,
let's click on our shape here.
154

154

00:08:26.000  -->  00:08:28.500
We've got a cone, and
when we explode something,
155

155

00:08:28.500  -->  00:08:30.930
it's gonna be exploding it
in an area around that.
156

156

00:08:30.930  -->  00:08:33.200
I don't think it's gonna be shooting
off in a particular direction.
157

157

00:08:33.200  -->  00:08:37.920
So I'm gonna change from cone to sphere,
and then that's better,
158

158

00:08:37.920  -->  00:08:41.600
spurting out in all different directions,
I think that is cool.
159

159

00:08:41.600  -->  00:08:44.260
The radius, I'm gonna make a little bit
smaller, I think it's a little bit large.
160

160

00:08:44.260  -->  00:08:47.377
So that means, the particles will be
spinning anywhere within this radius.
161

161

00:08:47.377  -->  00:08:50.262
But if we use Roger over here
as an example, if we hit him,
162

162

00:08:50.262  -->  00:08:53.890
then we want the particles to be
starting from a pretty tight standard.
163

163

00:08:53.890  -->  00:08:58.017
So I'm gonna change my radius down to 0.4,
make it a little bit smaller.
164

164

00:08:58.017  -->  00:09:02.977
And I'm just gonna see what happens
if I increase my emission to
165

165

00:09:02.977  -->  00:09:07.960
200 bump and then turn off looping,
hit Play, bam, play.
166

166

00:09:07.960  -->  00:09:09.238
Okay, not too bad.
167

167

00:09:10.619  -->  00:09:14.639
I think I do want it a little bit fuller,
so maybe we'll put it all back to 400,
168

168

00:09:14.639  -->  00:09:18.560
click on Play, boom, okay,
that's a bit more sparkly going on there.
169

169

00:09:18.560  -->  00:09:22.690
Great, and then next I'm gonna scroll to
find rotation of a lifetime just to get
170

170

00:09:22.690  -->  00:09:23.920
a little bit of rotation.
171

171

00:09:23.920  -->  00:09:27.540
Click on the selected,
I'll say yes to that, angular velocity,
172

172

00:09:27.540  -->  00:09:34.210
I'm going to change that to random between
two constants and go from -180 to 180.
173

173

00:09:34.210  -->  00:09:36.430
We'll see how that looks now and
I'll click on Play.
174

174

00:09:36.430  -->  00:09:39.700
Okay, so there's a little bit of
rotational movement on our particles,
175

175

00:09:39.700  -->  00:09:41.590
I think it mixes it up great.
176

176

00:09:41.590  -->  00:09:44.110
Okay, it's pretty good for now,
just clicking on my VFX folder,
177

177

00:09:44.110  -->  00:09:46.840
I'm gonna drag explosion particles
into that, that will create.
178

178

00:09:46.840  -->  00:09:49.360
This is a prefab delete from my scene cuz
179

179

00:09:49.360  -->  00:09:52.070
we don't want it randomly sitting
there in the middle of our scene.
180

180

00:09:52.070  -->  00:09:53.450
Okay, that's pretty good for now.
181

181

00:09:53.450  -->  00:09:58.230
Next up, we need to explode our enemies
and trigger the particle effect.
182

182

00:09:58.230  -->  00:10:01.850
So, this is where I have a challenge for
you to instantiate our explosion.
183

183

00:10:01.850  -->  00:10:03.860
And think of where we should
trigger the explosion.
184

184

00:10:03.860  -->  00:10:07.380
What's the situation where
the explosion needs to be created?
185

185

00:10:07.380  -->  00:10:10.000
Have a think about that,
what script would we put it in?
186

186

00:10:10.000  -->  00:10:14.000
And then to instantiate our
particle effect as a game object so
187

187

00:10:14.000  -->  00:10:17.770
that we can destroy that game
object after one second.
188

188

00:10:17.770  -->  00:10:21.920
So, we've done plenty of instantiating,
we've done plenty of destroying, and
189

189

00:10:21.920  -->  00:10:24.330
in the past, we've done destroying
after a certain amount of time, so
190

190

00:10:24.330  -->  00:10:25.890
you should have everything
you need in there.
191

191

00:10:25.890  -->  00:10:29.300
If it's not readily apparent, then dig
through your code, have a look, and
192

192

00:10:29.300  -->  00:10:30.050
have a think about it.
193

193

00:10:30.050  -->  00:10:32.660
Do a little bit of research and
give it your best shot.
194

194

00:10:32.660  -->  00:10:34.898
When you have given it your best shot,
I'll see you back here and
195

195

00:10:34.898  -->  00:10:36.022
we'll go through it together.
196

196

00:10:38.515  -->  00:10:42.470
Okay, welcome back, so
I'm going to find my enemy script,
197

197

00:10:42.470  -->  00:10:45.507
script, enemy open that
up in Visual Studio.
198

198

00:10:45.507  -->  00:10:48.447
And what am looking for here is
the moment where the enemy dies and
199

199

00:10:48.447  -->  00:10:51.630
that's where we are gonna
trigger our explosion effect.
200

200

00:10:51.630  -->  00:10:53.860
Dying and
explosion seem to go hand-in-hand.
201

201

00:10:53.860  -->  00:10:57.470
So you see down here,
ProcessHit, Destroy(gameObject).
202

202

00:10:57.470  -->  00:10:59.240
I'm just gonna factor this out and
203

203

00:10:59.240  -->  00:11:02.182
create a new method in here
which will be called Die.
204

204

00:11:02.182  -->  00:11:04.310
So right-click, Quick Actions and
205

205

00:11:04.310  -->  00:11:08.890
Refactors, extract method,
and we'll call it Die, great.
206

206

00:11:08.890  -->  00:11:10.040
Now within Die, what are we doing?
207

207

00:11:10.040  -->  00:11:11.520
We're destroying the gameObject.
208

208

00:11:11.520  -->  00:11:16.100
And because we're destroying the
gameObject, if we instantiate a particle
209

209

00:11:16.100  -->  00:11:20.220
that belongs to this gameObject,
that particle would be destroyed as well.
210

210

00:11:20.220  -->  00:11:24.510
So we need to create this as it's own
gameObject that can live for a moment and
211

211

00:11:24.510  -->  00:11:27.020
then be destroyed when they're ready for
it to be destroyed.
212

212

00:11:27.020  -->  00:11:31.050
So we'll start with GameObject,
and we'll call this explosion, and
213

213

00:11:31.050  -->  00:11:33.920
that would be equals Instantiate.
214

214

00:11:33.920  -->  00:11:36.460
And we need to know the what,
the where, and the rotation.
215

215

00:11:36.460  -->  00:11:38.570
So the what, we need to create a variable.
216

216

00:11:38.570  -->  00:11:42.010
For now, I'll call it deathVFX.
217

217

00:11:42.010  -->  00:11:45.160
Whereabouts while just
the transform.position of
218

218

00:11:45.160  -->  00:11:49.220
the parent of the enemy itself,
and then, transform
219

219

00:11:51.860  -->  00:11:56.060
if I can talk correctly,
transform.rotation.
220

220

00:11:56.060  -->  00:11:59.961
We can write it that way,
we've done quaternion in the past,
221

221

00:11:59.961  -->  00:12:04.314
we need just do transform.rotation
works just fine, semicolon and
222

222

00:12:04.314  -->  00:12:07.405
then on the next one,
we're gonna say Destroy.
223

223

00:12:07.405  -->  00:12:08.310
What are we destroying?
224

224

00:12:08.310  -->  00:12:12.280
Well, we're destroying explosion,
and, after how long?
225

225

00:12:12.280  -->  00:12:14.300
We'll say, 1 second.
226

226

00:12:14.300  -->  00:12:16.350
Okay, and
that should set some alarm bells off.
227

227

00:12:16.350  -->  00:12:19.350
We've got this amount of time
buried deep within our code here.
228

228

00:12:19.350  -->  00:12:23.930
So, we'll create a variable for that as
well that we can tune in our inspector.
229

229

00:12:23.930  -->  00:12:25.600
Let's, first of all, do death effects.
230

230

00:12:25.600  -->  00:12:30.976
Up at the very top,
we will SerializeField,
231

231

00:12:30.976  -->  00:12:39.330
and this will be a GameObject that
is called deathVFX, okay, and ;.
232

232

00:12:39.330  -->  00:12:41.390
We also need to serialized field.
233

233

00:12:42.690  -->  00:12:45.300
A float that will be,
what do we call it down here?
234

234

00:12:45.300  -->  00:12:46.270
We didn't call anything yet.
235

235

00:12:46.270  -->  00:12:51.815
Let's call it, float time, no,
236

236

00:12:51.815  -->  00:12:57.754
not time but duration of explosion.
237

237

00:12:57.754  -->  00:13:01.898
Okay, now back down to our 1f
down the bottom here will say,
238

238

00:13:01.898  -->  00:13:04.590
duration of explosion, right?
239

239

00:13:04.590  -->  00:13:08.645
Okay, saving that up, back into Unity,
we need to do a couple of things, find out
240

240

00:13:08.645  -->  00:13:14.430
enemies,so prefabs, I fed everything
to compile, prefabs, down to Roger.
241

241

00:13:14.430  -->  00:13:18.550
Roger now should have some extra
details on his Enemy Script.
242

242

00:13:18.550  -->  00:13:20.160
We have a deathFX.
243

243

00:13:20.160  -->  00:13:24.360
We need to click our selector,
find our Explosion Particles,
244

244

00:13:24.360  -->  00:13:27.800
that should be assigned Duration of
Explosion, we'll start this off at 1.
245

245

00:13:27.800  -->  00:13:32.674
My bad, I should have initialized
this at 1 = 1f, okay,
246

246

00:13:32.674  -->  00:13:38.442
that'd be useful for any other
enemies that we're applying this to.
247

247

00:13:38.442  -->  00:13:43.090
I'm gonna save, back over into our
script that looks all pretty good.
248

248

00:13:43.090  -->  00:13:46.580
I click on Play, okay,
shoot, shoot, shoot.
249

249

00:13:46.580  -->  00:13:49.130
Great, that's pretty explosive, isn't it?
250

250

00:13:49.130  -->  00:13:50.716
And nice, doesn't look very random?
251

251

00:13:50.716  -->  00:13:53.921
It looks the same every time might be
a little bit too many particles in there,
252

252

00:13:53.921  -->  00:13:56.634
but for now, I think it looks
pretty fun and pretty interesting,
253

253

00:13:56.634  -->  00:13:58.040
I live it as is, so that's cool.
254

254

00:13:58.040  -->  00:14:02.159
We now have explosions being triggered
in our game when we shoot out enemies.
255

255

00:14:02.159  -->  00:14:05.493
I look forward to seeing what yours
look like if you've created a particle
256

256

00:14:05.493  -->  00:14:07.699
explosion, that you
particularly happy with,
257

257

00:14:07.699  -->  00:14:10.700
then please share in the discussions
I would love to see it.
258

258

00:14:10.700  -->  00:14:12.190
And I'll see you in the next video.
