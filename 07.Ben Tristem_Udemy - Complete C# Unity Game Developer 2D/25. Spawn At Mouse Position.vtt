[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04.110  -->  00:00:06.274
In this video we are gonna be clicking and
3

3

00:00:06.274  -->  00:00:10.614
spawning out defenders wherever we have
clicked in the war which is pretty cool.
4

4

00:00:10.614  -->  00:00:14.261
And we are gonna be talking
in detail about return types.
5

5

00:00:14.261  -->  00:00:19.878
And about passing in information and
about creating arguments within methods.
6

6

00:00:19.878  -->  00:00:23.081
So it's gonna be pretty deep
from that point of view, but
7

7

00:00:23.081  -->  00:00:26.566
lots of awesome learning, so
let's jump in and get started.
8

8

00:00:26.566  -->  00:00:28.945
Okay, let's continue our journey
of placing our defender.
9

9

00:00:28.945  -->  00:00:32.490
In this video we're gonna place
the defender on a specific position
10

10

00:00:32.490  -->  00:00:33.490
within the world.
11

11

00:00:33.490  -->  00:00:38.105
So back over into defender spawner script,
what we need to do in here is create
12

12

00:00:38.105  -->  00:00:41.442
ourselves this mechanism for
saying where did I click.
13

13

00:00:41.442  -->  00:00:45.803
So I will below on mouse-down
in between our mouse-down and
14

14

00:00:45.803  -->  00:00:51.788
Spawn Defender I'm gonna make a new method
which I will have as a private Vector2,
15

15

00:00:51.788  -->  00:00:53.512
which I want to return.
16

16

00:00:53.512  -->  00:00:58.671
When something calls this method,
we want to be returning a Vector2 value.
17

17

00:00:58.671  -->  00:01:03.016
We'll call this GetSquareClicked.
18

18

00:01:03.016  -->  00:01:07.384
Within GetSquareClicked,
we'll start off by making Vector2,
19

19

00:01:07.384  -->  00:01:10.738
which we'll call clickPause or
clickPosition and
20

20

00:01:10.738  -->  00:01:14.794
that will be a new Vector2, so
we construct it as a Vector2.
21

21

00:01:14.794  -->  00:01:19.071
This will be Input.mousePosition.x, and
22

22

00:01:19.071  -->  00:01:23.130
then to get y coordinate, what will it be?
23

23

00:01:23.130  -->  00:01:30.346
You've got it, Input.mousePosition.y;.
24

24

00:01:30.346  -->  00:01:31.212
Good start.
25

25

00:01:31.212  -->  00:01:35.489
Next, after we've got our
position within the world,
26

26

00:01:35.489  -->  00:01:38.947
we need to convert that
to a grid coordinate.
27

27

00:01:38.947  -->  00:01:42.856
So to take it from just the role position
on the screen to what we want within
28

28

00:01:42.856  -->  00:01:46.916
the world spacing, cuz we know this is
one, one and up here is seven, five.
29

29

00:01:46.916  -->  00:01:48.636
So to do that, we'll used,
30

30

00:01:48.636  -->  00:01:53.601
something that we've used before in this
course which is a screen to world point.
31

31

00:01:53.601  -->  00:02:00.281
So Vector2, this will be worldPosition or
32

32

00:02:00.281  -->  00:02:08.231
worldPos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint.
33

33

00:02:08.231  -->  00:02:11.647
And then what's the reference
we're taking here?
34

34

00:02:11.647  -->  00:02:12.508
What's the point we want?
35

35

00:02:12.508  -->  00:02:18.296
Well, we want the clickPosition, so that's
why I've created this variable, clickPos.
36

36

00:02:18.296  -->  00:02:21.746
So we're saying, wherever clickPos is,
which is our x and
37

37

00:02:21.746  -->  00:02:23.411
y coordinates of our mouse.
38

38

00:02:23.411  -->  00:02:26.907
We want to convert that
into ScreenToWorldPoint.
39

39

00:02:26.907  -->  00:02:29.392
And now, because we're getting
our red squiggly line,
40

40

00:02:29.392  -->  00:02:31.929
it's saying because you wanted
me to return a Vector2 but
41

41

00:02:31.929  -->  00:02:34.795
I don't see anywhere in here
that's saying return to Vector2.
42

42

00:02:34.795  -->  00:02:38.384
So nice and simply we'll say return.
43

43

00:02:38.384  -->  00:02:39.885
What are we returning in here?
44

44

00:02:39.885  -->  00:02:44.281
We're returning the worldPosition,
so worldpos;.
45

45

00:02:44.281  -->  00:02:48.171
Okay, that should make it nice and
happy now that whenever we
46

46

00:02:48.171  -->  00:02:52.080
call GetSquaredClicked(),
we are returning worldPos.
47

47

00:02:52.080  -->  00:02:53.225
Now, how are we gonna use this?
48

48

00:02:53.225  -->  00:02:55.276
Well, this is where I've got
a little challenge for you.
49

49

00:02:55.276  -->  00:02:58.419
This challenge is a little bit more
like a riddle, and this is great for
50

50

00:02:58.419  -->  00:03:01.045
those of you who play a lot of
video games and like puzzles.
51

51

00:03:01.045  -->  00:03:03.062
So where do we need to use worldPos so
52

52

00:03:03.062  -->  00:03:06.781
that we can spawn our defenders
at the place that we've clicked?
53

53

00:03:06.781  -->  00:03:07.923
Well, I'd like for
54

54

00:03:07.923  -->  00:03:12.300
you to create an argument in
SpawnDefender() that receives coordinates.
55

55

00:03:12.300  -->  00:03:16.272
So, this is SpawnDefender() and we need
to be receiving coordinates in here.
56

56

00:03:16.272  -->  00:03:20.370
You need to specify and then, to use those
coordinates when spawning the defender.
57

57

00:03:20.370  -->  00:03:23.231
So where is it that we would
use those coordinates?
58

58

00:03:23.231  -->  00:03:25.440
Why do we need to say,
this is where you spawn?
59

59

00:03:25.440  -->  00:03:29.821
And then also to make sure you have
a place where you get the coordinate by
60

60

00:03:29.821  -->  00:03:34.067
calling GetSquareClicked() somewhere,
this is the puzzle bit.
61

61

00:03:34.067  -->  00:03:38.403
I'm saying, somewhere in our code,
we need to be calling GetSquareClicked().
62

62

00:03:38.403  -->  00:03:41.937
So it's a little bit of a tricky one,
it's a little bit more of a puzzle but
63

63

00:03:41.937  -->  00:03:43.948
it's only gonna be a tiny amount of code.
64

64

00:03:43.948  -->  00:03:47.963
It's just figuring out where to put things
so the right things are calling and
65

65

00:03:47.963  -->  00:03:50.012
returning and using the right things.
66

66

00:03:50.012  -->  00:03:51.619
So there's your challenge,
take that on and
67

67

00:03:51.619  -->  00:03:53.876
I'll see you back here when
you've given that your best shot.
68

68

00:03:56.581  -->  00:03:58.789
Okay, I'm gonna start at
the end of the chain here.
69

69

00:03:58.789  -->  00:04:03.178
I'm gonna say right at the very end we
want something to be spawned not in
70

70

00:04:03.178  -->  00:04:06.411
transform.position, but
in our worldPosition.
71

71

00:04:06.411  -->  00:04:10.614
And to do that we're saying we need within
our SpawnDefender here, we need to,
72

72

00:04:10.614  -->  00:04:11.995
whoever has called this,
73

73

00:04:11.995  -->  00:04:16.031
it's their responsibility to tell us
where is it that we need to place this?
74

74

00:04:16.031  -->  00:04:17.275
Where was clicked?
75

75

00:04:17.275  -->  00:04:21.305
So we'll create a Vector2
worldPos requirement, or
76

76

00:04:21.305  -->  00:04:26.736
an argument that needs to be parse in
when anything calls SpawnDefender,
77

77

00:04:26.736  -->  00:04:31.048
you need to tell me where in
the world I should be spawning.
78

78

00:04:31.048  -->  00:04:33.025
Now, where is currently
calling SpawnDefender?
79

79

00:04:33.025  -->  00:04:33.969
It's up here.
80

80

00:04:33.969  -->  00:04:36.865
So SpawnDefender, when we call it,
we need to be saying, okay,
81

81

00:04:36.865  -->  00:04:38.300
this is where you should click.
82

82

00:04:38.300  -->  00:04:40.085
But how do we know where you should click?
83

83

00:04:40.085  -->  00:04:44.744
Well, it's contain within here, we now
GetSquareClicked, we want this worldPos.
84

84

00:04:44.744  -->  00:04:49.625
And the way we get that, because we
have this return type of Vector2,
85

85

00:04:49.625  -->  00:04:53.517
we know that anything that calls,
GetSquareClicked,
86

86

00:04:53.517  -->  00:04:57.355
is going to be returning
the information of worldPos.
87

87

00:04:57.355  -->  00:04:58.983
So we can have it in here.
88

88

00:04:58.983  -->  00:05:05.173
And that will be parse into our
worldPos when SpawnDefender is called.
89

89

00:05:05.173  -->  00:05:07.052
So, just let me type this so
it's super clear.
90

90

00:05:07.052  -->  00:05:11.629
So we're calling a method within a method,
it's a little bit inception.
91

91

00:05:11.629  -->  00:05:13.846
GetSquaredClicked() in parenthesis.
92

92

00:05:13.846  -->  00:05:15.488
So SpawnDefender is calling, so
93

93

00:05:15.488  -->  00:05:19.135
when we call SpawnDefender we're
also calling GetSquareClicked().
94

94

00:05:19.135  -->  00:05:22.584
GetSquareClicked() is parsing back,
it's returning, sorry,
95

95

00:05:22.584  -->  00:05:26.042
it's returning the information of
world Pos in the SpawnDefender.
96

96

00:05:26.042  -->  00:05:30.617
And then that is passing in the
information of the Vector2 worldPos, so
97

97

00:05:30.617  -->  00:05:32.950
we can be using that spawn defender.
98

98

00:05:32.950  -->  00:05:33.971
Hopefully that all makes sense.
99

99

00:05:33.971  -->  00:05:35.362
I know it's a little bit tricky.
100

100

00:05:35.362  -->  00:05:38.906
And I know I have explained a few
different times, in a few different ways,
101

101

00:05:38.906  -->  00:05:40.662
and hopefully it does click for you.
102

102

00:05:40.662  -->  00:05:43.333
Before we put ourselves on
the back two aggressively.
103

103

00:05:43.333  -->  00:05:46.868
Let's go and click on Play and
make sure this all works.
104

104

00:05:46.868  -->  00:05:50.007
I'm sure there's ones that we've
forgotten in here somewhere.
105

105

00:05:50.007  -->  00:05:52.165
So when I click around, beautiful.
106

106

00:05:52.165  -->  00:05:53.402
I didn't forget any steps.
107

107

00:05:53.402  -->  00:05:56.909
So now, we have our DefenderSpawning
exactly where we click it,
108

108

00:05:56.909  -->  00:06:00.953
not out of the play space, only within
the play space, exactly as we want.
109

109

00:06:00.953  -->  00:06:04.276
Although not exactly as we want, because
we want them to be spawning just in
110

110

00:06:04.276  -->  00:06:06.561
the middle of the square and
not all over the place.
111

111

00:06:06.561  -->  00:06:10.388
And that will be the subject of the next
video, where we spawn our cactus or
112

112

00:06:10.388  -->  00:06:13.309
spawn our defenders in the right
place within the grid.
113

113

00:06:13.309  -->  00:06:14.905
So great work, well done.
114

114

00:06:14.905  -->  00:06:16.105
And I'll see you in the next video.
