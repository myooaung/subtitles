00:00:03.595  -->  00:00:08.138
Hello again, in this video we are going
to be talking about if, else if and else.
3

3

00:00:08.138  -->  00:00:10.910
And we're gonna be resolving a problem we
have at the moment where the player can
4

4

00:00:10.910  -->  00:00:15.220
simultaneously push up and down and
register two key presses or
5

5

00:00:15.220  -->  00:00:16.990
up down and enter in register three.
6

6

00:00:16.990  -->  00:00:21.340
That's not what we want, we want to have
that you can only push one at a time.
7

7

00:00:21.340  -->  00:00:23.490
So if we have a look at our
code as it is at the moment.
8

8

00:00:23.490  -->  00:00:25.080
We've got three if statements.
9

9

00:00:25.080  -->  00:00:27.230
We've talked about
the structure of if being,
10

10

00:00:27.230  -->  00:00:30.060
if this particular condition is true.
11

11

00:00:30.060  -->  00:00:34.660
That's why if is a conditional, this
is true, then do this particular thing.
12

12

00:00:34.660  -->  00:00:37.850
At the moment we're saying if that's true,
do this, if that's true do that,
13

13

00:00:37.850  -->  00:00:39.300
if that's true do that.
14

14

00:00:39.300  -->  00:00:42.430
We don't have a situation, we don't
have a structure in here that says,
15

15

00:00:42.430  -->  00:00:45.960
if that one's true well then don't
do any of these other things.
16

16

00:00:45.960  -->  00:00:47.230
So let's have a look at our options.
17

17

00:00:47.230  -->  00:00:50.610
We've already talked about if statement,
if this expression evaluates to true,
18

18

00:00:50.610  -->  00:00:53.400
then execute all of these
statements within this code block.
19

19

00:00:53.400  -->  00:00:56.170
You could have one, two, five,
ten statements within here,
20

20

00:00:56.170  -->  00:00:59.450
do all of these particular
things if this is true.
21

21

00:00:59.450  -->  00:01:02.660
We can also say, else if,
it's still an if statement but
22

22

00:01:02.660  -->  00:01:08.010
because it says else,
we are only executing this if statement
23

23

00:01:08.010  -->  00:01:12.040
if the preceding if statement
evaluated to false.
24

24

00:01:12.040  -->  00:01:13.950
So if something happened up here,
then go off and
25

25

00:01:13.950  -->  00:01:16.250
do it and don't even look at this else.
26

26

00:01:16.250  -->  00:01:19.370
But we're saying else is another
way of saying otherwise.
27

27

00:01:19.370  -->  00:01:24.740
If this is true, do that otherwise or
else do this particular if statement and
28

28

00:01:24.740  -->  00:01:29.400
that again is if some expression is true
then execute the code within this block.
29

29

00:01:29.400  -->  00:01:30.156
We could have again,
30

30

00:01:30.156  -->  00:01:32.680
we could have a whole bunch of
statements within this code block.
31

31

00:01:32.680  -->  00:01:34.550
We can also have a whole lot of else ifs.
32

32

00:01:34.550  -->  00:01:38.000
So if thing number one is true, do that.
33

33

00:01:38.000  -->  00:01:42.050
If thing number two, sorry,
else if thing number 2 is true, do that.
34

34

00:01:42.050  -->  00:01:44.290
Else if thing number three is true,
do that.
35

35

00:01:44.290  -->  00:01:45.440
Else if, and so on.
36

36

00:01:45.440  -->  00:01:48.670
So we're gonna have a lot of
else ifs one after another.
37

37

00:01:48.670  -->  00:01:52.954
And eventually we can get to the point
where we could as a catch all we can use
38

38

00:01:52.954  -->  00:01:57.584
else which is another way of saying if
nothing else above has evaluated to true,
39

39

00:01:57.584  -->  00:01:58.920
then just do this.
40

40

00:01:58.920  -->  00:02:02.230
And again,
we execute the code in the code block.
41

41

00:02:02.230  -->  00:02:04.470
So let's give a real world example here.
42

42

00:02:04.470  -->  00:02:07.540
If the condition of being in the mood for
an MMO,
43

43

00:02:07.540  -->  00:02:10.580
a massively multi play online games,
so if I'm in the mood for
44

44

00:02:10.580  -->  00:02:15.650
an MMO, then play World of Warcraft,
that's the statements within here.
45

45

00:02:15.650  -->  00:02:18.990
So the condition is if I'm in the mood for
an MMO, play World of Warcraft,
46

46

00:02:18.990  -->  00:02:24.140
else if I'm in the mood for
an FPS then play Overwatch.
47

47

00:02:24.140  -->  00:02:27.130
In other words,
if I'm not in the mood to play an MMO,
48

48

00:02:27.130  -->  00:02:30.034
then how about playing
a first-person shooter?
49

49

00:02:30.034  -->  00:02:32.329
Yeah, I'm in the mood for
that then play Overwatch.
50

50

00:02:32.329  -->  00:02:37.082
However, if I'm not in the mood for
that, if this evaluates as false then
51

51

00:02:37.082  -->  00:02:41.374
we can have our catch all of go to
bed because you know you should, so
52

52

00:02:41.374  -->  00:02:43.640
if I'm not in the mood for that.
53

53

00:02:43.640  -->  00:02:47.213
If you're a visual person let me just
give you this as a flow diagram here.
54

54

00:02:47.213  -->  00:02:49.319
MMO, yeah, why not?
55

55

00:02:49.319  -->  00:02:52.370
That's true, yes I'm in the mood for
an MMO, then I'll Play WoW.
56

56

00:02:52.370  -->  00:02:54.932
If it's false,
no I'm not in the mood for an MMO,
57

57

00:02:54.932  -->  00:02:57.530
then I'll consider a first person shooter.
58

58

00:02:57.530  -->  00:02:58.490
If I'm in the mood for that,
59

59

00:02:58.490  -->  00:03:01.510
if that evaluates as true,
then I'll play Overwatch.
60

60

00:03:01.510  -->  00:03:05.410
Or if I'm not in the mood for a first
person shooter, then I'll go to bed.
61

61

00:03:05.410  -->  00:03:09.130
So this is the flow, this happens first,
that happens second,
62

62

00:03:09.130  -->  00:03:13.550
and then this happens if all of these
other conditions are evaluated to false.
63

63

00:03:13.550  -->  00:03:17.870
When we look at our code here, we can
see that we need to have some mutually
64

64

00:03:17.870  -->  00:03:21.540
exclusive set up in here
that I can do this, and
65

65

00:03:21.540  -->  00:03:25.480
if I'm not presently doing that then okay,
I can do this.
66

66

00:03:25.480  -->  00:03:28.145
And if I'm not presently doing that,
I can do this.
67

67

00:03:28.145  -->  00:03:32.046
So that is the structure for our challenge
here, to produce straightforward if you've
68

68

00:03:32.046  -->  00:03:35.420
understood this concept, and if you've
done a bit of programming before,
69

69

00:03:35.420  -->  00:03:38.452
this will be a piece of cake and
you know how to do this straightaway.
70

70

00:03:38.452  -->  00:03:44.165
And the challenge is to allow only one
key option to be pressed down at a time,
71

71

00:03:44.165  -->  00:03:47.216
so the player can only push one at a time.
72

72

00:03:47.216  -->  00:03:50.031
So that's our challenge,
it's pretty straightforward,
73

73

00:03:50.031  -->  00:03:53.740
just only a couple of key words that you
need to be adding into our existing code.
74

74

00:03:53.740  -->  00:03:54.671
Give that your best shot and
75

75

00:03:54.671  -->  00:03:57.435
I'll see you back here in a moment where
we can go through our solution together.
76

76

00:04:00.910  -->  00:04:06.756
Our solution's pretty straightforward,
we need to leave our first if as an if and
77

77

00:04:06.756  -->  00:04:11.583
then our other two if statements,
we need to make them, else if, so
78

78

00:04:11.583  -->  00:04:17.710
it's saying if you're pushing a key,
if you're pushing the UpArrow, fantastic.
79

79

00:04:17.710  -->  00:04:21.450
Push the UpArrow, stop there,
nothing else needs to be done.
80

80

00:04:21.450  -->  00:04:22.720
Don't go to these other ones.
81

81

00:04:22.720  -->  00:04:24.095
If you're not pushing the UpArrow,
82

82

00:04:24.095  -->  00:04:26.453
then yeah, you've got an opportunity
to push the DownArrow.
83

83

00:04:26.453  -->  00:04:28.976
If you're not pushing
the DownArrow else if,
84

84

00:04:28.976  -->  00:04:31.377
we give you the opportunity
to push return.
85

85

00:04:31.377  -->  00:04:35.519
So that's a way of us creating this
mutually exclusive setup were we can only
86

86

00:04:35.519  -->  00:04:39.853
push one at a time, and in this particular
case there's no reason for us to put in
87

87

00:04:39.853  -->  00:04:44.357
an else, cuz basically we just do nothing
if these other conditions aren't met.
88

88

00:04:44.357  -->  00:04:49.750
Let's save that and jump back over to
unity, hit play again and then do a test.
89

89

00:04:49.750  -->  00:04:53.080
I can push up, I can push down a couple
of times or I push them together.
90

90

00:04:53.080  -->  00:04:56.296
You can probably hear me pushing
through the keyboard there.
91

91

00:04:56.296  -->  00:05:00.590
Only one's being pushed, a little tip here
if you click collapse then you can see how
92

92

00:05:00.590  -->  00:05:02.726
many times a particular thing is pushed.
93

93

00:05:02.726  -->  00:05:05.826
If I push up, then you should see,
I need to click back in the game window,
94

94

00:05:05.826  -->  00:05:06.881
just as a note to do that.
95

95

00:05:06.881  -->  00:05:11.452
Push up, you can see the under up arrow
going up, up, up and then if I push down,
96

96

00:05:11.452  -->  00:05:16.370
down's going down, if I pushed two at
the same time only one of them went up.
97

97

00:05:16.370  -->  00:05:19.210
If I accidentally kinda pushed one,
two, then they both go up.
98

98

00:05:19.210  -->  00:05:23.030
Okay, so we've created
mutually exclusive key presses
99

99

00:05:23.030  -->  00:05:26.790
by using the else if conditional
statement within here.
100

100

00:05:26.790  -->  00:05:29.100
Well done, great work,
I'll see you in the next video.
