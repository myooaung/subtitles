00:00:04.240  -->  00:00:06.210
In this video, we're doing
a couple of quick fiddly things.
2

2

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:09.200
We're making ourselves an axe, so
that we have another projectile.
3

3

00:00:09.200  -->  00:00:15.560
We are stopping defenders from being
placed multiple defenders in one square.
4

4

00:00:15.560  -->  00:00:18.385
And we're making our
cactus face to the right,
5

5

00:00:18.385  -->  00:00:20.250
cuz it's been facing to
the left all this time.
6

6

00:00:20.250  -->  00:00:22.470
So let's jump in and get started.
7

7

00:00:22.470  -->  00:00:25.830
Okay, we've got another problem and
solution type video.
8

8

00:00:25.830  -->  00:00:27.610
What's the problem, I hear you ask.
9

9

00:00:27.610  -->  00:00:30.440
Well, let's see when I place down
a cactus on different places,
10

10

00:00:30.440  -->  00:00:33.360
I can also place a trophy right
over the top of the cactus.
11

11

00:00:33.360  -->  00:00:35.890
Which although is kind of a cool strategy,
12

12

00:00:35.890  -->  00:00:38.670
is not the strategy we want
our player to be implementing.
13

13

00:00:38.670  -->  00:00:43.500
So if you wanna take this on as one
of those weird random challenges,
14

14

00:00:43.500  -->  00:00:45.680
where you dig in and
try to figure out why that's happening,
15

15

00:00:45.680  -->  00:00:47.280
here's a great place for you to do so.
16

16

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:50.130
Haven't really taught you
why this is happening.
17

17

00:00:50.130  -->  00:00:53.460
So I'm not expecting you to figure it
out from scratch, but some of you,
18

18

00:00:53.460  -->  00:00:56.160
I know, are clever folks, and
you will indeed figure it out,
19

19

00:00:56.160  -->  00:01:00.590
so see if you can prevent double
placement in the squares.
20

20

00:01:01.980  -->  00:01:04.850
Okay, I didn't give you a slide on that,
cuz it's not the official challenge for
21

21

00:01:04.850  -->  00:01:07.920
this video, the official challenge
is going to be much easier.
22

22

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:10.890
But let's solve this together,
so the problem is, here we go,
23

23

00:01:10.890  -->  00:01:13.450
here's our core game area.
24

24

00:01:13.450  -->  00:01:16.110
This is the thing that we say,
if you're clicking on this, then,
25

25

00:01:16.110  -->  00:01:17.790
place down a defender.
26

26

00:01:17.790  -->  00:01:20.320
Remember, we created the code for that.
27

27

00:01:20.320  -->  00:01:25.800
So what we need to do is prevent the mouse
click from ever reaching this collider,
28

28

00:01:25.800  -->  00:01:27.860
if there's already something on top of it.
29

29

00:01:27.860  -->  00:01:33.753
And the way that we need to do that, is to
find our defenders and add a what to them,
30

30

00:01:33.753  -->  00:01:38.713
so that we can click the space below them,
we need to add a collider.
31

31

00:01:38.713  -->  00:01:42.100
Okay, so find a box collider 2D.
32

32

00:01:42.100  -->  00:01:46.290
Put that around the trophy, make sure
it fits the square nice and neatly.
33

33

00:01:46.290  -->  00:01:47.100
It's looking pretty good.
34

34

00:01:47.100  -->  00:01:48.560
Apply back to the pre-fab.
35

35

00:01:48.560  -->  00:01:50.950
Grab ourselves the cactus.
36

36

00:01:50.950  -->  00:01:54.070
Drop that into the scene,
bloop, and do the same, as well.
37

37

00:01:54.070  -->  00:01:56.140
Add a Box Collider.
38

38

00:01:56.140  -->  00:01:58.228
Okay, just tighten that up a little bit.
39

39

00:01:58.228  -->  00:02:02.480
Make sure it's positioned
right on the exact point and
40

40

00:02:02.480  -->  00:02:03.745
looks like the box plot is pretty good.
41

41

00:02:03.745  -->  00:02:07.980
I'm just gonna make it a tiny bit
bigger just to prevent any accidental,
42

42

00:02:07.980  -->  00:02:10.200
shouldn't have clicked in this square,
but you did.
43

43

00:02:10.200  -->  00:02:10.970
Okay, so there we go.
44

44

00:02:10.970  -->  00:02:14.460
We got ourselves a couple of colliders,
apply that back.
45

45

00:02:14.460  -->  00:02:18.130
Now, when we go and click Play.
46

46

00:02:18.130  -->  00:02:22.800
And drop down some dudes into the scene,
drop down a cactus.
47

47

00:02:22.800  -->  00:02:24.230
Now, lets see.
Can we drop a trophy?
48

48

00:02:24.230  -->  00:02:29.260
No we can't, because the mouse is
hitting the Cactus'' box collider,
49

49

00:02:29.260  -->  00:02:31.250
and not making it to
the gameplay collider.
50

50

00:02:31.250  -->  00:02:35.660
Now, let's do a whole bunch of qa,
we can see we've got one here.
51

51

00:02:35.660  -->  00:02:38.740
This is how, if you're interested
in working in quality assurance, or
52

52

00:02:38.740  -->  00:02:41.070
qa in the games industry,
this is often what you have to do,
53

53

00:02:41.070  -->  00:02:45.390
just do a ton of clicking
until you kinda break it.
54

54

00:02:45.390  -->  00:02:46.495
So what's happening here?
55

55

00:02:46.495  -->  00:02:48.750
I thought we'd solved this,
I thought we'd fixed this problem.
56

56

00:02:48.750  -->  00:02:52.140
Well, we've got a little
bit of ZED depth issue.
57

57

00:02:52.140  -->  00:02:55.298
Let's click the 2D button
to change it into 3D mode.
58

58

00:02:55.298  -->  00:02:58.325
When I swing around, you can see,
when I line up like that,
59

59

00:02:58.325  -->  00:03:00.805
everything is on exactly the same plane.
60

60

00:03:00.805  -->  00:03:02.880
They're all on ZED equals zero.
61

61

00:03:02.880  -->  00:03:07.640
That means that sometimes our defenders
colliders being clicked first, and
62

62

00:03:07.640  -->  00:03:12.070
sometimes, it's the game, core game
area that's being clicked first, and
63

63

00:03:12.070  -->  00:03:13.800
we can't really determine
which one that is.
64

64

00:03:13.800  -->  00:03:18.030
There's randomness to this
whole kind of ZED depth issue.
65

65

00:03:18.030  -->  00:03:18.870
What can we do about that?
66

66

00:03:18.870  -->  00:03:24.660
Well, we just need to push the core game
area away from the camera a little bit.
67

67

00:03:24.660  -->  00:03:29.110
Which will like this, or we could
just come over to our ZED value, and
68

68

00:03:29.110  -->  00:03:31.000
change it to, I'm gonna put it to one.
69

69

00:03:31.000  -->  00:03:32.850
So no fissure definitely.
70

70

00:03:32.850  -->  00:03:34.570
Click back on the 2D button.
71

71

00:03:34.570  -->  00:03:37.010
Definitely, it's behind the defenders.
72

72

00:03:37.010  -->  00:03:43.120
Now, when we click on Play, and if I
place down a defender onto my play space,
73

73

00:03:43.120  -->  00:03:47.353
I know for sure, gonna pause,
click on the 2D mode.
74

74

00:03:47.353  -->  00:03:51.972
I know for sure that these ones I've
placed down are gonna be in front of,
75

75

00:03:51.972  -->  00:03:53.800
where's my core game area?
76

76

00:03:53.800  -->  00:03:55.940
It's gonna be in front of this game area,
so
77

77

00:03:55.940  -->  00:03:58.160
it will definitely click on those first.
78

78

00:03:58.160  -->  00:04:03.760
Okay, so let's deem that a success in that
we've fixed it, and that it's all amazing.
79

79

00:04:03.760  -->  00:04:06.980
Next up, what I wanna do,
is have a look at my cactus.
80

80

00:04:06.980  -->  00:04:08.120
Just a little bit of a fix here.
81

81

00:04:08.120  -->  00:04:12.595
You can see that, well, the cactus, it's
taken me a lot of videos to realize this,
82

82

00:04:12.595  -->  00:04:14.140
he's facing the wrong way.
83

83

00:04:14.140  -->  00:04:15.840
And there's two ways
that we can tell this.
84

84

00:04:15.840  -->  00:04:19.300
The first way is his mouth is kind
of oriented that way a little bit.
85

85

00:04:19.300  -->  00:04:22.390
So he's not looking at the attackers,
and also the lighting.
86

86

00:04:22.390  -->  00:04:24.570
It's super important to have
consistent lighting in your game.
87

87

00:04:24.570  -->  00:04:25.720
You see our trophy?
88

88

00:04:25.720  -->  00:04:28.060
We've got the light up
in the top-left corner,
89

89

00:04:28.060  -->  00:04:30.140
which we would probably call 10 o'clock.
90

90

00:04:30.140  -->  00:04:34.390
We call it based upon where it would
be on a clock, 12 being right above,
91

91

00:04:34.390  -->  00:04:39.240
6 being right down below, so this is
right about a 10 or 11 o'clock sunshine.
92

92

00:04:39.240  -->  00:04:42.740
But, my cactus is looking like it's
more like a 2 o'clock sunshine,
93

93

00:04:42.740  -->  00:04:44.350
so we need to flip the cactus.
94

94

00:04:44.350  -->  00:04:45.620
And this will be your challenge.
95

95

00:04:45.620  -->  00:04:46.850
It's something that we've done before.
96

96

00:04:46.850  -->  00:04:50.440
It's really,
really simple if you know how to do this,
97

97

00:04:50.440  -->  00:04:52.980
but the challenge is to
make the cactus face right.
98

98

00:04:52.980  -->  00:04:56.380
Flip, as a hint, the cactus, so
that it faces to the right, and
99

99

00:04:56.380  -->  00:04:58.320
check that you don't break
anything by doing this.
100

100

00:04:58.320  -->  00:05:01.320
We'll probably break at least
one thing by doing this.
101

101

00:05:01.320  -->  00:05:02.510
So there's your challenge.
102

102

00:05:02.510  -->  00:05:04.810
A little bit simpler,
I'd jump in, take that on now.
103

103

00:05:04.810  -->  00:05:06.980
See you back here when you've got it done!
104

104

00:05:06.980  -->  00:05:08.390
What do we need to do?
105

105

00:05:08.390  -->  00:05:11.100
Well, let's click on our prefab.
106

106

00:05:11.100  -->  00:05:12.910
Actually no,
I'll do this on the non-prefab, so
107

107

00:05:12.910  -->  00:05:15.070
we can see the impact of it.
108

108

00:05:15.070  -->  00:05:16.010
Click on the cactus.
109

109

00:05:16.010  -->  00:05:21.590
All we need to do is go over to scale and
find the appropriate axis to be scaling.
110

110

00:05:21.590  -->  00:05:22.330
Is it x?
111

111

00:05:22.330  -->  00:05:23.000
It is x.
112

112

00:05:23.000  -->  00:05:25.120
See when we change that it flips.
113

113

00:05:25.120  -->  00:05:27.220
The cactus, so I'll make that -1.
114

114

00:05:27.220  -->  00:05:32.070
Now, our cactus is facing to the right,
as it should, looking at the attackers.
115

115

00:05:32.070  -->  00:05:34.870
What is it that we could've broken,
I hear you ask.
116

116

00:05:34.870  -->  00:05:38.640
Well, where now is the gun?
117

117

00:05:38.640  -->  00:05:41.200
The gun is over on the left,
so it got flipped, as well.
118

118

00:05:41.200  -->  00:05:45.530
We just need to change the position
of the gun over to our forward hand.
119

119

00:05:45.530  -->  00:05:47.570
Or you could have the gun
on the back hand,
120

120

00:05:47.570  -->  00:05:51.120
you can have the cactus throwing
the zucchini from behind.
121

121

00:05:51.120  -->  00:05:53.510
That's fine as well, up to you.
122

122

00:05:53.510  -->  00:05:56.338
Apply that back to the prefab,
click on Play.
123

123

00:05:58.179  -->  00:06:00.770
And let's just check
that it's all working.
124

124

00:06:00.770  -->  00:06:04.620
We can place them down, and
we can't place over the top of each other.
125

125

00:06:04.620  -->  00:06:07.220
Good, that's still working,
haven't broken that.
126

126

00:06:07.220  -->  00:06:11.580
Now when my spawners do what spawners do,
everyone's throwing it, yep,
127

127

00:06:11.580  -->  00:06:12.890
from their forward hand.
128

128

00:06:12.890  -->  00:06:15.150
Okay, cool.
There's two other things I wanna do in my
129

129

00:06:15.150  -->  00:06:17.987
tidy-up video here,
is I wanna find my pre-fabs folder, and
130

130

00:06:17.987  -->  00:06:19.500
just organize this a little bit.
131

131

00:06:19.500  -->  00:06:21.041
It's starting to get a little bit full.
132

132

00:06:21.041  -->  00:06:22.222
I'm gonna create a couple of folders.
133

133

00:06:22.222  -->  00:06:27.540
I'm gonna create a folder for
attackers, a folder for Defenders,
134

134

00:06:28.570  -->  00:06:32.770
Defenders, and a folder for Projectiles.
135

135

00:06:34.550  -->  00:06:38.950
Projectiles, and
just shove things in the right place.
136

136

00:06:38.950  -->  00:06:43.390
Cactus is a defender,
Lizard is a attacker.
137

137

00:06:45.110  -->  00:06:46.950
Trophy is a defender.
138

138

00:06:46.950  -->  00:06:48.320
Zucchini is a projectile.
139

139

00:06:48.320  -->  00:06:48.950
And you know what?
140

140

00:06:48.950  -->  00:06:52.030
I'll make one more prefab folder, now, I'm
looking at what I've got left over here,
141

141

00:06:52.030  -->  00:06:55.550
which will be core game type stuff,
so Core Game.
142

142

00:06:55.550  -->  00:06:59.410
And that will be the canvas,
game camera, level loader, and spawner.
143

143

00:06:59.410  -->  00:07:00.810
Drag them into Core Game.
144

144

00:07:00.810  -->  00:07:02.750
Okay, that's a little bit tidier now.
145

145

00:07:02.750  -->  00:07:07.220
And the other thing I wanna do in this
video, is to make a different projectile.
146

146

00:07:07.220  -->  00:07:10.190
So here's another good chance for
you to take this on as a quick challenge.
147

147

00:07:10.190  -->  00:07:14.800
Maybe do this as I'm doing it, see if
you can beat me to creating your axe.
148

148

00:07:14.800  -->  00:07:17.030
I know there's some
competitive folks out there.
149

149

00:07:17.030  -->  00:07:18.460
This will be a good challenge.
150

150

00:07:18.460  -->  00:07:19.040
I said axe,
151

151

00:07:19.040  -->  00:07:22.320
I've given away a hint of what it is
that I'm gonna make as my projectile.
152

152

00:07:22.320  -->  00:07:23.630
I am gonna make an axe.
153

153

00:07:23.630  -->  00:07:26.960
So new game object, create empty.
154

154

00:07:26.960  -->  00:07:28.350
We will call this Axe.
155

155

00:07:28.350  -->  00:07:32.340
I'm gonna make our axe rotate as well,
I believe.
156

156

00:07:32.340  -->  00:07:37.440
And while I'm here, I'll write click
Create Empty, and I will call this body.
157

157

00:07:37.440  -->  00:07:39.680
So we have an empty child.
158

158

00:07:39.680  -->  00:07:40.660
On axe, what do we need?
159

159

00:07:40.660  -->  00:07:43.500
Well, we need the projectile script,
cuz it is a projectile.
160

160

00:07:43.500  -->  00:07:47.100
While I'm here, I'm gonna change the speed
to 2, cuz I know it needs to go a little
161

161

00:07:47.100  -->  00:07:49.720
bit quicker, and then, so
we can see it, we'll click on Body.
162

162

00:07:49.720  -->  00:07:52.820
This is where we want to
add our sprite renderer.
163

163

00:07:52.820  -->  00:07:55.100
Sprite renderer,
I'll have order in layer 6.
164

164

00:07:55.100  -->  00:07:58.130
The sprite I will choose by
clicking on the selector button,
165

165

00:07:58.130  -->  00:07:59.360
is the axe that I've got.
166

166

00:07:59.360  -->  00:08:00.670
You should have that, as well.
167

167

00:08:00.670  -->  00:08:05.804
Now, cuz we've chosen the axe, I need to
go to my not in use folder, find the axe
168

168

00:08:05.804  -->  00:08:10.652
and drag it into, I don't have a folder
for it yet, yeah, so right click.
169

169

00:08:10.652  -->  00:08:14.002
Create &gt; Folder, this is gonna be,
giving away the content of the next video,
170

170

00:08:14.002  -->  00:08:15.250
it's gonna be the Gnome.
171

171

00:08:15.250  -->  00:08:18.570
So we're making ourselves a Gnome
defender in the next video.
172

172

00:08:18.570  -->  00:08:22.070
So the not in use, grab the axe,
drag it into the Gnome folder.
173

173

00:08:22.070  -->  00:08:23.930
So we know the Gnome belongs to the axe,
or
174

174

00:08:23.930  -->  00:08:26.280
we could have it in a projectiles folder,
up to you.
175

175

00:08:26.280  -->  00:08:28.770
Now, we've got our sprite renderer,
great axe.
176

176

00:08:28.770  -->  00:08:30.100
What do we need to do on here next?
177

177

00:08:30.100  -->  00:08:35.459
Well, we need to add ourselves
an Animator, Animator.
178

178

00:08:35.459  -->  00:08:37.820
Now, I'm gonna do it this
slightly quicker way.
179

179

00:08:37.820  -->  00:08:41.420
So while clicking on the axe,
I'm gonna find the animation window,
180

180

00:08:41.420  -->  00:08:46.050
click Create, and in here,
find my Assets, Animations.
181

181

00:08:46.050  -->  00:08:52.070
This will be Defenders, and
we will call this Axe, what is it?
182

182

00:08:52.070  -->  00:08:58.390
Axe Throw, Axe Rotation, we'll call
it Axe Throw, and then, save that up.
183

183

00:08:58.390  -->  00:09:01.062
Okay, and by doing that,
it's created an animator, and
184

184

00:09:01.062  -->  00:09:03.091
it's created an axe animator controller.
185

185

00:09:03.091  -->  00:09:08.082
All very handy, but it's place them in my,
let's make sure it's in the right folder,
186

186

00:09:08.082  -->  00:09:08.970
in Defenders.
187

187

00:09:08.970  -->  00:09:11.490
There we go, it's in exactly the right
folder where it should be, great.
188

188

00:09:13.350  -->  00:09:15.120
Now I'm gonna click on
the body of the axe.
189

189

00:09:15.120  -->  00:09:17.450
Remember, don't do it on the Parent level,
but on the Body level.
190

190

00:09:17.450  -->  00:09:19.360
That's what we wanna have rotating.
191

191

00:09:19.360  -->  00:09:22.575
We can do Add Property and
surf down through Body,
192

192

00:09:22.575  -->  00:09:26.640
Transform, Rotation, click + there.
193

193

00:09:26.640  -->  00:09:28.140
Okay, we've got our two frames in.
194

194

00:09:28.140  -->  00:09:32.910
I'm gonna click the record button,
drag the slider down to the 1 second mark,
195

195

00:09:32.910  -->  00:09:39.070
change my rotation to minus 359, just
about completing a complete revolution.
196

196

00:09:39.070  -->  00:09:42.390
Unclick Record, just scrub it,
make sure it looks pretty good.
197

197

00:09:42.390  -->  00:09:47.050
Great, now, if I click on Play,
it hasn't been spawned or
198

198

00:09:47.050  -->  00:09:49.350
thrown, but
it will do what it's supposed to do.
199

199

00:09:49.350  -->  00:09:50.630
Bup Bup, flying on.
200

200

00:09:50.630  -->  00:09:53.100
Now you can see there's a little
bit of a pause at the start and
201

201

00:09:53.100  -->  00:09:54.230
the end of our rotation.
202

202

00:09:54.230  -->  00:09:59.050
If we click on Curves, just give ourselves
a bit more real estate here, shift and
203

203

00:09:59.050  -->  00:10:01.390
mouse wheel, taking forever.
204

204

00:10:03.650  -->  00:10:05.785
Shift and mouse wheel, okay, there we go.
205

205

00:10:05.785  -->  00:10:09.385
You can see that we've got
this nice lovely curved curve,
206

206

00:10:09.385  -->  00:10:14.020
which means that it's going to ramp
into and ramp out of our spin.
207

207

00:10:14.020  -->  00:10:16.530
Which is cool, that might work,
might be what you're after.
208

208

00:10:16.530  -->  00:10:19.580
But I want it to be constantly
spinning at a constant rate.
209

209

00:10:19.580  -->  00:10:24.620
So I'm gonna click Record, again, to make
sure that any changes I do are remembered.
210

210

00:10:24.620  -->  00:10:28.030
Click on the little dot at the very
end of our wave form there,
211

211

00:10:28.030  -->  00:10:31.240
the very end of our curve, and
you can see there's a handle on that.
212

212

00:10:31.240  -->  00:10:33.080
It doesn't get bigger as I zoom in,
sorry about that.
213

213

00:10:33.080  -->  00:10:34.532
You can see there's that little handle.
214

214

00:10:34.532  -->  00:10:36.090
I'm gonna move that, so
215

215

00:10:36.090  -->  00:10:41.150
that it's pointed directly at the other
dot at the start, the other keyframe, and
216

216

00:10:41.150  -->  00:10:45.920
click on the other keyframe, the first
keyframe, find its handle, and drag that,
217

217

00:10:45.920  -->  00:10:51.620
so it's pointed at the last keyframe as
well, so that we have a straight line.
218

218

00:10:51.620  -->  00:10:53.280
Now, unclick Record.
219

219

00:10:53.280  -->  00:10:55.056
Click on Play.
220

220

00:10:55.056  -->  00:10:57.360
Give ourselves back our window.
221

221

00:10:57.360  -->  00:11:01.360
And it should rotate more smoothly as it
flies along a smooth, smooth, smooth.
222

222

00:11:01.360  -->  00:11:02.450
So great, awesome.
223

223

00:11:02.450  -->  00:11:03.520
Now it's going a little bit slow.
224

224

00:11:03.520  -->  00:11:04.600
What can we do about that?
225

225

00:11:04.600  -->  00:11:06.170
Click back on dope sheet.
226

226

00:11:06.170  -->  00:11:10.090
Grab our final frame, and
just bring it halfway in.
227

227

00:11:10.090  -->  00:11:14.040
I think that will mean it does
the same 360 rotation, but
228

228

00:11:14.040  -->  00:11:19.760
it does it in half the amount of frames,
or half the amount of time, we could say.
229

229

00:11:19.760  -->  00:11:21.410
Spinning, spin, spin, spin.
230

230

00:11:21.410  -->  00:11:22.860
Okay, a little of a start or a stop.
231

231

00:11:22.860  -->  00:11:28.068
I think my curves have gone and
recurved themselves,
232

232

00:11:28.068  -->  00:11:32.870
so get that straight again,
little bit of a pain doing it this way.
233

233

00:11:32.870  -->  00:11:36.270
But, look at the control we have over it.
234

234

00:11:36.270  -->  00:11:39.315
Unclick Record, click on Play,
make sure this is all looking good.
235

235

00:11:39.315  -->  00:11:41.575
[SOUND] Looks great.
236

236

00:11:41.575  -->  00:11:46.106
We've got an axe already to have a Gnome,
with which to throw it so that's all for
237

237

00:11:46.106  -->  00:11:47.140
this video.
238

238

00:11:47.140  -->  00:11:48.370
Just a couple of bits and
239

239

00:11:48.370  -->  00:11:52.390
pieces before we do a nice big,
create ourselves a new defender video,
240

240

00:11:52.390  -->  00:11:55.140
which will be coming up next so great
stuff, and I'll see you again shortly.
