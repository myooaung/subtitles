[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,061  -->  00:00:06,930
In this video, we're gonna resolve
two issues that we currently have.
3

3

00:00:06,930  -->  00:00:09,820
Issue number one is that the player
gets stuck on the wall as we run
4

4

00:00:09,820  -->  00:00:11,070
along and jump.
5

5

00:00:11,070  -->  00:00:13,710
You can see, if I'm holding left,
then I get stuck, and
6

6

00:00:13,710  -->  00:00:15,206
slowly drift back down again.
7

7

00:00:15,206  -->  00:00:18,090
The other is, that if I just hit jump,
I can do wall jumps,
8

8

00:00:18,090  -->  00:00:20,320
which you might wanna have
wall jumps in your game.
9

9

00:00:20,320  -->  00:00:22,250
It's not too bad.
10

10

00:00:22,250  -->  00:00:25,470
If it is desired, in my game I don't want
wall jumps, cuz I don't want the player
11

11

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:28,840
accidentally just climbing the whole
way up the side of my wall here.
12

12

00:00:28,840  -->  00:00:31,660
So I'm gonna get rid of
those too in this video.
13

13

00:00:31,660  -->  00:00:36,110
First thing, the problem with our
players getting stuck on the wall is
14

14

00:00:36,110  -->  00:00:40,230
the fact that there's friction on
both the player and on the wall.
15

15

00:00:40,230  -->  00:00:43,740
To address that,
we need to add a physics material.
16

16

00:00:43,740  -->  00:00:46,170
So if we jump over here,
I'm gonna create a new folder,
17

17

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:49,540
material, a folder called Materials.
18

18

00:00:49,540  -->  00:00:53,280
So first of all, Folder,
I'll call this Materials.
19

19

00:00:54,620  -->  00:01:00,790
And then within here, I'm going to
right-click Create a Physics material 2D.
20

20

00:01:00,790  -->  00:01:01,666
Everything's 2D.
21

21

00:01:01,666  -->  00:01:06,610
We will call this Zero Friction.
22

22

00:01:06,610  -->  00:01:10,310
Whenever I hear the word friction,
I think of the song,
23

23

00:01:10,310  -->  00:01:13,001
there's a fraction too much friction.
24

24

00:01:13,001  -->  00:01:14,120
Have you heard that song?
25

25

00:01:14,120  -->  00:01:16,296
Maybe it's just me,
maybe it shows how old I am.
26

26

00:01:16,296  -->  00:01:18,100
[LAUGH] There's a fraction
too much friction.
27

27

00:01:18,100  -->  00:01:19,500
Anyway, I have no idea who sings it.
28

28

00:01:19,500  -->  00:01:21,550
I just, for some reason,
that's what friction is.
29

29

00:01:21,550  -->  00:01:24,080
Okay, so click on the material
that we've created here.
30

30

00:01:24,080  -->  00:01:26,770
You can see friction is 0.4,
put this all the way down to 0.
31

31

00:01:26,770  -->  00:01:30,229
We don't need any bounciness
because they are stone walls, but
32

32

00:01:30,229  -->  00:01:32,250
feel free to play around with that.
33

33

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:36,292
Just a side note, if you want to make a
bouncy thing, so bounce on a mushroom and
34

34

00:01:36,292  -->  00:01:40,213
go boing, put down a mushroom, put
a bounciness on that of greater than 0,
35

35

00:01:40,213  -->  00:01:42,021
maybe 1 or 2 or 10, or 100.
36

36

00:01:42,021  -->  00:01:46,010
And that'll allow your player to go boing
when you bounce on a particular surface.
37

37

00:01:46,010  -->  00:01:47,970
So that's something cool to
play around with, but for now,
38

38

00:01:47,970  -->  00:01:49,390
we're gonna take this material.
39

39

00:01:49,390  -->  00:01:53,572
Go over to the player, find the player's
capsule collider cuz that's the thing that
40

40

00:01:53,572  -->  00:01:55,269
is sticking, not the rigid body.
41

41

00:01:55,269  -->  00:01:57,250
There is a place to put
material on the rigid body, but
42

42

00:01:57,250  -->  00:01:59,291
it's the capsule collider
where you want to put this.
43

43

00:01:59,291  -->  00:02:03,720
That is our sticky point at the moment,
drag that over to material, hit play.
44

44

00:02:03,720  -->  00:02:07,270
Run over to the side of the wall and
we should not be able to hold down and
45

45

00:02:07,270  -->  00:02:08,990
get stuck on the wall.
46

46

00:02:08,990  -->  00:02:10,590
Zoink, there we go, we're slipping.
47

47

00:02:10,590  -->  00:02:11,610
Okay, we're still jumping.
48

48

00:02:11,610  -->  00:02:13,570
We're still doing our big double jump.
49

49

00:02:13,570  -->  00:02:17,652
That's going to be our next challenge and
this is a tournament challenge.
50

50

00:02:17,652  -->  00:02:19,720
I'm gonna ask you to take
this on as a challenge.
51

51

00:02:21,770  -->  00:02:27,460
So you stop the player wall jumping and
the goal here is to prevent the player
52

52

00:02:27,460  -->  00:02:30,490
from doing the multi-jump when they're
touching the wall, and I've got a hint.
53

53

00:02:30,490  -->  00:02:33,620
If you look at that and you're like, piece
of cake, I know what to do or you wanna
54

54

00:02:33,620  -->  00:02:36,830
jump in and figure out, stare at it for
a while, figure it out like a puzzle.
55

55

00:02:36,830  -->  00:02:40,310
If you're the sort of person who plays
puzzle games and you like puzzle games,
56

56

00:02:40,310  -->  00:02:42,490
then this is a really cool
puzzle to work through.
57

57

00:02:42,490  -->  00:02:44,660
If you want a hint,
I'm about to show you the hint now.
58

58

00:02:44,660  -->  00:02:50,380
And the hint is, add a second collider
to represent the player's feet.
59

59

00:02:50,380  -->  00:02:54,202
Make sure that that collider is
positioned in a way that it is only doing
60

60

00:02:54,202  -->  00:02:55,540
feet-related things.
61

61

00:02:55,540  -->  00:02:57,502
And then in our player script,
62

62

00:02:57,502  -->  00:03:02,184
we need to make a distinction between
the feet and the regular colliders.
63

63

00:03:02,184  -->  00:03:06,710
There's a hint for you, and if you wanna
jump in and take that on now, fantastic.
64

64

00:03:06,710  -->  00:03:09,928
If you have any problems, I will see you
back here when you've had a go at it, and
65

65

00:03:09,928  -->  00:03:11,237
we'll go through my solution.
66

66

00:03:14,630  -->  00:03:19,049
Okay, for my solution, I am going to
scroll right in here onto the player,
67

67

00:03:19,049  -->  00:03:21,560
I'm going to add a new component.
68

68

00:03:21,560  -->  00:03:23,560
That new component is gonna be a collider.
69

69

00:03:23,560  -->  00:03:25,950
I'll make it a box collider 2D.
70

70

00:03:25,950  -->  00:03:27,387
Presently, we have a capsule collider 2D.
71

71

00:03:27,387  -->  00:03:31,420
You can see that it opens up with
our big box around the player here.
72

72

00:03:31,420  -->  00:03:35,110
I'm gonna click on the Edit Collider,
drag this in,
73

73

00:03:35,110  -->  00:03:39,630
if I click on the Edit Collider
properly in here, Edit Collider.
74

74

00:03:39,630  -->  00:03:41,370
One more time, Edit Collider.
75

75

00:03:41,370  -->  00:03:45,910
And when I click on the green lines,
there we go, I can move it in.
76

76

00:03:45,910  -->  00:03:50,670
Now, I need to make sure that
the feet are inside the capsule.
77

77

00:03:50,670  -->  00:03:53,081
So that when the player comes
up to the wall, obviously,
78

78

00:03:53,081  -->  00:03:56,360
this is a bit more extreme here, that
the wall is touching the capsule first.
79

79

00:03:56,360  -->  00:04:00,020
The capsule is saying the player collides,
and stops and can't go any further, and
80

80

00:04:00,020  -->  00:04:03,330
it is the feet that says,
am I touching the ground or not?
81

81

00:04:03,330  -->  00:04:06,060
Because the problem is,
that this is the ground, but
82

82

00:04:06,060  -->  00:04:09,530
the wall is also the ground as we've
got it set up in our tile map here.
83

83

00:04:09,530  -->  00:04:10,710
It's a foreground.
84

84

00:04:10,710  -->  00:04:13,580
So anything that's foreground,
the player can touch.
85

85

00:04:13,580  -->  00:04:16,639
I'm gonna make, actually make
the capsule collider a little bit wider.
86

86

00:04:16,639  -->  00:04:20,010
Make this a little bit easier, there
we go, a bit wider around the player.
87

87

00:04:21,190  -->  00:04:24,710
I find this as an easier way to edit than
going into the offsets and size and stuff.
88

88

00:04:24,710  -->  00:04:27,157
You can do it either way.
You can play around with these,
89

89

00:04:27,157  -->  00:04:30,130
moving it left and right,
that does both sides.
90

90

00:04:30,130  -->  00:04:32,710
Or you can grab the individual side and
play around with it.
91

91

00:04:32,710  -->  00:04:37,130
Okay, back to our box collider, need to
bring this down a little bit to here, so
92

92

00:04:37,130  -->  00:04:39,830
it's just fit, a little bit wider.
93

93

00:04:39,830  -->  00:04:43,350
We don't want our player accidentally
not being able to get themselves
94

94

00:04:43,350  -->  00:04:44,600
off of platforms.
95

95

00:04:45,710  -->  00:04:47,260
Okay, it's looking pretty good,
there we go.
96

96

00:04:47,260  -->  00:04:49,893
Like I said before,
if you wanna keep the wall jumping, cool,
97

97

00:04:49,893  -->  00:04:53,870
then just make sure you're doing it with
the intention of it being wall jump.
98

98

00:04:53,870  -->  00:04:55,360
Otherwise, you'll get in a bit of bother.
99

99

00:04:55,360  -->  00:04:56,410
So we've got that in there.
100

100

00:04:56,410  -->  00:04:59,550
Next thing we need to do is
jump into our player script.
101

101

00:04:59,550  -->  00:05:04,583
And you can see that in our player
script here, we have the collider 2D.
102

102

00:05:04,583  -->  00:05:08,780
And the collider 2D is a broad
way of saying, any collider,
103

103

00:05:08,780  -->  00:05:12,260
2D collider type that
we have on our player.
104

104

00:05:12,260  -->  00:05:13,870
But we can get the component,
105

105

00:05:13,870  -->  00:05:15,900
we can get any of these components so
it's really cool.
106

106

00:05:15,900  -->  00:05:20,727
We can get the individual capsule collider
2D, or we can get the box collider 2D.
107

107

00:05:20,727  -->  00:05:24,200
So what I'm going to do in here,
is I'm going to leave the collider 2D.
108

108

00:05:24,200  -->  00:05:27,021
So I'm going to leave myCollider2D.
109

109

00:05:27,021  -->  00:05:33,420
It's just a holistic myCollider, that will
be used for bumping into walls and stuff.
110

110

00:05:33,420  -->  00:05:37,509
And later on, we'll probably use that for
whether the player has hit an enemy or
111

111

00:05:37,509  -->  00:05:39,841
needs to die, or
any of those kind of things.
112

112

00:05:39,841  -->  00:05:44,981
So we need to keep that collider in
there and I'm going to change the type
113

113

00:05:44,981  -->  00:05:49,776
though to, let's see,
it's going to be a capsule collider 2D,
114

114

00:05:49,776  -->  00:05:54,790
and then we'll call this myBodyCollider,
I think we'll call it.
115

115

00:05:54,790  -->  00:06:00,843
We'll do a control RR and
we'll call this myBodyCollider.
116

116

00:06:00,843  -->  00:06:04,194
I don't think I need the 2D and
then I just got myBodyCollider,
117

117

00:06:04,194  -->  00:06:06,440
and that's of capsule collider type 2D.
118

118

00:06:06,440  -->  00:06:09,277
And you can see that's changed it
down in here, which is excellent.
119

119

00:06:09,277  -->  00:06:15,760
I need a change in our GetComponent as
well to CapsuleCollider2D, excellent.
120

120

00:06:15,760  -->  00:06:18,557
And then, we need to add one more,
121

121

00:06:18,557  -->  00:06:24,169
which will be our type BoxCollider2D,
and I'll call this myFeet.
122

122

00:06:24,169  -->  00:06:26,244
And then it's the myFeet
we're mostly interest in.
123

123

00:06:26,244  -->  00:06:31,790
You're gonna copy myFeet here, and first
of all, I need to say what my feet is.
124

124

00:06:31,790  -->  00:06:34,530
So myFeet, [LAUGH] Sounds funny,
doesn't it?
125

125

00:06:34,530  -->  00:06:35,640
My feet, what are my feet?
126

126

00:06:35,640  -->  00:06:40,290
Well, my feet are GetComponent
of type BoxCollider2D.
127

127

00:06:41,790  -->  00:06:43,100
There we go.
128

128

00:06:43,100  -->  00:06:47,801
And then, if we jump down to the two
areas, we're using this at the moment,
129

129

00:06:47,801  -->  00:06:52,075
is in Jump and in ClimbLadder, and
we wish to change the myCollider.
130

130

00:06:52,075  -->  00:06:55,924
So instead of it being myCollider,
we now need this to be myFeet, so
131

131

00:06:55,924  -->  00:07:00,130
if myFeet are touching the ClimbLadder,
then we're able to climb.
132

132

00:07:00,130  -->  00:07:05,240
And also in the Jump,
if myFeet touching the layers,
133

133

00:07:05,240  -->  00:07:06,980
then it's all cool,
I should be able to jump.
134

134

00:07:06,980  -->  00:07:09,210
So we'll save that,
I think that's all right.
135

135

00:07:09,210  -->  00:07:10,980
I don't think I've missed
anything in there.
136

136

00:07:10,980  -->  00:07:11,668
Jump back in here.
137

137

00:07:11,668  -->  00:07:13,041
We now have this overall collider,
138

138

00:07:13,041  -->  00:07:15,939
which doesn't have any functionality
at the moment but we will need that.
139

139

00:07:15,939  -->  00:07:18,350
And we do need it for
when you're bumping into the walls.
140

140

00:07:18,350  -->  00:07:21,760
And we have our feet, that is what we are
using to determine whether I'm touching
141

141

00:07:21,760  -->  00:07:25,140
a ladder or touching, so I can jump, cool.
142

142

00:07:25,140  -->  00:07:25,800
Can I double jump?
143

143

00:07:25,800  -->  00:07:27,340
No, can I do wall jumps?
144

144

00:07:27,340  -->  00:07:28,350
No, I cannot.
145

145

00:07:28,350  -->  00:07:30,310
And last check, can I climb the ladder?
146

146

00:07:30,310  -->  00:07:31,890
Yes, I can, fantastic.
147

147

00:07:31,890  -->  00:07:36,104
Okay, so then we've shifted our mechanism
so that our player doesn't have those
148

148

00:07:36,104  -->  00:07:40,378
nasty behaviors that we didn't want by
adding this extra, as our camera zooms in,
149

149

00:07:40,378  -->  00:07:42,930
thanks camera, by adding a feet collider.
150

150

00:07:42,930  -->  00:07:47,586
We could've childed underneath player,
we could add child game objective and
151

151

00:07:47,586  -->  00:07:48,637
put feet on that.
152

152

00:07:48,637  -->  00:07:51,302
I just find this is more
of a clean way to do it,
153

153

00:07:51,302  -->  00:07:54,401
given that they're different
types of colliders.
154

154

00:07:54,401  -->  00:07:57,695
We know that this box collider is
the body, and we know that the,
155

155

00:07:57,695  -->  00:08:01,900
sorry, the box collider is feet, and
that the capsule collider is the body.
156

156

00:08:01,900  -->  00:08:02,970
So great work, well done.
157

157

00:08:02,970  -->  00:08:04,430
I hope you had success on that challenge.
158

158

00:08:04,430  -->  00:08:07,390
If you implemented it a different way,
fantastic, good work.
159

159

00:08:07,390  -->  00:08:11,188
There's plenty of ways to skin a cat, so
if it works for you, then that is great.
160

160

00:08:11,188  -->  00:08:14,248
Run with it, otherwise, feel free
to implement it the way I've done,
161

161

00:08:14,248  -->  00:08:15,940
and I will see you in an upcoming video.
