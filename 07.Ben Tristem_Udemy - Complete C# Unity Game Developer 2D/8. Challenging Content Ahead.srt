00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,980
Hello again.
1

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,460
I've created this as a special video to let you know that there's some challenging content coming in
2

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,580
the next couple of videos.
3

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,420
We find people for the next couple of years a little bit more challenging than we have been doing.
4

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,780
And that's because we're introducing some new concepts.
5

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,750
When you find new concepts it might not make sense just yet but I wouldn't want you to know is that
6

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,470
as you go through this course we go over those concepts over and over and over.
7

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,270
By the time you've finished the course it will all make sense and we'll all fit together even if the
8

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,120
first time you see something doesn't quite click in your mind.
9

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,890
So keep going and don't give up.
10

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,870
Make sure you watch all of the videos through there's often an answer to a question in the very next
11

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,460
video.
12

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,960
But if you have a question at the time throw them in the question section or on our forum and have a
13

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,430
look through the existing questions against this lecture because there's a very good chance someone's
14

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,770
asked it already and there's a really good answer from one of our teaching assistants or myself already
15

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,100
for that question and to get you prepared for the next couple of lectures.
16

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,220
I want to go through a couple of points to give you a little bit of theory in this lecture.
17

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,710
Just so you've got a little bit more knowledge before you get in there and we actually do it in the
18

19
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,220
code.
19

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,960
So I've got my little scribble a pencil here.
20

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,800
What I want to talk about first of all is just once again to remind you about variables and methods
21

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,370
so variable is a container.
22

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
It's like a box.
23

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,150
It's where we store things and you'll see in the next video we start talking about a variable which
24

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,720
is our starting state and also a variable which we just call state.
25

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,360
What state are we in it might be we're in the first part of our story the second part of our story where
26

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,760
at the end of our story.
27

28
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,220
So we're using the word state to say where are you in our story.
28

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,890
So at this point in time we might be defining the state as we'll call it B State B.
29

30
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,020
B might be you're standing in a corridor and it's very windy.
30

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:57,160
That's State B and we have all of the explanation we have all the the words story now scripted all objects
31

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:05,780
and any point in time we might say Well I it's no longer state B state now equals state C.
32

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,200
And by doing that we can update what state wearing because we just want to be in one state at a time
33

34
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,350
and when we stop we need to say what's the starting state so that our program knows where do we start
34

35
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,650
from.
35

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:25,000
So we would create a variable which we will call starting state and then at some point we're going to
36

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,530
say state equals starting state and that's a way of saying here is starting state that we're going to
37

38
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,660
define somewhere.
38

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,120
This is our very first thing very first thing we want to do we know what that is.
39

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,160
There it is right there.
40

41
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,120
And at some point we're going to say the state we're in now the variable that we're calling state that
41

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,990
we're keeping track of where we are right now.
42

43
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,510
It's going to equal standing state and what's dotting state well it's that thing we told it.
43

44
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,900
This is the starting state.
44

45
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,220
So I'll talk about this more detail in the next lecture but I just wanted to remind you about variables.
45

46
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:01,000
It's just a way of keeping track of what the value is at the moment or what the reference is at the
46

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,680
moment.
47

48
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,640
In other words what are we referring to.
48

49
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,680
So delete that.
49

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,540
And then the other main thing that we use a lot throughout all our scripts is a method or otherwise
50

51
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,160
known as a function.
51

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,540
Now I want to give you a quick analogy here so that you understand a little bit more a couple of concepts
52

53
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,380
to do with method.
53

54
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,340
So say we've got two people we've got one guy here very handsome we'll call him Rick for example and
54

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,370
another guy here not quite as handsome he's OK we'll call him on an Aubyn for example and we have a
55

56
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,690
situation where Rick is going to ask Ben to do something.
56

57
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:42,700
And in this instance we're using Rick to represent a method coal or a method that's got a list of actions
57

58
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,770
in it or code in it.
58

59
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:52,120
And Rick is going to say for example Ben please turn on the TV.
59

60
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:58,370
So our method might be called simply turn on TV or in the seas.
60

61
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,590
Now we have our curly braces and in there we have the action that it takes.
61

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,130
Maybe there's some code.
62

63
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,990
This is my commenting out my pseudo code in here.
63

64
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,880
It's something to do with how to go and switch on the TV.
64

65
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,730
So that's a method and I'm using that comparing it back to analogy in real life.
65

66
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,270
It's someone saying turn on the TV.
66

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,670
That's an action to do something for me please.
67

68
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,720
That's our method.
68

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,480
Now we have a concept as well.
69

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,970
We use a different color for this because it's important returning return so we can return a value.
70

71
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,670
What does that mean.
71

72
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,570
Well when we call the method.
72

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,390
So when Rick says Ben please turn on the TV.
73

74
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,600
That's the action.
74

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,220
Then we can return something so Ben can give something back to Rick.
75

76
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,540
So when we call our method in this case it's Rick saying Ben please turn on the TV.
76

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,270
You can ask for some information back from Ben and that's the return.
77

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,520
So he might say hey Ben turn on the TV and let me know what the football score is at the moment.
78

79
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,680
That's going to return something back to Rick.
79

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,620
So Rick's asking Ben turn on the TV and then Ben is returning back to Rick.
80

81
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,120
The score might be five to two.
81

82
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,260
And so our method.
82

83
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,330
Turn on TV can also have a structure for saying how do I give that back.
83

84
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,730
What sort of information do I want to get back what type of information do I want it to be an integer
84

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,730
like a five is an integer.
85

86
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,160
So I wanted to be a string.
86

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,740
For example a sentence.
87

88
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,660
So we have a way of asking back that's returning back and in the next couple of lectures we're going
88

89
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,950
to be asking a string to return because we want all of the words back.
89

90
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,520
We want our story to come back.
90

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,680
So when our method is saying do this particular thing.
91

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,060
And by the way give me back what the story should be.
92

93
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,310
That's the flow of information and then the final concept I'll give to you.
93

94
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,500
Now before we get into this and do these in the lectures just very quickly is the notion of public versus
94

95
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,010
private.
95

96
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,220
I talked about this a lot more in the next lecture.
96

97
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,500
The main thing to know here at the very high level is if something is a private method.
97

98
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,640
So it's all about methods here at the moment things a private method that only the things that are near
98

99
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,950
it or within the same script same class can call that method.
99

100
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:17,210
So using my reconvene example here if Ben and Rick are in the same room then if Rick calls a private
100

101
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,800
method then we'll hear it.
101

102
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,670
It's all cool.
102

103
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,210
However if Rick and Ben are in different rooms and Rick calls a private method then Ben won't hear it
103

104
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,570
or won't be out to do that.
104

105
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,660
I would need to make it a public method.
105

106
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,060
I need to be out to pick up a megaphone and yell it across the entire house so he can hear it from whatever
106

107
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,690
room he's in.
107

108
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,790
That's a real simplification of that analogy but it's a way of getting you thinking about the fact that
108

109
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:48,860
private can only be done in the same script or the same area of the code and public can be done across
109

110
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,510
all of our project anywhere in the project.
110

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,790
OK.
111

112
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,310
That's just a quick rundown of some of the concepts we're going to be covering in the next video.
112

113
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,850
We're going to go through them again I'm going to explain them again hopefully to hear them explain
113

114
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,370
two or three different ways.
114

115
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,590
It will really help you out to have it stick if it doesn't stick.
115

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,300
Don't worry about it.
116

117
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,350
It will make sense as things go along.
117

118
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,310
Just follow along as best you can ask questions and keep pushing through the course.
118

119
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,630
I'll see you the next video.
