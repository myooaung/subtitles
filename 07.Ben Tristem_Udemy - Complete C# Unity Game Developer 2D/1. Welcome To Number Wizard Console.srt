Hi, Unity students,
welcome to section two.
2

2

00:00:06,370  -->  00:00:08,820
Rick is gonna be shipping
into this section from now
3

3

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:10,000
on a pretty much daily basis.
4

4

00:00:10,000  -->  00:00:12,500
Rick, what are your plans for
producing Number Wizard Console and
5

5

00:00:12,500  -->  00:00:14,010
what's it all about?
6

6

00:00:14,010  -->  00:00:16,920
&gt;&gt; We're following the original
Number Wizard Console pretty closely, so
7

7

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:20,940
this is great for
people who are completely new to C#.
8

8

00:00:20,940  -->  00:00:23,500
We're gonna be jumping in
right at what's a variable?
9

9

00:00:23,500  -->  00:00:25,020
How do you write a method?
10

10

00:00:25,020  -->  00:00:28,500
In the previous section,
we very quickly wrote print Hello World.
11

11

00:00:28,500  -->  00:00:29,740
Why do we need a semicolon?
12

12

00:00:29,740  -->  00:00:30,600
What's a statement?
13

13

00:00:30,600  -->  00:00:33,530
So all that really foundational stuff
we'll be doing in this section.
14

14

00:00:33,530  -->  00:00:36,640
And at the end, we'll be producing
just a simple little game that'll
15

15

00:00:36,640  -->  00:00:39,360
allow us to flex out coding muscles.
16

16

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:42,910
So I've reviewed the code that Rick is
heading towards, and we've basically kept
17

17

00:00:42,910  -->  00:00:47,080
it as Rick says exactly the same as
the classic version of this course because
18

18

00:00:47,080  -->  00:00:49,800
literally hundreds of thousands of
students have been through that.
19

19

00:00:49,800  -->  00:00:52,360
And apart from a little bug I
left in the original version
20

20

00:00:52,360  -->  00:00:54,110
this is gonna be pretty much identical.
21

21

00:00:54,110  -->  00:00:58,200
I did consider making it into something
much more grand and intelligent and wise,
22

22

00:00:58,200  -->  00:01:01,470
but frankly,
it's right where it is it's perfect for
23

23

00:01:01,470  -->  00:01:04,900
right where you are in your learning
journey so that's what we're going for.
24

24

00:01:04,900  -->  00:01:06,140
So I hope you enjoy
this section with Rick.
25

25

00:01:06,140  -->  00:01:09,414
Any other parting words of wisdom for
them Rick?
26

26

00:01:09,414  -->  00:01:12,205
&gt;&gt; Yep, yes, is someone's already
pretty familiar with C# then
27

27

00:01:12,205  -->  00:01:14,994
you might want to watch through
these videos at two time speed and
28

28

00:01:14,994  -->  00:01:18,407
if you find yourself covering stuff that
you already know really well then feel
29

29

00:01:18,407  -->  00:01:20,610
free to skip this and
go to the next section.
30

30

00:01:20,610  -->  00:01:23,930
But, you're new to coding dive
right in now, take your time,
31

31

00:01:23,930  -->  00:01:28,970
do the challenges and enjoy the fact that
you're really expanding your knowledge.
32

32

00:01:28,970  -->  00:01:32,567
&gt;&gt; And I should say that the more advanced
people this section is specifically
33

33

00:01:32,567  -->  00:01:34,859
designed to not cover very
much at all of Unity.
34

34

00:01:34,859  -->  00:01:39,110
It is focused on basic C# just
to reinforce Rick's point there.
35

35

00:01:39,110  -->  00:01:39,940
&gt;&gt; Yep.
36

36

00:01:39,940  -->  00:01:41,140
Great, let's jump in and get started.
