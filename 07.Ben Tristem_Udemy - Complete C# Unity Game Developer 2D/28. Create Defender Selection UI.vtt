2

00:00:04.114  -->  00:00:04.803
In this video,
3

3

00:00:04.803  -->  00:00:08.142
we're implementing some UI where we
have our grayed out defender images.
4

4

00:00:08.142  -->  00:00:11.117
When we click on an image,
it changes that image to be selected.
5

5

00:00:11.117  -->  00:00:15.043
So that we're giving the player visual
feedback on what they can then place into
6

6

00:00:15.043  -->  00:00:15.637
the scene.
7

7

00:00:15.637  -->  00:00:17.371
So let's jump in and get started.
8

8

00:00:17.371  -->  00:00:21.749
Okay, we have a Cactus and we have
a Trophy, both of which are defenders.
9

9

00:00:21.749  -->  00:00:23.795
Let's make ourselves some UI now.
10

10

00:00:23.795  -->  00:00:27.285
So jump over into the hierarchy,
right-click, Create Empty.
11

11

00:00:27.285  -->  00:00:32.292
We'll call this Buttons,
I think is clear enough, Buttons.
12

12

00:00:32.292  -->  00:00:36.568
And then within Buttons we need to have,
well, because this is in screen space now,
13

13

00:00:36.568  -->  00:00:38.446
it's in world space, I should say.
14

14

00:00:38.446  -->  00:00:39.318
Sorry, world space.
15

15

00:00:39.318  -->  00:00:42.936
So we know here's one, and
there's seven along our x-axis.
16

16

00:00:42.936  -->  00:00:46.762
I'm gonna create a quad
instead of doing a sprite, and
17

17

00:00:46.762  -->  00:00:51.265
that will allow us to easily
position it within our world space.
18

18

00:00:51.265  -->  00:00:55.448
So I right-click on Buttons,
create 3D Object, and then find a Quad,
19

19

00:00:55.448  -->  00:00:57.035
which is just a flat shape.
20

20

00:00:57.035  -->  00:00:59.695
It's one side of a cube, if you will.
21

21

00:00:59.695  -->  00:01:01.080
I'm gonna drag it down to the bottom.
22

22

00:01:01.080  -->  00:01:02.874
It's okay if it overlaps down the bottom.
23

23

00:01:02.874  -->  00:01:06.583
But I wanna make sure that it doesn't go
any higher than this line along here,
24

24

00:01:06.583  -->  00:01:08.942
cuz that's gonna be
the bottom of my play space.
25

25

00:01:08.942  -->  00:01:11.071
So I'll pop it down in the bottom left.
26

26

00:01:11.071  -->  00:01:13.239
And what size do we want here?
27

27

00:01:13.239  -->  00:01:16.528
Let's see, Scale,
I'm gonna increase it up.
28

28

00:01:16.528  -->  00:01:17.958
I want it to go most of the way across.
29

29

00:01:17.958  -->  00:01:20.213
So we're gonna have a whole bunch
of buttons to select our UI.
30

30

00:01:20.213  -->  00:01:25.042
So let's just see how wide we want
it to go, probably all nine squares.
31

31

00:01:25.042  -->  00:01:26.538
So make it 9.
32

32

00:01:26.538  -->  00:01:31.796
It's gonna be our background, so
I'll rename it from Quad to Background,
33

33

00:01:31.796  -->  00:01:34.682
and line it up a little bit more nicelier.
34

34

00:01:34.682  -->  00:01:36.226
A little bit more nicelier,
is that a word?
35

35

00:01:36.226  -->  00:01:40.072
I think that's 0.5, no,
that's the wrong way.
36

36

00:01:40.072  -->  00:01:43.267
-0.5, there we go,
it's looking pretty close.
37

37

00:01:43.267  -->  00:01:46.169
A little bit off, but
I don't wanna finesse for it too long.
38

38

00:01:46.169  -->  00:01:48.585
There we go, -0.44.
39

39

00:01:48.585  -->  00:01:52.313
And -3 on the y, looking good.
40

40

00:01:52.313  -->  00:01:57.536
Okay, now let's change the color of
it by finding or adding a material.
41

41

00:01:57.536  -->  00:01:58.792
We have the default material here.
42

42

00:01:58.792  -->  00:02:00.647
We wanna go and add a new material.
43

43

00:02:00.647  -->  00:02:04.941
So let's go and create in our Assets
folder, right-click, Create, a new Folder.
44

44

00:02:04.941  -->  00:02:07.038
We will call it Materials.
45

45

00:02:07.038  -->  00:02:10.813
A material is something that we can
place over the top of this object here.
46

46

00:02:10.813  -->  00:02:15.721
Which we've done in other sections of
the course, so it should all be nice and
47

47

00:02:15.721  -->  00:02:16.637
easy for you.
48

48

00:02:16.637  -->  00:02:19.885
Right-click, and then Create a Material,
if we can find it.
49

49

00:02:19.885  -->  00:02:22.058
There it is, Material.
50

50

00:02:22.058  -->  00:02:24.103
And we'll call this Button Material.
51

51

00:02:24.103  -->  00:02:29.675
Just to be clear, you can call it whatever
your heart desires, Button Material.
52

52

00:02:29.675  -->  00:02:31.788
And then we'll change the color.
53

53

00:02:31.788  -->  00:02:36.665
Actually, first of all,
I'll drag it on top of my background here.
54

54

00:02:36.665  -->  00:02:40.904
Now when I change the color,
it should update in real time.
55

55

00:02:40.904  -->  00:02:44.878
What color should we have it,
a bluey kinda color?
56

56

00:02:44.878  -->  00:02:47.259
[SOUND] Yeah, we'll do it, a purple?
57

57

00:02:47.259  -->  00:02:48.098
I don't know.
58

58

00:02:48.098  -->  00:02:50.756
I hate to say it, I don't know about you,
but I often take hours.
59

59

00:02:50.756  -->  00:02:51.764
Is that color a good color?
60

60

00:02:51.764  -->  00:02:53.189
What about that color?
61

61

00:02:53.189  -->  00:02:57.773
And then let's reduce
the transparency a whole bunch.
62

62

00:02:57.773  -->  00:03:01.479
And we need to change the rendering
mode from Opaque to Transparent, so
63

63

00:03:01.479  -->  00:03:03.910
that transparency
actually will take place.
64

64

00:03:03.910  -->  00:03:07.969
Okay, it's in sort of a purple-y
gray kind of thing, which is fine.
65

65

00:03:07.969  -->  00:03:12.534
It bugs me a little bit that it's hanging
over the bottom of our play space, so
66

66

00:03:12.534  -->  00:03:14.302
I am gonna go and tidy that up.
67

67

00:03:14.302  -->  00:03:18.980
You don't have to, just to make the scale
on the y-axis a little bit tighter.
68

68

00:03:18.980  -->  00:03:22.059
[SOUND] And then drag it up a little bit.
69

69

00:03:22.059  -->  00:03:24.512
Okay, that's pretty good.
70

70

00:03:24.512  -->  00:03:26.476
Pretty good, it's still a little bit off,
it's gonna bug me.
71

71

00:03:26.476  -->  00:03:27.667
But that's fine, I'll move on.
72

72

00:03:27.667  -->  00:03:30.380
It's all about, done is better
than perfect, as I often say.
73

73

00:03:30.380  -->  00:03:33.612
So this is done, and
it is definitely better than perfect.
74

74

00:03:33.612  -->  00:03:37.419
Cuz perfect, we often don't get to,
and we spend so much time chasing it.
75

75

00:03:37.419  -->  00:03:38.635
So just remind yourself of that.
76

76

00:03:38.635  -->  00:03:40.789
If it's done, it is done.
77

77

00:03:40.789  -->  00:03:41.589
Done is better than perfect.
78

78

00:03:41.589  -->  00:03:42.518
Now what do we need?
79

79

00:03:42.518  -->  00:03:44.887
Well, we need some buttons
to sit over the top,
80

80

00:03:44.887  -->  00:03:47.210
buttons that represent
our characters here.
81

81

00:03:47.210  -->  00:03:49.901
Now I click on the Sprites,
find our Cactus.
82

82

00:03:49.901  -->  00:03:53.862
And find just any old frame within
here that I think is representative of
83

83

00:03:53.862  -->  00:03:55.519
how our cactus is gonna look.
84

84

00:03:55.519  -->  00:03:56.816
That's a good one.
85

85

00:03:56.816  -->  00:03:59.942
And then from there,
I'm going to drag that one frame,
86

86

00:03:59.942  -->  00:04:02.080
that one image over onto background.
87

87

00:04:02.080  -->  00:04:04.297
And that will create Cactus Idle_29.
88

88

00:04:04.297  -->  00:04:07.784
I'm gonna rename that to just Cactus,
so it's nice and clear.
89

89

00:04:07.784  -->  00:04:10.059
Let's see if we can find where that is.
90

90

00:04:10.059  -->  00:04:12.516
And you can see, it's hiding underneath.
91

91

00:04:12.516  -->  00:04:16.608
So we need to change in our Sprite
Renderer, change the order in layer.
92

92

00:04:16.608  -->  00:04:18.191
We'll make this 7, I think.
93

93

00:04:18.191  -->  00:04:23.196
If you look at our background,
because it's a 3D object, technically, if
94

94

00:04:23.196  -->  00:04:28.366
we click off 2D here, we can see that we
can move our background in and out here.
95

95

00:04:28.366  -->  00:04:29.885
It's a 2D object.
96

96

00:04:29.885  -->  00:04:33.758
We're not seeing the same information we
often do when we have the Sprite Renderer.
97

97

00:04:33.758  -->  00:04:37.148
But I can just bring it, which way
am I going, negative or positive?
98

98

00:04:37.148  -->  00:04:38.668
Yeah, negative.
99

99

00:04:38.668  -->  00:04:43.268
I'll just bring it forward a little bit,
just to make triply sure that it's not
100

100

00:04:43.268  -->  00:04:48.293
accidentally gonna be in line with my
world background in there, so just -0.05.
101

101

00:04:48.293  -->  00:04:49.229
Okay, that's pretty good.
102

102

00:04:49.229  -->  00:04:52.408
Get my Cactus image, click on W.
103

103

00:04:52.408  -->  00:04:55.979
Move it to roughly,
I'll have it the first one along actually.
104

104

00:04:55.979  -->  00:04:57.955
And it's too big, so
I'm gonna scale it down.
105

105

00:04:57.955  -->  00:04:58.898
Okay, click on the Cactus.
106

106

00:04:58.898  -->  00:05:01.055
I'm gonna click on my E tool.
107

107

00:05:01.055  -->  00:05:03.818
Just drag it down a little bit,
make it a bit smaller.
108

108

00:05:03.818  -->  00:05:05.932
Okay, and
just drop it roughly in the middle.
109

109

00:05:05.932  -->  00:05:06.867
Okay, that's pretty good.
110

110

00:05:06.867  -->  00:05:09.187
So I've got a Cactus,
that's where I want it to be.
111

111

00:05:09.187  -->  00:05:10.723
Now I'm gonna go grab my trophy.
112

112

00:05:10.723  -->  00:05:12.459
So let's go and find the Sprites.
113

113

00:05:12.459  -->  00:05:13.827
Where are our Sprites, where in there?
114

114

00:05:13.827  -->  00:05:18.204
Trophy, find a trophy that's
indicative of how our trophy looks.
115

115

00:05:18.204  -->  00:05:20.298
We've got the top and the bottom.
116

116

00:05:20.298  -->  00:05:22.871
You know what, somewhere,
we had our trophy whole.
117

117

00:05:22.871  -->  00:05:25.070
Okay, I'm just gonna go grab trophy whole.
118

118

00:05:25.070  -->  00:05:28.520
And I should drag that into the,
we are using it, so
119

119

00:05:28.520  -->  00:05:32.876
I'll put it into my trophy folder,
to say that we're using it.
120

120

00:05:32.876  -->  00:05:36.891
Now, trophy whole, I'll go and
drag on top of my background.
121

121

00:05:36.891  -->  00:05:41.219
We'll rename it from trophy whole,
to just plain old Trophy.
122

122

00:05:41.219  -->  00:05:46.027
Trophy, okay, change the order to 7
as well, make sure it sits on top.
123

123

00:05:46.027  -->  00:05:48.738
Drag it over and
put it in the second slot there.
124

124

00:05:48.738  -->  00:05:52.096
It's a little bit small, so
I'm gonna make it just a tiny bit bigger.
125

125

00:05:52.096  -->  00:05:53.768
My R tool, did I say R last time?
126

126

00:05:53.768  -->  00:05:55.424
I think I might have said E.
127

127

00:05:55.424  -->  00:05:57.619
I'm not looking at
the keyboard as I type it.
128

128

00:05:57.619  -->  00:05:58.481
I don't know about you.
129

129

00:05:58.481  -->  00:06:01.671
I just tend to bang on QWER until
I find the one that looks right.
130

130

00:06:01.671  -->  00:06:04.718
So I haven't properly learned
in my brain which letter it is,
131

131

00:06:04.718  -->  00:06:06.604
cuz I'm never looking at the letter.
132

132

00:06:06.604  -->  00:06:08.750
I'm just E, yeah, that's rotate.
133

133

00:06:08.750  -->  00:06:09.669
R, okay, that's scales.
134

134

00:06:09.669  -->  00:06:10.780
That's how I kinda do it.
135

135

00:06:10.780  -->  00:06:12.332
Okay, so we've got these two here.
136

136

00:06:12.332  -->  00:06:15.490
Now we need to black them out,
to say when you're not selected,
137

137

00:06:15.490  -->  00:06:19.247
you're just going to be a kinda washed
out color, grayed out, if you will.
138

138

00:06:19.247  -->  00:06:21.357
So grab the gray,
bring it all the way down.
139

139

00:06:21.357  -->  00:06:25.031
So there's still a little bit of
definition, but it looks grayed out.
140

140

00:06:25.031  -->  00:06:28.646
And then I'll do the same for
my Cactus, if I can find Cactus.
141

141

00:06:28.646  -->  00:06:30.196
There you are.
142

142

00:06:30.196  -->  00:06:32.670
And drag this down, down, down, down.
143

143

00:06:32.670  -->  00:06:35.870
If you want, you can highlight
the hexidecimal code here, copy that.
144

144

00:06:35.870  -->  00:06:38.774
And then find your other one.
145

145

00:06:38.774  -->  00:06:41.195
When I say say other one, for
me now, the other one is trophy.
146

146

00:06:41.195  -->  00:06:43.520
Click on Color, and
then you could paste that in there.
147

147

00:06:43.520  -->  00:06:44.446
There we go, and
148

148

00:06:44.446  -->  00:06:48.099
that's how you could do it if you
want to have it exactly the same.
149

149

00:06:48.099  -->  00:06:52.120
So now we've got these two that
are grayed out, looking pretty spiffy.
150

150

00:06:52.120  -->  00:06:55.580
We need to have it so that when we
click on them, they change to white.
151

151

00:06:55.580  -->  00:06:58.591
They change to a color that
we can access and use.
152

152

00:06:58.591  -->  00:07:01.417
And that's where I'm gonna
give you a challenge.
153

153

00:07:01.417  -->  00:07:03.655
So I know you're up to this challenge, and
154

154

00:07:03.655  -->  00:07:06.153
the challenge is to change
the button to white.
155

155

00:07:06.153  -->  00:07:09.189
So we need to add a collider
to each button, remember that?
156

156

00:07:09.189  -->  00:07:11.120
We found that a couple of videos ago.
157

157

00:07:11.120  -->  00:07:14.484
Add a collider, and
then to create a DefenderButton script.
158

158

00:07:14.484  -->  00:07:17.776
And then use onMouseDown( ) to change
the color from black to white.
159

159

00:07:17.776  -->  00:07:20.211
Mostly we're saying change it to white.
160

160

00:07:20.211  -->  00:07:21.305
And I've got a hint for you.
161

161

00:07:21.305  -->  00:07:22.645
If you look at that and you're like,
162

162

00:07:22.645  -->  00:07:24.647
I don't know how to change
the color of things, Rick.
163

163

00:07:24.647  -->  00:07:27.991
If you wanna go search through
the documents and dig into that,
164

164

00:07:27.991  -->  00:07:30.337
solve it like a sleuth,
you can do that now.
165

165

00:07:30.337  -->  00:07:33.836
Otherwise, I'll give you a hint, which is
the very specific line you need to use.
166

166

00:07:33.836  -->  00:07:35.709
So pause the video now
if that's all you need.
167

167

00:07:35.709  -->  00:07:38.592
If you need one last bit of information,
then here it is.
168

168

00:07:38.592  -->  00:07:41.362
Is you can use this line of code,
GetComponent.
169

169

00:07:41.362  -->  00:07:45.942
Remember, we need to get the component,
the SpriteRenderer.color.
170

170

00:07:45.942  -->  00:07:48.918
And to change it, = Color.white.
171

171

00:07:48.918  -->  00:07:52.133
So there's your mission if
you choose to accept it.
172

172

00:07:52.133  -->  00:07:55.066
I'll see you back here
when you've got it done.
173

173

00:07:56.369  -->  00:07:58.682
Okay, so first up,
let's create our colliders.
174

174

00:07:58.682  -->  00:07:59.739
Click on Cactus.
175

175

00:07:59.739  -->  00:08:02.760
Find, or Add Component, not finding it.
176

176

00:08:02.760  -->  00:08:05.949
Collider, we're already halfway,
typed in Box Collider 2D.
177

177

00:08:05.949  -->  00:08:08.758
That's looking pretty good,
it's getting around the outside.
178

178

00:08:08.758  -->  00:08:11.518
We don't wanna accidentally have it
in the play space, that'd be bad.
179

179

00:08:11.518  -->  00:08:13.953
That's okay if it drops down
the bottom a little bit.
180

180

00:08:13.953  -->  00:08:16.740
And we can tidy this up,
I'm gonna do it manually for now.
181

181

00:08:16.740  -->  00:08:18.417
You can get it very precise.
182

182

00:08:18.417  -->  00:08:22.329
I'll leave a little bit of
a gap between the two objects.
183

183

00:08:22.329  -->  00:08:23.901
I think that is fine.
184

184

00:08:23.901  -->  00:08:25.324
Yeah, I think that is cool.
185

185

00:08:25.324  -->  00:08:29.775
Trophy, add a box collider to you,
Box Collider 2D, and drag it out.
186

186

00:08:29.775  -->  00:08:33.193
We can see our underneath,
we can see the line.
187

187

00:08:33.193  -->  00:08:36.444
I'm just flowing down there.
188

188

00:08:36.444  -->  00:08:38.077
Bring it down to the bottom of the screen.
189

189

00:08:38.077  -->  00:08:40.816
Bring it up to nearly
the top of the screen,
190

190

00:08:40.816  -->  00:08:43.259
and you can see what's the size of it.
191

191

00:08:43.259  -->  00:08:45.896
0.84 by 0.71 is pretty
much the size of that.
192

192

00:08:45.896  -->  00:08:48.860
Okay, so
we've got colliders on those two objects.
193

193

00:08:48.860  -->  00:08:50.187
Fantastic, just save all that up.
194

194

00:08:50.187  -->  00:08:52.564
Next up, go into my Scripts folder.
195

195

00:08:52.564  -->  00:08:54.948
Actually, I'm gonna do
this the other way around.
196

196

00:08:54.948  -->  00:08:58.506
I'll show you, if you highlight Trophy and
Cactus &gt; Add Component.
197

197

00:08:58.506  -->  00:09:00.671
And then type in,
what should we call this?
198

198

00:09:00.671  -->  00:09:05.196
Sorry, DefenderButton,
what did I ask you to call it?
199

199

00:09:05.196  -->  00:09:06.511
DefenderButton, yeah.
200

200

00:09:06.511  -->  00:09:07.615
Read your slides, Rick.
201

201

00:09:07.615  -->  00:09:09.453
Yes, I will, good advice.
202

202

00:09:09.453  -->  00:09:13.057
DefenderButton, capital B we need there,
Button.
203

203

00:09:13.057  -->  00:09:18.561
That'll create and add,
that'll add to these two game objects.
204

204

00:09:18.561  -->  00:09:21.666
Excellente, I'm gonna just
tweak that Cactus a tiny bit.
205

205

00:09:21.666  -->  00:09:27.321
Cuz it'll bug me if I don't have it
lining up the same as the Trophy.
206

206

00:09:27.321  -->  00:09:30.255
There we go, that's looking better.
207

207

00:09:30.255  -->  00:09:34.774
Okay, so let's find our script,
drag it into our Scripts folder.
208

208

00:09:34.774  -->  00:09:40.170
And then open that up,
where is it, DefenderButton.
209

209

00:09:41.282  -->  00:09:44.421
Righty-o, I'm gonna to
get rid of Start and
210

210

00:09:44.421  -->  00:09:47.403
Update, don't need those at the moment.
211

211

00:09:47.403  -->  00:09:52.312
What I do need to do is have
an onMouseDown event that we're
212

212

00:09:52.312  -->  00:09:53.723
listening for.
213

213

00:09:53.723  -->  00:09:59.008
And here I'll use the line that
I had before, GetComponent.
214

214

00:09:59.008  -->  00:10:04.130
GetComponent, and that's
the SpriteRenderer that we need to access.
215

215

00:10:04.130  -->  00:10:05.668
SpriteRenderer, that's a method.
216

216

00:10:05.668  -->  00:10:10.479
.color, we're accessing the color,
217

217

00:10:10.479  -->  00:10:15.579
and we wanna change that to Color.white.
218

218

00:10:15.579  -->  00:10:16.757
Save that up.
219

219

00:10:16.757  -->  00:10:19.532
Back over into Unity, click on Play.
220

220

00:10:19.532  -->  00:10:21.600
That should start grayed out.
221

221

00:10:21.600  -->  00:10:24.072
And then when we click on them,
boom, it becomes white.
222

222

00:10:24.072  -->  00:10:25.788
And that becomes white as well.
223

223

00:10:25.788  -->  00:10:29.930
Now that's a little bit of a problem
that they stay white forever.
224

224

00:10:29.930  -->  00:10:32.911
So let's get out of that,
jump back over into Unity.
225

225

00:10:32.911  -->  00:10:34.351
What do we need to do here?
226

226

00:10:34.351  -->  00:10:37.509
Well, we need to have that each
time we're clicking the mouse,
227

227

00:10:37.509  -->  00:10:39.265
we reset everything back to black.
228

228

00:10:39.265  -->  00:10:42.749
And we only have the one
we've clicked on be white.
229

229

00:10:42.749  -->  00:10:45.549
So the way I'm gonna do that
is by using a foreach loop.
230

230

00:10:45.549  -->  00:10:47.669
We haven't properly
discussed foreach loops yet.
231

231

00:10:47.669  -->  00:10:50.169
So let's have a quick
conversation about that.
232

232

00:10:50.169  -->  00:10:51.969
They're pretty simple.
233

233

00:10:51.969  -->  00:10:54.470
They're very similar to the for
loops that we've done before.
234

234

00:10:54.470  -->  00:10:58.700
And foreach loops allows us to do
something to each item in a collection.
235

235

00:10:58.700  -->  00:11:00.933
So a collection is a group of things.
236

236

00:11:00.933  -->  00:11:03.405
It could be a list, or
it could be an array.
237

237

00:11:03.405  -->  00:11:06.748
And I have an example below of just
some code syntax where we have
238

238

00:11:06.748  -->  00:11:08.211
a collection of monsters.
239

239

00:11:08.211  -->  00:11:10.345
So think about this.
240

240

00:11:10.345  -->  00:11:13.231
We might have monsters, or
attackers, or dogs, or elephants,
241

241

00:11:13.231  -->  00:11:15.229
whatever it is that
you've got in your game.
242

242

00:11:15.229  -->  00:11:20.551
But we'll say there's a collection of
monsters and they're of type Enemy.
243

243

00:11:20.551  -->  00:11:22.397
So our monsters are of type Enemy.
244

244

00:11:22.397  -->  00:11:23.204
This is how it might look.
245

245

00:11:23.204  -->  00:11:27.169
We might say foreach, and
then in parentheses, Enemy.
246

246

00:11:27.169  -->  00:11:30.145
This is the type,
it's important to put that first.
247

247

00:11:30.145  -->  00:11:33.658
And then we're talking about
this collection of monsters.
248

248

00:11:33.658  -->  00:11:38.125
We'll say, for example, there's ten
monsters in this collection of monsters.
249

249

00:11:38.125  -->  00:11:40.172
I don't know how many there is.
250

250

00:11:40.172  -->  00:11:41.509
But for each of those monsters,
we want to do a thing.
251

251

00:11:41.509  -->  00:11:46.386
So for each monster in monsters, the first
one, the second one, the third one,
252

252

00:11:46.386  -->  00:11:49.995
the fourth one, and so on,
then we want to do these things.
253

253

00:11:49.995  -->  00:11:52.095
That's where we execute our code block.
254

254

00:11:52.095  -->  00:11:54.836
So that's a foreach loop,
it's pretty simple.
255

255

00:11:54.836  -->  00:11:58.407
Let's implement that now in our game,
using our buttons.
256

256

00:11:58.407  -->  00:11:59.815
So we'll be substituting.
257

257

00:11:59.815  -->  00:12:03.349
Instead of monsters, we'll have
a grouping, a collection of buttons.
258

258

00:12:03.349  -->  00:12:07.054
And then we're looking to do
a certain thing to each button in our
259

259

00:12:07.054  -->  00:12:08.504
collection of buttons.
260

260

00:12:08.504  -->  00:12:11.241
So let's, at the start of our OnMouseDown,
261

261

00:12:11.241  -->  00:12:14.419
we'll create a variable
that we'll call buttons.
262

262

00:12:14.419  -->  00:12:17.682
buttons, and
we'll say buttons = FindObjectOfType.
263

263

00:12:17.682  -->  00:12:22.106
ObjectsOfType, sorry,
make sure ObjectsOfType.
264

264

00:12:22.106  -->  00:12:25.922
Cuz we're looking through many objects,
we're not looking at just one.
265

265

00:12:25.922  -->  00:12:28.818
We wanna find a whole bunch of objects,
and
266

266

00:12:28.818  -->  00:12:31.643
that's what these buttons are gonna be.
267

267

00:12:31.643  -->  00:12:33.892
And this will be of type DefenderButton.
268

268

00:12:33.892  -->  00:12:38.289
So look for all of the DefenderButtons
that you can find,
269

269

00:12:38.289  -->  00:12:40.584
parenthesis at the end here.
270

270

00:12:40.584  -->  00:12:46.652
Now, foreach, so
we're saying foreach(DefenderButton).
271

271

00:12:46.652  -->  00:12:51.287
So for every DefenderButton that we have,
we're going to look for
272

272

00:12:51.287  -->  00:12:54.619
something that we'll
call button in buttons.
273

273

00:12:54.619  -->  00:12:58.306
So this is the buttons,
the variable we've made.
274

274

00:12:58.306  -->  00:13:01.393
We're saying, we're looking for
all of the DefenderButtons.
275

275

00:13:01.393  -->  00:13:05.408
And then for each of our
DefenderButton type, we're looking for
276

276

00:13:05.408  -->  00:13:09.791
a button in buttons, in this list
of buttons that we've created here.
277

277

00:13:09.791  -->  00:13:10.807
That's a lot of buttons.
278

278

00:13:10.807  -->  00:13:13.032
And then what do we do?
279

279

00:13:13.032  -->  00:13:17.762
Well, we'll say button.getComponent.
280

280

00:13:17.762  -->  00:13:21.229
That's this button here
we're referring to.
281

281

00:13:21.229  -->  00:13:25.500
button.getComponent&lt;SpriteRenderer&gt;().co-
lor.
282

282

00:13:25.500  -->  00:13:29.224
And that's gonna equal what?
283

283

00:13:29.224  -->  00:13:32.358
= new Color32, so
284

284

00:13:32.358  -->  00:13:37.762
that we can use our 32-bit color.
285

285

00:13:37.762  -->  00:13:44.929
Here, if we click back on our Color, we
can have the 0 to 255, which is Color32.
286

286

00:13:44.929  -->  00:13:49.296
We can have RBG 0 to 1,
which is giving it in decimal places.
287

287

00:13:49.296  -->  00:13:50.798
We can use either of those two.
288

288

00:13:50.798  -->  00:13:57.119
We're gonna use this 0 to 255, so we can
use the standard RGB and alpha numbers.
289

289

00:13:57.119  -->  00:14:04.080
We'll just alpha that out a little bit,
colors we wanna have in there.
290

290

00:14:04.080  -->  00:14:09.005
So, new Color32(41, 41, 41, 255).
291

291

00:14:09.005  -->  00:14:10.936
They were the numbers
that we had in there.
292

292

00:14:10.936  -->  00:14:13.533
Save that up, let's make sure this works.
293

293

00:14:13.533  -->  00:14:14.884
Back over into Unity, click on Play.
294

294

00:14:14.884  -->  00:14:18.177
When I say black,
I mean this kind of grayed out color.
295

295

00:14:18.177  -->  00:14:19.729
Click on that, click on the other one.
296

296

00:14:19.729  -->  00:14:22.050
You can see it's toggling between the two,
magic and wonderful.
297

297

00:14:22.050  -->  00:14:25.074
And if we had a whole bunch of them,
then we would lay them out.
298

298

00:14:25.074  -->  00:14:26.626
Which we will later on in the game.
299

299

00:14:26.626  -->  00:14:28.627
We'll have more defenders,
we can click on more as we go.
300

300

00:14:28.627  -->  00:14:31.819
But this is the framework now for
having our selectable buttons,
301

301

00:14:31.819  -->  00:14:34.719
that we can now hook up our code
to say when you click on that,
302

302

00:14:34.719  -->  00:14:36.941
that we actually do place
that into the game.
303

303

00:14:36.941  -->  00:14:38.925
At the moment,
we're just placing in the Cactus.
304

304

00:14:38.925  -->  00:14:42.132
And that'll be the topic for
our next video, see you then.
