2

00:00:04.098  -->  00:00:08.655
Hello again, in this video, we're
creating ourselves a projectile that will
3

3

00:00:08.655  -->  00:00:13.144
instantiate at a gun position on our
cactus so it looks like it can shoot, pew,
4

4

00:00:13.144  -->  00:00:16.430
right from his gun hand and
not from on top of his face.
5

5

00:00:16.430  -->  00:00:18.430
Okay, let's jump in and get started.
6

6

00:00:18.430  -->  00:00:21.680
I left you with a little bit of
ambiguity at the end of last video.
7

7

00:00:21.680  -->  00:00:24.360
So lets clarify that and
get cleaned up on it.
8

8

00:00:24.360  -->  00:00:28.720
So it's to do with the animation event and
how it looks whether it looks like this
9

9

00:00:28.720  -->  00:00:31.880
structure that we've seen before,
or if it looks another way.
10

10

00:00:31.880  -->  00:00:37.080
Now the difference is if your clicked on
the game object that has an animation
11

11

00:00:37.080  -->  00:00:42.200
on it, so click Game object, to go the
Animation window, find the CactusAttack.
12

12

00:00:42.200  -->  00:00:46.480
You can see the animation event in
here has a drop-drown menu, and
13

13

00:00:46.480  -->  00:00:48.430
it doesn't have all the other information.
14

14

00:00:48.430  -->  00:00:52.510
That's how it looks, when it's the game
object's animation, that it's controlling.
15

15

00:00:52.510  -->  00:00:56.500
And it's saying, I'm gonna look for
anything that I think is a valid function,
16

16

00:00:56.500  -->  00:00:58.780
or method, as we call it,
17

17

00:00:58.780  -->  00:01:02.800
that this particular game object
can do from this animation event.
18

18

00:01:02.800  -->  00:01:06.180
And it's saying, well, I think you can do
set movement speed because I know that's
19

19

00:01:06.180  -->  00:01:08.710
in the project, but it's not supported.
20

20

00:01:08.710  -->  00:01:11.490
Function not supported
means that our cactus
21

21

00:01:11.490  -->  00:01:15.130
doesn't have it on the script
that would allow us to do that.
22

22

00:01:15.130  -->  00:01:17.710
That script is in the attacker script, and
23

23

00:01:17.710  -->  00:01:20.730
the attacker script is on the attackers,
not on the cactus.
24

24

00:01:20.730  -->  00:01:26.678
Okay, but if we were just straight up on
the Animation &gt; Defenders &gt; CactusAttack.
25

25

00:01:26.678  -->  00:01:29.510
Then it's gonna look differently,
it's gonna give us this sort of structure,
26

26

00:01:29.510  -->  00:01:30.860
this sort of look to it.
27

27

00:01:30.860  -->  00:01:35.340
So what I'm gonna do is just delete,
it's put in set movement speed just for
28

28

00:01:35.340  -->  00:01:38.550
when we're monkeying around before,
I think it's put that in as the default.
29

29

00:01:38.550  -->  00:01:39.677
We don't want that in there,
30

30

00:01:39.677  -->  00:01:42.121
at the moment we don't want it to
be called any sort of function.
31

31

00:01:42.121  -->  00:01:45.880
We haven't created it yet, we could create
it in here by saying let's call it fire
32

32

00:01:45.880  -->  00:01:47.900
and then go into our script and
create fire.
33

33

00:01:47.900  -->  00:01:50.340
I'm gonna do it the other way around
just to show you how it works
34

34

00:01:50.340  -->  00:01:51.420
the other way around.
35

35

00:01:51.420  -->  00:01:53.430
So, let's go and
create ourselves a new script.
36

36

00:01:53.430  -->  00:01:58.350
Go in the Script folder, right-click
Create C# Script, I'll call this,
37

37

00:01:58.350  -->  00:02:02.500
so this is gonna be on our character to
make our character to be able to shoots,
38

38

00:02:02.500  -->  00:02:04.710
so let's call it the Shooter script.
39

39

00:02:04.710  -->  00:02:07.860
This turns you into a shooter
when you have the script,
40

40

00:02:07.860  -->  00:02:10.220
open up that in Visual Studio.
41

41

00:02:10.220  -->  00:02:11.530
Now what do we need to do in here?
42

42

00:02:11.530  -->  00:02:13.918
Well, let's start by creating our method.
43

43

00:02:13.918  -->  00:02:17.210
I'm just gonna delete all this stuff,
we'll probably use it at some point, but
44

44

00:02:17.210  -->  00:02:18.580
for now, we'll keep it nice and clean,
45

45

00:02:18.580  -->  00:02:21.040
just have just the things
in there that we're using.
46

46

00:02:21.040  -->  00:02:25.541
So we need to create a public
method of no return type, so
47

47

00:02:25.541  -->  00:02:29.270
of avoid return type I should say,
we'll call this Fire.
48

48

00:02:29.270  -->  00:02:31.440
We're not gonna pass anything
in at the moment, and
49

49

00:02:31.440  -->  00:02:33.910
within there, we want to do something.
50

50

00:02:33.910  -->  00:02:37.930
But I'll get to the something in a minute,
we'll just say return,
51

51

00:02:37.930  -->  00:02:41.550
that means nothing's going on when
you ask to call Fire, just return.
52

52

00:02:41.550  -->  00:02:43.070
Just go back to your business.
53

53

00:02:43.070  -->  00:02:46.585
So I'll save that, and
then jump back over into here.
54

54

00:02:46.585  -->  00:02:54.198
And you can see when we clicked on Cactus,
and we go to the Cactus' attack animation.
55

55

00:02:54.198  -->  00:02:59.120
So once it finishes compiling CactusAttack
we can go and click on our animation
56

56

00:02:59.120  -->  00:03:03.940
event and from our drop-down we should
see if we've done it correctly.
57

57

00:03:03.940  -->  00:03:04.920
What have you done Rick?
58

58

00:03:04.920  -->  00:03:08.250
You doofus, we haven't actually told
cactus that it has this script,
59

59

00:03:08.250  -->  00:03:12.050
so drag your shooter
script over on to cactus.
60

60

00:03:12.050  -->  00:03:16.170
Now, it will now, I did that deliberately
to make a point, no I didn't.
61

61

00:03:17.220  -->  00:03:20.860
Now we know when we clicked on Cactus
from the cactus animation event and
62

62

00:03:20.860  -->  00:03:21.990
click on that.
63

63

00:03:21.990  -->  00:03:25.630
So cactus animation and
we click on the animation event,
64

64

00:03:25.630  -->  00:03:27.970
if I can click it properly,
nothing is going right at the moment.
65

65

00:03:27.970  -->  00:03:31.310
There we go, got it,
then the function should say Fire.
66

66

00:03:31.310  -->  00:03:34.280
Now we can select Fire from
our list of functions.
67

67

00:03:34.280  -->  00:03:36.520
We don't have the other information,
we don't have any other,
68

68

00:03:36.520  -->  00:03:39.160
well what if we wanted to fire fast or
fire slow?
69

69

00:03:39.160  -->  00:03:42.090
We can do that by going back
into our script within Fire,
70

70

00:03:42.090  -->  00:03:46.760
saying we need when something calls Fire,
we need it to pass to us some parameters.
71

71

00:03:46.760  -->  00:03:48.052
So let's just make this up for right now.
72

72

00:03:48.052  -->  00:03:51.720
I'm gonna delete this so you don't have
to type along, we'll say float and
73

73

00:03:51.720  -->  00:03:53.150
damage for example.
74

74

00:03:53.150  -->  00:03:55.827
If we want to put damage there, save that.
75

75

00:03:55.827  -->  00:04:00.460
Now we may go back in once it compiles,
taking it's time, time for
76

76

00:04:00.460  -->  00:04:02.560
faster computer Ric, I think.
77

77

00:04:02.560  -->  00:04:06.550
Waiting, waiting,waiting,
okay, loading, there we go.
78

78

00:04:06.550  -->  00:04:10.840
Now it's gonna have this parameter where
we can say, well the damage might be 20.
79

79

00:04:10.840  -->  00:04:14.300
And this is the kind of thing that's
useful if we've got a fighting game,
80

80

00:04:14.300  -->  00:04:18.260
it might be left jab is just here,
left jab is just there, and
81

81

00:04:18.260  -->  00:04:19.440
then right punch is just there.
82

82

00:04:19.440  -->  00:04:21.920
That's 10 damage,
10 damage, and 30 damage.
83

83

00:04:21.920  -->  00:04:25.930
If you wanted that level of control
within your animation events.
84

84

00:04:25.930  -->  00:04:28.430
Okay, I'm just gonna go back in here,
remove my parameters,
85

85

00:04:28.430  -->  00:04:30.670
we don't need that, Save.
86

86

00:04:32.070  -->  00:04:35.050
That will return from whence it came,
which is great.
87

87

00:04:35.050  -->  00:04:37.310
Now we need to give it
a projectile to shoot.
88

88

00:04:37.310  -->  00:04:41.090
Now we've said, we want you to shoot
something, we're gonna call this and
89

89

00:04:41.090  -->  00:04:41.920
something's gonna happen.
90

90

00:04:41.920  -->  00:04:45.878
Let's go and create a projectile, so from
my Sprites folder, the they're not in use,
91

91

00:04:45.878  -->  00:04:47.670
I'm gonna grab the zucchini.
92

92

00:04:47.670  -->  00:04:50.600
You can grab whatever your heart desires,
do something different.
93

93

00:04:50.600  -->  00:04:54.572
Do something that is maybe a little bit
more sensible than a cactus shooting
94

94

00:04:54.572  -->  00:04:55.272
a zucchini.
95

95

00:04:55.272  -->  00:04:59.850
I'm gonna drag that into my Cactus folder,
click on Cactus.
96

96

00:04:59.850  -->  00:05:02.360
Now from here we need to turn
this into a game object so
97

97

00:05:02.360  -->  00:05:04.210
that we can turn it into a prefab.
98

98

00:05:04.210  -->  00:05:07.170
At the moment this is just a Sprite,
this zucchini here.
99

99

00:05:07.170  -->  00:05:12.260
So dragging it into our hierarchy
create a zucchini game object.
100

100

00:05:12.260  -->  00:05:17.120
And within that we have our Sprite
renderer that's automatically created and
101

101

00:05:17.120  -->  00:05:21.160
automatically assigned
the zucchini sprite, excellent.
102

102

00:05:21.160  -->  00:05:23.710
And this is down at our 0, 0 position.
103

103

00:05:23.710  -->  00:05:26.150
So if we reset it's still 0, 0, great.
104

104

00:05:26.150  -->  00:05:30.530
And we need to change the order in layer,
so I'm gonna put it at six, I think.
105

105

00:05:30.530  -->  00:05:33.140
Let's just drag it up and
put it next to the Cactus,
106

106

00:05:33.140  -->  00:05:35.470
that means it'll sit over the top
of the Cactus, which is good.
107

107

00:05:35.470  -->  00:05:38.200
We could play around and see,
does it look better underneath the cactus?
108

108

00:05:38.200  -->  00:05:41.150
No, if he's shooting something he's
not gonna be shooting it from his back
109

109

00:05:41.150  -->  00:05:43.052
unless it's some sort of butt projectile.
110

110

00:05:43.052  -->  00:05:45.430
[LAUGH] But
it's not that kind of game now, is it?
111

111

00:05:45.430  -->  00:05:49.500
So for our game it's gonna be shooting
out from the front of our cactus.
112

112

00:05:49.500  -->  00:05:52.470
Okay, so we've got that, now to turn
this into a prefab what do we do?
113

113

00:05:52.470  -->  00:05:56.960
Well, we click our Prefabs folder, drag
the zucchini down into the Prefabs folder,
114

114

00:05:56.960  -->  00:06:00.010
we now have a zucchini
prefab that we can use.
115

115

00:06:00.010  -->  00:06:05.590
Every time we instantiate a zucchini it's
gonna come from our zucchini prefabs,
116

116

00:06:05.590  -->  00:06:07.070
fantastic.
117

117

00:06:07.070  -->  00:06:09.410
Now, what to do next?
118

118

00:06:09.410  -->  00:06:12.570
Well, next let's instantiate our zucchini.
119

119

00:06:12.570  -->  00:06:15.960
So we need a way of actually
telling it what the zucchini is.
120

120

00:06:15.960  -->  00:06:20.020
We need a reference to the zucchini,
so we'll serialize field and
121

121

00:06:20.020  -->  00:06:22.740
we'll call it GameObject as type.
122

122

00:06:22.740  -->  00:06:27.370
In the future we might put
a projectile script on
123

123

00:06:27.370  -->  00:06:32.400
the zucchini making it class projectile
when we do that to make it more precise.
124

124

00:06:32.400  -->  00:06:35.860
Cuz when we say GameObject,
we could drag any odd thing in there and
125

125

00:06:35.860  -->  00:06:36.920
accidentally mess it up.
126

126

00:06:36.920  -->  00:06:40.750
But for now, we'll say GameObject cuz
that's the tightest we have at the moment
127

127

00:06:40.750  -->  00:06:46.020
I believe for it, and
we'll call it projectile, all right?
128

128

00:06:46.020  -->  00:06:48.800
We get rid of our return,
instead of that we're gonna instantiate.
129

129

00:06:48.800  -->  00:06:53.360
So let's instantiate, now little mini
challenge for you, if you remember how to
130

130

00:06:53.360  -->  00:06:58.250
instantiate something, we need to have the
object, the position, and the rotation.
131

131

00:06:58.250  -->  00:07:00.190
So drop that in now if you will.
132

132

00:07:02.310  -->  00:07:08.280
Okay, so we're instantiating the
projectile, where are we instantiating it?
133

133

00:07:08.280  -->  00:07:11.910
Well, we'll do it at
just transform.position,
134

134

00:07:11.910  -->  00:07:14.290
that'll be in the middle
of the game objects,
135

135

00:07:14.290  -->  00:07:18.560
that'll be in the middle of the Cactus,
and then we want to do the rotation.
136

136

00:07:18.560  -->  00:07:23.410
We can either do the Quaternion.identity,
or
137

137

00:07:23.410  -->  00:07:29.750
we could do the transform.rotation and
if we spell transform correctly it helps.
138

138

00:07:29.750  -->  00:07:32.691
[LAUGH] Both of those
Transform.rotation or
139

139

00:07:32.691  -->  00:07:36.190
Quaternion.identity, they're both
saying we don't need any rotation,
140

140

00:07:36.190  -->  00:07:39.820
just get the rotation that you arrive
with when you're instantiated.
141

141

00:07:39.820  -->  00:07:41.990
Okay, let's save that up,
jump back over into the game,
142

142

00:07:41.990  -->  00:07:44.500
I'm gonna delete my zucchini game object.
143

143

00:07:44.500  -->  00:07:49.600
It should be instantiating from
the prefabs, so click on your Cactus and
144

144

00:07:49.600  -->  00:07:54.730
then make sure assigning the zucchini or
whatever yours is as the projectile.
145

145

00:07:54.730  -->  00:07:57.352
Now when we click on Play,
he'll go through,
146

146

00:07:57.352  -->  00:07:59.209
we have to look at his animator down here.
147

147

00:08:00.770  -->  00:08:04.410
He'll go through his idle and
then block into the attack, and
148

148

00:08:04.410  -->  00:08:08.380
then spawn a zucchini every time
149

149

00:08:08.380  -->  00:08:12.370
the animation loops around in the attack
loops around to that point in there.
150

150

00:08:12.370  -->  00:08:14.970
But it's instantiating in the middle
a little of a crappy spot.
151

151

00:08:14.970  -->  00:08:18.040
It's just shoving them right in the middle
of this game object and saying,
152

152

00:08:18.040  -->  00:08:19.380
there you go.
153

153

00:08:19.380  -->  00:08:22.260
And that's something that we
want to rectify by saying well,
154

154

00:08:22.260  -->  00:08:25.880
he should be shooting it rather than
shooting it from wherever his gun hand is.
155

155

00:08:25.880  -->  00:08:29.220
And you can go ahead and find an art
asset and put the gun in the hand,
156

156

00:08:29.220  -->  00:08:30.000
totally do that.
157

157

00:08:30.000  -->  00:08:32.910
I'm just gonna pretend
that he's holding a gun.
158

158

00:08:32.910  -->  00:08:35.470
Okay, so let's give the Cactus a gun.
159

159

00:08:35.470  -->  00:08:37.460
I'm just gonna close up Canvas there.
160

160

00:08:37.460  -->  00:08:39.290
So under Cactus, right click, or
161

161

00:08:39.290  -->  00:08:43.190
on Cactus right click Create Empty,
I will call this just Gun.
162

162

00:08:44.410  -->  00:08:48.760
Okay, and because I created my empty
while it was sitting on a Cactus,
163

163

00:08:48.760  -->  00:08:52.450
it's centered right in the middle of
the Cactus and childed to the cactus.
164

164

00:08:52.450  -->  00:08:54.370
Make sure you've childed
the gun to the cactus.
165

165

00:08:54.370  -->  00:08:57.130
If it's not, you can just drag
gun over the top of Cactus and
166

166

00:08:57.130  -->  00:08:58.750
it will be childed to it.
167

167

00:08:58.750  -->  00:09:00.350
Now, where do we wanna position our gun?
168

168

00:09:00.350  -->  00:09:04.720
It's as simple as just moving the gun
child game object to where we think
169

169

00:09:04.720  -->  00:09:05.550
the gun hand would be.
170

170

00:09:05.550  -->  00:09:08.170
You can put it all the way down there if
you wanted, probably wouldn't look so
171

171

00:09:08.170  -->  00:09:11.060
good, but we'll put it over here
to the right of the cactus.
172

172

00:09:11.060  -->  00:09:14.380
Okay, that's looking pretty cool,
we've got a position for
173

173

00:09:14.380  -->  00:09:17.760
our gun, now it's challenge time.
174

174

00:09:17.760  -->  00:09:23.270
I'd like for you to instantiate
the projectile from this gun position.
175

175

00:09:23.270  -->  00:09:26.850
So it's a bit of a quicker challenge,
we need to create a reference for
176

176

00:09:26.850  -->  00:09:29.130
our gun Game Object should
be pretty straight forward,
177

177

00:09:29.130  -->  00:09:30.990
there is a hint in the script already.
178

178

00:09:30.990  -->  00:09:35.076
And we need to instantiate
the projectile from where the gun
179

179

00:09:35.076  -->  00:09:38.925
is positioned which is as
simple as one word and one dot.
180

180

00:09:38.925  -->  00:09:42.839
So there you go, should be pretty quick to
take on that challenge if you've got our
181

181

00:09:42.839  -->  00:09:48.199
concepts along the way,
I'll see you back here in a moment Okay,
182

182

00:09:48.199  -->  00:09:49.700
hopefully that all made sense.
183

183

00:09:49.700  -->  00:09:54.920
I'm gonna start off by giving ourselves
a reference to gun by, I'll copy this.
184

184

00:09:54.920  -->  00:09:55.890
You know what I'm gonna do?
185

185

00:09:55.890  -->  00:09:57.860
I'm gonna show you a slightly
different way to do things.
186

186

00:09:57.860  -->  00:09:59.070
We haven't done this yet, but
187

187

00:09:59.070  -->  00:10:04.690
I could create our variable by saying
Serializefield GameObject and then gun.
188

188

00:10:04.690  -->  00:10:09.030
And that allows us to have a new
variable that we know is going to
189

189

00:10:09.030  -->  00:10:13.801
have a field in our inspector so
we can drag our gun Game Object into.
190

190

00:10:13.801  -->  00:10:18.189
Okay, that's one way of writing it, but
because these are both the same type, and
191

191

00:10:18.189  -->  00:10:19.898
we're serializing them both.
192

192

00:10:19.898  -->  00:10:24.151
Here is a slight little thing, you can do
a little trick if you prefer to cut down
193

193

00:10:24.151  -->  00:10:26.220
on space, you can just say comma gun.
194

194

00:10:26.220  -->  00:10:30.542
And that will create two variables that
are both of type Game Object that we're
195

195

00:10:30.542  -->  00:10:31.670
serializing.
196

196

00:10:31.670  -->  00:10:33.246
You can have as many of
these as you want here.
197

197

00:10:33.246  -->  00:10:37.889
Gun and then otherThing, and then handBag,
198

198

00:10:37.889  -->  00:10:42.700
and then hairclip, okay you get the point.
199

199

00:10:42.700  -->  00:10:44.340
So, you can have as many
of those as you want.
200

200

00:10:44.340  -->  00:10:47.940
So, you can group them together or
split them out separate, is up to you.
201

201

00:10:47.940  -->  00:10:50.150
Okay, so we've created a gun.
202

202

00:10:50.150  -->  00:10:54.680
Now instantiating is as simple as
saying instead of instantiating at
203

203

00:10:54.680  -->  00:10:59.650
the transform.position of this
Game Object, we know where the gun is so
204

204

00:10:59.650  -->  00:11:03.540
let's instantiate at
gun.transform.position.
205

205

00:11:03.540  -->  00:11:04.530
Hopefully you figured that out,
206

206

00:11:04.530  -->  00:11:07.480
hopefully I wasn't too cryptic
with my clue just there.
207

207

00:11:07.480  -->  00:11:10.090
But we're instantiating
at the guns position.
208

208

00:11:10.090  -->  00:11:12.510
We'll save that up,
jump back over in the Unity,
209

209

00:11:12.510  -->  00:11:16.070
click on Play,
see if our mission is successful.
210

210

00:11:16.070  -->  00:11:18.579
Watch the animator for
a little bit of excitement, so
211

211

00:11:18.579  -->  00:11:21.922
we can see that we're going through
the idle, idle, idle, idle, and
212

212

00:11:21.922  -->  00:11:25.853
then over into attack once we get to the
certain frame, [SOUND] it's not appearing.
213

213

00:11:25.853  -->  00:11:26.700
Why is that?
214

214

00:11:26.700  -->  00:11:28.500
Let's do a little bit of troubleshooting.
215

215

00:11:28.500  -->  00:11:32.100
Okay, you've probably guessed it,
this is me being a doofus again.
216

216

00:11:32.100  -->  00:11:36.490
We haven't actually assigned
our gun to the field.
217

217

00:11:36.490  -->  00:11:41.590
So let's drag gun over into our field,
now it should all work.
218

218

00:11:41.590  -->  00:11:45.400
And we know to apply
that back to the prefab.
219

219

00:11:45.400  -->  00:11:49.950
So this cactus gun is always gonna
work when we instantiate new
220

220

00:11:49.950  -->  00:11:53.430
cactuses in the future,
cacti in the future.
221

221

00:11:53.430  -->  00:11:56.880
Okay, here we go, idle animation,
tack, tack, tack, tack, boom and
222

222

00:11:56.880  -->  00:12:00.920
it's spawning right on his hand, or
instantiating right on where his hand is.
223

223

00:12:00.920  -->  00:12:03.940
And so we can do a little bit of
playing around with the size of the of
224

224

00:12:03.940  -->  00:12:07.680
the zucchini and the positioning of it,
but that's the essence of it.
225

225

00:12:07.680  -->  00:12:11.820
Great work, well done on
setting up a gun flash shooter,
226

226

00:12:11.820  -->  00:12:13.140
and I will see you in the next video
