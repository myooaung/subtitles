00:00:04,274  -->  00:00:06,273
Hello again,
welcome to our instructor hangout.
3

3

00:00:06,273  -->  00:00:07,625
We've got Ben with us here.
4

4

00:00:07,625  -->  00:00:08,150
Good day Ben.
5

5

00:00:08,150  -->  00:00:09,487
It's been a while since we've seen you.
6

6

00:00:09,487  -->  00:00:11,123
How have you been doing?
&gt;&gt; Good day Rick.
7

7

00:00:11,123  -->  00:00:12,460
How are you doing sport?
8

8

00:00:12,460  -->  00:00:14,131
I'm fine mate, thank you very much.
9

9

00:00:14,131  -->  00:00:16,355
I've been away for
a little trip so I'm back now and
10

10

00:00:16,355  -->  00:00:19,517
looking forward to helping out.
&gt;&gt; Cool, cool.
11

11

00:00:19,517  -->  00:00:23,307
So what we're gonna go through in this
video is, we're gonna go through some of
12

12

00:00:23,307  -->  00:00:26,138
the things that we've dug into
throughout this section and
13

13

00:00:26,138  -->  00:00:28,194
get Ben's take on what we've been doing.
14

14

00:00:28,194  -->  00:00:31,767
I said at the start of this course it's
good to hear things from different
15

15

00:00:31,767  -->  00:00:33,070
perspectives, angles.
16

16

00:00:33,070  -->  00:00:36,565
So we're gonna get Ben to give us
his take on what we've been doing.
17

17

00:00:36,565  -->  00:00:40,190
And the first thing I wanna dive
into is a good meaty conversation.
18

18

00:00:40,190  -->  00:00:44,094
We've had some questions about state
versus state versus state and so
19

19

00:00:44,094  -->  00:00:46,686
we use the word state about 1,000 times.
20

20

00:00:46,686  -->  00:00:49,051
And a little bit of why
have we got state state?
21

21

00:00:49,051  -->  00:00:49,820
What does that mean?
22

22

00:00:49,820  -->  00:00:54,421
Just to touch on that and to get your
thoughts, Ben, on how do we know, for
23

23

00:00:54,421  -->  00:00:58,597
example, that we can access our
public method in the state class.
24

24

00:00:58,597  -->  00:01:01,569
What in here is telling us
that we can access that?
25

25

00:01:01,569  -->  00:01:04,993
But first, a really quick note when
Ben and I were goofing around,
26

26

00:01:04,993  -->  00:01:09,700
we've commented out this line of code just
while we're experimenting and talking.
27

27

00:01:09,700  -->  00:01:11,284
Don't comment out that line of code,
28

28

00:01:11,284  -->  00:01:13,767
don't follow what we've done
with that particular line.
29

29

00:01:13,767  -->  00:01:16,510
Leave it as it is,
you don't need to comment it out.
30

30

00:01:16,510  -->  00:01:20,444
Okay, back to it.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so first thing I want you to pay
31

31

00:01:20,444  -->  00:01:24,050
attention to the coloring,
here, and the capitalization.
32

32

00:01:24,050  -->  00:01:29,036
So state state is saying that we wanna
make a variable called state with a small
33

33

00:01:29,036  -->  00:01:30,502
s and is of type state.
34

34

00:01:30,502  -->  00:01:34,140
Now why are we calling it state state,
why use the same word twice?
35

35

00:01:34,140  -->  00:01:36,105
Simply because as you get more experience,
36

36

00:01:36,105  -->  00:01:39,622
you will use the same word twice because
your eye will be attuned to two things.
37

37

00:01:39,622  -->  00:01:43,325
To the capitalization, which of course
we're hoping that you are nice and
38

38

00:01:43,325  -->  00:01:47,170
good people and make your actual things,
your instances, with lowercase.
39

39

00:01:47,170  -->  00:01:49,459
But the thing that's more robust
than that is looking at this blue.
40

40

00:01:49,459  -->  00:01:52,055
This state is in blue,
just like text is in blue here.
41

41

00:01:52,055  -->  00:01:54,895
All these things that are in
blue are types of things.
42

42

00:01:54,895  -->  00:01:56,750
Input is a type, key code's a type.
43

43

00:01:56,750  -->  00:01:57,899
All these things are types.
44

44

00:01:57,899  -->  00:02:02,185
So it's a variable of type state and
they both happen to have the name state.
45

45

00:02:04,547  -->  00:02:05,880
So-
&gt;&gt; Cool, great.
46

46

00:02:05,880  -->  00:02:06,620
&gt;&gt; That's that bit.
47

47

00:02:06,620  -->  00:02:07,493
&gt;&gt; Very good.
48

48

00:02:07,493  -->  00:02:08,785
Yeah, excellent.
49

49

00:02:08,785  -->  00:02:11,586
So that's one part and
then the next part is,
50

50

00:02:11,586  -->  00:02:16,300
I've seen a couple of questions in
the Q and A about why does this work?
51

51

00:02:16,300  -->  00:02:20,900
Why can we say that our
TextComponent.text we're calling our
52

52

00:02:20,900  -->  00:02:23,774
method from our state class over here.
53

53

00:02:23,774  -->  00:02:28,106
Why is this state effective in allowing us
54

54

00:02:28,106  -->  00:02:31,508
to call this method?
&gt;&gt; Well over in state.cs,
55

55

00:02:31,508  -->  00:02:35,445
if you pop over there for a second, we've
said that when we make these state things,
56

56

00:02:35,445  -->  00:02:38,716
which for the moment I understand
that you guys haven't got the detail
57

57

00:02:38,716  -->  00:02:40,000
of exactly what a class is.
58

58

00:02:40,000  -->  00:02:41,463
And a lot of these details
you're gonna have to.
59

59

00:02:41,463  -->  00:02:43,416
Remember how pictures used
to load on the Internet?
60

60

00:02:43,416  -->  00:02:45,795
They were fuzzy and then they get
sharper and sharper and sharper.
61

61

00:02:45,795  -->  00:02:48,274
And now the Internet is so fast that they
just appear, but they used to go fuzzy,
62

62

00:02:48,274  -->  00:02:49,620
then sharper, sharper, sharper.
63

63

00:02:49,620  -->  00:02:50,650
That's the way we're teaching you.
64

64

00:02:50,650  -->  00:02:52,600
We're not teaching you line by line,
right.
65

65

00:02:52,600  -->  00:02:55,967
Because the reason images used to do that
is cuz you kind of got an overview really
66

66

00:02:55,967  -->  00:02:59,498
quickly and you could scroll down the page
if you weren't interested, same here.
67

67

00:02:59,498  -->  00:03:01,007
So we're giving you the overview,
68

68

00:03:01,007  -->  00:03:03,970
then we're gonna drill into
the detail on successive approaches.
69

69

00:03:03,970  -->  00:03:07,002
So what we're doing here
in this other class,
70

70

00:03:07,002  -->  00:03:10,424
is we're saying that it's public,
a public method
71

71

00:03:10,424  -->  00:03:15,260
called GetStateStory is available to
anything that is a state instance.
72

72

00:03:15,260  -->  00:03:16,831
So we have this state class in blue.
73

73

00:03:16,831  -->  00:03:18,270
I've done it in red, but you get the idea.
74

74

00:03:18,270  -->  00:03:20,974
And then we make ourselves
a little state variable here.
75

75

00:03:20,974  -->  00:03:26,260
It's now on this state variable
we can say, .Get.StateStory etc.
76

76

00:03:26,260  -->  00:03:27,880
All right, so that's whats going on there.
77

77

00:03:27,880  -->  00:03:32,461
The reason that you can say
back in your Adventuregame.cs
78

78

00:03:32,461  -->  00:03:36,110
class .GetStateStory is because the State,
79

79

00:03:36,110  -->  00:03:40,517
this State here is this word here and
it is of typestate.
80

80

00:03:40,517  -->  00:03:43,290
Because it's typestate it has
this public method on it.
81

81

00:03:44,480  -->  00:03:46,901
So, that's kind of all you
need to know at the moment.
82

82

00:03:46,901  -->  00:03:50,930
Well, unless there's another question.
&gt;&gt; Excellent, no, that's good for now.
83

83

00:03:50,930  -->  00:03:53,618
And you were saying we haven't
dug a lot into class and
84

84

00:03:53,618  -->  00:03:57,585
in upcoming sections we're gonna dig into
that a bit more or a lot more I guess.
85

85

00:03:57,585  -->  00:03:59,118
We're gonna dive into that a bunch.
86

86

00:03:59,118  -->  00:04:03,236
There's also a conversation that we've
been having throughout this whole section
87

87

00:04:03,236  -->  00:04:05,209
that's been about scriptable object.
88

88

00:04:05,209  -->  00:04:09,884
And there's been some great questions
about the notion of here is
89

89

00:04:09,884  -->  00:04:11,580
game as a game object.
90

90

00:04:11,580  -->  00:04:14,637
And we can see very clearly we've
got our script attached to it.
91

91

00:04:14,637  -->  00:04:16,649
So that brings the script into existence.
92

92

00:04:16,649  -->  00:04:18,485
That makes the script come alive,
93

93

00:04:18,485  -->  00:04:21,680
cuz it's attached to this
GameObject as an instance.
94

94

00:04:21,680  -->  00:04:25,080
Whereas this script here,
state, is just hanging out.
95

95

00:04:25,080  -->  00:04:29,400
But let me give ourselves a bit
more screen real estate here.
96

96

00:04:29,400  -->  00:04:34,352
When we create our scriptable objects,
you can see that the state script,
97

97

00:04:34,352  -->  00:04:37,896
the state class,
is sitting on this asset file here.
98

98

00:04:37,896  -->  00:04:41,563
Do you wanna give us your take on
what's going on here from a different
99

99

00:04:41,563  -->  00:04:42,612
direction?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
100

100

00:04:42,612  -->  00:04:45,610
let's take it from the direction of where
things are on the disk to keep it simple.
101

101

00:04:45,610  -->  00:04:52,240
So over on this GameObject anything you do
on that is being stored in the scene file.
102

102

00:04:52,240  -->  00:04:54,868
So that is just in your scene file
which will be in this folder over here.
103

103

00:04:54,868  -->  00:04:57,973
So anything you're doing there's stored
in this scene until you get into prefabs
104

104

00:04:57,973  -->  00:05:00,880
which we'll get into later,
which are prefabricated objects.
105

105

00:05:00,880  -->  00:05:02,610
So when you make the changes that,
store them there.
106

106

00:05:02,610  -->  00:05:05,813
Now, when it comes to these files down
here, all of these state files that we've
107

107

00:05:05,813  -->  00:05:09,063
created, the point is, is what it's
saying in the inspector here is, firstly,
108

108

00:05:09,063  -->  00:05:11,700
when you make one of these you're
just making a file on the disk.
109

109

00:05:11,700  -->  00:05:12,403
You can see it here.
110

110

00:05:12,403  -->  00:05:15,720
It's in a cell.asset,
it's A2 in a cell.asset.
111

111

00:05:15,720  -->  00:05:18,081
So when you make one of these, you're
literally just make a file on the disk.
112

112

00:05:18,081  -->  00:05:22,872
And the template that that file is based
on is defined by this state script that
113

113

00:05:22,872  -->  00:05:23,470
we made.
114

114

00:05:23,470  -->  00:05:25,023
So the state is just the template for it.
115

115

00:05:25,023  -->  00:05:27,460
It's like the form you're
filling out basically.
116

116

00:05:27,460  -->  00:05:30,248
And then here is the form
showed to you in the inspector.
117

117

00:05:30,248  -->  00:05:34,760
It gives you options to both specify texts
and to link to a couple of other states.
118

118

00:05:34,760  -->  00:05:35,820
So that's what's going on there.
119

119

00:05:35,820  -->  00:05:38,268
You're making a file on
the disk to a given template.
120

120

00:05:38,268  -->  00:05:42,796
The template is the state.cs
script of an object class.
121

121

00:05:42,796  -->  00:05:45,378
It's a template for
storing information in.
122

122

00:05:45,378  -->  00:05:48,282
Just like a Google form or
a Wufu form or a SurveyMonkey form.
123

123

00:05:48,282  -->  00:05:51,183
It's just a form.
&gt;&gt; Yep, cool.
124

124

00:05:51,183  -->  00:05:53,131
And in your opinion, Ben,
125

125

00:05:53,131  -->  00:05:58,407
when should we be looking beside let's
just jump to scriptable objects?
126

126

00:05:58,407  -->  00:06:01,560
At this stage people are going
through the course and not yet
127

127

00:06:01,560  -->  00:06:04,979
familiar with how do I make decisions,
how do I problems solve?
128

128

00:06:04,979  -->  00:06:07,578
One of the things that I've been
hitting on is let's teach you how to
129

129

00:06:07,578  -->  00:06:08,222
problem solve.
130

130

00:06:08,222  -->  00:06:11,027
What's a nugget that we can be
giving people at this point,
131

131

00:06:11,027  -->  00:06:12,990
in terms of when they should be thinking,
132

132

00:06:12,990  -->  00:06:16,806
scriptable objects would be a good idea
from my project versus I don't [INAUDIBLE]
133

133

00:06:16,806  -->  00:06:20,425
scriptable objects at the moment?
&gt;&gt; Okay, so two answers I think to that.
134

134

00:06:20,425  -->  00:06:23,580
Number one is you won't know yet.
135

135

00:06:23,580  -->  00:06:25,344
If you're brand new to coding and
you're following a 3D,
136

136

00:06:25,344  -->  00:06:26,554
you don't have enough experience yet.
137

137

00:06:26,554  -->  00:06:29,936
So step one is watch us do something,
right?
138

138

00:06:29,936  -->  00:06:31,858
Step two is start to follow along with us.
139

139

00:06:31,858  -->  00:06:32,908
Step three, later on and
140

140

00:06:32,908  -->  00:06:36,312
the learning journey you'll be to be able
to make those decisions for yourself.
141

141

00:06:36,312  -->  00:06:38,569
So don't expect to be able
to make that decision yet,
142

142

00:06:38,569  -->  00:06:40,946
we're just introducing you
to a possibility, right?
143

143

00:06:40,946  -->  00:06:44,506
And then to answer more specifically,
when you start to wanna watch out for
144

144

00:06:44,506  -->  00:06:47,631
that type of stuff is in code you
should never have magic numbers.
145

145

00:06:47,631  -->  00:06:49,121
We've started to talk about that.
146

146

00:06:49,121  -->  00:06:51,778
Any number that's not zero, one, or
two probably shouldn't be in code.
147

147

00:06:51,778  -->  00:06:55,742
Even two is questionable because it's some
sort of number that contains information.
148

148

00:06:55,742  -->  00:06:56,948
It's the number of days of the week.
149

149

00:06:56,948  -->  00:06:58,134
It's something else.
150

150

00:06:58,134  -->  00:07:01,036
So that should be
a parameter to your code.
151

151

00:07:01,036  -->  00:07:04,052
It should be something that you use
to change the way your code works,
152

152

00:07:04,052  -->  00:07:05,721
not buried deep inside the code file.
153

153

00:07:05,721  -->  00:07:08,494
And the same goes for
words and strings of text, so
154

154

00:07:08,494  -->  00:07:12,660
putting all the story text in the code
has a couple of problems with it.
155

155

00:07:12,660  -->  00:07:16,399
Firstly it obfuscates,
it makes unclear how the code works.
156

156

00:07:16,399  -->  00:07:19,993
And the other thing that it does is that
if I'm working on a CS file, a C# file
157

157

00:07:19,993  -->  00:07:23,925
trying to make the game do something,
behave in certain way, somebody else can't
158

158

00:07:23,925  -->  00:07:27,950
simultaneously work if you wanna work with
a partner on creating the story text.
159

159

00:07:27,950  -->  00:07:29,990
Because they'd be clashing
on the same file, and
160

160

00:07:29,990  -->  00:07:32,285
we'd have a lot of trouble
reconciling those changes.
161

161

00:07:32,285  -->  00:07:35,406
So that's kind i the bottom line as
to why we're using them here and
162

162

00:07:35,406  -->  00:07:37,543
we wanna introduce you
to them really early.
163

163

00:07:37,543  -->  00:07:40,899
Uncomfortably early for me in the design
of this course to introduce it to you.
164

164

00:07:40,899  -->  00:07:43,433
But the point is that,
if we do that and as you move forward,
165

165

00:07:43,433  -->  00:07:46,150
you'll start to question
whenever you create a new script.
166

166

00:07:46,150  -->  00:07:49,200
In the future,
in about three sections time,
167

167

00:07:49,200  -->  00:07:51,880
you'll be ready to start questioning,
I'm making a new script.
168

168

00:07:51,880  -->  00:07:53,815
Should it just be what comes
out the box by default,
169

169

00:07:53,815  -->  00:07:56,394
which is more on behavior thing which
is just what comes out the box.
170

170

00:07:56,394  -->  00:07:58,341
Should it be a scriptable object,
which we'll try to see now or
171

171

00:07:58,341  -->  00:08:00,780
should it be something else
which we'll cover later.
172

172

00:08:00,780  -->  00:08:01,776
So that's the point,
173

173

00:08:01,776  -->  00:08:04,922
it's to get you in the habit of
questioning the type of script that Unity
174

174

00:08:04,922  -->  00:08:07,974
just automatically gives you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really great point about
175

175

00:08:07,974  -->  00:08:11,048
multiple people working on it, cuz you
might have a friend you teamed up with.
176

176

00:08:11,048  -->  00:08:12,813
The friend's gonna be the story writer and
177

177

00:08:12,813  -->  00:08:15,423
you're gonna be working on
the functionality, for example.
178

178

00:08:15,423  -->  00:08:20,079
And the friend can be in there creating
all sorts of great story and states and
179

179

00:08:20,079  -->  00:08:24,881
flow and not at all impacting the fact
that you're in here working on the script
180

180

00:08:24,881  -->  00:08:27,822
and getting some
functionality into the game.
181

181

00:08:27,822  -->  00:08:28,710
It's pretty cool.
182

182

00:08:28,710  -->  00:08:31,965
Another thing that Ben and
I were talking about just before we turned
183

183

00:08:31,965  -->  00:08:35,289
on the camera was our bracketing,
our braces and where things fits.
184

184

00:08:35,289  -->  00:08:37,380
So I wanna touch on that
just very briefly Ben.
185

185

00:08:37,380  -->  00:08:41,120
What's important at this stage and
what's not important at this stage in your
186

186

00:08:41,120  -->  00:08:45,198
opinion for people to be focused on when
it comes to the layout to white space,
187

187

00:08:45,198  -->  00:08:47,852
to their formatting?
&gt;&gt; So this is an interesting one.
188

188

00:08:47,852  -->  00:08:48,819
It's a bone of contentions.
189

189

00:08:48,819  -->  00:08:49,919
So it's a marmite point.
190

190

00:08:49,919  -->  00:08:51,488
Either you love it or you hate it.
191

191

00:08:51,488  -->  00:08:55,336
One thing actually matters is how
the compiler in service that code.
192

192

00:08:55,336  -->  00:08:59,298
Now I'd really like you to be able to read
code even if it's not perfectly formatted,
193

193

00:08:59,298  -->  00:09:03,110
otherwise when you even go to Unity sample
code it may not be perfectly formatted.
194

194

00:09:03,110  -->  00:09:05,886
If you find other people's code on
the web, it's not gonna be perfectly
195

195

00:09:05,886  -->  00:09:09,317
formatted, there is no perfect, but it may
not be consistently formatted, all right.
196

196

00:09:09,317  -->  00:09:12,636
Now what you're seeing on the screen here
is not currently consistently formatted,
197

197

00:09:12,636  -->  00:09:14,100
but it's okay, let go of it.
198

198

00:09:14,100  -->  00:09:17,270
Yes, of course, we should have
a consistent coding style and yes,
199

199

00:09:17,270  -->  00:09:20,842
of course, it's good if we stick with
a perfect and consistent code style.
200

200

00:09:20,842  -->  00:09:24,014
But to do that you have to learn as
Rick says, to change the template, and
201

201

00:09:24,014  -->  00:09:26,718
what gets spat out in terms of
this code with start and update,
202

202

00:09:26,718  -->  00:09:30,540
there's spaces between the method name and
the brackets here but there aren't here.
203

203

00:09:30,540  -->  00:09:33,990
This curly braces here rather than here,
relax, its okay.
204

204

00:09:33,990  -->  00:09:37,949
It all works in C#,
it's all white space, it doesn't care,
205

205

00:09:37,949  -->  00:09:40,499
we know it's not 100% consistent.
206

206

00:09:40,499  -->  00:09:43,635
We, in the future of the course,
will think about changing the template and
207

207

00:09:43,635  -->  00:09:45,010
really tightening that up.
208

208

00:09:45,010  -->  00:09:48,774
But the first thing you need to do is let
go of perfect code formatting before you
209

209

00:09:48,774  -->  00:09:50,896
then start fully owning it, in my opinion.
210

210

00:09:50,896  -->  00:09:53,350
Cuz first you need to make a decision
about what code style do you
211

211

00:09:53,350  -->  00:09:54,005
want to employ.
212

212

00:09:54,005  -->  00:09:57,409
There is no one code style
that is the right code style,
213

213

00:09:57,409  -->  00:09:59,700
it's what's right for you.
214

214

00:09:59,700  -->  00:10:02,804
And secondly, you need to be not
allergic to other people's code.
215

215

00:10:02,804  -->  00:10:05,193
You need to get in the habit of
suppressing that urge to say,
216

216

00:10:05,193  -->  00:10:06,200
it's not right.
217

217

00:10:06,200  -->  00:10:08,598
And remember there's no right or
wrong, there's just styles.
218

218

00:10:08,598  -->  00:10:10,649
It's not consistent, it's not good, but
219

219

00:10:10,649  -->  00:10:13,652
you need to get able to read code
that is inconsistently styled.
220

220

00:10:13,652  -->  00:10:17,089
Otherwise, when you come to solve bigger
problems later, where you wanna copy and
221

221

00:10:17,089  -->  00:10:20,820
paste or at least you're inspired by other
people's code, if you can't get over the,
222

222

00:10:20,820  -->  00:10:23,962
it's not perfectly consistent, you can
lose out on a lot of value that other
223

223

00:10:23,962  -->  00:10:27,661
people have created.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great point.
224

224

00:10:27,661  -->  00:10:31,581
As you were talking I've just gone and
formatted this to our preferred
225

225

00:10:31,581  -->  00:10:36,365
formatting, which is not to have any space
between the update and the brackets here,
226

226

00:10:36,365  -->  00:10:38,900
and to have our curly
braces on the next line.
227

227

00:10:38,900  -->  00:10:44,153
But there's a lot of people who
prefer to do things like that,
228

228

00:10:44,153  -->  00:10:47,820
and they both work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.
229

229

00:10:47,820  -->  00:10:52,106
[CROSSTALK] So strive for
consistency in the code you write but
230

230

00:10:52,106  -->  00:10:56,127
forgive inconsistency in others.
&gt;&gt; Excellent, really good.
231

231

00:10:56,127  -->  00:11:00,214
The other thing I wanted to hit on in this
instructor hangout is there are some part
232

232

00:11:00,214  -->  00:11:03,819
of the design in this section that
we've gone through pretty fast, for
233

233

00:11:03,819  -->  00:11:06,847
example how to write a story or
how to come with a story idea?
234

234

00:11:06,847  -->  00:11:09,891
Or how to connect from one
state to the next state.
235

235

00:11:09,891  -->  00:11:13,817
We've gone through that pretty quickly cuz
we just don't have time in this course to
236

236

00:11:13,817  -->  00:11:15,320
dig too deep into design.
237

237

00:11:15,320  -->  00:11:18,396
People are here to learn programming,
they're here to learn Unity, and
238

238

00:11:18,396  -->  00:11:20,991
they're here to learn how to make
a game from start to finish.
239

239

00:11:20,991  -->  00:11:24,940
So we skipped some of that, and hopefully,
we'll have a narrative design course.
240

240

00:11:24,940  -->  00:11:27,096
If you really want one
then make some noise and
241

241

00:11:27,096  -->  00:11:29,609
we'll put that on the agenda
to create one of those.
242

242

00:11:29,609  -->  00:11:34,422
But I've deliberately not spent too much
time on that throughout this section cuz I
243

243

00:11:34,422  -->  00:11:37,460
know we just don't have time
to dig into it too much.
