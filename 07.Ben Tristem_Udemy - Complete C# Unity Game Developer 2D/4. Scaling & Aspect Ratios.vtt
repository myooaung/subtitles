2

00:00:04.012  -->  00:00:05.690
Hello again my friend.
3

3

00:00:05.690  -->  00:00:10.637
In this video, we're talking about aspect
ratios, to make sure that when someone
4

4

00:00:10.637  -->  00:00:15.625
playing on a 16:9 device, or 4:3 device,
our game is fitting as it should.
5

5

00:00:15.625  -->  00:00:19.715
So let's jump over to I'm just
gonna reset game here back to 16:9,
6

6

00:00:19.715  -->  00:00:23.030
cuz that's going to be my default,

7
16:9, I reckon.
7

8

00:00:23.030  -->  00:00:26.987
I think that's what is the sweet spot for
devices just at the moment.
8

9

00:00:26.987  -->  00:00:29.404
And you can see we've
got our outline here,
9

10

00:00:29.404  -->  00:00:32.157
which is where our game
thinks the game should be.
10

11

00:00:32.157  -->  00:00:34.470
And then we've got our
big old image behind it.
11

12

00:00:34.470  -->  00:00:36.704
When we click on Game,
our image is being chopped off.
12

13

00:00:36.704  -->  00:00:39.789
And that's ccuz we've
said our image should be,
13

14

00:00:39.789  -->  00:00:42.144
if I click on Canvas and then my Image.
14

15

00:00:42.144  -->  00:00:46.304
We've said we want it to be set native
size, and the native size I know by going
15

16

00:00:46.304  -->  00:00:49.190
to my images, and
clicking on the splash image here.
16

17

00:00:49.190  -->  00:00:53.790
I can see that the native size is,
where are you hiding native size?
17

18

00:00:53.790  -->  00:00:57.115
I need to find an image, there he is,
the splash imagine underneath.
18

19

00:00:57.115  -->  00:00:58.608
And drag this guy up here.
19

20

00:00:58.608  -->  00:01:01.222
1920x1080.
20

21

00:01:01.222  -->  00:01:04.035
And so we're showing 1920x1080,
21

22

00:01:04.035  -->  00:01:09.480
whereas when we go to click on our Canvas,
it thinks that the game is much smaller.
22

23

00:01:09.480  -->  00:01:11.760
It's saying this is what
I'm gonna show on the game.
23

24

00:01:11.760  -->  00:01:14.800
So the first step is for
us to say the Canvas Scaler.
24

25

00:01:14.800  -->  00:01:17.783
We want to change this to
Scale With Screen Size.
25

26

00:01:17.783  -->  00:01:20.964
And have our reference resolution,
doesn't really matter, but
26

27

00:01:20.964  -->  00:01:22.555
the reference resolution says,
27

28

00:01:22.555  -->  00:01:26.661
well we're gonna drop a whole bunch of
art in here that we thinks 1920x1080.
28

29

00:01:26.661  -->  00:01:29.100
So let's make our reference
resolution 1920x1080.
29

30

00:01:29.100  -->  00:01:34.610
And now we can see that our outline of our
canvas matches the outline of the image.
30

31

00:01:34.610  -->  00:01:37.300
If you click on game,
the whole thing fits in.
31

32

00:01:37.300  -->  00:01:38.810
Sweet.
32

33

00:01:38.810  -->  00:01:41.820
Now, if we were to play around with
some of these other scale modes,
33

34

00:01:41.820  -->  00:01:44.590
we could say constant pixel size.
34

35

00:01:44.590  -->  00:01:46.570
And I know we've looked at
this in previous sections, but
35

36

00:01:46.570  -->  00:01:50.700
just very briefly constant pixel
size would say, if we click on that,
36

37

00:01:50.700  -->  00:01:54.835
we won't Want to have no matter how
someone changes the resolution.
37

38

00:01:54.835  -->  00:01:56.465
And if we're making a mobile game,
38

39

00:01:56.465  -->  00:01:59.575
the resolution is changing cuz
someone's on a different device.
39

40

00:01:59.575  -->  00:02:04.337
We're saying keep the pixel size exactly
the same on their screen, no matter what.
40

41

00:02:04.337  -->  00:02:08.357
So if we go and drop an image in
here that's 10 pixels by 10 pixels,
41

42

00:02:08.357  -->  00:02:13.587
it will take up 10 pixels by 10 pixels no
matter what the size of their device is.
42

43

00:02:13.587  -->  00:02:15.387
Whether they've got a massive tablet or
43

44

00:02:15.387  -->  00:02:18.557
they've got a little
teensy-weensy flip phone.
44

45

00:02:18.557  -->  00:02:20.187
Okay, that's Constant Pixel Size.
45

46

00:02:20.187  -->  00:02:22.277
Constant Physical Size
is on the other side.
46

47

00:02:22.277  -->  00:02:27.730
If we say we want our image to take up for
example 10 cm.
47

48

00:02:27.730  -->  00:02:30.180
You can see that there are different
units we can choose in here.
48

49

00:02:30.180  -->  00:02:33.570
10 cm for example on their screen.
49

50

00:02:33.570  -->  00:02:39.190
No matter what size screen they've got,
we want this button to be 10 cm by 10 cm.
50

51

00:02:39.190  -->  00:02:40.715
Hang on,
does that actually fit on a phone?
51

52

00:02:40.715  -->  00:02:41.866
Probably not.
52

53

00:02:41.866  -->  00:02:44.490
So, we can say Constant Pixel Size.
53

54

00:02:44.490  -->  00:02:47.330
For us we wanna have scale
with screen size, so
54

55

00:02:47.330  -->  00:02:51.640
if it's a different device the the whole
thing gets stretched bigger and smaller.
55

56

00:02:51.640  -->  00:02:53.870
There's a few different
ways to do the stretching.
56

57

00:02:53.870  -->  00:02:57.780
This is the screen match mode here,
match, width or height.
57

58

00:02:57.780  -->  00:03:01.460
You can choose to scale based upon
all the way on the left is width, and
58

59

00:03:01.460  -->  00:03:03.910
all the way over on the right is height.
59

60

00:03:03.910  -->  00:03:05.900
Or we can choose to Expand and Shrink.
60

61

00:03:05.900  -->  00:03:08.790
So let's play around with those
a little bit at the moment.
61

62

00:03:08.790  -->  00:03:11.500
First thing I'll do is
detach my scene window.
62

63

00:03:11.500  -->  00:03:15.630
Just drag it and find a spot where it's
not gonna click into somewhere else, so
63

64

00:03:15.630  -->  00:03:18.420
that I can then plop that
over on the side there.
64

65

00:03:18.420  -->  00:03:21.570
You can see what I'm doing,
is I'm fiddling around with stuff here.
65

66

00:03:21.570  -->  00:03:22.180
Grab the game.
66

67

00:03:22.180  -->  00:03:22.700
Do the same.
67

68

00:03:22.700  -->  00:03:24.180
Drop it into the middle.
68

69

00:03:24.180  -->  00:03:28.530
Change its size, okay so
it's about that, great.
69

70

00:03:28.530  -->  00:03:31.280
Just a note, when you're moving around
the game window, if you're moving it,
70

71

00:03:31.280  -->  00:03:35.600
you'll see that it's not changing until
you let go and then it goes, blop and
71

72

00:03:35.600  -->  00:03:37.430
drops into place.
72

73

00:03:37.430  -->  00:03:38.070
Go to over here.
73

74

00:03:38.070  -->  00:03:42.310
So if we change screen match mode to
say Expand, what is that going to do?
74

75

00:03:42.310  -->  00:03:45.360
Well one of the things when I'm playing
with here is this aspect ratio.
75

76

00:03:45.360  -->  00:03:48.610
Again, we've done this in the past,
if there's an aspect ratio that you don't
76

77

00:03:48.610  -->  00:03:51.910
have in your list here, you can add
it by clicking on the plus button.
77

78

00:03:51.910  -->  00:03:53.660
For example there are some,
78

79

00:03:54.940  -->  00:03:58.240
I'm gonna change it from fixed
resolution to aspect ratio.
79

80

00:03:58.240  -->  00:04:02.490
There are some devices
nowadays that are 18x9.
80

81

00:04:02.490  -->  00:04:09.480
Not just the 16x9, but 18x9, so
they're even longer than they are high.
81

82

00:04:09.480  -->  00:04:12.924
Okay, click OK on that, so
now we have our extra 18x9 that we can
82

83

00:04:12.924  -->  00:04:15.397
select as an aspect ratio
to see how that looks.
83

84

00:04:15.397  -->  00:04:19.412
And when we do that, we've now got
these blue bars down the side,
84

85

00:04:19.412  -->  00:04:23.070
they're blue because my settings
say they should be blue.
85

86

00:04:23.070  -->  00:04:27.102
And I've got a little mini challenge for
you here, for those of you who already
86

87

00:04:27.102  -->  00:04:30.540
know the answer to this,
you'll be like this is simple, simple.
87

88

00:04:30.540  -->  00:04:31.550
And for those of you who don't,
88

89

00:04:31.550  -->  00:04:35.670
a little bit of a research maybe just
to poke around, some experimenting.
89

90

00:04:35.670  -->  00:04:39.160
So to change our default
background to black.
90

91

00:04:39.160  -->  00:04:40.280
So that's your mini-challenge.
91

92

00:04:40.280  -->  00:04:43.244
Jump in and
do that now if you'd be so kind.
92

93

00:04:43.244  -->  00:04:45.540
And if you get stuck here's
a quick hand for you.
93

94

00:04:45.540  -->  00:04:48.370
If you don't think you need the hint,
then take on the challenge now.
94

95

00:04:48.370  -->  00:04:50.880
Otherwise, here's the hint.
95

96

00:04:50.880  -->  00:04:55.290
One of your game objects already
in your scene, has what you need.
96

97

00:04:55.290  -->  00:04:57.500
It's like a riddle isn't it?
97

98

00:04:57.500  -->  00:04:59.750
You already have a game object
that does what you need.
98

99

00:04:59.750  -->  00:05:01.050
So jump and take on that challenge.
99

100

00:05:01.050  -->  00:05:01.955
I'll see you back here in a moment.
100

101

00:05:04.334  -->  00:05:08.650
Okay, so well done if you knew
exactly where to go for that.
101

102

00:05:08.650  -->  00:05:11.290
The background here comes from our camera.
102

103

00:05:11.290  -->  00:05:12.630
So if you click on main camera,
103

104

00:05:12.630  -->  00:05:15.970
you can see that currently our
default background is this blue.
104

105

00:05:15.970  -->  00:05:19.670
Now I asked you to change it to black
which is the common convention when you've
105

106

00:05:19.670  -->  00:05:22.950
got these side bars,
basically the game is saying,
106

107

00:05:22.950  -->  00:05:26.450
I don't have anything to put down here,
so i'm just gonna put these black bars.
107

108

00:05:26.450  -->  00:05:29.120
For the illustrative purposes
while I'm showing you this video,
108

109

00:05:29.120  -->  00:05:33.050
I'm gonna make mine a pink color, so
you can see it really clearly and
109

110

00:05:33.050  -->  00:05:36.085
easily, cuz the black kind
of blends in with they grey.
110

111

00:05:36.085  -->  00:05:38.485
This grey is purely from Unity.
111

112

00:05:38.485  -->  00:05:41.665
That's from me playing
around with window here.
112

113

00:05:41.665  -->  00:05:45.955
The device would be, for example,
there, down to there, down to there,
113

114

00:05:45.955  -->  00:05:49.925
and this is just Unity saying well,
I've got more stuff in the window because
114

115

00:05:49.925  -->  00:05:52.335
that's how Rickers made
my window at the moment.
115

116

00:05:52.335  -->  00:05:55.870
Okay, and the pink stuff is what
the player is going to see.
116

117

00:05:55.870  -->  00:05:57.160
If we use a particular mode.
117

118

00:05:57.160  -->  00:05:59.480
So let's have a play around
with this a little bit more.
118

119

00:05:59.480  -->  00:06:01.740
Seeing view where we can see it.
119

120

00:06:01.740  -->  00:06:02.800
Click off camera so
120

121

00:06:02.800  -->  00:06:05.025
that's not sitting over the top,
click on the cameras, there we go.
121

122

00:06:05.025  -->  00:06:06.137
Camera's here.
122

123

00:06:06.137  -->  00:06:09.382
So if I'm in this 18x9,
we have these bars on the side,
123

124

00:06:09.382  -->  00:06:11.920
I'm gonna set mine defaulting to 16:9.
124

125

00:06:11.920  -->  00:06:16.434
This is where I say, okay,
I want 16:9 to look good.
125

126

00:06:16.434  -->  00:06:20.418

127
16:9 is gonna cover a lot of
the common aspect ratios, and
126

128

00:06:20.418  -->  00:06:22.570
I have a little diagram for this.
127

129

00:06:22.570  -->  00:06:23.460
Let me just show you this for
128

130

00:06:23.460  -->  00:06:28.070
those of you who are not quite fully 100%
clear on the aspect ratio stuff just yet.
129

131

00:06:28.070  -->  00:06:30.290
Rick, can you explain it
a little bit more detail?
130

132

00:06:30.290  -->  00:06:31.200
Yes, I can.
131

133

00:06:31.200  -->  00:06:34.440
So if you look at this,
this might be a tablet, and
132

134

00:06:34.440  -->  00:06:39.180
a tablet generally is a little bit wider,
a bit fatter.
133

135

00:06:39.180  -->  00:06:46.200
Whereas a phone tends to be a phone, tends
to be a little bit narrower or skinnier.
134

136

00:06:46.200  -->  00:06:48.268
Now if we look at this tablet, the old,
135

137

00:06:48.268  -->  00:06:50.724
old tablets tended to
be 4x3 aspect ratios.
136

138

00:06:50.724  -->  00:06:54.576
So the longer edge,
usually referred to as the width,
137

139

00:06:54.576  -->  00:06:59.365
cuz we talk about things in
the landscape or the horizontal aspect.
138

140

00:06:59.365  -->  00:07:04.283
4x3, so no matter how many pixels
this was, this along here,
139

141

00:07:04.283  -->  00:07:09.020
the aspect ratio is for
every four pixels along our long side,
140

142

00:07:09.020  -->  00:07:12.800
we have three pixels along the short side.
141

143

00:07:12.800  -->  00:07:16.790
And for
a phone nowadays common is more of a 16,
142

144

00:07:16.790  -->  00:07:21.020
whoops one six, not six one.
143

145

00:07:21.020  -->  00:07:21.650
16x9.
So
144

146

00:07:21.650  -->  00:07:24.780
for every 16 pixels we get along
here we get 9 pixels along there.
145

147

00:07:24.780  -->  00:07:28.635
And some phones get tons of pixels, so
146

148

00:07:28.635  -->  00:07:34.422
you might have a full on
1920x1080 resolution.
147

149

00:07:34.422  -->  00:07:37.034
And that's an 8,
well done Rick, typing an 8.
148

150

00:07:37.034  -->  00:07:41.402
1920x1080 resolution
meaning we physically have,
149

151

00:07:41.402  -->  00:07:45.100
I'm going to tap in here
1,920 pixels you see.
150

152

00:07:45.100  -->  00:07:48.361
A pixel is a dot that's
showing you the graphics.
151

153

00:07:48.361  -->  00:07:50.788
Each of these little dots
make up the picture and
152

154

00:07:50.788  -->  00:07:53.943
then this way there is 100x80
dots along the screen, and
153

155

00:07:53.943  -->  00:07:57.720
then all of these add up to the total
number of pixels you get on the screen.
154

156

00:07:57.720  -->  00:08:03.932
So it could be 1920x1080 could be
smaller than that It could be 1280x720,
155

157

00:08:03.932  -->  00:08:08.030
could be the number of actual
pixels you have on your phone.
156

158

00:08:08.030  -->  00:08:11.322
Or on your tablet, or
on your TV for that matter.
157

159

00:08:11.322  -->  00:08:17.137
Generally, 1920x1080 is referred to as
1080, and 1280x720 is referred to as 720.
158

160

00:08:17.137  -->  00:08:21.853
On some other phones,
maybe it's the Google Pixel 3 for example.
159

161

00:08:21.853  -->  00:08:28.702
The Google Pixel 3 I believe has
an aspect ratio of 18x9 I believe,
160

162

00:08:28.702  -->  00:08:32.890
so then it has even
more pixels along here.
161

163

00:08:32.890  -->  00:08:34.920
What does that mean for
us when we are making our game.
162

164

00:08:34.920  -->  00:08:37.412
What means if you are making
a game that looks really sweet,
163

165

00:08:37.412  -->  00:08:40.680
I'm gonna change my color
here if you let me.
164

166

00:08:40.680  -->  00:08:43.680
If you make again,
it looks really sweet on the tablet.
165

167

00:08:43.680  -->  00:08:45.880
You're like that's prefect, fits nicely.
166

168

00:08:45.880  -->  00:08:46.730
We've got things over here.
167

169

00:08:46.730  -->  00:08:47.680
We've got things there.
168

170

00:08:47.680  -->  00:08:49.680
We've got things right up
in the top right corner.
169

171

00:08:49.680  -->  00:08:54.500
And then you stick it on to a phone
that has a much longer resolution,
170

172

00:08:54.500  -->  00:08:58.790
then you end up with the black bars
along the side of your screen.
171

173

00:08:58.790  -->  00:08:59.920
So what do we do about this?
172

174

00:08:59.920  -->  00:09:01.100
Well we've got a couple of options.
173

175

00:09:01.100  -->  00:09:04.640
And those options we see over
in our Screen Match Mode here.
174

176

00:09:04.640  -->  00:09:07.210
We can do the Match, Expand or Shrink.
175

177

00:09:07.210  -->  00:09:08.897
So let's have a look at
the Expand first of all.
176

178

00:09:08.897  -->  00:09:11.268
So I've got my game at 16:9.
177

179

00:09:11.268  -->  00:09:12.620
It all fits nice and neatly.
178

180

00:09:12.620  -->  00:09:16.450
There's no extra pink zones within it.
179

181

00:09:16.450  -->  00:09:19.560
As I call, how is this gonna look on 4x3?
180

182

00:09:19.560  -->  00:09:22.667
Because 16x9, and
4x3 are the two ends of my spectrum.
181

183

00:09:22.667  -->  00:09:25.822
I'm probably gonna bounce between those,
but we'd have a look at 16x10.
182

184

00:09:25.822  -->  00:09:30.116
We'd have a look at it at 18x9 as well,
but we'll see how it looks on 4x3.
183

185

00:09:30.116  -->  00:09:34.268
If we're using expand, and
we say that our reference
184

186

00:09:34.268  -->  00:09:38.640
resolution is 1920x1080 which is a 16:9.
185

187

00:09:38.640  -->  00:09:44.120
Then when it expands, it's going to add
more content, i.e., add the black bars,
186

188

00:09:44.120  -->  00:09:46.790
or in my case I've made them pink bars so
they're easier to see.
187

189

00:09:46.790  -->  00:09:49.700
So we still retain all of
the content on our screen.
188

190

00:09:49.700  -->  00:09:56.130
It still stretches or scales as the device
is a bigger device or a smaller device.
189

191

00:09:56.130  -->  00:10:00.390
But if the shape of the device is
a little bit squarer, i.e., 4x3.
190

192

00:10:00.390  -->  00:10:03.070
Then we will get these
black bars put in there.
191

193

00:10:03.070  -->  00:10:05.780
Now, what happens if we would
have used Shrink as our option.
192

194

00:10:05.780  -->  00:10:10.370
Well, Shrink when we start off with
our 16x9, looks kind of nice and
193

195

00:10:10.370  -->  00:10:11.590
neat and normal.
194

196

00:10:11.590  -->  00:10:12.780
Okay, I'll just line it up there.
195

197

00:10:12.780  -->  00:10:14.830
And you can see the outliner overall.
196

198

00:10:14.830  -->  00:10:16.280
Now I'll send you over here.
197

199

00:10:16.280  -->  00:10:17.090
Line's up.
198

200

00:10:17.090  -->  00:10:20.090
If I was to then change that to 4x3.
199

201

00:10:20.090  -->  00:10:24.890
We lose the content on the side, and you
can see over here again in my scene view,
200

202

00:10:24.890  -->  00:10:27.610
that it has just brought
in the side of my game.
201

203

00:10:27.610  -->  00:10:32.530
Which is totally cool in terms of making
sure we don't have any black bars, but
202

204

00:10:32.530  -->  00:10:35.570
not cool if you've got
important content on the side.
203

205

00:10:35.570  -->  00:10:39.360
Now for my splash screen here,
there's nothing important on the side.
204

206

00:10:39.360  -->  00:10:41.910
It's just a little bit
extra artistic flavor, but
205

207

00:10:41.910  -->  00:10:43.917
we've created it in a very smart way.
206

208

00:10:43.917  -->  00:10:46.850
Let's say we've got all
the important content in the middle.
207

209

00:10:46.850  -->  00:10:52.250
So for this particular scree,
I'm gonna go with this shrink option,
208

210

00:10:52.250  -->  00:10:55.060
so that if someone if using
a different aspect ration,
209

211

00:10:55.060  -->  00:10:56.770
they're not gonna get the black bars.
210

212

00:10:56.770  -->  00:10:59.500
You can do it anyway you want,
I really wanna be clear on that.
211

213

00:10:59.500  -->  00:11:01.320
But I think for
this one it looks pretty cool.
212

214

00:11:01.320  -->  00:11:05.470
And also cool, is we can do it differently
for different scenes in Unity.
213

215

00:11:05.470  -->  00:11:09.730
We don't have to have the same canvas
scaling approach for all of them.
214

216

00:11:09.730  -->  00:11:11.720
So I'm gonna save up my scene here,
215

217

00:11:11.720  -->  00:11:15.870
jump over into my other scenes to
leave my windows floating around.
216

218

00:11:15.870  -->  00:11:16.560
Find a way.
217

219

00:11:16.560  -->  00:11:19.910
Jump over into my start screen.
218

220

00:11:19.910  -->  00:11:23.530
Now my start screen,
I'm just going to zoom out.
219

221

00:11:23.530  -->  00:11:27.170
Okay, we have the same issue that we
had before where we haven't told it,
220

222

00:11:27.170  -->  00:11:29.280
click on Canvas, we haven't told it.
221

223

00:11:29.280  -->  00:11:31.700
Sorry I know this all a little
bit hard to see at the moment.
222

224

00:11:31.700  -->  00:11:32.290
Pop it over there.
223

225

00:11:32.290  -->  00:11:32.800
There we go.
224

226

00:11:32.800  -->  00:11:35.414
This is scene and this is game.
225

227

00:11:35.414  -->  00:11:39.959
We are still on constant pixel size,
I wanna change that to scale with screen
226

228

00:11:39.959  -->  00:11:44.452
size and put my reference
resolution to 1920x1080, excellent.
227

229

00:11:44.452  -->  00:11:48.318
And if I put it to 16:
9 it looks pretty good.
228

230

00:11:48.318  -->  00:11:52.051
Now I'm gonna show you a not
exactly perfect amazing way,
229

231

00:11:52.051  -->  00:11:53.583
first to resolve this.
230

232

00:11:53.583  -->  00:11:57.157
But it's what I am gonna do good
enough for now, and it's for
231

233

00:11:57.157  -->  00:11:58.920
educational purposes.
232

234

00:11:58.920  -->  00:12:02.402
The problem is that we've got
this art that has graphics,
233

235

00:12:02.402  -->  00:12:04.974
that has words baked into the background.
234

236

00:12:04.974  -->  00:12:09.168
So if I now go and say, let's see,
235

237

00:12:09.168  -->  00:12:13.234
Expand, and then choose 4x3.
236

238

00:12:13.234  -->  00:12:14.845
Okay we have our bars, and
237

239

00:12:14.845  -->  00:12:19.620
note again you have to change the bars
each time you come into the main camera.
238

240

00:12:19.620  -->  00:12:22.270
So change this to black if you will,
for me for
239

241

00:12:22.270  -->  00:12:24.330
illustrative purposes
I'm gonna make it pink.
240

242

00:12:24.330  -->  00:12:27.590
Again, so you can see what's going on.
241

243

00:12:27.590  -->  00:12:31.720
Okay, so expand puts in the bars like
I don't really like the look of that.
242

244

00:12:31.720  -->  00:12:34.840
I don't wanna have black bars,
might be my approach.
243

245

00:12:34.840  -->  00:12:38.927
So if we go Shrink, but
when I do Shrink and it's down on 4:3.
244

246

00:12:38.927  -->  00:12:45.900
So sidenote,16:9 looks just fine,

247
4:3, I lose my text over here.
245

248

00:12:45.900  -->  00:12:50.380
So what I'd like you to do
as another challenge is,
246

249

00:12:51.400  -->  00:12:52.460
this is the second challenge.
247

250

00:12:52.460  -->  00:12:54.350
I usually don't do two, just the one.
248

251

00:12:54.350  -->  00:12:57.130
Is to anchor your Start Menu text so
249

252

00:12:57.130  -->  00:13:00.420
that it is always close to
the right of the screen.
250

253

00:13:00.420  -->  00:13:03.230
No matter what aspect ratio we are using.
251

254

00:13:03.230  -->  00:13:05.660
So, you need to remember back from
when we were working on anchoring.
252

255

00:13:05.660  -->  00:13:07.200
You'll need to do a little
bit of alignment, and
253

256

00:13:07.200  -->  00:13:10.770
you'll need to play around with the screen
scaling mode that you're using.
254

257

00:13:10.770  -->  00:13:12.140
But jump in, take on that challenge.
255

258

00:13:12.140  -->  00:13:13.046
And I'll see you back here in a moment.
256

259

00:13:15.353  -->  00:13:19.140
Okay, so what I mean by this is see
how we're getting chopped off there?
257

260

00:13:19.140  -->  00:13:25.030
So no matter what, we have to have
Start Game and Quit visible to the player,
258

261

00:13:25.030  -->  00:13:29.830
or else they may like Start Gar, I don't
know what that means, we don't want that.
259

262

00:13:29.830  -->  00:13:31.410
We could just do the black bars, but
260

263

00:13:31.410  -->  00:13:33.610
we're gonna go with an approach
where we're not gonna do that.
261

264

00:13:33.610  -->  00:13:39.690
I've got my scale with screen size to
1920x1080, and the screen mode is Shrink.
262

265

00:13:39.690  -->  00:13:44.200
And what I will do is click on my garden
text and rename it, cuz I'm naughty,
263

266

00:13:44.200  -->  00:13:44.930
I haven't renamed it.
264

267

00:13:44.930  -->  00:13:47.590
That should be Start Text On here,
265

268

00:13:47.590  -->  00:13:51.260
rename the reloading text to
be what's that, quit text.
266

269

00:13:51.260  -->  00:13:52.960
Okay, that's a little renaming.
267

270

00:13:52.960  -->  00:13:56.229
So the start text, we'll click on that
back over into my scene view here,
268

271

00:13:56.229  -->  00:13:57.988
I'll just make it a little bit bigger.
269

272

00:13:57.988  -->  00:14:00.496
You don't have to move your windows around
the way I am, I'm just doing this so
270

273

00:14:00.496  -->  00:14:02.030
you can see what's going on.
271

274

00:14:02.030  -->  00:14:07.918
And first of all, we need to click on our
w tool, move that fits within the window,
272

275

00:14:07.918  -->  00:14:10.497
the current window that is here.
273

276

00:14:10.497  -->  00:14:15.260
I'm going to just get this default UI
thing out of the way, find the alignment,
274

277

00:14:15.260  -->  00:14:16.600
click on right align.
275

278

00:14:16.600  -->  00:14:17.940
Now I need to move it
a little bit further,
276

279

00:14:17.940  -->  00:14:20.800
cuz there was a line center, put the edge.
277

280

00:14:20.800  -->  00:14:22.620
How far away from the edge do I want it?
278

281

00:14:22.620  -->  00:14:24.690
Around about there, I think.
279

282

00:14:24.690  -->  00:14:28.270
And 4x3 is currently my
squarest resolution.
280

283

00:14:28.270  -->  00:14:34.810
So my Start at the worst case scenario is
gonna appear all the way into about here.
281

284

00:14:34.810  -->  00:14:35.960
And that's still readable I think.
282

285

00:14:35.960  -->  00:14:36.680
That's cool.
283

286

00:14:36.680  -->  00:14:40.530
And while on start, I'm going to
click on the anchor tool, that little
284

287

00:14:40.530  -->  00:14:44.450
grid thing here and click on the right,
so now my anchor point is on the right.
285

288

00:14:44.450  -->  00:14:46.174
I'll do the same for quit, and
286

289

00:14:46.174  -->  00:14:48.250
then we'll have a look at
whether it's all worked or not.
287

290

00:14:48.250  -->  00:14:51.280
Click on quit, do the right alignment.
288

291

00:14:51.280  -->  00:14:55.310
Move it over to the right, so
it's a right aligned approach here.
289

292

00:14:55.310  -->  00:14:56.720
I don't have to do it right aligned, but
290

293

00:14:56.720  -->  00:14:59.280
I find that's gonna make it look
a little bit neater and tidier.
291

294

00:14:59.280  -->  00:15:00.640
Start game and quit.
292

295

00:15:00.640  -->  00:15:06.025
Now, if I was to click on
a different aspect ratio so
293

296

00:15:06.025  -->  00:15:08.600

297
16:9, you can see that sorry.
294

298

00:15:08.600  -->  00:15:10.430
Bit too hasty Rick what are you doing?
295

299

00:15:10.430  -->  00:15:14.750
I didn't click on anchor and to the right,
so now it's anchored to the right and
296

300

00:15:14.750  -->  00:15:15.860
I need to move it.
297

301

00:15:15.860  -->  00:15:18.860
Oops, from my scene view yep, scene view.
298

302

00:15:18.860  -->  00:15:21.260
Move it over to the right, close to that.
299

303

00:15:23.670  -->  00:15:27.050
Being a bit thrown off here, cuz I wasn't
zoomed in properly on my scene view.
300

304

00:15:27.050  -->  00:15:27.583
Okay, there we go.
301

305

00:15:27.583  -->  00:15:30.572
Now, when I'm on 16:9,
that all looks like it's taken.
302

306

00:15:30.572  -->  00:15:32.700

307
16:9, it's way over on the right.
303

308

00:15:32.700  -->  00:15:35.650
If I go to say 16:10,
it's still to the right.
304

309

00:15:35.650  -->  00:15:37.410
If I go 4x3, it's still to the right.
305

310

00:15:37.410  -->  00:15:39.750
So it's all fitting in in a nice spot.
306

311

00:15:39.750  -->  00:15:43.590
We know no matter what we're not gonna
lose our game text, it's gonna be in here.
307

312

00:15:43.590  -->  00:15:45.680
I said before that we
do lose our big glitch.
308

313

00:15:45.680  -->  00:15:46.330
That's a note.
309

314

00:15:46.330  -->  00:15:50.340
If you're baking in any information that
you just really don't wanna lose in your
310

315

00:15:50.340  -->  00:15:53.530
background, then make sure
you have a safe zone.
311

316

00:15:53.530  -->  00:15:58.560
And the safe zone as you can see here,
is this amount of space to the left and
312

317

00:15:58.560  -->  00:15:59.100
the right.
313

318

00:15:59.100  -->  00:16:02.650
So we'd wanna create our art, so
there's nothing important there and
314

319

00:16:02.650  -->  00:16:04.150
nothing important there.
315

320

00:16:04.150  -->  00:16:07.050
With you now, our setup of our image.
316

321

00:16:07.050  -->  00:16:07.940
Okay so there we have it.
317

322

00:16:07.940  -->  00:16:11.420
We've created our splash screen and
our start menus, and
318

323

00:16:11.420  -->  00:16:13.500
our aspect ratio is feeling pretty good.
319

324

00:16:13.500  -->  00:16:14.830
No matter what size and
320

325

00:16:14.830  -->  00:16:20.640
shape of mobile within the 4:3 to

326
16:9 relationship should be good.
321

327

00:16:20.640  -->  00:16:22.120
What's 8:9 look like?
322

328

00:16:22.120  -->  00:16:27.990
Okay, we will get a little bit
of chopping off at the 18:9.
323

329

00:16:27.990  -->  00:16:28.730
Sorry.
That's okay.
324

330

00:16:28.730  -->  00:16:32.200
As well I'm happy with that, there's
a bit of that safe zone coming into play.
325

331

00:16:32.200  -->  00:16:33.840
Okay, cool.
So we're all set up, ready to go.
326

332

00:16:33.840  -->  00:16:35.531
Let's jump into the next video.
