00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,270
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,270  -->  00:00:05,706
Hey hey, welcome again.
3

3

00:00:05,706  -->  00:00:08,410
Here we have health up in
our top left of the screen.
4

4

00:00:08,410  -->  00:00:11,581
We're displaying it when we take
a bullet hit, blonk goes to 100,
5

5

00:00:11,581  -->  00:00:13,268
then blonk again goes to 0, we die.
6

6

00:00:13,268  -->  00:00:16,830
Back to play again and returns to
200 when we start our game again.
7

7

00:00:16,830  -->  00:00:19,556
So, let's jump in and display our health.
8

8

00:00:19,556  -->  00:00:21,520
Hokie dokie, let's get started.
9

9

00:00:21,520  -->  00:00:25,233
And what I'm gonna do is start off with
the framework of what we're doing and
10

10

00:00:25,233  -->  00:00:27,217
a challenge which is to Display Health.
11

11

00:00:27,217  -->  00:00:29,829
Because it's so
similar to displaying score,
12

12

00:00:29,829  -->  00:00:33,300
I think I've got a lot of confidence
in you that you can nail it.
13

13

00:00:33,300  -->  00:00:36,357
So first of all,
I'd like you to create HealthDisplay.cs.
14

14

00:00:36,357  -->  00:00:39,311
And a sneaky hint,
this is is sneaky hint number one,
15

15

00:00:39,311  -->  00:00:41,710
it's very similar to ScoreDisplay.cs.
16

16

00:00:41,710  -->  00:00:44,556
Then create Health text within our canvas,
and
17

17

00:00:44,556  -->  00:00:47,698
sneaky hint #2 its very
similar to the score text.
18

18

00:00:47,698  -->  00:00:50,621
And we only need to be displaying health
from the game not in the game over
19

19

00:00:50,621  -->  00:00:51,168
the screen.
20

20

00:00:51,168  -->  00:00:54,057
Cuz I think it's pretty obvious what your
health is when you are at game over.
21

21

00:00:54,057  -->  00:00:57,607
Need to create a health method and
sneaky hint number #3,
22

22

00:00:57,607  -->  00:00:59,890
it's very similar to GetScore().
23

23

00:00:59,890  -->  00:01:02,470
So GetHealth() and
GetScore() are very similar.
24

24

00:01:02,470  -->  00:01:07,358
And then finally to Call GetHealth() and
convert that to a string.
25

25

00:01:07,358  -->  00:01:11,618
And finally, well now I think sneaky hint
is you get the picture by now that it's
26

26

00:01:11,618  -->  00:01:12,900
very similar to score.
27

27

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:17,354
So jump in, implement your health,
have it displaying in the game screen,
28

28

00:01:17,354  -->  00:01:21,265
decreasing when you get hit, and
I will see you when you're done.
29

29

00:01:21,265  -->  00:01:22,220
Okay where should we start?
30

30

00:01:22,220  -->  00:01:23,867
I'm gonna click on my gain canvas.
31

31

00:01:23,867  -->  00:01:28,460
I've got my score text so I'll duplicate
that, to make some health text.
32

32

00:01:28,460  -->  00:01:30,780
Health text, great.
33

33

00:01:30,780  -->  00:01:35,790
And then instead of a score display
script I'll remove that component, we
34

34

00:01:35,790  -->  00:01:41,275
need to add a let's say, Health Display,
so jump over into my script's folder,
35

35

00:01:41,275  -->  00:01:46,382
right-click, create, C sharp script
which I shall call Health Display.
36

36

00:01:46,382  -->  00:01:51,138
Excellent, now when I
clicked on my Health text,
37

37

00:01:51,138  -->  00:01:56,018
I can add component or
drag on over health display.
38

38

00:01:56,018  -->  00:01:57,859
Excellent, so health display, all good.
39

39

00:01:57,859  -->  00:02:01,498
Now we gotta reposition health text,
so click on health text, hit W.
40

40

00:02:01,498  -->  00:02:02,672
Move move move move.
41

41

00:02:02,672  -->  00:02:04,077
Looks pretty good.
42

42

00:02:04,077  -->  00:02:09,311
Okay, and change the color from
blue to it was all yellow.
43

43

00:02:09,311  -->  00:02:10,928
Okay, looks pretty sharp.
44

44

00:02:10,928  -->  00:02:13,401
And I can see that I've got
six placeholder zero's but
45

45

00:02:13,401  -->  00:02:17,450
only five of them displaying, which shows
me that my font's a little bit too big.
46

46

00:02:17,450  -->  00:02:19,987
Change that to 80, left align.
47

47

00:02:19,987  -->  00:02:23,934
And then click on my anchor point,
left align on my anchor point, top left.
48

48

00:02:23,934  -->  00:02:25,950
That looks pretty sharp, I think.
49

49

00:02:25,950  -->  00:02:30,131
And then my score I'm also gonna
change that font size down to 80.
50

50

00:02:30,131  -->  00:02:33,143
There we go, lots of room for millions.
51

51

00:02:33,143  -->  00:02:38,079
Well maybe not millions, but hundreds
of thousands of scores and healths.
52

52

00:02:38,079  -->  00:02:40,621
I will apply all this back to the prefab,
but
53

53

00:02:40,621  -->  00:02:44,621
at the moment I've got this game
canvas prefab to my game over scene.
54

54

00:02:44,621  -->  00:02:47,997
So what I'll do first I'll save this up,
55

55

00:02:47,997  -->  00:02:52,830
jump over into game over,
get all this UI stuff done first.
56

56

00:02:52,830  -->  00:02:57,402
And in here, I've got my start menu,
game canvas.
57

57

00:02:57,402  -->  00:03:01,870
So I don't want my changes to my
other game canvas to change this.
58

58

00:03:01,870  -->  00:03:06,600
This is really the game over score
displaying canvas, it's not a game canvas.
59

59

00:03:06,600  -->  00:03:11,780
So I'm gonna click on game canvas, go to
game object, and break prefab instance.
60

60

00:03:11,780  -->  00:03:13,303
And instead of Game Canvas,
61

61

00:03:13,303  -->  00:03:17,183
I'm going to call this Score Canvas
just to show that that's what it is.
62

62

00:03:17,183  -->  00:03:20,801
We don't really need to prefab it
bu,t it's good to prefab everything
63

63

00:03:20,801  -->  00:03:21,538
just in case.
64

64

00:03:21,538  -->  00:03:23,355
So now we have a Score Canvas.
65

65

00:03:24,512  -->  00:03:27,980
On our game over scene that shouldn't
be broken by any of the changes.
66

66

00:03:27,980  -->  00:03:31,900
I'm gonna save the changes we
do over on our game scene.
67

67

00:03:31,900  -->  00:03:34,170
So over here now we've
got our Game Canvas.
68

68

00:03:34,170  -->  00:03:36,672
That is yes, so that's relevant.
69

69

00:03:36,672  -->  00:03:38,230
Apply all that back now, this is prefab.
70

70

00:03:38,230  -->  00:03:41,262
So if you've got multiple levels this
should work for those multiple levels.
71

71

00:03:41,262  -->  00:03:44,802
Okay, so let's go have a look
at our script, where are we?
72

72

00:03:44,802  -->  00:03:46,770
Health Display, open up Health Display.
73

73

00:03:47,940  -->  00:03:51,275
Okay, nothing in there, I mention it's
very similar to Score Display, so
74

74

00:03:51,275  -->  00:03:52,743
I'm gonna go get Score Display.
75

75

00:03:52,743  -->  00:03:55,425
Might end up a little more
work changing all the words,
76

76

00:03:55,425  -->  00:03:58,910
copy that over to Health Display,
but it's a good starting place.
77

77

00:03:58,910  -->  00:04:01,313
Delete and then paste all this in.
78

78

00:04:01,313  -->  00:04:02,167
So good one.
79

79

00:04:02,167  -->  00:04:05,131
Instead of scoreText we
need to have healthText.
80

80

00:04:05,131  -->  00:04:08,215
I'm not doing a rename all
just in case that goes and
81

81

00:04:08,215  -->  00:04:10,664
renames things in other scripts for me.
82

82

00:04:10,664  -->  00:04:13,657
I'm gonna just manually rename it in here,
gameSession.
83

83

00:04:13,657  -->  00:04:15,828
Well, let's finish this.
84

84

00:04:15,828  -->  00:04:19,439
Let's finish this healthText here as well.
85

85

00:04:20,800  -->  00:04:25,467
So all of the scoreTexts
should be healthTexts.
86

86

00:04:25,467  -->  00:04:29,741
Okay, they're all updated,
now Text has a squiggly underline,
87

87

00:04:29,741  -->  00:04:33,140
which means that we're
not using the namespace.
88

88

00:04:33,140  -->  00:04:37,880
So using UnityEngine.UI namespace there,
the squiggly lines go away, excellent.
89

89

00:04:37,880  -->  00:04:42,003
So that healthText part should be done and
dusted now.
90

90

00:04:42,003  -->  00:04:45,792
GameSession that's not where we're getting
the health from, the health currently
91

91

00:04:45,792  -->  00:04:49,159
should be with the player cuz the player
has a concept of I'm taking damage,
92

92

00:04:49,159  -->  00:04:51,270
here is where my health is at the moment.
93

93

00:04:51,270  -->  00:04:54,958
So let's see,
yep there is a health variable already,
94

94

00:04:54,958  -->  00:04:58,894
let's find a good spot to be
putting our get health method.
95

95

00:04:58,894  -->  00:05:03,291
I think it's gonna be underneath Die,
so all of this health-related stuff,
96

96

00:05:03,291  -->  00:05:07,488
then down here we'll, underneath
the Die method we'll create a public,
97

97

00:05:07,488  -->  00:05:11,320
we need to return something we
need to be returning and int.
98

98

00:05:11,320  -->  00:05:15,268
And we'll call this GetHealth,
parentheses,
99

99

00:05:15,268  -->  00:05:19,999
curly braces,
what we will return we will return health.
100

100

00:05:19,999  -->  00:05:22,125
And semicolon, save that up.
101

101

00:05:22,125  -->  00:05:26,755
It looks pretty good, back over to health
display, now we've got our game session.
102

102

00:05:26,755  -->  00:05:30,060
Instead of game session we
need to change this to player.
103

103

00:05:30,060  -->  00:05:35,429
So type player and
variable we'll call player.
104

104

00:05:35,429  -->  00:05:39,660
And then again instead of game
session it's called player.
105

105

00:05:39,660  -->  00:05:42,959
Fun objective type this
will be the player.
106

106

00:05:45,240  -->  00:05:52,308
And gameSession this will be player,
oops player small p, okay.
107

107

00:05:52,308  -->  00:05:56,143
And we can set it up this way cuz at the
moment we've only got one level you might
108

108

00:05:56,143  -->  00:05:59,272
need to do singleton on the player
if you have multiple levels.
109

109

00:05:59,272  -->  00:06:02,957
But for us, we've just got the one
game level so this works okay.
110

110

00:06:02,957  -->  00:06:06,541
We're gonna say get health,
under our updates, so
111

111

00:06:06,541  -->  00:06:12,243
every frame we're updating the health text
with the player's get health value and
112

112

00:06:12,243  -->  00:06:14,950
we're converting that into a string.
113

113

00:06:14,950  -->  00:06:18,254
So let's save that up we'll check
that we've done everything that we
114

114

00:06:18,254  -->  00:06:19,774
need to in here, click on Play.
115

115

00:06:19,774  -->  00:06:23,950
The Health should be at 200 at the moment
if we've set things up correctly.
116

116

00:06:23,950  -->  00:06:27,012
Yes, 200, score goes up great when I die.
117

117

00:06:27,012  -->  00:06:29,499
It goes to 0, excellent, Game Over screen.
118

118

00:06:29,499  -->  00:06:31,340
We've still got our score
display where we want it to.
119

119

00:06:31,340  -->  00:06:33,373
Play Again Back to 200.
120

120

00:06:33,373  -->  00:06:35,350
It's all looking pretty hunky dory.
121

121

00:06:35,350  -->  00:06:39,146
Excellent, so we now have health,
we have score, we have a full game loop.
122

122

00:06:39,146  -->  00:06:43,123
We can play the whole way through, we
can die, we can have laughs, we can cry,
123

123

00:06:43,123  -->  00:06:44,223
all that good stuff.
124

124

00:06:44,223  -->  00:06:46,560
So great work and
I'll see you in the next lecture.
