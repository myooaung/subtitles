2

00:00:04.304  -->  00:00:08.567
In this video we're gonna add a constraint
to our camera so that when our player
3

3

00:00:08.567  -->  00:00:12.452
runs to the edge of the screen,
the camera doesn't follow the player.
4

4

00:00:12.452  -->  00:00:14.190
You can't see what's off the screen or
5

5

00:00:14.190  -->  00:00:16.680
the ugly mess we've got off
the side of our screen.
6

6

00:00:16.680  -->  00:00:21.720
But as the player runs to the other side,
getting past the dead zone,
7

7

00:00:21.720  -->  00:00:24.880
the camera continues to follow
until they bump to the end again.
8

8

00:00:24.880  -->  00:00:27.600
So let's jump in and
put some constraints on our camera.
9

9

00:00:27.600  -->  00:00:31.222
So the problem we have at the moment,
is that we can see in our game,
10

10

00:00:31.222  -->  00:00:35.000
we can see the down below where our
character is, we can see up above.
11

11

00:00:35.000  -->  00:00:37.730
We can see all of these areas of our
screen that we don't necessarily want
12

12

00:00:37.730  -->  00:00:39.970
the player to be able to
see this stuff down below.
13

13

00:00:39.970  -->  00:00:42.690
Also, as the player gets to the edge
of our world, say this is the edge of
14

14

00:00:42.690  -->  00:00:46.260
the world, we don't want to have to
build out all this content over here.
15

15

00:00:46.260  -->  00:00:47.710
We want that to feel like
the edge of the world,
16

16

00:00:47.710  -->  00:00:50.060
so we want the camera to allow
the player to go over here.
17

17

00:00:50.060  -->  00:00:52.450
To do that we add constraints.
18

18

00:00:52.450  -->  00:00:56.140
So let's scroll down on our virtual
camera that we've got down here.
19

19

00:00:56.140  -->  00:01:02.603
Let's rename this at the moment actually,
we'll rename this to Virtual Camera.
20

20

00:01:02.603  -->  00:01:03.980
Yeah, that'll do for the moment.
21

21

00:01:03.980  -->  00:01:06.469
If we add more, then we'll update
the name for that, but for now,
22

22

00:01:06.469  -->  00:01:09.010
this is our Virtual Camera,
and this is our main camera.
23

23

00:01:09.010  -->  00:01:10.920
We scroll down to the bottom
of our Virtual Camera.
24

24

00:01:10.920  -->  00:01:14.500
We'll see Extensions, and
Add Extensions, select that.
25

25

00:01:14.500  -->  00:01:15.930
You're going to hold
down the mouse button,
26

26

00:01:15.930  -->  00:01:18.710
I've messed this up a couple of times,
accidentally doing stuff.
27

27

00:01:18.710  -->  00:01:22.462
Just clicking, that'll add whatever
the one down the bottom is,
28

28

00:01:22.462  -->  00:01:26.356
but hold the mouse button down,
scroll up to CinemachineConfiner.
29

29

00:01:26.356  -->  00:01:30.625
This'll add the confiner
script to our Virtual Camera.
30

30

00:01:30.625  -->  00:01:34.760
And you can see that it's asking for
a bounding block shape, which is required.
31

31

00:01:34.760  -->  00:01:38.502
Now to do this, we're gonna have to do a
couple of additional steps to do with our
32

32

00:01:38.502  -->  00:01:40.280
2D physics.
33

33

00:01:40.280  -->  00:01:45.186
So what we need is a collider that
we put somewhere in the world,
34

34

00:01:45.186  -->  00:01:49.832
that the camera can bump into,
and say this as far as I move.
35

35

00:01:49.832  -->  00:01:52.560
So let's have a look at our world
that we've got here at the moment.
36

36

00:01:52.560  -->  00:01:54.330
We've got our background.
37

37

00:01:54.330  -->  00:01:55.490
I'm gonna make a little
bit of our background,
38

38

00:01:55.490  -->  00:01:57.470
I'm gonna say what
are the limits of our game?
39

39

00:01:57.470  -->  00:01:59.922
What are limits of where we can
run within our game at the moment?
40

40

00:01:59.922  -->  00:02:03.930
To do that,
I'm going to grab my tile map and
41

41

00:02:03.930  -->  00:02:08.580
highlight my background
texture that I've got here.
42

42

00:02:08.580  -->  00:02:12.320
And just make sure, this is where I've
seen a few people in the Q&amp;A say,
43

43

00:02:12.320  -->  00:02:14.290
why can't I climb up my ladder?
44

44

00:02:14.290  -->  00:02:16.712
Or why is this, or how has that
disappeared, or where's it going?
45

45

00:02:16.712  -->  00:02:19.330
Nearly always it's cuz the active
tile map is incorrect.
46

46

00:02:19.330  -->  00:02:21.570
So make sure for now we're on background.
47

47

00:02:21.570  -->  00:02:24.126
And I'm going to say,
where do I want my entire world to be?
48

48

00:02:24.126  -->  00:02:25.404
Well, a little bit more to the left,
49

49

00:02:25.404  -->  00:02:27.070
a little bit higher,
a little bit to the right.
50

50

00:02:27.070  -->  00:02:30.105
So, that's gonna be my entire
level that the player can go.
51

51

00:02:30.105  -->  00:02:33.160
And I don't want, as we can see at the
moment, I don't want at any point in time
52

52

00:02:33.160  -->  00:02:36.740
that we can see the bits down below,
or the bits up above.
53

53

00:02:36.740  -->  00:02:37.830
Okay, so we've got that.
54

54

00:02:37.830  -->  00:02:40.010
Also, need to build out my
level a little bit more, so
55

55

00:02:40.010  -->  00:02:41.760
we can actually run a bit more left and
right.
56

56

00:02:41.760  -->  00:02:43.830
So, I'm gonna switch to foreground.
57

57

00:02:43.830  -->  00:02:47.590
And I think this is all my
non tile rule tile stuff.
58

58

00:02:47.590  -->  00:02:51.547
So I need to just quickly go and
create my tool,
59

59

00:02:51.547  -->  00:02:56.625
my rule tile, world in here,
just quickly recreate this.
60

60

00:02:56.625  -->  00:03:00.219
I hadn't done that from before,
that should all be super quick with
61

61

00:03:00.219  -->  00:03:04.560
the rule tile, wow, look at that,
so fast, so wonderful, love it.
62

62

00:03:04.560  -->  00:03:06.510
And then we'll go down to the end here.
63

63

00:03:06.510  -->  00:03:09.750
That's as far as we want our player to go,
maybe even put a little bit of a wall on
64

64

00:03:09.750  -->  00:03:13.960
the side saying,
thou shall not go past there.
65

65

00:03:13.960  -->  00:03:17.260
And then, do the same down this way so
we can run a little bit further and
66

66

00:03:17.260  -->  00:03:19.910
put our wall, oops,
put our wall up on the side.
67

67

00:03:21.960  -->  00:03:25.320
I'm using this, the fill tool here,
68

68

00:03:25.320  -->  00:03:29.440
which I find is really good to be able
to paint a lot of stuff very quickly.
69

69

00:03:29.440  -->  00:03:32.440
Okay so we've got our foreground now,
we've got our background,
70

70

00:03:32.440  -->  00:03:33.910
we'll put this all the way up there.
71

71

00:03:33.910  -->  00:03:36.897
Maybe we can put a roof up here, but
we don't need to do, well, okay,
72

72

00:03:36.897  -->  00:03:38.833
we'll do that, we'll make it a cabin roof.
73

73

00:03:38.833  -->  00:03:42.680
Just for completion of what we're trying
to do in this particular example.
74

74

00:03:42.680  -->  00:03:43.390
Okay, so there we go.
75

75

00:03:43.390  -->  00:03:46.460
We've got our little enclosed level
our player can run around in.
76

76

00:03:46.460  -->  00:03:49.320
We make sure we binded
it on the right layers.
77

77

00:03:49.320  -->  00:03:52.300
Next thing we need to do is to
create ourselves some collision.
78

78

00:03:52.300  -->  00:03:54.640
So, I'm gonna put this on background,
79

79

00:03:54.640  -->  00:03:57.570
my background tile map is
where I will put this.
80

80

00:03:57.570  -->  00:03:59.890
We need to go over and add a component.
81

81

00:03:59.890  -->  00:04:06.780
That component will be a a collider
of 2D type, a Polygon Collider 2D.
82

82

00:04:06.780  -->  00:04:10.795
We'll put that, you'll see this big
Polygon Collider that's been added,
83

83

00:04:10.795  -->  00:04:13.120
the green line there,
we need to edit that.
84

84

00:04:13.120  -->  00:04:17.760
To edit that, we click on
the Edit Collider button, underneath
85

85

00:04:17.760  -->  00:04:21.230
Polygon Collider 2D heading there,
and we can move around these points.
86

86

00:04:21.230  -->  00:04:24.980
I'm going to put my points just inside
87

87

00:04:26.860  -->  00:04:30.090
my wall just here,
on the outside of the wall.
88

88

00:04:30.090  -->  00:04:32.190
So the camera,
this is where I want the camera to go.
89

89

00:04:32.190  -->  00:04:36.090
The camera will see this, but it won't
see anything in the outside of that.
90

90

00:04:36.090  -->  00:04:39.576
Got one too many points here,
it's a five star, five pointed things.
91

91

00:04:39.576  -->  00:04:45.040
So if I click, hold down Ctrl,
and then hit click again, sorry.
92

92

00:04:45.040  -->  00:04:46.400
So, just one more time on that.
93

93

00:04:46.400  -->  00:04:48.690
If you wanna get rid of a point,
hold down Ctrl and
94

94

00:04:48.690  -->  00:04:50.298
then click, that gets through the point.
95

95

00:04:50.298  -->  00:04:53.775
We'll get our other points just where
they need to be around the outside.
96

96

00:04:53.775  -->  00:04:57.990
It doesn't need to be perfect, just needs
to be generally in where we want it to be.
97

97

00:04:59.120  -->  00:05:00.250
Okay, that's looking pretty,
98

98

00:05:00.250  -->  00:05:05.530
good there we have our collider, that is
going around the outside of our level.
99

99

00:05:05.530  -->  00:05:11.320
Now we have our collider, if we jump
back over into our Virtual Camera,
100

100

00:05:11.320  -->  00:05:15.340
scroll down, and where it says
Bounding Box Shape, 2D Collider.
101

101

00:05:15.340  -->  00:05:20.200
Drag in the entire background layer
in there, it contains that collider.
102

102

00:05:20.200  -->  00:05:23.110
Now it knows,
you can see this yellow line has appeared.
103

103

00:05:23.110  -->  00:05:27.380
That the Virtual Camera now knows that
is the boundaries of where I can and
104

104

00:05:27.380  -->  00:05:28.081
can not go.
105

105

00:05:28.081  -->  00:05:30.622
If we try to play now, the characters
going to fall through the wall, and
106

106

00:05:30.622  -->  00:05:32.850
I think he'll just randomly disappear.
107

107

00:05:32.850  -->  00:05:37.870
Yep, just kind of some weird behavior
going on there because our character
108

108

00:05:37.870  -->  00:05:40.480
is colliding with the background,
which we don't want it to do.
109

109

00:05:40.480  -->  00:05:41.997
And the background is
colliding with itself, so
110

110

00:05:41.997  -->  00:05:43.218
there's all this collision going on,
111

111

00:05:43.218  -->  00:05:45.000
so we need to have a look at
our physics collisions rules.
112

112

00:05:45.000  -->  00:05:48.734
We do that by going up to Edit &gt;
Project Settings &gt; Physics 2D.
113

113

00:05:48.734  -->  00:05:51.590
And we can see down at the bottom here,
a Layer Collision Matrix.
114

114

00:05:51.590  -->  00:05:54.100
So this is the layers that
we've set up at the moment,
115

115

00:05:54.100  -->  00:05:57.070
and you can see we've got Default,
Transparent Effects, etc.
116

116

00:05:57.070  -->  00:06:00.500
The only ones that we've set up
have been Ground and Climbing,
117

117

00:06:00.500  -->  00:06:04.370
we don't have anything, any information
in here for Background or for the Player.
118

118

00:06:04.370  -->  00:06:08.199
So that's our next step,
click back on to the Player,
119

119

00:06:08.199  -->  00:06:12.878
and head up to Layer at the top of
your Inspector there, Add Layer.
120

120

00:06:12.878  -->  00:06:16.273
And I'm gonna add for
my Layer 10, Player, and then for
121

121

00:06:16.273  -->  00:06:19.130
my User Layer 11 I'm
going to add Background.
122

122

00:06:20.590  -->  00:06:26.250
And then back over to Player, I'm gonna
change the layer to number 10 Player.
123

123

00:06:26.250  -->  00:06:30.858
And then over to my Background tile map,
I'm gonna change that layer to, number 11,
124

124

00:06:30.858  -->  00:06:31.617
Background.
125

125

00:06:31.617  -->  00:06:33.680
Now we need to go back into our physics.
126

126

00:06:33.680  -->  00:06:38.955
So, Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Physics 2D,
back down to our Matrix, and
127

127

00:06:38.955  -->  00:06:45.150
we can see which of all of our layers is
allowed to collide with the other layers.
128

128

00:06:45.150  -->  00:06:48.140
The first thing I'm gonna look at is
my Background here and my Player.
129

129

00:06:48.140  -->  00:06:50.950
So I don't want this collision here,
I don't want my Player
130

130

00:06:50.950  -->  00:06:54.330
colliding with my Background, and
we can probably leave it at that.
131

131

00:06:54.330  -->  00:06:57.720
You know what I am gonna do,
is I'm gonna say, at this point in time,
132

132

00:06:57.720  -->  00:06:59.720
nothing needs to collide
with the Background.
133

133

00:06:59.720  -->  00:07:02.210
I don't see any reason that something
should bounce into the Background,
134

134

00:07:02.210  -->  00:07:03.910
so let's just turn it all off.
135

135

00:07:03.910  -->  00:07:07.690
We can come in later on and finesse this
a little bit more as we need to, but for
136

136

00:07:07.690  -->  00:07:12.810
now that should be all we need
to do to have our Player and
137

137

00:07:12.810  -->  00:07:14.930
our camera function
the way it's supposed to.
138

138

00:07:14.930  -->  00:07:18.470
Okay, so now we have our Player,
make our game screen is a bit bigger here.
139

139

00:07:18.470  -->  00:07:21.230
We have our Player,
actually I'll leave them both here so
140

140

00:07:21.230  -->  00:07:22.670
we can see what's going
on with our camera.
141

141

00:07:22.670  -->  00:07:26.550
As we run to the left, you can see that
our camera doesn't continue to move cuz
142

142

00:07:26.550  -->  00:07:29.130
it's stopped by the Bounding Box
on the left there.
143

143

00:07:29.130  -->  00:07:32.590
It's stopped by the collision, as we run
to to the right, we get to our dead zone.
144

144

00:07:32.590  -->  00:07:35.760
We scroll up and
then the camera will move along and
145

145

00:07:35.760  -->  00:07:40.090
follow us, until again, it bumps into
the end, and it doesn't go any further.
146

146

00:07:40.090  -->  00:07:44.320
Which is a really, really cool piece
of functionality to give our world,
147

147

00:07:44.320  -->  00:07:47.780
that feeling, that the player knows,
okay, well, this is clearly the end.
148

148

00:07:47.780  -->  00:07:50.810
I cannot go any further there cuz
the camera has stopped moving,
149

149

00:07:50.810  -->  00:07:53.100
which is a really,
really nice way of looking at it.
150

150

00:07:53.100  -->  00:07:56.951
And as the final step, make sure that we
jump over into our Prefabs folder and
151

151

00:07:56.951  -->  00:07:59.133
drag our Cameras in there and prefab that.
152

152

00:07:59.133  -->  00:08:01.190
We should be prefabbing
everything at some point.
153

153

00:08:01.190  -->  00:08:03.020
We'll be creating our next levels and
154

154

00:08:03.020  -->  00:08:05.744
we need to make sure that these
are all nice prefabs ready to go.
155

155

00:08:05.744  -->  00:08:07.529
Why not prefab our tile map?
156

156

00:08:07.529  -->  00:08:11.469
Well, this is all data about
this particular level.
157

157

00:08:11.469  -->  00:08:16.277
So if we prefab background, then if we
make another level where we're using
158

158

00:08:16.277  -->  00:08:21.250
that background tile map, then we would
be overwriting this particular one.
159

159

00:08:21.250  -->  00:08:24.540
So, we're gonna have to have a different
system for how we create our prefabs and
160

160

00:08:24.540  -->  00:08:25.990
set up our different layers.
161

161

00:08:25.990  -->  00:08:29.370
But for now we can leave them not
being prefab, we'll prefab our camera.
162

162

00:08:29.370  -->  00:08:32.410
The challenge for you in this
video is to confine your camera.
163

163

00:08:32.410  -->  00:08:34.860
Add enough sandbox game level for
your camera.
164

164

00:08:34.860  -->  00:08:38.370
So, as I did make the sides and
the walls and the background,
165

165

00:08:38.370  -->  00:08:42.714
add a collision to your background layer,
as we did with the Polygon Collider 2D.
166

166

00:08:42.714  -->  00:08:44.810
And then to update your physics layer,
167

167

00:08:44.810  -->  00:08:48.470
particularly to make sure that
the player is on a player layer, and
168

168

00:08:48.470  -->  00:08:51.770
that the player and the background
aren't bumping into each other.
169

169

00:08:51.770  -->  00:08:52.960
So that's your challenge,
170

170

00:08:52.960  -->  00:08:55.090
you've probably already done it
as we're going through the video.
171

171

00:08:55.090  -->  00:08:58.180
If not, jump in and do that now, and
I will see you in the next video.
