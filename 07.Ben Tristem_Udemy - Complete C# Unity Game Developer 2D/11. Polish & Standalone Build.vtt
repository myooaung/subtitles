2

00:00:04.252  -->  00:00:07.589
Hello, in this video, we're gonna
be creating a standalone build,
3

3

00:00:07.589  -->  00:00:08.550
Number Wizard UI.
4

4

00:00:08.550  -->  00:00:13.480
I've called mine, that when we click and
play, it takes us into a standalone build.
5

5

00:00:13.480  -->  00:00:15.739
We've added a Quit button,
so we can quit out of it.
6

6

00:00:15.739  -->  00:00:19.070
We can play all the way through our game,
and it all works.
7

7

00:00:19.070  -->  00:00:21.990
We’re putting in the funnel, it’s little
bits of polish in terms of color and
8

8

00:00:21.990  -->  00:00:23.020
text as well.
9

9

00:00:23.020  -->  00:00:27.080
And when we click on Quit,
that takes us out of the game.
10

10

00:00:27.080  -->  00:00:29.010
Okay, let’s get cracking.
11

11

00:00:29.010  -->  00:00:30.810
When creating a standalone build for
your game,
12

12

00:00:30.810  -->  00:00:33.750
it’s good form to provide some way for
people to quit.
13

13

00:00:33.750  -->  00:00:35.880
So we’re gonna add a Quit button here.
14

14

00:00:35.880  -->  00:00:40.438
Start off, I’m in my Start menu scene,
I’ve switched over to that.
15

15

00:00:40.438  -->  00:00:44.496
I'm gonna duplicate my Start button,
so you just Ctrl+D or Cmd+D.
16

16

00:00:44.496  -->  00:00:47.230
Now instead of Start button,
we will call this Quit button.
17

17

00:00:48.920  -->  00:00:54.120
Quit button, doink doink doink,move
our Quit button down a little bit
18

18

00:00:54.120  -->  00:00:59.504
below the Start button and re-change
the font on here from Start, okay.
19

19

00:00:59.504  -->  00:01:01.598
I know it's a bit of a pain to
update all these names, but
20

20

00:01:01.598  -->  00:01:03.540
it really does help us
out in the long run.
21

21

00:01:03.540  -->  00:01:05.840
We will name this Quit,
we'll have it a little bit smaller.
22

22

00:01:05.840  -->  00:01:08.310
We don't want people to think
that Quit is the main event.
23

23

00:01:09.410  -->  00:01:14.170
Change this down to say 70 or maybe
even smaller than that, 60 font size.
24

24

00:01:14.170  -->  00:01:17.620
Okay, good, Start and Quit,
make the button a little bit smaller,
25

25

00:01:17.620  -->  00:01:21.300
I think, in Quit and Quit.
26

26

00:01:21.300  -->  00:01:26.182
Okay, there we go, so if I've got
a Start button and a Quit button.
27

27

00:01:26.182  -->  00:01:29.704
Change the color of the Quit button,
so it's a little bit more of a red,
28

28

00:01:29.704  -->  00:01:31.650
warning-y kind of thing.
29

29

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:34.930
Okay, there we go, I'm not gonna spend
a ton of time finessing my colors.
30

30

00:01:34.930  -->  00:01:38.310
I'll leave that up to you to
make your game look beautiful.
31

31

00:01:38.310  -->  00:01:41.860
My game is functional at the moment,
that is what I'm going for.
32

32

00:01:41.860  -->  00:01:44.370
Okay, so now, when we click on Quit,
what do we wanna have happen?
33

33

00:01:44.370  -->  00:01:45.450
We wanna have quit.
34

34

00:01:45.450  -->  00:01:47.590
Where do we manage that
in our scene loader?
35

35

00:01:47.590  -->  00:01:49.540
We have our scene loader script.
36

36

00:01:49.540  -->  00:01:51.870
Let's fire up our scene loader script.
37

37

00:01:51.870  -->  00:01:53.900
We can see, we've got a couple
of public methods in here.
38

38

00:01:53.900  -->  00:01:54.703
What do we need to do?
39

39

00:01:54.703  -->  00:01:57.643
If you were to pause the video now and
figure out what we would need to do,
40

40

00:01:57.643  -->  00:01:58.930
what do you think you would do?
41

41

00:02:00.180  -->  00:02:04.120
You would create a new method that's
a public method that allows us to quit.
42

42

00:02:04.120  -->  00:02:04.990
How do we do that?
43

43

00:02:04.990  -->  00:02:07.920
Let's have a quick look at
the unity docs for our code.
44

44

00:02:07.920  -->  00:02:10.510
We're looking for Application.Quit.
45

45

00:02:10.510  -->  00:02:14.260
Now, a really good point here,
this is ignored in the editor.
46

46

00:02:14.260  -->  00:02:17.210
This is only when we make a standalone
build that the Quit button
47

47

00:02:17.210  -->  00:02:18.120
will do anything.
48

48

00:02:18.120  -->  00:02:21.881
In the editor, we just can't quit like
that, and also, in the docs here,
49

49

00:02:21.881  -->  00:02:25.765
there's a caveat that be careful if
you're doing this for iOS, or Android,
50

50

00:02:25.765  -->  00:02:29.509
or anywhere there's gonna be rules
about how people are allowed to quit.
51

51

00:02:29.509  -->  00:02:33.242
But this is good for us while
we're creating standalone PC, Mac,
52

52

00:02:33.242  -->  00:02:36.020
Linux builds to be able
to let people quit.
53

53

00:02:36.020  -->  00:02:37.618
Okay, so we need Application.Quit.
54

54

00:02:37.618  -->  00:02:45.023
Let's create ourselves a public void,
let's say QuitGame.
55

55

00:02:45.023  -->  00:02:50.023
We'll call this, and
we need to not pass in anything,
56

56

00:02:50.023  -->  00:02:54.156
our curly braces, Application.Quit, and
57

57

00:02:54.156  -->  00:02:58.230
parentheses at the end, semicolon.
58

58

00:02:58.230  -->  00:03:00.180
Okay, now, and we'll save that.
59

59

00:03:00.180  -->  00:03:02.330
I'm just gonna remove my little
bit of white space just there.
60

60

00:03:02.330  -->  00:03:03.300
Okay, save that.
61

61

00:03:03.300  -->  00:03:05.940
We have our public method QuitGame.
62

62

00:03:05.940  -->  00:03:08.270
Back over to our button,
click on our button.
63

63

00:03:08.270  -->  00:03:09.680
Should be a pro at doing this by now.
64

64

00:03:09.680  -->  00:03:13.713
Scene Loader is already connected to
the button cuz that was what we got from
65

65

00:03:13.713  -->  00:03:14.553
duplicating.
66

66

00:03:14.553  -->  00:03:16.360
Whoops, something went wrong there.
67

67

00:03:16.360  -->  00:03:19.610
We need to click Scene Loader and
Quit Game.
68

68

00:03:19.610  -->  00:03:21.740
There we go,
we've made ourselves a Quit button.
69

69

00:03:21.740  -->  00:03:22.710
What else do we need to do here?
70

70

00:03:22.710  -->  00:03:24.790
Well, I've got some challenging points for
you.
71

71

00:03:24.790  -->  00:03:27.783
We need to add text and polish,
add the remaining instructions and
72

72

00:03:27.783  -->  00:03:30.457
text to your game,
tweak your buttons, images, colors,
73

73

00:03:30.457  -->  00:03:33.464
get it to the point where you think
it looks beautiful and amazing.
74

74

00:03:33.464  -->  00:03:36.550
And then we will create a standalone
build, which we will do together.
75

75

00:03:36.550  -->  00:03:40.244
If you know how to do that already, you
can create that without waiting for me.
76

76

00:03:40.244  -->  00:03:41.783
Otherwise we'll do that together.
77

77

00:03:41.783  -->  00:03:45.680
I'll just take a very short amount of
time to add my text and tweak my colors.
78

78

00:03:45.680  -->  00:03:48.490
But if you wanna take a bit more time and
have it look amazing,
79

79

00:03:48.490  -->  00:03:49.800
now is the time to do that.
80

80

00:03:49.800  -->  00:03:52.392
So pause the video and add those elements.
81

81

00:03:54.673  -->  00:03:56.678
Okay, well, first of all,
in our Start menu,
82

82

00:03:56.678  -->  00:03:59.670
we need to tell someone what is
going on and what they need to do.
83

83

00:03:59.670  -->  00:04:04.076
On Canvas, right click UI,
Text Mesh Pro Text.
84

84

00:04:04.076  -->  00:04:07.040
I'll move this up to
the top here a little bit.
85

85

00:04:07.040  -->  00:04:10.030
Anchored to the middle of
the screen is fine for now.
86

86

00:04:10.030  -->  00:04:11.780
I think that's okay.
87

87

00:04:11.780  -->  00:04:15.729
I'm going to change the text in here to,
I'll put in,
88

88

00:04:16.871  -->  00:04:22.280
Quotation marks, Welcome to Number Wizard.
89

89

00:04:25.902  -->  00:04:32.580
Please think of a number between 1 and
1,000.
90

90

00:04:32.580  -->  00:04:34.980
Okay, stretch out our
box a little bit here.
91

91

00:04:34.980  -->  00:04:37.860
Just quick sticks,
not gonna take too long on this.
92

92

00:04:37.860  -->  00:04:40.347
Increase the font size,
80, how's that look?
93

93

00:04:40.347  -->  00:04:44.833
A little bit too big, 60, and
then, we will center a line and
94

94

00:04:44.833  -->  00:04:49.410
middle inside our box,
make the box a little bit neater.
95

95

00:04:49.410  -->  00:04:51.400
Okay, Welcome to Number Wizard.
96

96

00:04:51.400  -->  00:04:53.140
And you can click on that again.
97

97

00:04:53.140  -->  00:04:54.866
W to move it around.
98

98

00:04:54.866  -->  00:04:57.680
That's roughly where I want it.
99

99

00:04:57.680  -->  00:05:00.110
I want these buttons to be
pretty much underneath it.
100

100

00:05:00.110  -->  00:05:04.705
We want the player's line of sight
to come down a flow like this.
101

101

00:05:04.705  -->  00:05:08.380
Okay, numbers between 1 and 1,000,
102

102

00:05:08.380  -->  00:05:13.360
probably need our final quotation
marks on the end of this.
103

103

00:05:13.360  -->  00:05:16.071
Okay, dot, dot, dot, there we go, and
104

104

00:05:16.071  -->  00:05:21.380
of course we need to rename this to
Intro Text or something similar to that.
105

105

00:05:21.380  -->  00:05:26.322
Intro Text, if we click Play,
just make sure that looks okay, and yeah,
106

106

00:05:26.322  -->  00:05:29.692
not too bad,
a little bit ugly background there.
107

107

00:05:29.692  -->  00:05:31.980
I'm just gonna change my background,
click on the camera.
108

108

00:05:31.980  -->  00:05:36.116
I could create an image text box that fits
behind here, that would be fine as well.
109

109

00:05:36.116  -->  00:05:40.706
But now we've changed the camera
background to something a little bit
110

110

00:05:40.706  -->  00:05:45.110
darker and grayer, just so
it's not the default camera.
111

111

00:05:45.110  -->  00:05:46.110
Okay, how does that look?
112

112

00:05:47.750  -->  00:05:49.710
It looks just fine.
113

113

00:05:49.710  -->  00:05:53.660
Okay, what I will do is click on this and
114

114

00:05:53.660  -->  00:05:58.490
copy my hexidecimal code, so I can put
that into the camera in my other scenes.
115

115

00:05:58.490  -->  00:06:01.216
In upcoming sections,
we're gonna talk about prefabbing, so
116

116

00:06:01.216  -->  00:06:02.986
we don't have to do this manual process.
117

117

00:06:02.986  -->  00:06:07.018
But we won't jump into that just yet,
we're gonna do it manual in each of our
118

118

00:06:07.018  -->  00:06:10.688
cameras and feel the pain of why don't
we have a better way to do this?
119

119

00:06:10.688  -->  00:06:14.163
So save,
let's go have a look at our other scenes.
120

120

00:06:14.163  -->  00:06:16.861
We will look at Cool Game,
what do we need to do here?
121

121

00:06:16.861  -->  00:06:20.068
Well, I'm just gonna change the camera
to that new color that I've just
122

122

00:06:20.068  -->  00:06:20.710
come up with.
123

123

00:06:22.150  -->  00:06:26.220
There we go, and you can see
the cameras in each of the scenes and
124

124

00:06:26.220  -->  00:06:30.008
all of these game objects in each
of these scenes are independent.
125

125

00:06:30.008  -->  00:06:32.580
So just cuz we changed
the camera in the first scene
126

126

00:06:32.580  -->  00:06:34.400
doesn't mean the camera
is changed in this scene.
127

127

00:06:34.400  -->  00:06:37.962
We need to go in and change them all
independently at the moment with the way
128

128

00:06:37.962  -->  00:06:39.748
that we've got things structured.
129

129

00:06:39.748  -->  00:06:43.791
And like I said, we'll find a much better
way to do this in upcoming sections of
130

130

00:06:43.791  -->  00:06:45.889
the course, but for now, this is fine.
131

131

00:06:45.889  -->  00:06:47.811
So we've got all the stuff we
need to have written on there.
132

132

00:06:47.811  -->  00:06:51.178
On the win screen, we need to have, again,
133

133

00:06:51.178  -->  00:06:54.728
I'll update my camera,
paste that in there.
134

134

00:06:54.728  -->  00:06:57.690
Okay and what do we wanna have Ben saying?
135

135

00:06:57.690  -->  00:07:03.281
So on Canvas, right click,
we will create UI &gt; TextMeshPro,
136

136

00:07:03.281  -->  00:07:07.615
I'll name this straight away,
Well Done Text.
137

137

00:07:07.615  -->  00:07:12.590
And then here we'll say,
Well done, I don't know why
138

138

00:07:12.590  -->  00:07:16.140
he's saying well done to us, is he,
cuz we were the one who guessed it.
139

139

00:07:16.140  -->  00:07:23.170
So we'll say, I guessed your number.
140

140

00:07:23.170  -->  00:07:26.220
Want to play again?
141

141

00:07:26.220  -->  00:07:29.634
Okay, so it's really not a game per
se that we've got going on here.
142

142

00:07:29.634  -->  00:07:35.305
It is a demonstration of our ability
to create UI in a nice, friendly way.
143

143

00:07:35.305  -->  00:07:39.032
And as we move forward, we'll make things
that are a lot more of a game with game
144

144

00:07:39.032  -->  00:07:42.270
play and decisions for players,
all that kind of good stuff.
145

145

00:07:42.270  -->  00:07:46.580
And we center and
center vertically and horizontally.
146

146

00:07:46.580  -->  00:07:48.620
Move that into an okay position,
147

147

00:07:48.620  -->  00:07:52.710
put the Play Again button lined
up relatively underneath.
148

148

00:07:52.710  -->  00:07:54.360
Okay, a little bit faster
than most with this,
149

149

00:07:54.360  -->  00:07:55.690
don't wanna take too much time on it.
150

150

00:07:55.690  -->  00:07:59.344
Just to show you what I'm doing to make
sure that you can see everything that I've
151

151

00:07:59.344  -->  00:08:00.048
got in my game.
152

152

00:08:00.048  -->  00:08:03.355
We'll click on Play, and
we can click the Play Again button,
153

153

00:08:03.355  -->  00:08:04.940
it takes us into the game.
154

154

00:08:04.940  -->  00:08:06.960
Start or Quit, we'll start.
155

155

00:08:06.960  -->  00:08:08.690
Higher higher higher, success.
156

156

00:08:08.690  -->  00:08:11.220
Success button should be renamed to
something a little bit cleverer.
157

157

00:08:11.220  -->  00:08:15.278
I think I'll do that right now, or else,
it's gonna bug me and bug anyone out there
158

158

00:08:15.278  -->  00:08:18.260
who thinks that Success is not
the right thing to be calling this.
159

159

00:08:18.260  -->  00:08:24.333
We'll just change it to, That's, It.
160

160

00:08:24.333  -->  00:08:28.861
[LAUGH] exclamation mark doesn't work with
this font, but we'll say, That's It or
161

161

00:08:28.861  -->  00:08:29.450
Correct.
162

162

00:08:29.450  -->  00:08:31.040
I'll say Correct.
163

163

00:08:31.040  -->  00:08:33.670
Nice and clean,
instead of saying Success, that's fine,
164

164

00:08:33.670  -->  00:08:35.025
we'll leave it named as it is.
165

165

00:08:35.025  -->  00:08:37.100
It still makes sense, like that.
166

166

00:08:37.100  -->  00:08:41.320
Okay, so Correct, last thing we
wanna do is to create a build.
167

167

00:08:41.320  -->  00:08:44.515
We go up to File&gt; Build Settings.
168

168

00:08:44.515  -->  00:08:47.049
We've got our scenes in there,
make sure you've got your scenes.
169

169

00:08:47.049  -->  00:08:51.273
That's very important 0, 1,
2, where our platform is PC,
170

170

00:08:51.273  -->  00:08:54.420
Mac &amp; Linux Standalone,
click Build and Run.
171

171

00:08:55.780  -->  00:08:56.850
Where are we gonna save that?
172

172

00:08:56.850  -->  00:09:01.340
I'm gonna save mine not
in my repo in here.
173

173

00:09:01.340  -->  00:09:02.894
You can save it wherever you like,
it's fine.
174

174

00:09:02.894  -->  00:09:05.260
I'm just gonna save mine to the desktop.
175

175

00:09:05.260  -->  00:09:08.910
I'm gonna create a new folder in here
which we need to do, New Folder.
176

176

00:09:08.910  -->  00:09:13.040
Number Wizard UI, and
click on that, select folder,
177

177

00:09:13.040  -->  00:09:13.940
that's where it'll be saved.
178

178

00:09:13.940  -->  00:09:16.160
Building and running, it'll take
a little bit of time to do this.
179

179

00:09:16.160  -->  00:09:17.170
Wait for the magic.
180

180

00:09:17.170  -->  00:09:20.989
I'll pause my video and
come back when I finish building, and
181

181

00:09:20.989  -->  00:09:22.616
I'll see you in a moment.
182

182

00:09:22.616  -->  00:09:23.352
Here I am again.
183

183

00:09:23.352  -->  00:09:26.410
I've had a pop up,
which is asking me the configuration.
184

184

00:09:26.410  -->  00:09:29.420
Just leave all that at default and
click on Play.
185

185

00:09:29.420  -->  00:09:33.430
Made with Unity's splash automatically
in there, which is cool.
186

186

00:09:33.430  -->  00:09:37.950
Welcome to Number Wizard, start the game,
higher higher higher, correct, well done,
187

187

00:09:37.950  -->  00:09:41.467
play again, fantastic, quit, and
that does quit us out of the game.
188

188

00:09:41.467  -->  00:09:43.950
So that is a file,
if you go and track that down.
189

189

00:09:44.960  -->  00:09:46.860
Find your folder where
you have saved that.
190

190

00:09:46.860  -->  00:09:50.310
You'll see that you've got
a Number Wizard application.
191

191

00:09:50.310  -->  00:09:54.550
If you were to double click on that, that
is what will allow you to play the game.
192

192

00:09:54.550  -->  00:09:58.650
And you can send that off to someone else,
you can share that, you can host it,
193

193

00:09:58.650  -->  00:10:02.950
all those kinda good things,
Correct, Play Again, and Quit.
194

194

00:10:03.990  -->  00:10:06.040
Ok, so this is the file
that you're interested in.
195

195

00:10:07.880  -->  00:10:10.320
This is the application
that we've just created.
196

196

00:10:10.320  -->  00:10:13.630
Excellent, great work,
you've done the full loop, the full cycle,
197

197

00:10:13.630  -->  00:10:16.130
the full everything on Number Wizard UI.
198

198

00:10:16.130  -->  00:10:19.040
Great work in this section, and
I'll see you again in an upcoming video.
