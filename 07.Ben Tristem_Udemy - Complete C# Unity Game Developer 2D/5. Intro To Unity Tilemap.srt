00:00:03,994  -->  00:00:07,320
In this video, we are gonna be
setting up our tile palette,
2

2

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:10,779
creating a couple of tilemap
layers within our tilemap grid,
3

3

00:00:10,779  -->  00:00:14,903
and then painting a couple of layers
of tile information into our scene and
4

4

00:00:14,903  -->  00:00:19,560
creating a simple platform that might be
something that our character could run and
5

5

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:20,860
jump on in the future.
6

6

00:00:20,860  -->  00:00:23,775
So let's jump in and
create our first tilemaps.
7

7

00:00:24,980  -->  00:00:28,640
If you don't have it on your screen
already, make sure you go to Windows and
8

8

00:00:28,640  -->  00:00:32,750
Tile Palette, to get the Tile Palette,
I've docked mine up here next to my scene,
9

9

00:00:32,750  -->  00:00:37,190
so it's nice cose in hand, you will be
using this a bunch in this lecture.
10

10

00:00:37,190  -->  00:00:40,210
I wanna give you a little bit of
an overview of the Tilemap Pipeline.
11

11

00:00:40,210  -->  00:00:42,060
We started out with our sprite sheet.
12

12

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:45,340
We've sliced it up in the sprite editor.
13

13

00:00:45,340  -->  00:00:47,650
Next we need to create a tile asset.
14

14

00:00:47,650  -->  00:00:52,590
So each of these sliced sprites
will become individual tile.assets.
15

15

00:00:52,590  -->  00:00:57,430
And then we add those tiles
into a tile palette and
16

16

00:00:57,430  -->  00:01:01,780
from the tile palette, we can paint those
into our tilemap, which is our scene.
17

17

00:01:01,780  -->  00:01:05,925
And we can have multiple tilemaps
that act as layers that you can paint
18

18

00:01:07,005  -->  00:01:09,835
within and
then they can fit on top of each other.
19

19

00:01:09,835  -->  00:01:12,755
So that's the pipeline,
let's go in and actually create that.
20

20

00:01:12,755  -->  00:01:15,375
This is the flow we are going to
be going through in this lecture,
21

21

00:01:15,375  -->  00:01:16,165
in terms of creation.
22

22

00:01:16,165  -->  00:01:19,085
It's also the challenge for this lecture,
23

23

00:01:19,085  -->  00:01:22,175
feel free to complete this challenge
as we go along, pausing the video.
24

24

00:01:22,175  -->  00:01:24,875
Or watch the whole way through and
then complete it at the end.
25

25

00:01:24,875  -->  00:01:27,480
Create a foreground and
background Tilemap.
26

26

00:01:27,480  -->  00:01:30,660
Create your tile palette,
format the tile palette.
27

27

00:01:30,660  -->  00:01:33,630
So arrange the tiles if need be if you
want it to be a little bit neater and
28

28

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:34,540
more arranged.
29

29

00:01:34,540  -->  00:01:37,710
And then paint a background and
a couple of simple platforms.
30

30

00:01:37,710  -->  00:01:39,150
That's what we'll be going through.
31

31

00:01:39,150  -->  00:01:41,560
Let's jump in and do that.
32

32

00:01:41,560  -->  00:01:47,090
Step number one is to right-click in the
hierarchy, go to 2D Object and Tilemap.
33

33

00:01:47,090  -->  00:01:48,780
That creates for us a grid.
34

34

00:01:48,780  -->  00:01:51,930
You can see this grid has
been placed within our scene
35

35

00:01:51,930  -->  00:01:56,060
that has a whole bunch of cells in it,
a la a grid, which is very cool.
36

36

00:01:56,060  -->  00:01:58,550
And underneath that,
it has our first tilemap.
37

37

00:01:58,550  -->  00:02:02,407
We're gonna rename
the tilemap to Background,
38

38

00:02:02,407  -->  00:02:07,590
right-click on Grid and
create a second Tilemap and
39

39

00:02:07,590  -->  00:02:13,730
I will call this one, you guessed it,
Foreground, Foreground.
40

40

00:02:13,730  -->  00:02:15,170
I'm also gonna rename our grid,
41

41

00:02:15,170  -->  00:02:19,250
just to be really clear here I'm
gonna rename this Tilemap Grid.
42

42

00:02:19,250  -->  00:02:23,679
So this is where all of our tilemaps will
live within this particular grid in here.
43

43

00:02:23,679  -->  00:02:28,162
The next step is for us to jump over our
Tile Palette and create a new palette.
44

44

00:02:28,162  -->  00:02:30,601
So right, sorry, sorry,
click on Create New Palette.
45

45

00:02:30,601  -->  00:02:34,777
I'm going to call this Manual Tiles
because in the future we'll have
46

46

00:02:34,777  -->  00:02:36,720
an automatic tile set up.
47

47

00:02:36,720  -->  00:02:38,080
So we'll call this Manual Tiles.
48

48

00:02:38,080  -->  00:02:40,450
That will all become
clearer in later videos.
49

49

00:02:40,450  -->  00:02:42,520
It'll ask us where we
would like to save this.
50

50

00:02:42,520  -->  00:02:44,520
I'm gonna create a new folder.
51

51

00:02:44,520  -->  00:02:47,630
Actually while I'm in here,
which is a Tiles folder and
52

52

00:02:47,630  -->  00:02:50,330
all things tiles I will drop in there.
53

53

00:02:50,330  -->  00:02:52,450
We tend not to have to
access the Tiles folder but
54

54

00:02:52,450  -->  00:02:53,998
it's good to know where they are.
55

55

00:02:56,333  -->  00:03:00,630
Okay, so now we have our Tiles
folder with our tilemap, sorry,
56

56

00:03:00,630  -->  00:03:02,570
our manual Tile Palette.
57

57

00:03:02,570  -->  00:03:05,060
This is a prefab, you can see down here.
58

58

00:03:06,270  -->  00:03:09,010
Next step is for
us to find our sprite sheet.
59

59

00:03:10,030  -->  00:03:12,370
We'll use the background one first and
60

60

00:03:12,370  -->  00:03:17,370
drag that into our tile palette and
it will ask us where we wanna save that.
61

61

00:03:17,370  -->  00:03:21,850
This is more tiles, so double-click
into Tiles, select that folder.
62

62

00:03:21,850  -->  00:03:23,910
It's generating these as tile assets, so
63

63

00:03:23,910  -->  00:03:27,460
it's converting or
creating from the sprite,
64

64

00:03:27,460  -->  00:03:30,560
it's creating actual tile assets,
you can see them in our tile palette.
65

65

00:03:30,560  -->  00:03:32,010
If you go into the tiles folder,
66

66

00:03:32,010  -->  00:03:36,180
you can see these as individual, I'll just
expand this a little bit, so we can see.
67

67

00:03:36,180  -->  00:03:42,790
Individual.asset file, so each of these is
now a tile file, a tile file as a .asset.
68

68

00:03:42,790  -->  00:03:45,760
There's a little bit of
information we can tweak on it.
69

69

00:03:45,760  -->  00:03:49,840
We can change its color tinting and we can
change its collider type, not a lot going
70

70

00:03:49,840  -->  00:03:54,500
on there but a little, bit of manipulation
we can do to each of these assets.
71

71

00:03:54,500  -->  00:03:59,446
Now, in the tile palette, this is where we
can do some cool stuff within our scene.
72

72

00:03:59,446  -->  00:04:04,030
If you were to click on the top left and
jump into your scene and
73

73

00:04:04,030  -->  00:04:07,690
start painting, then we are painting
these tiles into our scene.
74

74

00:04:07,690  -->  00:04:10,170
And you can see something
a little bit weird's going on.
75

75

00:04:10,170  -->  00:04:13,570
It is allowing us to create
one tile per grid square but
76

76

00:04:13,570  -->  00:04:15,290
the tile's not the right size.
77

77

00:04:15,290  -->  00:04:19,890
So we go back to our sprite sheet, which
we sliced up previously where it says,
78

78

00:04:19,890  -->  00:04:22,140
what is the pixels per unit?
79

79

00:04:22,140  -->  00:04:24,920
When it comes to this is one unit,
it's saying, well,
80

80

00:04:24,920  -->  00:04:27,350
how many pixels belong to that one unit.
81

81

00:04:27,350  -->  00:04:31,860
We are going to say 32 cuz that's
the size of our individual sprites and
82

82

00:04:31,860  -->  00:04:33,810
then click on Apply.
83

83

00:04:33,810  -->  00:04:37,810
And that automatically makes it
fit nicely into our tile palette.
84

84

00:04:37,810  -->  00:04:40,690
I'll do that for the other sprite
sheet while I'm here and I remember.
85

85

00:04:40,690  -->  00:04:42,430
So I change that to 32.
86

86

00:04:42,430  -->  00:04:47,400
And if you grabbed the tile asset
straight from our asset pack provider,
87

87

00:04:47,400  -->  00:04:51,660
you will need to make this 16
because those assets are 16 by 16.
88

88

00:04:51,660  -->  00:04:53,420
I've gone and increased the size.
89

89

00:04:53,420  -->  00:04:57,600
I've doubled the size of our assets that
we'll be using, that I've provided for
90

90

00:04:57,600  -->  00:05:00,430
you, just so that we've got a little
bit more fidelity on there.
91

91

00:05:00,430  -->  00:05:03,490
Okay, so, within our tile palette,
the normal rule is you can scroll in and
92

92

00:05:03,490  -->  00:05:06,500
out and move around the same
way you would in a scene.
93

93

00:05:06,500  -->  00:05:09,910
We're going to paint into our
background scene a little bit more.
94

94

00:05:09,910  -->  00:05:11,140
We're gonna paint a background.
95

95

00:05:11,140  -->  00:05:14,130
Now, make sure your active
tilemap is Background.
96

96

00:05:14,130  -->  00:05:16,420
If you're painting onto the foreground,
97

97

00:05:16,420  -->  00:05:22,150
then it will be physically painting on
to this foreground tilemap layer here.
98

98

00:05:22,150  -->  00:05:25,390
If we're painting on a background,
it will paint on there.
99

99

00:05:25,390  -->  00:05:30,500
Clicking on the individual tilemap itself
doesn't change where you paint to,
100

100

00:05:30,500  -->  00:05:32,460
it's only over here that
changes where you paint to.
101

101

00:05:32,460  -->  00:05:36,480
This is just inspecting it,
it's not saying where we are painting to.
102

102

00:05:36,480  -->  00:05:38,440
So we're painting to
the Active Tilemap background.
103

103

00:05:38,440  -->  00:05:43,260
We will click on the, let's see,
we'll grab four of these.
104

104

00:05:43,260  -->  00:05:47,010
Go over into our scene and we can
paint four of these wherever we like.
105

105

00:05:47,010  -->  00:05:49,100
Which is cool,
we could grab these four and
106

106

00:05:49,100  -->  00:05:51,510
paint four like that and
build it up manually.
107

107

00:05:51,510  -->  00:05:56,060
We could grab this entire area and
that allows us to paint a big chunk and
108

108

00:05:56,060  -->  00:06:03,170
we can move it along and paint bit by bit
or we can click on the filled box tool and
109

109

00:06:03,170  -->  00:06:07,980
then highlight all of our background
which was nicely tiled and
110

110

00:06:07,980  -->  00:06:12,560
drag it all the way over our area and
you can see it is tiled nicely and
111

111

00:06:12,560  -->  00:06:13,530
it feels out our whole background.
112

112

00:06:13,530  -->  00:06:15,960
If we wanted to, we could zoom the whole
way out and say you know what,
113

113

00:06:15,960  -->  00:06:19,000
I think our level is going
to be about that big.
114

114

00:06:19,000  -->  00:06:21,690
And then make a background for
that entire area.
115

115

00:06:21,690  -->  00:06:26,470
I'm going to undo that for now,
we don't need it to be all that size yet.
116

116

00:06:26,470  -->  00:06:29,780
You can see the white line is where
our camera is currently viewing.
117

117

00:06:29,780  -->  00:06:32,665
If I click on main camera,
you can see it in here.
118

118

00:06:32,665  -->  00:06:35,605
If you wanted to have a view that was
a little bit more zoomed out then you
119

119

00:06:35,605  -->  00:06:37,435
could just increase
the size of you camera.
120

120

00:06:37,435  -->  00:06:40,785
You can see the preview is being zoomed
out and the window is being zoomed out.
121

121

00:06:40,785  -->  00:06:43,375
We'll spend a bunch of time on
our camera a little bit later on.
122

122

00:06:43,375  -->  00:06:46,915
So for now, I'm just going to leave
it at five and not worry just yet
123

123

00:06:46,915  -->  00:06:50,265
about how large I want my
assets to appear on the screen.
124

124

00:06:51,950  -->  00:06:53,410
Now the next step in this process is for
125

125

00:06:53,410  -->  00:06:55,790
us to make some platforms
in the foreground.
126

126

00:06:55,790  -->  00:07:00,980
I'm going to zoom out a little bit here
and drag in my other sprite sheet.
127

127

00:07:00,980  -->  00:07:02,570
And again, you can see wherever I drag it,
128

128

00:07:02,570  -->  00:07:06,900
it'll literally place that sprite
sheet with the layout in that spot.
129

129

00:07:06,900  -->  00:07:10,430
Click on tiles cuz it's creating
our tile assets, wait for
130

130

00:07:10,430  -->  00:07:14,450
it to generate those and then we will
see a range in our tile pallet here,
131

131

00:07:14,450  -->  00:07:18,550
we've got the exact sprite sheet all
plugged in there nice and neatly.
132

132

00:07:18,550  -->  00:07:22,070
Now here's where you can rearrange
your tile pallet a little bit,
133

133

00:07:22,070  -->  00:07:25,160
so that you can easily find things.
134

134

00:07:25,160  -->  00:07:28,820
You can see here, we've got these
top areas, we've got a upper left,
135

135

00:07:28,820  -->  00:07:30,200
we've got a bottom left.
136

136

00:07:30,200  -->  00:07:33,930
The botton spots of our platform,
so click on the top left and
137

137

00:07:33,930  -->  00:07:35,910
then I'll paint that in our scene here.
138

138

00:07:35,910  -->  00:07:38,990
Now you might have painted that and
you don't know where it is hiding.
139

139

00:07:38,990  -->  00:07:42,550
I fiddled around with this a little bit,
so this is now appearing on top.
140

140

00:07:42,550  -->  00:07:47,710
But we have an issue now where
we need to tell our Tilemap
141

141

00:07:47,710  -->  00:07:51,450
layers how to render in
relation to one another.
142

142

00:07:51,450  -->  00:07:53,050
So we've go our foreground and
our background.
143

143

00:07:53,050  -->  00:07:55,780
If you have a look over her
on the tarmac renderer,
144

144

00:07:55,780  -->  00:07:58,850
you can see there is a sorting order
which is currently default and
145

145

00:07:58,850  -->  00:08:01,830
an ordering layer which
is 0 on each of these.
146

146

00:08:01,830  -->  00:08:05,160
If I was to go and
change the foreground to say 1,
147

147

00:08:05,160  -->  00:08:08,620
then it should appear over
the top of the background.
148

148

00:08:08,620  -->  00:08:12,600
If I was to change this to -1 then
it should appear underneath and
149

149

00:08:12,600  -->  00:08:16,450
I would only see that if I was to turn
off the background and there they are.
150

150

00:08:16,450  -->  00:08:21,890
So it's one way to manipulate the order of
your layers, we're gonna use a different
151

151

00:08:21,890  -->  00:08:26,790
way that I think has a lot more
scalability, then that approach there.
152

152

00:08:26,790  -->  00:08:30,940
I want you to go up to Layers up
in the top right of your screen,
153

153

00:08:30,940  -->  00:08:34,770
click on Edit Layers and
here you'll see a few areas.
154

154

00:08:34,770  -->  00:08:38,440
You've got tags, we've used tags a little
bit in the past and you can add new tags.
155

155

00:08:38,440  -->  00:08:43,350
That's good from within code to say,
this thing is a such-and-such type,
156

156

00:08:43,350  -->  00:08:46,350
as a tag or such-and-such tag,
not necessarily a type.
157

157

00:08:46,350  -->  00:08:47,830
And we've got sorting layers and
158

158

00:08:47,830  -->  00:08:49,850
that's gonna be the focus
of what we want to do here.
159

159

00:08:49,850  -->  00:08:54,320
We've also got this nice and
ambiguously named [LAUGH] layers.
160

160

00:08:54,320  -->  00:08:58,180
And for us, we're gonna be using these
layers when it comes to collision and
161

161

00:08:58,180  -->  00:09:02,330
things to do with physics,
to say what bumps int what.
162

162

00:09:02,330  -->  00:09:06,000
When it comes to displaying, to rendering,
we're gonna be using sorting layers, so
163

163

00:09:06,000  -->  00:09:08,190
we're gonna go ahead and
create a new layer.
164

164

00:09:08,190  -->  00:09:10,160
I'll call this Background.
165

165

00:09:10,160  -->  00:09:15,370
And then also create another layer
which we will call Foreground.
166

166

00:09:15,370  -->  00:09:17,820
Now the strength of doing it this way,
167

167

00:09:17,820  -->  00:09:22,480
is that we can really easily rearrange the
order of this, so if we get them wrong or
168

168

00:09:22,480  -->  00:09:27,560
if we wanna add a new layer then it is
very, very easy just in this one place
169

169

00:09:27,560  -->  00:09:32,550
to change the sorting of everything
that happens across our entire game.
170

170

00:09:32,550  -->  00:09:34,550
If I click on background,
171

171

00:09:34,550  -->  00:09:38,110
then we will see over here we've
got the option sorting layer.
172

172

00:09:38,110  -->  00:09:41,510
We'll make this sorting layer as
background and then over on foreground,
173

173

00:09:41,510  -->  00:09:43,690
we'll make the sorting
layer as foreground.
174

174

00:09:43,690  -->  00:09:47,930
And because we've set up in
our layers that the background
175

175

00:09:49,040  -->  00:09:52,800
is underneath the foreground,
it has displayed it like that.
176

176

00:09:52,800  -->  00:09:56,010
So, whatever is on the bottom
is gonna be displayed first.
177

177

00:09:56,010  -->  00:09:57,210
Now the next step in the process,
178

178

00:09:57,210  -->  00:10:00,350
I'm going to rearrange my tilemap,
my tile palette just a little bit.
179

179

00:10:00,350  -->  00:10:03,020
Now I'll show you how to do that,
so you can do that yourself.
180

180

00:10:03,020  -->  00:10:07,110
If we click on the Edit button here,
right at the top of your
181

181

00:10:07,110  -->  00:10:10,130
tile palette is an edit button,
very important to click on that.
182

182

00:10:10,130  -->  00:10:13,020
Now we can move things
around in our palette.
183

183

00:10:13,020  -->  00:10:15,070
Basically, we can paint and copy and move.
184

184

00:10:15,070  -->  00:10:19,700
So we click on the Selection Tool, then
click on the tile we're interested in.
185

185

00:10:20,730  -->  00:10:22,260
Click on the move tool.
186

186

00:10:22,260  -->  00:10:25,250
We can now drag and
move this to another position.
187

187

00:10:25,250  -->  00:10:28,870
So it's a block that belongs on its own,
just a one-piece platform.
188

188

00:10:28,870  -->  00:10:29,730
Put it over there.
189

189

00:10:29,730  -->  00:10:36,310
We can also click on these
other kind of vertical pieces,
190

190

00:10:36,310  -->  00:10:39,940
move those to the side, get them out of
the way, a little bit over there as well.
191

191

00:10:39,940  -->  00:10:43,430
And you can of course click Select,
click Select,
192

192

00:10:43,430  -->  00:10:47,800
highlight a bunch of these and
move them all together which is cool.
193

193

00:10:47,800  -->  00:10:52,162
So I will select my block in here,
this will become apparent in a moment,
194

194

00:10:52,162  -->  00:10:53,244
move that aside.
195

195

00:10:53,244  -->  00:10:56,400
Okay, so I'm not gonna do too
much more finessing with that.
196

196

00:10:56,400  -->  00:10:58,910
I will just get these guys out of the way,
so
197

197

00:10:58,910  -->  00:11:02,230
that they are not in the way of
what I am trying to do there.
198

198

00:11:02,230  -->  00:11:05,460
This last couple move them
down into there, okay,
199

199

00:11:05,460  -->  00:11:08,160
you can spend a lot more time finessing
this and laying it out if you want but
200

200

00:11:08,160  -->  00:11:10,110
I'm just gonna do it a little
bit quick at the moment.
201

201

00:11:10,110  -->  00:11:11,120
What we do need to do, though,
202

202

00:11:11,120  -->  00:11:14,760
is figure out a way to be able to paint
down all the pieces we need to paint down.
203

203

00:11:14,760  -->  00:11:17,370
We've got this top left corner,
which we've already painted in there.
204

204

00:11:17,370  -->  00:11:19,790
Just gonna turn off Edit mode for
the moment.
205

205

00:11:19,790  -->  00:11:25,890
I can then click the tiles next to it,
these upper level areas.
206

206

00:11:25,890  -->  00:11:28,800
Click on the paint brush, select those and
207

207

00:11:28,800  -->  00:11:31,660
that will allow me to paint
the top of my platform.
208

208

00:11:31,660  -->  00:11:35,400
Then clean things up a little bit by
erasing these other ones down here.
209

209

00:11:35,400  -->  00:11:39,290
And then we've got our platform that
has a nice corner on the side and
210

210

00:11:39,290  -->  00:11:40,590
a ledge we can run along.
211

211

00:11:40,590  -->  00:11:41,720
What do we do at the right here?
212

212

00:11:41,720  -->  00:11:43,330
Well we can do it two ways.
213

213

00:11:43,330  -->  00:11:48,670
One, we can, first of all,
click on our tile, come in here, paint it.
214

214

00:11:48,670  -->  00:11:51,160
And then we can flip it within our scene.
215

215

00:11:51,160  -->  00:11:54,850
What do I mean by that is if
you select the Select tool,
216

216

00:11:54,850  -->  00:11:57,010
click on the Select tool,
click on your tile.
217

217

00:11:57,010  -->  00:12:01,692
This is now the instance in our scene,
I can scale that using -1 and
218

218

00:12:01,692  -->  00:12:03,510
that will flip that tile.
219

219

00:12:03,510  -->  00:12:08,381
But the process of having to do that every
single time we put that down in a scene is
220

220

00:12:08,381  -->  00:12:13,178
a little bit clunky, so the better way to
do it is to click in our Tilemap, click
221

221

00:12:13,178  -->  00:12:18,280
Edit, click on the Select Tool, click
on the tile piece we're interested in.
222

222

00:12:18,280  -->  00:12:21,030
Paint that down, it automatically
changes to the paint brush.
223

223

00:12:21,030  -->  00:12:25,380
Click that down, go to the Select Tool
again, click back on that piece.
224

224

00:12:25,380  -->  00:12:28,270
Now we can change the scale
in here from 1 to -1.
225

225

00:12:28,270  -->  00:12:33,260
And that will flip that so that we've
now got a platform that we can go and
226

226

00:12:33,260  -->  00:12:34,350
paint into our scene.
227

227

00:12:34,350  -->  00:12:38,530
So I'll click off Edit and
click on the paintbrush,
228

228

00:12:38,530  -->  00:12:42,340
highlight all of those, and
I can now place those into my scene.
229

229

00:12:42,340  -->  00:12:45,420
Likewise, I can do that by
grabbing the bottom left corner.
230

230

00:12:45,420  -->  00:12:47,780
Need to click on edit again.
231

231

00:12:48,940  -->  00:12:51,790
Paintbrush, select the dropper tool.
232

232

00:12:51,790  -->  00:12:53,530
And then paint that down.
233

233

00:12:53,530  -->  00:12:57,080
Click back to the selection tool,
click back on our tile piece.
234

234

00:12:57,080  -->  00:12:58,535
And change that to minus one.
235

235

00:12:58,535  -->  00:13:00,610
It's a little bit clunky
to go through that process,
236

236

00:13:00,610  -->  00:13:03,510
but once you get your tile pallet setup,
it's quite nice.
237

237

00:13:03,510  -->  00:13:06,600
Now we don't need to do the same to these
top pieces cuz there are two bottom pieces
238

238

00:13:06,600  -->  00:13:12,030
in our sprite sheet here that
we've got in our tile pallet.
239

239

00:13:12,030  -->  00:13:16,016
We do need to do it for
the two on our left, so I'm gonna select,
240

240

00:13:16,016  -->  00:13:18,090
sorry eye dropper.
241

241

00:13:18,090  -->  00:13:20,700
Drag on those, paint over there,
242

242

00:13:20,700  -->  00:13:25,730
back to select and then change both
of those at the same time to -1.
243

243

00:13:25,730  -->  00:13:30,600
And as a final step in this process, I'll
create, I'll grab this middle piece and
244

244

00:13:30,600  -->  00:13:32,300
drag that into the middle.
245

245

00:13:32,300  -->  00:13:33,940
So I know exactly where it lies.
246

246

00:13:33,940  -->  00:13:36,270
There's a second middle piece in
here that I've created just for
247

247

00:13:36,270  -->  00:13:37,580
a little bit of flavor.
248

248

00:13:37,580  -->  00:13:41,320
I will select that and
then move it next to it as well.
249

249

00:13:41,320  -->  00:13:42,060
Okay, so there we go.
250

250

00:13:42,060  -->  00:13:43,430
We've got a tile pallet.
251

251

00:13:43,430  -->  00:13:45,220
We're paining now the foreground.
252

252

00:13:45,220  -->  00:13:48,020
I want you to go ahead as the last step
in the challenge is just to create
253

253

00:13:48,020  -->  00:13:49,600
a couple of very simple platforms.
254

254

00:13:49,600  -->  00:13:52,420
Please don't over invest
in this because we will be
255

255

00:13:52,420  -->  00:13:54,620
doing an automatic process soon.
256

256

00:13:54,620  -->  00:14:00,000
But for now,
drop down a couple of little platforms.
257

257

00:14:00,000  -->  00:14:02,900
So that we can be creating
the first steps of our platform.
258

258

00:14:02,900  -->  00:14:04,383
So if you do that I will
see you back in a moment.
259

259

00:14:06,578  -->  00:14:09,548
Okay, I'm gonna place down a simple
little platform in here and
260

260

00:14:09,548  -->  00:14:12,738
I'll speed up the video, so
that it's nice and quick watching it and
261

261

00:14:12,738  -->  00:14:13,964
I will see you in a moment.
262

262

00:14:21,290  -->  00:14:22,230
Okay, there we have it.
263

263

00:14:22,230  -->  00:14:26,590
Very simple, kind of platform, ledge,
run along, jump, run along, jump, so
264

264

00:14:26,590  -->  00:14:28,080
that we can get some shape for our level.
265

265

00:14:28,080  -->  00:14:31,590
You can see that I've used these little
rounded corner pieces on the corner here,
266

266

00:14:31,590  -->  00:14:34,210
so that it looks a little bit
more natural, how it flows.
267

267

00:14:34,210  -->  00:14:35,160
And that's it for this video.
268

268

00:14:35,160  -->  00:14:39,060
If you want to share a screenshot of what
you've created, that would be fantastic.
269

269

00:14:39,060  -->  00:14:41,990
I look forward to seeing it and I look
forward to seeing you in the next video
