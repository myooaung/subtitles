00:00:00,012  -->  00:00:05,158
[SOUND] Hello again.
2

2

00:00:05,158  -->  00:00:08,755
In this video we're going to be
using a script to push our character
3

3

00:00:08,755  -->  00:00:11,712
across the screen with a tunable
walk speed variable so
4

4

00:00:11,712  -->  00:00:14,540
we can change just how
fast the character goes.
5

5

00:00:14,540  -->  00:00:16,980
So let's jump in and
make our character move.
6

6

00:00:16,980  -->  00:00:18,050
What to do first?
7

7

00:00:18,050  -->  00:00:20,200
Well we need to create a script.
8

8

00:00:20,200  -->  00:00:21,970
Let's double script in double script.
9

9

00:00:21,970  -->  00:00:24,350
Double script in our click folder,
that doesn't make sense, Rick.
10

10

00:00:24,350  -->  00:00:27,260
Double click in our script folder,
that sounds better.
11

11

00:00:27,260  -->  00:00:30,820
Right click and create C# script.
12

12

00:00:30,820  -->  00:00:32,450
We will call this attacker.
13

13

00:00:33,470  -->  00:00:35,260
It becomes attacker CS.
14

14

00:00:35,260  -->  00:00:37,160
Double click to open up visual studio.
15

15

00:00:38,600  -->  00:00:39,260
And here we go.
16

16

00:00:39,260  -->  00:00:40,650
And you know what, while I remember,
17

17

00:00:40,650  -->  00:00:44,420
I'm gonna jump back over into Unity and
attach that to our lizard.
18

18

00:00:44,420  -->  00:00:48,850
So lizard, we can add component and
look for attacker this way, or
19

19

00:00:48,850  -->  00:00:52,750
we can drag the attacker script on over,
but I'll just do it this way.
20

20

00:00:52,750  -->  00:00:54,850
There we go.
We now have our component.
21

21

00:00:54,850  -->  00:00:57,440
Which is the attacker
script on the lizard.
22

22

00:00:57,440  -->  00:00:58,530
Now what do we wanna do in here?
23

23

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:02,610
First of all, we need the concept of
moving from right to left on the screen.
24

24

00:01:02,610  -->  00:01:07,344
So within update we wanna say move,
move, move, move every frame for update.
25

25

00:01:07,344  -->  00:01:13,082
And I'm gonna show you how to do
that using transform.Translate.
26

26

00:01:13,082  -->  00:01:14,839
Transform.Translate and
27

27

00:01:14,839  -->  00:01:19,500
the way we use this is in brackets to
say which direction we wanna move in.
28

28

00:01:19,500  -->  00:01:21,540
So vector two,
we can do this as vector three.
29

29

00:01:21,540  -->  00:01:25,810
But I'm gonna do it as a vector two,
which is basically just the same as vector
30

30

00:01:25,810  -->  00:01:30,810
three, but without the Zed information,
it just makes it as a vector two.
31

31

00:01:30,810  -->  00:01:32,210
Vector two dot.
32

32

00:01:32,210  -->  00:01:33,570
Now what are our options here?
33

33

00:01:33,570  -->  00:01:37,070
Interestingly the Unity
makes it a bit easier for
34

34

00:01:37,070  -->  00:01:40,370
us to just say what we want our
character to go from right to left.
35

35

00:01:40,370  -->  00:01:44,490
So we just want it to move left,
and there actually is, and
36

36

00:01:44,490  -->  00:01:46,990
here if we go dot we can
see it's got a left option.
37

37

00:01:46,990  -->  00:01:49,410
If you scroll around you can also
see there is a right option,
38

38

00:01:49,410  -->  00:01:50,800
there's an up option.
39

39

00:01:50,800  -->  00:01:53,180
Let's see and there's a down option.
40

40

00:01:53,180  -->  00:01:55,620
So we'll type in left,
that's gonna move our character,
41

41

00:01:55,620  -->  00:01:58,050
just move to the left which is cool.
42

42

00:01:58,050  -->  00:02:01,220
We need to do what so
that it's frame rate independent.
43

43

00:02:01,220  -->  00:02:06,065
We need to multiply it by, you got it,
44

44

00:02:06,065  -->  00:02:09,900
Time.deltaTime and semicolon.
45

45

00:02:09,900  -->  00:02:12,950
We also need to do one more thing in
here so that we can alter the speed, but
46

46

00:02:12,950  -->  00:02:14,895
let's just see that this works okay.
47

47

00:02:14,895  -->  00:02:19,220
Save, jump back over,
we have our lizard, click on play.
48

48

00:02:19,220  -->  00:02:21,800
So it should be saying every
frame move to the left,
49

49

00:02:21,800  -->  00:02:25,210
which is the negative
X I've moved to the left.
50

50

00:02:25,210  -->  00:02:27,210
It's on the negative X.
51

51

00:02:27,210  -->  00:02:28,500
So we'll click play.
52

52

00:02:28,500  -->  00:02:29,440
See what happens here.
53

53

00:02:31,490  -->  00:02:33,230
Jumps out and walk, walk, walk.
54

54

00:02:33,230  -->  00:02:34,180
Excellent.
55

55

00:02:34,180  -->  00:02:37,610
So we do need to do a little bit more
magic when it comes to the movement so
56

56

00:02:37,610  -->  00:02:39,880
that it's not sliding as it jumps out.
57

57

00:02:39,880  -->  00:02:42,860
So there'll be a little bit trickery there
and we'll get deeper into our animation
58

58

00:02:42,860  -->  00:02:46,920
system, and triggering things, and
the relationship between that later on.
59

59

00:02:46,920  -->  00:02:49,180
But for now we just wanna
get our character moving and
60

60

00:02:49,180  -->  00:02:50,230
play around with that.
61

61

00:02:50,230  -->  00:02:53,980
I'm gonna do one more thing cuz I wanna
be able to tune my movement speeds.
62

62

00:02:53,980  -->  00:02:58,410
So I will multiply this
by concept of walkSpeed.
63

63

00:02:58,410  -->  00:03:01,830
So walkSpeed multiplied.
64

64

00:03:01,830  -->  00:03:06,540
WalkSpeed is not created yet so at the top
of our script we will say serialized field
65

65

00:03:08,270  -->  00:03:13,410
float walkSpeed and
we will initialize that at 1f.
66

66

00:03:13,410  -->  00:03:17,460
Okay, now to give ourselves
a little bit of constraint,
67

67

00:03:17,460  -->  00:03:20,410
so we don't go in there and
accidentally do it too fast or too slow.
68

68

00:03:20,410  -->  00:03:24,170
We can give ourselves a slider if you're
working with a designer or an animator or
69

69

00:03:24,170  -->  00:03:25,680
an artist, to make life easier.
70

70

00:03:25,680  -->  00:03:26,610
Let's give it a range.
71

71

00:03:26,610  -->  00:03:32,520
So above or on the same line, before our
variable our serializedField float here,
72

72

00:03:32,520  -->  00:03:35,860
we'll type in range and then parentheses.
73

73

00:03:35,860  -->  00:03:37,760
The lowest we want our
character to go is 0.
74

74

00:03:37,760  -->  00:03:40,380
You can't really go any slower than 0.
75

75

00:03:40,380  -->  00:03:42,970
Maybe you could walk backwards, but
we're not really going for that.
76

76

00:03:42,970  -->  00:03:44,820
And then up to a maximum of, I don't know,
77

77

00:03:44,820  -->  00:03:49,350
I'm just guessing 5f, and
we can change that later on if need be.
78

78

00:03:49,350  -->  00:03:51,310
Sorry, there's no semicolon
at the end of that.
79

79

00:03:51,310  -->  00:03:54,000
So, like I say, you could write it like
that on two different lines to make it
80

80

00:03:54,000  -->  00:03:55,350
a little bit easier to read.
81

81

00:03:55,350  -->  00:03:57,150
Or we could do it on the same line.
82

82

00:03:57,150  -->  00:03:59,130
So then it's all recognizable.
83

83

00:03:59,130  -->  00:04:04,000
Up to you, I'm gonna do it on different
lines, just so I can have it nice and
84

84

00:04:04,000  -->  00:04:05,800
clean and not going too far to the right.
85

85

00:04:05,800  -->  00:04:10,720
So we'll Save, jump back on over,
click on our Lizard game object.
86

86

00:04:10,720  -->  00:04:12,640
Let's see,
the script should take a moment.
87

87

00:04:12,640  -->  00:04:15,770
And then blink,
we have our walk speed from zero to five.
88

88

00:04:15,770  -->  00:04:18,760
So if I put it at zero, click on Play.
89

89

00:04:18,760  -->  00:04:21,880
Should see that the character
stays there in the one spot.
90

90

00:04:21,880  -->  00:04:23,270
Which is good for the jump but
91

91

00:04:23,270  -->  00:04:25,690
then the moment it starts to
walk we'll need to change that.
92

92

00:04:25,690  -->  00:04:29,450
So, like I said there's some trickery
we'll do later on in this section.
93

93

00:04:29,450  -->  00:04:32,220
But if I move it up,
at what speed does it look good?
94

94

00:04:32,220  -->  00:04:34,620
Five seems a bit too fast indeed.
95

95

00:04:34,620  -->  00:04:36,210
Get back here buddy.
96

96

00:04:36,210  -->  00:04:39,720
And I think the one we had it
at is looking pretty good.
97

97

00:04:39,720  -->  00:04:43,900
What we want to do is make sure
there's a good relationship between
98

98

00:04:43,900  -->  00:04:46,970
how fast it's walking and
where the feet are on the screen.
99

99

00:04:46,970  -->  00:04:52,320
So, if the character is moving,
if the animation's moving really fast but
100

100

00:04:52,320  -->  00:04:55,750
the character's not moving at all that
looks like he's doing the moonwalk.
101

101

00:04:55,750  -->  00:04:57,740
He's kind of sliding on the spot.
102

102

00:04:57,740  -->  00:04:59,920
So what we can do there
is look at how fast.
103

103

00:04:59,920  -->  00:05:02,710
First of all from a game play point of
view if we're like okay that's the sort of
104

104

00:05:02,710  -->  00:05:03,560
speed I want him to go.
105

105

00:05:03,560  -->  00:05:08,230
But it looks like he's walking a little
bit too quickly with his animation.
106

106

00:05:08,230  -->  00:05:11,970
So the way we can address that is
to play around within his animation
107

107

00:05:11,970  -->  00:05:16,860
of the samples to change
how fast the animation go.
108

108

00:05:16,860  -->  00:05:19,260
So that's gonna be a little bit of
a challenge I give to you now is tune your
109

109

00:05:19,260  -->  00:05:22,050
walk speed, tune the movement of
the attacker across the screen so
110

110

00:05:22,050  -->  00:05:22,940
you're happy with it.
111

111

00:05:22,940  -->  00:05:24,930
Remember, this guy is a little
bit of a slower, heavier guy.
112

112

00:05:24,930  -->  00:05:28,508
We'll implement some faster
guys as well in a little bit.
113

113

00:05:28,508  -->  00:05:32,420
And then to tune the animation speed
of the walk so the actual arms and
114

114

00:05:32,420  -->  00:05:34,940
legs speed, movement looks pretty good.
115

115

00:05:34,940  -->  00:05:38,030
So take a moment to do that,
don't finesse it super, super long.
116

116

00:05:38,030  -->  00:05:39,650
Just get something that
you're happy with for now.
117

117

00:05:41,940  -->  00:05:45,580
Okay so let's change the walk speed,
now you might have come up against this.
118

118

00:05:45,580  -->  00:05:49,140
I deliberately left this as one of those
gotchas for you to figure out, but
119

119

00:05:49,140  -->  00:05:52,550
I can only see the lizard jump if I change
the samples here then it's the jump
120

120

00:05:52,550  -->  00:05:53,400
that's changing.
121

121

00:05:53,400  -->  00:05:55,970
If you click on lizard jump
you should see lizard walk,
122

122

00:05:55,970  -->  00:05:58,430
which is the other animations
that's attached to the lizard.
123

123

00:05:58,430  -->  00:06:02,306
And we can say well let's
make the walk speed say 18.
124

124

00:06:02,306  -->  00:06:06,273
So when he's actually trundling
along we move at this 18 speed.
125

125

00:06:06,273  -->  00:06:07,643
And I'm gonna change it to scene view so
126

126

00:06:07,643  -->  00:06:10,350
I can follow it and not have to
keep coming backwards and forwards.
127

127

00:06:10,350  -->  00:06:13,540
So that seems to be a plodding,
bloop, bloop, bloop.
128

128

00:06:13,540  -->  00:06:19,658
Okay, and when we go to our speed
here we'll move the walk speed up to,
129

129

00:06:19,658  -->  00:06:24,339
we'll say if it's one [SOUND]
that looks pretty good.
130

130

00:06:24,339  -->  00:06:25,970
I'm gonna leave it that, 18 and 1.
131

131

00:06:25,970  -->  00:06:28,950
And then follow him off the screen.
132

132

00:06:28,950  -->  00:06:31,170
That looks like his feet
aren't really sliding.
133

133

00:06:31,170  -->  00:06:33,000
Good, okay, so pretty happy with that.
134

134

00:06:33,000  -->  00:06:35,260
We've created ourselves
our first attacker.
135

135

00:06:35,260  -->  00:06:37,280
Got him moving from right to left.
136

136

00:06:37,280  -->  00:06:41,270
And in the next video, I think what we're
gonna do is start spawning some attackers.
137

137

00:06:41,270  -->  00:06:42,080
Yeah, let's do that.
138

138

00:06:42,080  -->  00:06:45,520
Okay, so let's jump in in the next video,
and start spawning some attackers.
