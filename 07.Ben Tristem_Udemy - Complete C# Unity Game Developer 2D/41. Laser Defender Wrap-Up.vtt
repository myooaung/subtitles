2

2

00:00:04.177  -->  00:00:06.896
Okay, we're gonna wrap up
the section Laser Defender now.
3

3

00:00:06.896  -->  00:00:10.017
I really wanna be putting more stuff
into the game and more functionality and
4

4

00:00:10.017  -->  00:00:10.711
more features.
5

5

00:00:10.711  -->  00:00:14.483
There's so many things that we can do but
I think that we've got the core of it.
6

6

00:00:14.483  -->  00:00:18.944
We've got a really great cool
gameplay that you can take in so
7

7

00:00:18.944  -->  00:00:21.404
many different directions now.
8

8

00:00:21.404  -->  00:00:25.108
There's so many design leaders to pull
in terms of the type of the enemy and
9

9

00:00:25.108  -->  00:00:27.336
the speed of the enemy and
the projectiles.
10

10

00:00:27.336  -->  00:00:32.297
They're shooting the paths that they
go on, how many enemies are coming out,
11

11

00:00:32.297  -->  00:00:34.340
how much health the player has?
12

12

00:00:34.340  -->  00:00:37.860
How fast the player shoots, or how big
the players bullets are, there's so
13

13

00:00:37.860  -->  00:00:39.185
many things that you can do.
14

14

00:00:39.185  -->  00:00:42.317
You can have you when you shoot an enemy
it explodes at a whole bunch of little
15

15

00:00:42.317  -->  00:00:43.671
things that you need to pick up.
16

16

00:00:43.671  -->  00:00:47.932
Or you could have that instantiate a whole
bunch of other little mini enemies that
17

17

00:00:47.932  -->  00:00:48.632
fly around.
18

18

00:00:48.632  -->  00:00:49.761
That maybe just go [SOUND] and
19

19

00:00:49.761  -->  00:00:51.980
dart straight down on
the screen towards the player.
20

20

00:00:51.980  -->  00:00:53.617
So lots and lots of things you can do.
21

21

00:00:53.617  -->  00:00:58.609
I want you to really let your
creativity get invested in these game.
22

22

00:00:58.609  -->  00:01:02.796
Really think about it and you know what if
you are really into programming then save
23

23

00:01:02.796  -->  00:01:04.505
yourself some extra challenge.
24

24

00:01:04.505  -->  00:01:08.468
How can I make these features to make
this game even better that it is.
25

25

00:01:08.468  -->  00:01:11.666
If you're really into the design side
of things then think about in terms of
26

26

00:01:11.666  -->  00:01:12.746
the player experience.
27

27

00:01:12.746  -->  00:01:17.285
How do you build it so that the waves are
coming in and complimenting each other and
28

28

00:01:17.285  -->  00:01:20.115
making it a really good challenge for
the player.
29

29

00:01:20.115  -->  00:01:23.401
Keeping the player on their toes,
keeping them interested and excited,
30

30

00:01:23.401  -->  00:01:25.312
maybe have a wave that's wave 20 words.
31

31

00:01:25.312  -->  00:01:27.990
A big boss just slowly
comes across the screen and
32

32

00:01:27.990  -->  00:01:30.812
just bombs out a whole bunch
of bombs to the player.
33

33

00:01:30.812  -->  00:01:33.620
So there's a lot you can do if you
wanna flex your design muscles.
34

34

00:01:33.620  -->  00:01:35.641
If you're more into
the artistic side of it,
35

35

00:01:35.641  -->  00:01:38.045
then we introduce particle
effects in this section.
36

36

00:01:38.045  -->  00:01:41.722
And you can really go to town in
creating beautiful particle effects, and
37

37

00:01:41.722  -->  00:01:45.652
explosions, and smoke, and dust, and
all those kind of really cool things.
38

38

00:01:45.652  -->  00:01:47.520
So, really think about it
from that point of view.
39

39

00:01:47.520  -->  00:01:50.992
What you've been excited about in
this section of the course, and
40

40

00:01:50.992  -->  00:01:53.659
what you'd like to put
a little bit more time into.
41

41

00:01:53.659  -->  00:01:56.938
And I really wanna acknowledge you for
all of your hard work,
42

42

00:01:56.938  -->  00:01:59.973
it's no mean feat getting to
this point in a big course.
43

43

00:01:59.973  -->  00:02:01.527
And that means you're
really paying attention,
44

44

00:02:01.527  -->  00:02:03.867
you're committed to what you're up to,
you're committed to learning.
45

45

00:02:03.867  -->  00:02:07.682
So great work, really well done for
all of the hard work that you've put in.
46

46

00:02:07.682  -->  00:02:11.453

participation you've had in the community
47

or giving an answer, or
48

48

00:02:14.393  -->  00:02:15.960
sharing what it is you're up to.
49

49

00:02:15.960  -->  00:02:19.789

wonderful is the fact that people

So thank you very much for

53

53

00:02:29.040  -->  00:02:32.792
And good luck in the next part of
the course, which is gonna be Busch Garden
