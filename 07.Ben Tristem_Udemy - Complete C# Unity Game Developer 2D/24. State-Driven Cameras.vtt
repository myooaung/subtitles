00:00:04.240  -->  00:00:07.620
In this video we're going to
create some different states for
2

2

00:00:07.620  -->  00:00:11.071
our cameras,
based upon the player state animation.
3

3

00:00:11.071  -->  00:00:13.730
So as we run, the camera might
move out a In a little bit and
4

4

00:00:13.730  -->  00:00:15.840
as we climb up the ladder it
might move out a little bit more.
5

5

00:00:15.840  -->  00:00:20.250
And then we stand still and
the camera slowly zooms back in so
6

6

00:00:20.250  -->  00:00:21.760
we can see what's going on.
7

7

00:00:21.760  -->  00:00:25.130
So let's set up some different
cameras based up the players state.
8

8

00:00:25.130  -->  00:00:29.280
The first thing we need to do is hop up
the cinema machine at the top here and
9

9

00:00:29.280  -->  00:00:32.320
to create a state driven camera.
10

10

00:00:32.320  -->  00:00:35.520
This is now going to be
the parent of our cameras.
11

11

00:00:35.520  -->  00:00:40.000
I'm going to drag it underneath
the main cameras but
12

12

00:00:40.000  -->  00:00:42.340
then put underneath that
our virtual camera.
13

13

00:00:42.340  -->  00:00:44.980
So, here is our new order of events,
camera main,
14

14

00:00:44.980  -->  00:00:49.040
camera, at the same level main camera and
our new state driven camera,
15

15

00:00:49.040  -->  00:00:50.510
a little bit of wonky word in here.
16

16

00:00:50.510  -->  00:00:51.760
I'll call this.
17

17

00:00:51.760  -->  00:00:58.120
Our State Driven Camera just like that and
we tend not to mush it all together so
18

18

00:00:58.120  -->  00:01:01.080
I'm gonna just put spaces in there so
State Driven Camera.
19

19

00:01:01.080  -->  00:01:05.080
This in a way is going to operate and
drive and control all of our cameras.
20

20

00:01:05.080  -->  00:01:07.660
Underneath that it's brought
in a Virtual Camera.
21

21

00:01:07.660  -->  00:01:11.383
Sorry we've dragged in our Virtual Camera
and brought in a Cm vCam 1,
22

22

00:01:11.383  -->  00:01:13.034
with the State Driven Camera.
23

23

00:01:13.034  -->  00:01:15.271
I'm gonna delete that just for now so
24

24

00:01:15.271  -->  00:01:18.240
that we can be really
clear on what we're doing.
25

25

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:22.016
I'm gonna duplicate my camera, my virtual
camera as opposed to using the one that
26

26

00:01:22.016  -->  00:01:23.817
came in with the state driven camera.
27

27

00:01:23.817  -->  00:01:26.580
Okay, so
there we've got our structure just there.
28

28

00:01:26.580  -->  00:01:28.200
And if we look at our virtual camera,
29

29

00:01:28.200  -->  00:01:30.630
it's the same old virtual
camera that we've had before.
30

30

00:01:30.630  -->  00:01:35.440
If you clicked on state driven camera,
it now has under here virtual camera
31

31

00:01:35.440  -->  00:01:39.490
children and the critical point is,
any cameras that we want the state driven
32

32

00:01:39.490  -->  00:01:44.740
camera to be controlling have
to be childed to that camera.
33

33

00:01:44.740  -->  00:01:48.570
And we can see in here, Virtual Camera,
which is our virtual camera.
34

34

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:50.450
Okay, so that's a lot of organizing.
35

35

00:01:50.450  -->  00:01:54.410
Hopefully that made sense in terms of our
relationship and our hierarchy there.
36

36

00:01:54.410  -->  00:01:56.330
So we do have our virtual
camera that we've had before.
37

37

00:01:56.330  -->  00:02:01.250
If we click play then it's the only
camera that we have at the moment so
38

38

00:02:01.250  -->  00:02:04.380
it's gonna do its normal thing and
run around as we have been doing.
39

39

00:02:04.380  -->  00:02:08.230
So, we're not gonna lose anything if
we just wanna stop at that point,
40

40

00:02:08.230  -->  00:02:10.539
that's all well and
[INAUDIBLE] and good but
41

41

00:02:10.539  -->  00:02:15.222
we aren't going to go further than that,
we're gonna duplicate our virtual camera,
42

42

00:02:15.222  -->  00:02:19.646
it will be now be called virtual camera
one, the first one, I think I'll rename to
43

43

00:02:19.646  -->  00:02:23.660
virtual camera run and the second,
I will rename to virtual camera idle.
44

44

00:02:25.250  -->  00:02:25.750
Idle.
45

45

00:02:27.580  -->  00:02:30.270
And then,
if we clock on the state driven camera,
46

46

00:02:30.270  -->  00:02:32.180
you can see we've got these
two cameras down here.
47

47

00:02:32.180  -->  00:02:35.470
Virtual camera children,
we've got our run and our idle.
48

48

00:02:36.980  -->  00:02:41.320
We need to set up some states just a quick
reminder of the states that we're dealing
49

49

00:02:41.320  -->  00:02:43.260
with, if you click on your animator and
50

50

00:02:43.260  -->  00:02:48.240
then over on animations on the player
animator controller these are the states
51

51

00:02:48.240  -->  00:02:53.770
its referring to that we're gonna be
using to drive the different cameras.
52

52

00:02:53.770  -->  00:02:57.820
Currently we've got climbing and running,
in the future we might have dying as well.
53

53

00:02:57.820  -->  00:03:00.690
So that's what we're talking about,
so back in the state during camera,
54

54

00:03:00.690  -->  00:03:04.540
we need to tell it that that's
the animator we're interested in.
55

55

00:03:04.540  -->  00:03:08.850
So, if you click on animated target here
non animator, click on that you can see we
56

56

00:03:08.850  -->  00:03:11.560
got to get one option because that's
the only animator we've got it present
57

57

00:03:11.560  -->  00:03:12.830
which is the player.
58

58

00:03:12.830  -->  00:03:16.580
Now the player's state machine
is gonna be available to us
59

59

00:03:16.580  -->  00:03:18.060
within the state driven camera.
60

60

00:03:18.060  -->  00:03:21.750
When we click on the plus
button here you see State.
61

61

00:03:21.750  -->  00:03:22.870
The list is empty.
62

62

00:03:22.870  -->  00:03:24.140
Click on the plus button.
63

63

00:03:24.140  -->  00:03:25.810
New State.
64

64

00:03:25.810  -->  00:03:29.870
And then where we have default, we can
choose any of the states that we have in
65

65

00:03:29.870  -->  00:03:31.910
our state machine, so idling,
running and climbing.
66

66

00:03:31.910  -->  00:03:34.100
We're gonna start with idling.
67

67

00:03:34.100  -->  00:03:37.400
And then the camera that our attach
to that is our virtual camera idle.
68

68

00:03:37.400  -->  00:03:40.590
And then I'll add another state.
69

69

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:45.640
And that would be for running and
we will attach our virtual camera run.
70

70

00:03:45.640  -->  00:03:48.980
One thing that I found is a little buggy
in this version of center machine,
71

71

00:03:48.980  -->  00:03:53.210
I'm gonna have a look at is my idol
is still orthographic in size and
72

72

00:03:53.210  -->  00:03:54.800
my run is still orthographic.
73

73

00:03:54.800  -->  00:03:59.030
Sometimes for some reasons it changes to
field of view as if it's now going to 3D
74

74

00:03:59.030  -->  00:04:03.120
camera, I found the only solution to that
is deleting and reduplicating the camera.
75

75

00:04:03.120  -->  00:04:04.280
But keep your eye on that.
76

76

00:04:04.280  -->  00:04:07.230
Sometimes that can come and get makes
a little bit difficult to do the amount of
77

77

00:04:07.230  -->  00:04:09.720
the zoom in that you wanna
have on your camera.
78

78

00:04:09.720  -->  00:04:13.020
So speaking of zoom in, we've got out idle
it's still a little bit of design here.
79

79

00:04:13.020  -->  00:04:16.350
How do we want things to work
when our character is running,
80

80

00:04:16.350  -->  00:04:19.863
do we want the camera to zoom in a little
bit, to make a little bit tighter?
81

81

00:04:19.863  -->  00:04:23.370
More interesting or wanna to zoom out and
make a little bit more free.
82

82

00:04:23.370  -->  00:04:24.630
Hm.
83

83

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:28.670
Ain't much of a muchness, mostly we're
doing it at the moment for flavour,
84

84

00:04:28.670  -->  00:04:32.420
just to make our game feel a bit more
dynamic as opposed to doing it for
85

85

00:04:32.420  -->  00:04:35.830
gameplay reasons where we want the player
to see more or see less of the screen.
86

86

00:04:35.830  -->  00:04:39.889
So I think if were idling,
I think I want it to just.
87

87

00:04:40.920  -->  00:04:42.110
pop in a little bit.
88

88

00:04:42.110  -->  00:04:45.620
If we're running a think I want it
to come out to the full extent.
89

89

00:04:45.620  -->  00:04:50.200
So that means my idle camera I'm
gonna take from seven to six.
90

90

00:04:50.200  -->  00:04:53.060
I'll make it reasonably pronounced, for
91

91

00:04:53.060  -->  00:04:55.770
the sake of you being able
to see what I'm doing here.
92

92

00:04:55.770  -->  00:04:57.570
Make it five, so
I'm gonna get super pronounced.
93

93

00:04:57.570  -->  00:04:59.650
I think it's gonna be a lot too harsh.
94

94

00:04:59.650  -->  00:05:02.260
But we'll make it pronounced so
we can see what's going on here.
95

95

00:05:02.260  -->  00:05:05.700
And then back to our state driven
camera you can see that we've got our
96

96

00:05:05.700  -->  00:05:08.340
two states in here hooked up,
If we hit play.
97

97

00:05:08.340  -->  00:05:11.870
Now when we are idling,
the camera should be in close.
98

98

00:05:11.870  -->  00:05:13.990
When we run, the camera zooms out.
99

99

00:05:13.990  -->  00:05:17.450
And you can see the blend
between the two is pretty quick.
100

100

00:05:17.450  -->  00:05:20.580
I mean it's awesome that we're
able to do that so quickly.
101

101

00:05:20.580  -->  00:05:23.650
You might like that amount of bouncing.
102

102

00:05:23.650  -->  00:05:26.300
I think that would make me
pretty seasick after a while.
103

103

00:05:26.300  -->  00:05:27.830
That's fine.
I've done it a bit more extreme.
104

104

00:05:27.830  -->  00:05:28.640
as I was saying.
105

105

00:05:28.640  -->  00:05:32.250
Now, but if the blending is much too fast,
there's a way that we can address that.
106

106

00:05:32.250  -->  00:05:34.820
If you look at custom blends.
107

107

00:05:34.820  -->  00:05:36.230
Click create asset.
108

108

00:05:36.230  -->  00:05:37.520
It'll ask us if where we want to store it.
109

109

00:05:37.520  -->  00:05:40.460
I'm going to put this interesting,
is this an animation?
110

110

00:05:40.460  -->  00:05:42.150
This is a camera.
111

111

00:05:42.150  -->  00:05:44.820
I will put this in
animation I think cuz it
112

112

00:05:44.820  -->  00:05:47.980
feels like an animation as a blend
state driven camera blends.
113

113

00:05:49.800  -->  00:05:54.510
Now we have our list here is empty, if
you click plus under this customs blends.
114

114

00:05:54.510  -->  00:05:56.730
We can say,
we are going from something to something.
115

115

00:05:56.730  -->  00:06:00.700
Select go from any camera into idle,
could do a particular type of blend.
116

116

00:06:00.700  -->  00:06:05.350
We'll say from Idle to Run.
117

117

00:06:05.350  -->  00:06:08.520
We can change the style of Easing In and
Out.
118

118

00:06:08.520  -->  00:06:09.320
We can change the time.
119

119

00:06:09.320  -->  00:06:12.280
So our default Ease In and Out time here.
120

120

00:06:12.280  -->  00:06:13.160
For everything is 0.5.
121

121

00:06:13.160  -->  00:06:15.740
So if I change this to say five.
122

122

00:06:15.740  -->  00:06:22.760
Then every single camera transition
is going to take that five seconds.
123

123

00:06:22.760  -->  00:06:26.360
So run five and eventually it
gets to where it wants to and
124

124

00:06:26.360  -->  00:06:28.200
fires slowly back in again.
125

125

00:06:28.200  -->  00:06:30.270
Which is cool and we can leave it at that.
126

126

00:06:30.270  -->  00:06:32.950
We don't even need to
create our custom blends.
127

127

00:06:32.950  -->  00:06:37.060
But if we wanna have a different
blend per camera change,
128

128

00:06:37.060  -->  00:06:39.730
then we need to have our
custom blends just here.
129

129

00:06:39.730  -->  00:06:40.590
So we are gonna do that.
130

130

00:06:40.590  -->  00:06:43.510
We'll have our first camera and
we'll set up our second.
131

131

00:06:43.510  -->  00:06:47.070
Blends, so
the first blend was from idle to run and
132

132

00:06:47.070  -->  00:06:51.490
our next is going to be from run to idle,
cuz they're our only states at the moment.
133

133

00:06:51.490  -->  00:06:55.370
And then the amount of time we want will,
134

134

00:06:55.370  -->  00:06:59.870
from idle to run, I think we want
that to happen pretty quickly.
135

135

00:06:59.870  -->  00:07:01.390
So I'll put this down to 1.
136

136

00:07:01.390  -->  00:07:05.000
And then from run back to auto,
that's more of a relaxed moment.
137

137

00:07:05.000  -->  00:07:06.065
We'll have this at 3.
138

138

00:07:07.540  -->  00:07:09.350
Again this is for security purposes,
139

139

00:07:09.350  -->  00:07:11.780
we can turn this once we've
got more our game available.
140

140

00:07:11.780  -->  00:07:14.690
As we run it kinda goes to this
fuller view, running, running and
141

141

00:07:14.690  -->  00:07:17.930
if I stop than it stops.
142

142

00:07:17.930  -->  00:07:18.520
Okay, cool.
143

143

00:07:19.920  -->  00:07:23.070
The other thing we can do in
addition to this is we can
144

144

00:07:23.070  -->  00:07:26.800
ask the camera to wait
before going into the blend.
145

145

00:07:26.800  -->  00:07:28.820
And we do that down here in our state.
146

146

00:07:28.820  -->  00:07:33.720
So before we go into our idling,
we can wait a whole second and
147

147

00:07:33.720  -->  00:07:36.830
before we go into running,
we can say, no wait at all.
148

148

00:07:36.830  -->  00:07:38.430
And then what happens here is we run,
149

149

00:07:38.430  -->  00:07:43.000
it goes straight into our full of view,
this might be our default camera and
150

150

00:07:43.000  -->  00:07:46.330
then if I stop for a bit it waits
at a while then it zooms in.
151

151

00:07:46.330  -->  00:07:50.290
I think that's a nice touch just to show
the player that the world is dynamic,
152

152

00:07:50.290  -->  00:07:53.800
they can't just we haven't forgotten
about if they stopped running.
153

153

00:07:53.800  -->  00:07:56.070
And I would probably make that
ease a little bit longer.
154

154

00:07:56.070  -->  00:07:58.650
So it's a bit more of a slow
dramatic you're running.
155

155

00:07:58.650  -->  00:07:59.240
You're playing the game.
156

156

00:07:59.240  -->  00:07:59.840
You're doing stuff.
157

157

00:07:59.840  -->  00:08:02.040
Maybe you're stopping here,
looking at something and
158

158

00:08:02.040  -->  00:08:05.040
it just does a little bit of
zooming in on the player,
159

159

00:08:05.040  -->  00:08:08.470
little bit of increased tension
at that moment for the game.
160

160

00:08:08.470  -->  00:08:12.480
Okay so they're the main points
the custom blends the states and
161

161

00:08:12.480  -->  00:08:13.380
setting up the cameras.
162

162

00:08:13.380  -->  00:08:17.730
So the challenge I've got for
you in this video is add a Ladder Camera.
163

163

00:08:17.730  -->  00:08:20.070
That's an additional state for the camera.
164

164

00:08:20.070  -->  00:08:23.260
When we're climbing ladders I recommend
duplicating one of the cameras
165

165

00:08:23.260  -->  00:08:24.700
we've got at the moment and using that.
166

166

00:08:24.700  -->  00:08:26.850
And then to make sure
that the blending to and
167

167

00:08:26.850  -->  00:08:30.100
from the camera is how you would like it
to be when you are climbing the ladder.
168

168

00:08:30.100  -->  00:08:33.950
You get the right sort of framing and
you get the right in and
169

169

00:08:33.950  -->  00:08:36.120
out and it's not bouncing too much.
170

170

00:08:36.120  -->  00:08:40.790
So, pause the video and set yourself
up an extra space for climbing ladders.
171

171

00:08:43.250  -->  00:08:44.120
Okay, welcome back.
172

172

00:08:44.120  -->  00:08:49.050
I'm going to duplicate the Idle and
rename that from Idle to
173

173

00:08:50.070  -->  00:08:55.110
Climb as our virtual camera climb.
174

174

00:08:55.110  -->  00:08:58.610
And then underneath our state
driven camera here it's
175

175

00:08:58.610  -->  00:09:00.620
already been in place
because it's childhood.
176

176

00:09:00.620  -->  00:09:05.230
So it already knows its child in terms
of states we need to say a new state.
177

177

00:09:05.230  -->  00:09:07.460
This state is climbing.
178

178

00:09:07.460  -->  00:09:10.860
We've already set up,
in our state machine down here, climbing.
179

179

00:09:10.860  -->  00:09:12.700
And we're using the virtual camera climb.
180

180

00:09:12.700  -->  00:09:15.150
Of course, let me just check that
it hasn't done anything strange.
181

181

00:09:15.150  -->  00:09:18.810
No, It's still on the right
sort of orthographic lens here.
182

182

00:09:18.810  -->  00:09:24.710
And I think just, again, for illustrative
purposes, let's make he camera climb,
183

183

00:09:24.710  -->  00:09:28.470
do we want it to move out so
you can see more of the world, so
184

184

00:09:28.470  -->  00:09:32.090
it's more dramatic or move in so it's
more tense as you are climbing a ladder.
185

185

00:09:32.090  -->  00:09:34.290
Probably, for now,
I'm going to move it out a little bit.
186

186

00:09:34.290  -->  00:09:36.230
Just so you see a bit more of the world.
187

187

00:09:36.230  -->  00:09:39.640
A little bit more of that
vertico feeling perhaps.
188

188

00:09:39.640  -->  00:09:40.932
Vetico?
I think it is vertigo.
189

189

00:09:40.932  -->  00:09:44.190
Vertigo, verti-come, verti-stay, vertigo.
190

190

00:09:44.190  -->  00:09:50.120
Here we are, now what we need to do is
to back to our state driven camera,
191

191

00:09:50.120  -->  00:09:53.660
we need to make sure that
we have our transition.
192

192

00:09:53.660  -->  00:09:58.640
We will say from any camera,
it's probably gonna be from run but
193

193

00:09:58.640  -->  00:10:02.825
from any camera into climb.
194

194

00:10:02.825  -->  00:10:08.120
We wanted to be reasonably
snappy to see how that feels.
195

195

00:10:08.120  -->  00:10:09.760
And we can change these things in here.
196

196

00:10:09.760  -->  00:10:11.310
Ease in, ease out, et cetera.
197

197

00:10:11.310  -->  00:10:13.820
You can play around with that
to see the different feel of it.
198

198

00:10:13.820  -->  00:10:19.250
Generally we're just doing the ease in and
the ease out and we also want from
199

199

00:10:19.250  -->  00:10:24.560
the climb back out to the any camera.
200

200

00:10:25.600  -->  00:10:29.210
I think it's a good way to do this and you
can do that for any of your states just
201

201

00:10:29.210  -->  00:10:34.110
any state in the run, it does particular
thing, any state into the idle this thing.
202

202

00:10:34.110  -->  00:10:38.520
That's a handy way to set it out without
getting a thousand different states as
203

203

00:10:38.520  -->  00:10:42.050
thousand different blends as we
get more states in there and
204

204

00:10:42.050  -->  00:10:46.850
then the amount of time, we'll do it the
same again and the with the wait time we
205

205

00:10:46.850  -->  00:10:49.500
won't have any wait time, it'll just
be zing and straight in and out.
206

206

00:10:49.500  -->  00:10:54.390
So that should be the camera
being a little bit further out
207

207

00:10:54.390  -->  00:10:59.220
as we jump onto our ladder so it starts
off in idle and then as we climb, yet
208

208

00:10:59.220  -->  00:11:00.910
it brings the camera out a little bit.
209

209

00:11:00.910  -->  00:11:03.290
So I think all of my values
are a little bit too extreme.
210

210

00:11:03.290  -->  00:11:06.460
It's probably gonna annoy the player
if things are moving around that much.
211

211

00:11:06.460  -->  00:11:08.450
But I wanted to have it with
that sort of extreme so
212

212

00:11:08.450  -->  00:11:11.700
that you can see what's going
on in our video here side.
213

213

00:11:11.700  -->  00:11:16.670
Tune to more down a little bit so
my size of internet is not quite so much.
214

214

00:11:16.670  -->  00:11:19.950
And there's one last thing I wanted
to do in this video to show you,
215

215

00:11:19.950  -->  00:11:21.880
okay, I think it's pretty cool.
216

216

00:11:21.880  -->  00:11:24.830
If you click on one of your cameras,
I will click on Run and
217

217

00:11:24.830  -->  00:11:29.710
then scroll down,
I'd say use this one with care.
218

218

00:11:29.710  -->  00:11:35.570
With much care but we're setting
ourselves up a shake cam which,
219

219

00:11:35.570  -->  00:11:37.190
man, so many uses for it.
220

220

00:11:37.190  -->  00:11:41.370
For now we're just gonna use it as part
of the state driven camera mechanism.
221

221

00:11:41.370  -->  00:11:44.590
But we can use it in other ways in
the future if you want to trigger
222

222

00:11:44.590  -->  00:11:45.120
it in other ways.
223

223

00:11:45.120  -->  00:11:46.450
But, for now, we have a look.
224

224

00:11:46.450  -->  00:11:50.410
If you scroll down on one of your cameras,
I'm going to use run, down to noise.
225

225

00:11:50.410  -->  00:11:54.460
We'll set up basic multi channel
perlin and then noise profile,
226

226

00:11:54.460  -->  00:11:56.340
well I'll put this in vibration.
227

227

00:11:56.340  -->  00:12:01.060
Amplitude gain done have this [INAUDIBLE]
.2 and then frequency gain 1.
228

228

00:12:01.060  -->  00:12:05.040
So, amplitude is how far it goes and
frequency is how quickly it does it.
229

229

00:12:05.040  -->  00:12:09.430
You click on play,
as we run our camera should shake.
230

230

00:12:09.430  -->  00:12:14.640
So, but you can see our camera,
is going crazy in our scene view here.
231

231

00:12:14.640  -->  00:12:15.460
It's kinda cool.
232

232

00:12:15.460  -->  00:12:18.050
It gives a little bit of
interesting wobble as we run along.
233

233

00:12:18.050  -->  00:12:20.820
So that's something that you can
play around with to get a good feel.
234

234

00:12:20.820  -->  00:12:21.970
It's little bit dynamic.
235

235

00:12:21.970  -->  00:12:25.170
Use this with caution,
don't go crazy with it I don't think.
236

236

00:12:25.170  -->  00:12:27.300
And probably don't have
you seen over there,
237

237

00:12:27.300  -->  00:12:29.870
it's super distracting
when you see it like that.
238

238

00:12:29.870  -->  00:12:32.380
But if we would to put
the amplitude out further and
239

239

00:12:32.380  -->  00:12:36.480
the frequency up a bunch that as we run
the whole cameras gonna be on crazy.
240

240

00:12:36.480  -->  00:12:41.220
So I'm sure you can think of some really
cool uses for that not just in our state
241

241

00:12:41.220  -->  00:12:45.020
cuz at the moment we're gonna
pause this that is not crazy,
242

242

00:12:45.020  -->  00:12:49.200
so in our current we're just using
a baseball with what the player does.
243

243

00:12:49.200  -->  00:12:50.960
But in the future if
you had to play a die,
244

244

00:12:50.960  -->  00:12:53.480
that would be a great time
to do a camera shake.
245

245

00:12:53.480  -->  00:12:56.750
I'm ready to set up now so when we do
have a dying state, it will be easy for
246

246

00:12:56.750  -->  00:12:57.880
us to remember to put it in.
247

247

00:12:57.880  -->  00:13:00.260
But for the moment I'm going to
have it super subtle just so
248

248

00:13:00.260  -->  00:13:03.720
there's some little bit of movement there
is the player is running along just to
249

249

00:13:03.720  -->  00:13:07.130
give it a little bit of dynamic balance,
but that's a really cool tool for
250

250

00:13:07.130  -->  00:13:11.410
you to play around with in your own game.
&gt;&gt; So there we have it state based and
251

251

00:13:11.410  -->  00:13:14.420
animation state based
animations down here.
252

252

00:13:14.420  -->  00:13:18.290
Step by camera driven by
the player's animation state,
253

253

00:13:18.290  -->  00:13:21.890
where we can have zoom in's and
zoom out's and a little bit of noise
254

254

00:13:21.890  -->  00:13:26.260
a whole bunch of cool things based upon
what the player is up to in the game.
255

255

00:13:26.260  -->  00:13:29.570
So, hopefully you find that useful and
hopefully you can retrofit that
256

256

00:13:29.570  -->  00:13:32.840
to some of the past projects
that we've been working on.
257

257

00:13:32.840  -->  00:13:37.550
I think in Rush this sort
of thing will be fantastic
258

258

00:13:37.550  -->  00:13:40.360
to add through out our game back in Rush.
259

259

00:13:40.360  -->  00:13:44.590
So well done in this video and
I will see you in the next lecture.
