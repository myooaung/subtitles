1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:10,160
This video we're going to be learning about tags in unity and we're also going to be creating an unbreakable

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,740
block.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,040
So to get started on that.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,610
First of all I want to just recap the block types that I'd like to have in our game.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,240
We've talked about this before right at the very start of this section we're all talking about the game

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,080
design.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,210
We want to have damage level so when the ball hits a block it doesn't destroy immediately it has multiple

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,260
levels of damage and also to have unbreakable blocks.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,420
And it's the unbreakable blocks we're going to be focussing on in this lecture.

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,880
Also we want to have all I want to have some different size blocks so for example we can have a huge

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,820
block in the middle.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,240
Maybe that's the thing that we apply the multiple damaged levels too.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,920
And we can also have small blocks that have maybe one here in the blocks and have to have different

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,400
block size different block damage levels and unbreakable blocks.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,130
And as I mentioned we're going to be using tags to do this and I've given you the link to the documentation

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,880
on tags.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,550
The good thing to look at in here is tags help you identify game objects for scripting purposes so they

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,590
help us say is this game object the particular game object we're looking for in our case it's to say

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,460
Should this be destroyed or not destroyed.

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,230
In other words is it breakable or not but it could be.

21
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:23,360
Is this a an enemy that I'm trying issue therefore to give the enemy damage or can this rocket collide

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,840
with a spaceship or not.

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,540
Why with the spaceship so tag's is a handy way of giving something an identity that we can then ask

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,400
about you our code and to apply that back to what we're doing here.

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:40,330
If we add the tags to our breakable blocks we had at the tag breakable end of the unbreakable blocks

26
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:46,450
we had the tag unbreakable then we can say things like if the tag is breakable then do particular things.

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,980
If the tag is unbreakable then do some other types of things.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,510
So that's the logic we're working on for our current game.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,990
And if you click on your prefab block or you can also click on one of the blocks in your scene but fanelle

30
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,380
will click on the prefab because then it will apply any changes we make to all of the blocks in the

31
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,190
scene.

32
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,750
If we click on our prefab and then up in the top right of the Inspector you'll see something that says

33
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,520
Teg.

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,790
Currently it has untagged next to it.

35
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,100
Click on the untagged.

36
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,160
You'll see that there's one two three four there's a whole bunch of current tag options that are default

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,820
with unity.

38
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,220
So for example player on main camera I'm going to add our own tags so we click on Add tag.

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,270
You see that list is empty.

40
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,390
There's a little plus button click on the plus and then we're going to create breakable capital B.

41
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,090
And then click save.

42
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,580
Also will create a second one which is unbreakable.

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,700
And then click on Save or hit enter.

44
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,640
So you've got breakable and unbreakable now we need to go back to our block prefab up to tag and actually

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,210
tag that as breakable.

46
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,990
So click on breakable and because we changed it on our prefab which would click on any of our blocks

47
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,570
in our scene we can see that they are breakable because it applies immediately to all of the instances

48
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,730
while we are here.

49
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,230
I'm going to duplicate my blog actually while I'm here I'm going to rename this to breakable so you

50
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,360
can right click rename or just click in the name area and call this breakable block.

51
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,750
OK.

52
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,780
Now in a duplicate So control deal komenda.

53
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,160
Right click rename.

54
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,050
I'll call this unbreakable lock.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,460
Well clicking an unbreakable block I'm going to make sure that I can see the Sprite renderer in my inspector

56
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,800
and change the colour from yellow to kind of a grey type of colour so I can see that this is unbreakable.

57
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,720
Drag that into my scene.

58
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,950
Now I have an unbreakable block in my scene and while I'm here I'm going to duplicate this a couple

59
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,690
of times so I've duplicated it and then holding down controlled it snap a place.

60
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,120
So I've got this little wall down the bottom of our level which makes interesting.

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,410
We have to go around the wall to get up to the main part of our game.

62
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,840
And also if the ball is up here then it can do a little bit of bounce bounce bounce in a little bit

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,440
of pinball type ricocheting which I think is pretty cool.

64
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,440
Okay so now we need to have a look at what do we do with our code and I'm going to be focussing on one

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,560
script which is the block not seeing scripts are open that up.

66
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,900
Now if you haven't already within block dotsie s there's going to be two places where we need to add

67
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,990
our code to say only do something if it's tagged as breakable.

68
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,540
And I'm going to give you a challenge at this point.

69
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,200
So we'll be adding some if statements will be one if statement will put it in two places so in two places

70
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,460
and if statements.

71
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,360
So our code only applies to breakable blocks.

72
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,730
And here is the code.

73
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,840
If tag equals equals and this is another way of us saying does it.

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,280
Is it currently assigned us.

75
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,740
Is the tag currently equalling breakable if we only had one equal in there it would be say I would be

76
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,810
saying I want you to make tag as the thing that's an assignment.

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,400
If there's one equals it's assignment same thing on the left should now be assigned the value of the

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
thing on the right.

79
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:06,980
If there's two equals it's saying it's saying that Teg currently equals breakable so asking if tag currently

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,700
equals breakable.

81
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,740
Then do our code.

82
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,480
OK.

83
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,230
So that's how we test for our tagging breakable.

84
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,070
That's your challenge.

85
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,530
Jump in find two places in Block dotsie is where we can add that and I'll see you back here in a moment.

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,110
Okay so what are the two places will place number one is we want to make sure we're only destroying

87
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,260
the block if it's tagged as destroyable.

88
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,890
This is part of our collision method in here.

89
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,360
Right above destroy block.

90
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,860
I'll say if I open parentheses tag.

91
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,270
Equals.

92
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,080
Equals.

93
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,740
Quotations.

94
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,460
Breakable.

95
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,230
Make sure you spell it exactly the same.

96
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,270
This is one of the downsides of the string reference is if we spell this slightly incorrectly then not

97
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,330
we don't know what's going on or if we create this in here and then over in unity we go and change the

98
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,830
name of our tag we say you know maybe we should call it distractable then we have to remember that we

99
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,810
have a hard coded breakables a string reference.

100
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,810
Now open curly brackets and close code brackets and that E is destroyed block so only destroy it.

101
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,510
If it's breakable call now the other place we need to do this is to make sure we're only counting the

102
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,940
breakable blocks because at the start we say can up pull the blocks is going to count up 8 9 10 11 12

103
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,020
13 14 say there's 14 blocks in the scene after we destroy the eight we can destroy.

104
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,790
We won't be able to destroy these and the game will be sitting there saying well you've still got another

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,490
six weeks to destroy.

106
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,100
So we need to make sure they're not included in our calculation to do that.

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,160
We wrap our level count breakable blocks in an IF statement.

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,220
What I'm going to do is a quick rename I've noticed this just now as I'm looking at it are rename my

109
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,960
current count breakable blocks that's in our level C S script.

110
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,870
We've got our public public method we're calling in here.

111
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:58,900
I will rename the spectre block dotsie is rename this to just straight up count blocks.

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,540
Because we're not yet at the point telling it with that account breakable blocks or unbreakable blocks.

113
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,330
At this point it just knows to count the blocks.

114
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,140
So I'm going to rename that and I'm not sure how to rename we've done this a few times.

115
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,180
But you're right click and rename make sure it's applying to all the places that it is named that for

116
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,650
us it's overing level script as well so.

117
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:18,920
Yep.

118
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,400
Cowpox has been renamed.

119
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:29,140
Now if I put a bar of level count box I say if a tag equals equals quotations breakable.

120
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,820
And then again wrap this in our coin brackets.

121
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,070
Level.

122
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,110
Count blocks.

123
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,690
Great.

124
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,270
And then I'm going to do a quick tidy up of my start method.

125
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,520
Generally I don't like to have to interpret and read what's going on.

126
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,380
There's some code in here.

127
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,920
What's exactly happening here.

128
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,500
All of this code is saying basically just the count breakable blocks.

129
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,900
So I'll highlight everything from level down to the cold bracket here everything with my start method

130
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,720
right click and then we're going to re factor on Peacey we have the double click extract method and

131
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,260
this is where we say count what's count breakable blocks because that's precisely what it's doing it's

132
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,590
just counting the breakable blocks and then we can look at our start method count breakable walks.

133
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:14,920
Okay.

134
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,280
Got it.

135
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,900
And if I need to get clarification then I can go have a look at what's going on in there.

136
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,880
If I add another couple of things that we need to do in the start menu it's not a start method it's

137
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,130
not going to get too full and busy so we'll save this up jump over into unity see if it is time we celebrate

138
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,510
or not just yet.

139
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,120
I think it is time way for my scripts to compile.

140
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,140
It often takes a little bit of time.

141
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,880
Like my game we know a bit bigger.

142
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:44,180
Click on play drive the paddle over the right shoot up into the air and not braking because I've screwed

143
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,670
it up.

144
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,470
What have I done wrong.

145
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,610
Okay let's have a look breakable.

146
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,190
I left this as breakable which I should have changed to unbreakable.

147
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,400
So that's one of the downsides of duplicating you get everything that comes with it and sometimes you

148
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,410
can forget so it should be unbreakable.

149
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,800
We've done that on the prefabs so it should be applied to all of our breakable blocks.

150
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,210
Well done.

151
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,060
If you did that yourself without making my mistake.

152
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,990
Now let's launch the ball up.

153
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,090
They don't break.

154
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,080
But boy you are definitely not breaking a game is definitely fast.

155
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,610
I just want to make sure that the yellow blocks do break as this is too slow.

156
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,880
That's good drive on over here and they do explode and not exploit.

157
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,490
Excellent.

158
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,210
So we've made ourselves a different type of block which is unbreakable.

159
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,950
The level should still low.

160
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,510
You might want to test that yourself.

161
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,050
I haven't tested that but I'll do that.

162
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,080
Off camera just to make sure that when we did defeat the last destroyable block it does load to the

163
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,410
next level and we've used tags in the process.

164
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,400
Great work and I'll see you on the next like Shah.
