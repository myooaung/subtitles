2

00:00:03.931  -->  00:00:08.208
In this video, I'm gonna take you
through my flow diagram for my story.
3

3

00:00:08.208  -->  00:00:10.552
And we're gonna talk about
a couple of tips and
4

4

00:00:10.552  -->  00:00:14.690
tricks in terms of creating some story
flow for you to get this into your game.
5

5

00:00:14.690  -->  00:00:18.819
Just a note here, just a caveat that if
you're into game design this is a great
6

6

00:00:18.819  -->  00:00:20.739
opportunity to flex your muscles.
7

7

00:00:20.739  -->  00:00:24.060
If this is not your thing,
not a problem at all, just do the minimum,
8

8

00:00:24.060  -->  00:00:26.540
just do enough so
you understand the process.
9

9

00:00:26.540  -->  00:00:30.510
And then you can move on to the next part
of the content, next part of the course.
10

10

00:00:30.510  -->  00:00:33.700
So let's jump in and
talk about what I've created here.
11

11

00:00:33.700  -->  00:00:34.780
So we need a story flow.
12

12

00:00:34.780  -->  00:00:36.820
I'll show you how I've
created my story flow.
13

13

00:00:36.820  -->  00:00:38.410
I've used draw.io.
14

14

00:00:38.410  -->  00:00:42.538
So if you go to your browser, draw.io.
15

15

00:00:42.538  -->  00:00:46.620
At the moment, this is a free-to-use,
totally cool place to go.
16

16

00:00:46.620  -->  00:00:48.870
Hopefully, it stays that way
in the future, who knows?
17

17

00:00:48.870  -->  00:00:51.010
But for now,
this is the way I've been doing it.
18

18

00:00:51.010  -->  00:00:55.790
You can save your diagrams to the cloud,
to Google Drive, and
19

19

00:00:55.790  -->  00:00:57.370
I've got mine on my device.
20

20

00:00:57.370  -->  00:01:01.123
If I click there, it allows me to create
a new diagram, which you might wanna do or
21

21

00:01:01.123  -->  00:01:02.409
you can open up my diagram.
22

22

00:01:02.409  -->  00:01:05.851
I'm gonna share that with you in
the resources against this lecture, and
23

23

00:01:05.851  -->  00:01:07.870
I'm gonna open up my diagram now.
24

24

00:01:07.870  -->  00:01:09.816
It opens it up as an XML.
25

25

00:01:09.816  -->  00:01:11.280
It's the Steam Punk Game Diagram.
26

26

00:01:11.280  -->  00:01:14.015
And you can see we've got all
these flowcharting tools.
27

27

00:01:14.015  -->  00:01:18.926
And then I've created some boxes for
my story with some ending states and
28

28

00:01:18.926  -->  00:01:20.710
some flow throughout it.
29

29

00:01:20.710  -->  00:01:22.940
So feel free to create your own mechanism.
30

30

00:01:22.940  -->  00:01:24.470
You don't have to follow mine at all.
31

31

00:01:24.470  -->  00:01:26.450
You don't have to do
this number of states.
32

32

00:01:26.450  -->  00:01:28.300
You don't have to do
this number of choices.
33

33

00:01:28.300  -->  00:01:31.850
This is me just coming up with
a few minutes of early gameplay
34

34

00:01:31.850  -->  00:01:35.100
that I could potentially extend
the rest of my game onto.
35

35

00:01:35.100  -->  00:01:39.550
I start off in the top left and I have
some branching choices for the player.
36

36

00:01:39.550  -->  00:01:42.700
I have some choices that lead
down to this game over state and
37

37

00:01:42.700  -->  00:01:46.290
some choices which lead to these
two different success states.
38

38

00:01:46.290  -->  00:01:50.070
And you can reach success from any point
and can reach game over from any point.
39

39

00:01:50.070  -->  00:01:53.240
So let me just show you a little
bit how I've created things here.
40

40

00:01:53.240  -->  00:01:58.180
I've used a numbering system, where I
start with A1, and then when I make my
41

41

00:01:58.180  -->  00:02:02.710
choices, the top choice over here, I've
got take them head on rush the guards.
42

42

00:02:02.710  -->  00:02:06.170
That is A2 and
the second choice here is A3.
43

43

00:02:06.170  -->  00:02:10.740
So in each instance, whichever choice
I'm doing first is the first number.
44

44

00:02:10.740  -->  00:02:15.670
So over here where I've got,
A3 is gonna lead to A4 and A5.
45

45

00:02:15.670  -->  00:02:18.616
The top choice is A4 and
the next choice is A5.
46

46

00:02:18.616  -->  00:02:22.531
It gets a little bit messy if you decide,
you know what, maybe I should remove this,
47

47

00:02:22.531  -->  00:02:24.080
or I should insert a new one.
48

48

00:02:24.080  -->  00:02:28.300
So your numbers might not become
consecutive after a while,
49

49

00:02:28.300  -->  00:02:30.100
if you're doing some edits to this flow.
50

50

00:02:30.100  -->  00:02:31.560
But so long as they stay in order.
51

51

00:02:31.560  -->  00:02:34.690
So if you wanted to insert something
in-between this Outside Hangar and
52

52

00:02:34.690  -->  00:02:38.770
Emergency Exit,
could call it A1b, for example.
53

53

00:02:38.770  -->  00:02:39.720
So there's a few ways to do it.
54

54

00:02:39.720  -->  00:02:41.900
There's no absolute,
there's no right or wrong.
55

55

00:02:41.900  -->  00:02:45.210
I'm just showing you my particular
system but there's no perfect way.
56

56

00:02:45.210  -->  00:02:47.640
Given that we're bringing information,
57

57

00:02:47.640  -->  00:02:51.710
we're bringing data from an external
tool and bringing it into Unity,
58

58

00:02:51.710  -->  00:02:54.770
there's gonna be a little bit of
compromise in how we go about doing this.
59

59

00:02:54.770  -->  00:02:57.897
And I've created some others where
I'm starting with B, B1, B2,
60

60

00:02:57.897  -->  00:03:01.190
etc just to show that that's a different
storyline, different branch.
61

61

00:03:01.190  -->  00:03:03.010
So I can have them a little bit separated.
62

62

00:03:03.010  -->  00:03:05.290
Here's the A branch and
here's the B branch.
63

63

00:03:05.290  -->  00:03:10.370
So within this tool you can create a new,
I've used this heading tool over here.
64

64

00:03:10.370  -->  00:03:14.130
You click on that,
it brings it into your area for you.
65

65

00:03:14.130  -->  00:03:16.720
Within this you can change
the name of the heading,
66

66

00:03:16.720  -->  00:03:20.790
or change the heading I should say,
so This Room.
67

67

00:03:20.790  -->  00:03:23.780
And then you can change
the text that you have in it.
68

68

00:03:23.780  -->  00:03:25.570
Here is our story.
69

69

00:03:25.570  -->  00:03:32.530
And then I always have some sort of,
what do you want to do?
70

70

00:03:32.530  -->  00:03:37.240
And then 1 option and 2 options.
71

71

00:03:37.240  -->  00:03:40.610
So that's the general structure
of how I'd like things out here.
72

72

00:03:40.610  -->  00:03:45.050
And when we wish to connect our arrows,
let me just remove this and
73

73

00:03:45.050  -->  00:03:47.645
remove this, super strike forward.
74

74

00:03:47.645  -->  00:03:52.580
I just move my boxes to where I think they
should fit within my overall diagram here.
75

75

00:03:52.580  -->  00:03:58.328
So from our B1, which is opening a door,
you wait it out after perhaps 20 minutes.
76

76

00:03:58.328  -->  00:04:00.049
You hear feet shuffling, blah, blah, blah.
77

77

00:04:00.049  -->  00:04:01.041
What do you wanna do?
78

78

00:04:01.041  -->  00:04:05.070
Option number 1 is over here to B3.
79

79

00:04:05.070  -->  00:04:09.889
So you just mouse over and when you see
the green circle, you drag that and
80

80

00:04:09.889  -->  00:04:11.156
an arrow appears.
81

81

00:04:11.156  -->  00:04:14.040
We can drag it and
click it over into this box over here.
82

82

00:04:14.040  -->  00:04:17.370
Likewise from here,
green circle drag over there.
83

83

00:04:17.370  -->  00:04:18.690
And then I can move this around and
84

84

00:04:18.690  -->  00:04:24.355
the arrow is going to go where it still
remain connected to the box there.
85

85

00:04:24.355  -->  00:04:26.705
Okay, so let's use the general
flash straight forward.
86

86

00:04:26.705  -->  00:04:27.985
I'll let you play around with it
87

87

00:04:27.985  -->  00:04:29.665
if you want to get a little
bit more sophisticated.
88

88

00:04:29.665  -->  00:04:31.455
You can change the colors
I have on the right.
89

89

00:04:31.455  -->  00:04:32.616
You can change the text.
90

90

00:04:32.616  -->  00:04:34.110
You can do all that kind of good stuff but
91

91

00:04:34.110  -->  00:04:36.355
I'm not here to teach you how
to use this particular tool.
92

92

00:04:36.355  -->  00:04:40.365
I'm just here to teach you how to
create some good story flow and to be
93

93

00:04:40.365  -->  00:04:44.670
able to import that into Unity to get that
into your engine, get it into the game.
94

94

00:04:44.670  -->  00:04:47.200
Now a couple other things
I'll show you in here.
95

95

00:04:47.200  -->  00:04:51.500
I've tended to just have two options most
of the time mainly because if I have
96

96

00:04:51.500  -->  00:04:54.790
three, it becomes really messy and
there's so much content to create.
97

97

00:04:54.790  -->  00:04:56.980
I felt that two was pretty interesting.
98

98

00:04:56.980  -->  00:05:00.680
You might wanna get more sophisticated
than I have, which is totally cool.
99

99

00:05:00.680  -->  00:05:04.845
I've created moments where
the player has two options and
100

100

00:05:04.845  -->  00:05:09.277
the both options end up leading
back to this option over here.
101

101

00:05:09.277  -->  00:05:13.950
So A3, you can either go
to the option of A4 or A5.
102

102

00:05:13.950  -->  00:05:17.035
If you go to A4, there is only
one option which takes you to A5.
103

103

00:05:17.035  -->  00:05:19.931
So it's totally fine, you don't
have to have option 1 and option 2.
104

104

00:05:19.931  -->  00:05:22.800
In here,
you can see I've got just one option.
105

105

00:05:22.800  -->  00:05:25.300
And then that will lead to
this next state over here.
106

106

00:05:25.300  -->  00:05:28.040
I've also got situations where
we go through the dialog,
107

107

00:05:28.040  -->  00:05:32.870
we go through the story and
then at the end, I just continue.
108

108

00:05:32.870  -->  00:05:35.070
So we'll continue this story,
it's not a choice to make.
109

109

00:05:35.070  -->  00:05:36.690
It's just continuing on.
110

110

00:05:36.690  -->  00:05:43.250
I also have situations over here where
both the options lead to the next state.
111

111

00:05:43.250  -->  00:05:46.430
The play doesn't necessarily know that and
we don't wanna tell them that, hey,
112

112

00:05:46.430  -->  00:05:48.710
it didn't really matter
what you chose in there.
113

113

00:05:48.710  -->  00:05:53.125
But it's cool for us to give the illusion
of choice, even if we're not gonna go and
114

114

00:05:53.125  -->  00:05:54.905
create all these extra states for it.
115

115

00:05:54.905  -->  00:05:56.171
So that's a situation.
116

116

00:05:56.171  -->  00:05:58.893
You don't wanna do that too much because
if people are replaying eventually they'll
117

117

00:05:58.893  -->  00:05:59.435
figure it out.
118

118

00:05:59.435  -->  00:06:01.945
But I think a couple of those is okay.
119

119

00:06:01.945  -->  00:06:05.865
Also, multiple branches that lead
down to our game over state.
120

120

00:06:05.865  -->  00:06:12.230
I usually start with, okay, so in this
part of my story, what do I see happening?
121

121

00:06:12.230  -->  00:06:14.840
And from my story, it's airship pilot.
122

122

00:06:14.840  -->  00:06:19.065
He starts off kind of trying to get to his
ship and then there is these block hinges
123

123

00:06:19.065  -->  00:06:24.330
get in the way and eventually he either
succeeds or he doesn't, he perishes.
124

124

00:06:24.330  -->  00:06:27.950
And so on that path, here is where he
starts and here is a success point.
125

125

00:06:27.950  -->  00:06:30.710
And then I like to put a midpoint
somewhere in the middle as well.
126

126

00:06:30.710  -->  00:06:36.340
So for example, it might be one of
these where he sees a couple of people.
127

127

00:06:36.340  -->  00:06:39.450
Over here's a couple of people talking,
and he has a choice at that point.
128

128

00:06:39.450  -->  00:06:43.130
I wanna have a few branches
lead to that point there, but
129

129

00:06:43.130  -->  00:06:44.800
this becomes a bit of a hub.
130

130

00:06:44.800  -->  00:06:46.743
There are a few things feed into there and
131

131

00:06:46.743  -->  00:06:49.120
then from there a few
things feed outwards.
132

132

00:06:49.120  -->  00:06:52.040
So there are a few different approaches
you can take with your story.
133

133

00:06:52.040  -->  00:06:54.964
So that leads us to our challenge,
which is to create a story.
134

134

00:06:54.964  -->  00:06:59.670
Use Draw.io or something similar, a
similar tool, like I said, a mind mapping
135

135

00:06:59.670  -->  00:07:04.620
tool, or you can even use a spreadsheet
if you wanted to, or a paper and pencil.
136

136

00:07:04.620  -->  00:07:08.960
Create your own story, create some
flows in there, states and transitions.
137

137

00:07:08.960  -->  00:07:12.000
And then share a screenshot of your
flow diagram with our community.
138

138

00:07:12.000  -->  00:07:16.720
I'm really interested to know what you
came up with and it's pretty cool to see
139

139

00:07:16.720  -->  00:07:21.210
weird, big, convoluted,
crazy flow diagrams of these stories.
140

140

00:07:21.210  -->  00:07:22.535
I've seen a couple of them already so
141

141

00:07:22.535  -->  00:07:24.304
I'm interested in seeing
what you come up with.
142

142

00:07:24.304  -->  00:07:26.493
And as I said before, if you're into this,
143

143

00:07:26.493  -->  00:07:28.742
if you wanna practice
being a game designer,
144

144

00:07:28.742  -->  00:07:33.250
if you wanna flex your narrative design
muscles, here's a big opportunity for you.
145

145

00:07:33.250  -->  00:07:36.300
If this is not your thing,
no worries, just do the minimum and
146

146

00:07:36.300  -->  00:07:37.810
that is totally cool.
147

147

00:07:37.810  -->  00:07:41.810
In the next video, we'll take our
content and we'll put it into Unity so
148

148

00:07:41.810  -->  00:07:46.010
that we can see our full story
actually within our engine.
149

149

00:07:46.010  -->  00:07:48.120
So great work, and
I'll see you in the next video.
