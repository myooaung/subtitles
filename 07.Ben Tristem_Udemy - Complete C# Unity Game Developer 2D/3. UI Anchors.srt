00:00:04,212  -->  00:00:09,124
Hello and welcome, in this video we're
gonna be implementing our hilarious image
2

2

00:00:09,124  -->  00:00:11,169
of Rick with silly looking hat on.
3

3

00:00:11,169  -->  00:00:14,968
And playing around with the anchor
points to make sure that when we change
4

4

00:00:14,968  -->  00:00:19,024
the aspect ratio of our game, or
if the player's changing the aspect ratio.
5

5

00:00:19,024  -->  00:00:23,083
That our elements stay anchored to where
we want them to stay on the screen.
6

6

00:00:23,083  -->  00:00:26,434
Don't have any weird stretching and
don't have any weird floating.
7

7

00:00:26,434  -->  00:00:29,337
So let's jump in and talk anchor points.
8

8

00:00:29,337  -->  00:00:33,966
Because we're starting a new section we
need to start a new project, I'm calling
9

9

00:00:33,966  -->  00:00:38,539
mine number wizard UI, saving it in Repos,
whoops, I didn't mean to click it.
10

10

00:00:38,539  -->  00:00:43,788
Unity 2D Number wizard UI is
where I'm selecting my project,
11

11

00:00:43,788  -->  00:00:48,257
and 2D is our template and
I'm using 2018.2.
12

12

00:00:48,257  -->  00:00:51,295
Create project,
this'll take a minute or so.
13

13

00:00:51,295  -->  00:00:55,042
So what I'm going to do is pause my
recording, you might wanna pause
14

14

00:00:55,042  -->  00:00:59,669
the video, and then once Unity has loaded
up the project, I will see you back here.
15

15

00:00:59,669  -->  00:01:00,303
Welcome back,
16

16

00:01:00,303  -->  00:01:03,386
I'm gonna start this process by saving
our scene as something different.
17

17

00:01:03,386  -->  00:01:07,836
I'm gonna Save As and we'll call this,
we'll put it into the Scenes folder.
18

18

00:01:07,836  -->  00:01:12,511
It's quite clever we have a Scenes folder
in there well done default unity thank
19

19

00:01:12,511  -->  00:01:16,366
you for that, we will call this
Start Menu this will be the scene.
20

20

00:01:16,366  -->  00:01:20,513
It's okay I have spaces where we're naming
our scenes no worries click Save on that,
21

21

00:01:20,513  -->  00:01:23,392
we have Start Menu and Sample Scene,
I'm gonna go ahead and
22

22

00:01:23,392  -->  00:01:25,836
delete Sample Scene we
don't need that anymore.
23

23

00:01:25,836  -->  00:01:28,766
Let's go into a hierarchy right click,
got to UI and
24

24

00:01:28,766  -->  00:01:33,094
click on Canvas, that will create a UI
Canvas, you might need to double click
25

25

00:01:33,094  -->  00:01:36,114
on it to get it nice and
highlighted on the scene here.
26

26

00:01:36,114  -->  00:01:40,790
The first thing I'll do while on
Canvas is change how UI scale mode to
27

27

00:01:40,790  -->  00:01:42,523
scale with screen size.
28

28

00:01:42,523  -->  00:01:46,034
If it's on constant pixel size then it
will try to keep everything the exact
29

29

00:01:46,034  -->  00:01:49,222
pixels that we have on our screen here,
no matter what's going on.
30

30

00:01:49,222  -->  00:01:53,725
Once I got to put the reference
resolution to 1920 by 1080,
31

31

00:01:53,725  -->  00:01:58,228
that shows Unity, this is what we
think it's most likely to be, and
32

32

00:01:58,228  -->  00:02:01,401
scale from this,
scale from this resolution.
33

33

00:02:01,401  -->  00:02:03,149
Use that as our benchmark.
34

34

00:02:03,149  -->  00:02:07,964
Okay, we've got our canvas, we've set
that up and I'll right click on Canvas.
35

35

00:02:07,964  -->  00:02:12,742
Scroll down to UI, and
we will put in a Button, click on Button.
36

36

00:02:12,742  -->  00:02:14,435
And see button sitting
on the screen there,
37

37

00:02:14,435  -->  00:02:15,863
might need to scroll in a little bit.
38

38

00:02:15,863  -->  00:02:19,583
I'm gonna make my button a little big
bigger, again just by dragging on
39

39

00:02:19,583  -->  00:02:22,634
the bottom, dragging on the right,
dragging on the top.
40

40

00:02:22,634  -->  00:02:26,427
We can scale up our button, I'll move
the button over to the right a little bit.
41

41

00:02:26,427  -->  00:02:29,720
And there we go,
we have ourselves a button.
42

42

00:02:29,720  -->  00:02:33,133
And we're looking at the functionality of
the button in the next couple of videos,
43

43

00:02:33,133  -->  00:02:35,960
but for now we're looking at
the positioning, and the scaling, and
44

44

00:02:35,960  -->  00:02:37,200
the anchoring of the button.
45

45

00:02:37,200  -->  00:02:39,074
If you look in the middle of your screen,
46

46

00:02:39,074  -->  00:02:41,071
you can see that we
have our anchor points.
47

47

00:02:41,071  -->  00:02:43,326
All four anchor points are together,
48

48

00:02:43,326  -->  00:02:46,575
that means that we have this
one central anchor point.
49

49

00:02:46,575  -->  00:02:50,205
The different anchor points relate to
the different sides of our button.
50

50

00:02:50,205  -->  00:02:54,309
So, the top left anchor point relates
to the top left of our button,
51

51

00:02:54,309  -->  00:02:57,264
the bottom right,
the bottom right, and so on.
52

52

00:02:57,264  -->  00:03:00,727
We can grab the anchor points and
stretch them out.
53

53

00:03:00,727  -->  00:03:04,636
That's gonna show there's a relationship
between this top-left point and
54

54

00:03:04,636  -->  00:03:06,147
that top-left point there.
55

55

00:03:06,147  -->  00:03:07,904
What relationship, I hear you ask?
56

56

00:03:07,904  -->  00:03:12,087
Well, this is important if our
screen resolution changes.
57

57

00:03:12,087  -->  00:03:17,586
So if I switch from 16:9 to say 5:4,
and you can see 5:4 is more of
58

58

00:03:17,586  -->  00:03:23,374
a squarish resolution whereas 16:9
is more of a wide screen resolution.
59

59

00:03:23,374  -->  00:03:25,304
You can see when we change to 5:4,
60

60

00:03:25,304  -->  00:03:28,244
you'll see that our box
stretched up a little bit here.
61

61

00:03:28,244  -->  00:03:32,217
If we click on our button, and
click on our anchor presets,
62

62

00:03:32,217  -->  00:03:36,429
we can change that to for example,
just the bottom right here,
63

63

00:03:36,429  -->  00:03:39,688
the options around
the outside of a stretching,
64

64

00:03:39,688  -->  00:03:44,641
and the options within the inside here
at an anchor at a particular point.
65

65

00:03:44,641  -->  00:03:48,115
So you can see left, center, and
right, top, middle, and bottom.
66

66

00:03:48,115  -->  00:03:49,729
And you see stretch and stretch.
67

67

00:03:49,729  -->  00:03:54,802
If you would said let's anchor to left and
top, we click on this button just here.
68

68

00:03:54,802  -->  00:03:58,536
Now our anchor points all move up, all
four of them move up to the top left, and
69

69

00:03:58,536  -->  00:04:01,027
we say, what about if it's right and
bottom?
70

70

00:04:01,027  -->  00:04:02,830
Then they all move down
to the bottom right.
71

71

00:04:02,830  -->  00:04:07,670
If we click on stretching, that's when
they pull apart, and they say, when
72

72

00:04:07,670  -->  00:04:12,965
the Canvas grows, then the button should
grow in the same proportion to the Canvas.
73

73

00:04:12,965  -->  00:04:16,501
It should stretch up in the same way,
that the Canvas is doing,
74

74

00:04:16,501  -->  00:04:20,971
we see that a lot more pronounced if we go
to free aspect, than when we stretch and
75

75

00:04:20,971  -->  00:04:25,243
move it, it changes based upon the
distance from this point to that anchor,
76

76

00:04:25,243  -->  00:04:26,949
or that point to that anchor.
77

77

00:04:26,949  -->  00:04:31,922
It's trying to keep those distances
the same irrespective of what
78

78

00:04:31,922  -->  00:04:34,335
size this Canvas is changed to.
79

79

00:04:34,335  -->  00:04:38,355
What we're more likely to do with our
button is say let's anchor our button to,
80

80

00:04:38,355  -->  00:04:40,531
for example, the top right of the screen.
81

81

00:04:40,531  -->  00:04:43,509
And I'll move it up a little bit more so
we can see this more clearly, so
82

82

00:04:43,509  -->  00:04:45,190
I'll move it up there to the top right.
83

83

00:04:45,190  -->  00:04:50,113
It's anchored to the top right,
still on free aspect, as we move around,
84

84

00:04:50,113  -->  00:04:54,902
you can see that it's staying up on
the top right of our screen over here.
85

85

00:04:54,902  -->  00:04:56,337
It's not moving to different parts.
86

86

00:04:56,337  -->  00:05:00,891
If I was to move it around like this and
to say let's anchor to the bottom left,
87

87

00:05:00,891  -->  00:05:04,325
then as we moved around it's
gonna try to keep it in the same
88

88

00:05:04,325  -->  00:05:08,415
distance from the bottom left to our
anchor point down at the bottom.
89

89

00:05:08,415  -->  00:05:13,059
I'm gonna switch back to 69, and
I'll show you, move my button back into
90

90

00:05:13,059  -->  00:05:17,796
the middle here, I'll show you another
example which has to do with images.
91

91

00:05:17,796  -->  00:05:21,210
So I've given you a couple of images
against this lecture for you to download.
92

92

00:05:21,210  -->  00:05:24,524
They may be zipped, but go grab those
if you'd like, or you can totally
93

93

00:05:24,524  -->  00:05:27,674
use your own images, if you wanna
play around with your own images,
94

94

00:05:27,674  -->  00:05:29,739
I've got my hilarious wizard images here.
95

95

00:05:29,739  -->  00:05:33,656
So you gonna drag those into my project,
just click and drag.
96

96

00:05:33,656  -->  00:05:36,050
Here we go, we've got a Rick and
we've got a Ben.
97

97

00:05:36,050  -->  00:05:40,933
Now, within Canvas, I click on Canvas,
right click, go to UI and
98

98

00:05:40,933  -->  00:05:45,837
then Image I'm gonna move my image
just a little bit out of the way.
99

99

00:05:45,837  -->  00:05:49,984
Careful you don't accidentally grab the
anchor points, that's pretty easy to do.
100

100

00:05:49,984  -->  00:05:54,323
I'm gonna move my image down
the bottom left, that's good.
101

101

00:05:54,323  -->  00:05:57,908
Now what I want to do, is to have the Rick
102

102

00:05:57,908  -->  00:06:02,591
image be placed on top of
my image game object here.
103

103

00:06:02,591  -->  00:06:07,355
So gonna change this to,
rename it to Wizard Rick, so it's nice and
104

104

00:06:07,355  -->  00:06:09,541
clear what we're doing here.
105

105

00:06:09,541  -->  00:06:15,201
And from in the inspector, while I clicked
on Wizard Rick, if I click on under image,
106

106

00:06:15,201  -->  00:06:18,915
you can see there is a source image,
currently is None.
107

107

00:06:18,915  -->  00:06:24,195
If I click on this selector, scroll down
until I find the image I'm looking for,
108

108

00:06:24,195  -->  00:06:28,873
which is the Wizard Rick and
that replaces the white box without image.
109

109

00:06:28,873  -->  00:06:33,479
Pretty easy, now I can move around and
scale this image, one of the issues
110

110

00:06:33,479  -->  00:06:38,109
you see that if I scale it like that it
gets stretched and a little bit ugly.
111

111

00:06:38,109  -->  00:06:42,463
And if you do that, if you get it
stretched and it's out of proportion it's
112

112

00:06:42,463  -->  00:06:46,560
really easy to get it back is by click
Set Native Size in the inspector.
113

113

00:06:46,560  -->  00:06:49,003
So you say, Set Native Size,
click on that, and
114

114

00:06:49,003  -->  00:06:51,513
it'll take it back to
the size you imported it at.
115

115

00:06:51,513  -->  00:06:54,711
And reposition this a little
bit over on to the left and
116

116

00:06:54,711  -->  00:06:58,976
make it a bit bigger in the screen by
holding down shift and scaling out,
117

117

00:06:58,976  -->  00:07:03,552
that will scale it in proportion,
that will keep the aspect ratio correct.
118

118

00:07:03,552  -->  00:07:06,909
Okay, currently you can see that
Wizard Rick is anchored to the middle of
119

119

00:07:06,909  -->  00:07:08,404
the screen that should be okay.
120

120

00:07:08,404  -->  00:07:12,546
But, if someone is playing at an aspect
ratio of 4:3, you can see we've now got
121

121

00:07:12,546  -->  00:07:16,285
this huge big gap underneath Wizard Rick,
and it looks pretty terrible.
122

122

00:07:16,285  -->  00:07:20,626
So what we wanna do is to have it so
it doesn't float in mid air.
123

123

00:07:20,626  -->  00:07:24,212
And that is a challenge
I'm going to set for you.
124

124

00:07:24,212  -->  00:07:28,915
How can we anchor Wizard Rick in
a way that he doesn't float with
125

125

00:07:28,915  -->  00:07:30,886
a big gap underneath him.
126

126

00:07:30,886  -->  00:07:33,810
I'm also gonna set you the challenge of
setting up your button, don't worry about
127

127

00:07:33,810  -->  00:07:36,418
the look of the button just yet,
we'll be doing that in upcoming videos.
128

128

00:07:36,418  -->  00:07:40,321
But, get your button so
it is anchored to the right of the screen.
129

129

00:07:40,321  -->  00:07:43,659
So here's the challenge, anchor your
elements, create a start button and
130

130

00:07:43,659  -->  00:07:45,286
anchor it to the right of the screen.
131

131

00:07:45,286  -->  00:07:48,748
Import an image or
use the image that I've given to you and
132

132

00:07:48,748  -->  00:07:53,797
anchor to the bottom left of the screen,
so that if the screen resolution changes,
133

133

00:07:53,797  -->  00:07:58,297
those two elements stay in sensible
positions and don't look too crazy.
134

134

00:07:58,297  -->  00:08:00,505
So there's your challenge,
jump in and take that on, and
135

135

00:08:00,505  -->  00:08:01,870
I'll see you back here in a moment.
136

136

00:08:04,336  -->  00:08:08,940
Okay, welcome back, so what I'm going
to do with the Wizard Rick here,
137

137

00:08:08,940  -->  00:08:12,940
clicking on Wizard Rick I'm going
to change the anchor point to
138

138

00:08:12,940  -->  00:08:17,707
the bottom left, and I could just move
it down to the bottom left like that.
139

139

00:08:17,707  -->  00:08:20,857
I'm gonna show you a little trick here,
if you're clicked on the anchor presets,
140

140

00:08:20,857  -->  00:08:23,392
if you hold down, there's a couple
of clues here, Shift and Alt.
141

141

00:08:23,392  -->  00:08:26,590
If you hold down Alt, and
then find the bottom left,
142

142

00:08:26,590  -->  00:08:30,526
if I click on that it will shift
the image down to the bottom left.
143

143

00:08:30,526  -->  00:08:35,503
I could have clicked on shift to top left,
or top right, or another position, and
144

144

00:08:35,503  -->  00:08:38,982
that just helps me easily
position things on the screen.
145

145

00:08:38,982  -->  00:08:42,497
Not pretty cool to do that,
that's just to help you line things up.
146

146

00:08:42,497  -->  00:08:45,243
So checking my pivot
is in the bottom left.
147

147

00:08:45,243  -->  00:08:49,954
Now if I change my aspect ratio to any of
these other things, it's still staying
148

148

00:08:49,954  -->  00:08:54,260
bottom left no matter what, so
we don't get that weird gap underneath.
149

149

00:08:54,260  -->  00:08:57,989
I know that 16:9 is probably
the lowest of my profiles.
150

150

00:08:57,989  -->  00:09:01,564
So long as my image fits
on the screen at 16:9 and
151

151

00:09:01,564  -->  00:09:05,401
isn't chopped off at the top,
I know that all is good.
152

152

00:09:05,401  -->  00:09:08,190
Now with the button, let me just
make my button a little bit more of
153

153

00:09:08,190  -->  00:09:10,880
a sensible shape,
don't worry about the text for the moment,
154

154

00:09:10,880  -->  00:09:12,985
we'll be dealing with
that in upcoming videos.
155

155

00:09:12,985  -->  00:09:18,643
And I will click on my anchoring, click on
the right, so middle and right is fine.
156

156

00:09:18,643  -->  00:09:20,971
You could do it bottom right
if you wanted, or top right,
157

157

00:09:20,971  -->  00:09:21,998
either of those is fine.
158

158

00:09:21,998  -->  00:09:26,727
l'll do it middle right, that means it
will be maintaining an equal distance from
159

159

00:09:26,727  -->  00:09:31,468
the right-hand side of our button to this
point right in the middle of the screen.
160

160

00:09:31,468  -->  00:09:35,632
So if we scale around our screen, you can
see that there's a lot of things added to
161

161

00:09:35,632  -->  00:09:38,450
the top and the bottom of the space,
added to the top and
162

162

00:09:38,450  -->  00:09:41,037
the bottom the button stays
mostly in the middle.
163

163

00:09:41,037  -->  00:09:44,537
And I wanna move that down a little
bit for this aspect ratio and
164

164

00:09:44,537  -->  00:09:47,918
at 16:10 it looks fine,

165
16:9 looks good as well.
165

166

00:09:47,918  -->  00:09:50,706
Okay, so that is us we've started
the process of anchoring,
166

167

00:09:50,706  -->  00:09:52,808
we've imported an image, created a button.
167

168

00:09:52,808  -->  00:09:56,299
We're gonna be doing a lot more cool
stuff with buttons in upcoming videos.
168

169

00:09:56,299  -->  00:09:59,048
Great work, and
I will see you in the next video.
