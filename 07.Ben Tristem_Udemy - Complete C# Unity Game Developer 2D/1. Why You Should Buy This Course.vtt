We would all love to teach you to code a really fun way using a unity engine to make tuti games.

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.200
Well it's been tristam founder of the game Dave TV.

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.500
We genuinely make some of the most popular game development tutorials in the world.

4
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.070
And I've teamed up with my friend.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.740
Thanks Ben.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.900
Hi I'm Rick I've been teaching people how to make games for more than 10 years what I know is that it's

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.840
really difficult to know where to start.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.640
And you only had a program when coding and learning game development.

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.360
Well I can assure you in this post we make it easy as A B for beginners to jump in and learn how to

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.160
code and learn how to make break.

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.300
Don't take our word for it.

12
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.010
There's over forty thousand people have taken the time to lead a review of this course which is amazing

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.190
thank you to those people.

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.720
And what's more we're making it even better in the summer of 2018.

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.990
We are upgrading the Internet of course to Unity 2018.

16
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.170
So all the newest possible content we have helped thousands of people make real gain.

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.900
And we want you to be one of them.

18
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.540
So Rick how do we do.

19
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.950
Yeah.

20
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.560
We're going to start with the fundamentals for C sharp getting you up and running.

21
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.570
Understanding things like what is a variable How do you measure that.

22
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.390
What are conditionals statements from the ground up.

23
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.130
Confidence for those foundations were also going to be getting in there and playing around with the

24
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.340
union so they understand unity as the interface work.

25
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.010
What are the different aspects of it.

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.860
Just getting really comfortable injured.

27
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.930
And the third player for this course is the game development game design aspect of things so I'm going

28
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.460
to talk a little bit about the player experience and how you create something that's going to be enjoyable

29
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.080
for someone to play when it's your game.

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.540
So they and then we move on to more advanced sharp tools just when we need them.

31
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.100
So that your code can continue to read pretty much like English.

32
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.600
Beautiful clean code simple solution.

33
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.300
We're going to take a deeper dive into the Unity's features again as we need them to enhance the player

34
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.650
experience to enhance your learning to increase the scope of the games that you make.

35
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.030
And we'll really start to think about the architecture of your solutions how things fit together how

36
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.370
they are ascetically how they are function.

37
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.730
So brick by the end of the course.

38
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.000
Can they do it by the end of this cause you will be a truly ninja you'll understand the foundations

39
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.110
of programming you know how to make an interesting game for players like the games that we've got on

40
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.420
the screen at the moment you'll be out to create these sorts of platforms defence games putting putting

41
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.430
your own creativity to them so that you can really make them your own step your own way it's the midpoint

42
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.580
flights your muscles is a game developer you cited to get going so it really is a biding time.

43
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.510
So learn to code.

44
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.010
So please dive in with us and we'll take care.
