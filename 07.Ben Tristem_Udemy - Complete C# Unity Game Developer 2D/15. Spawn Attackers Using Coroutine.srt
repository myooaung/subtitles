00:00:04,166  -->  00:00:06,349
Okay, exciting times in this video,
3

3

00:00:06,349  -->  00:00:10,800
we are going to create a spawner that
will pump out a whole bunch of attackers.
4

4

00:00:10,800  -->  00:00:14,940
We'll create five spawners, actually,
using our spawner script and
5

5

00:00:14,940  -->  00:00:17,080
co-routines and some randomness.
6

6

00:00:17,080  -->  00:00:20,671
So this is starting to look a little
bit like a game, let's jump in and
7

7

00:00:20,671  -->  00:00:21,361
get started!
8

8

00:00:21,361  -->  00:00:25,844
Okay, let's start this framework together,
and then I'm gonna give you a pretty meaty
9

9

00:00:25,844  -->  00:00:28,910
programming challenge,
hopefully you'll find it meaty.
10

10

00:00:28,910  -->  00:00:31,520
So first of all,
I need a concept of a spawner.
11

11

00:00:31,520  -->  00:00:37,176
So right-click, create empty,
we'll call this spawner,
12

12

00:00:37,176  -->  00:00:40,340
hit Enter, reset the transform.
13

13

00:00:40,340  -->  00:00:41,430
Now, where do we wanna spawn?
14

14

00:00:41,430  -->  00:00:45,650
We want to have them spawn over
on the right here, so I will move
15

15

00:00:45,650  -->  00:00:49,580
my spawner just to the top right,
I think this is gonna be an okay place.
16

16

00:00:49,580  -->  00:00:54,560
Remember, in my design,
I'm not placing defenders on these two.
17

17

00:00:54,560  -->  00:00:57,800
So you kind of wanna have it
up here from on the screen.
18

18

00:00:57,800  -->  00:00:58,610
That's a good spot for
19

19

00:00:58,610  -->  00:01:02,700
our first spawner, we can finesse
the position a little bit more later on.
20

20

00:01:02,700  -->  00:01:06,026
Now to move my trophy just
a bit out of the way so
21

21

00:01:06,026  -->  00:01:09,510
to simulate the fact that it would
be placed there in the game.
22

22

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:14,950
And then this lizard, I will just
move it a little bit out of the way.
23

23

00:01:14,950  -->  00:01:18,362
But he is the sort of guy that we wanna
have spawn, how do we need him to spawn?
24

24

00:01:18,362  -->  00:01:20,990
Well, we need to turn him into a prefab,
so
25

25

00:01:20,990  -->  00:01:23,619
grab a lizard, drag it down into Prefabs.
26

26

00:01:23,619  -->  00:01:27,710
We wanna be spawning, and instantiating
prefabs is the way for us to do it.
27

27

00:01:27,710  -->  00:01:30,570
So I now have a lizard prefab, over here,
we'll drag the trophy down, so
28

28

00:01:30,570  -->  00:01:32,290
we have a trophy prefab.
29

29

00:01:32,290  -->  00:01:35,060
And while we're here, we'll drag the
spawner down, so we have a spawner prefab.
30

30

00:01:35,060  -->  00:01:36,500
What else can we prefab while we're here?
31

31

00:01:36,500  -->  00:01:38,900
You know what,
let's prefab the canvas, there we go.
32

32

00:01:38,900  -->  00:01:40,672
And why not the camera as well?
33

33

00:01:40,672  -->  00:01:43,302
There we go, this is how you do
it when it comes to prefab-ing.
34

34

00:01:43,302  -->  00:01:46,460
Anything you can prefab,
you should prefab.
35

35

00:01:46,460  -->  00:01:52,091
Okay, now jump over in our scripts folder,
I will right-click, create
36

36

00:01:52,091  -->  00:01:57,450
a C# script that I will call, should
I call it Spawner or AttackerSpawner?
37

37

00:01:57,450  -->  00:02:02,167
I'm gonna call it AttackerSpawner,
because in the future,
38

38

00:02:02,167  -->  00:02:06,262
I think I'll be spawning
defenders as well, maybe.
39

39

00:02:06,262  -->  00:02:10,260
So we'll call it AttackerSpawner, so it's
super clear, and it also makes it right
40

40

00:02:10,260  -->  00:02:13,223
next door to the Attackers script,
I find that pretty useful.
41

41

00:02:13,223  -->  00:02:17,562
Let's open up AttackerSpawner script, and
I'm just gonna give you one thing in here
42

42

00:02:17,562  -->  00:02:20,464
as a starting point,
then I'll give you the challenge.
43

43

00:02:20,464  -->  00:02:24,864
And that is,
we need a bool that is called spawn, and
44

44

00:02:24,864  -->  00:02:27,972
we'll start that off as being true.
45

45

00:02:27,972  -->  00:02:31,175
So we're saying that when this
spawner script comes into action,
46

46

00:02:31,175  -->  00:02:32,318
which, you know what,
47

47

00:02:32,318  -->  00:02:36,336
back over into Unity, let's actually put
it back on our spawner, so we have that.
48

48

00:02:36,336  -->  00:02:40,660
Drag that AttackerSpawner script
onto there, great, got it.
49

49

00:02:40,660  -->  00:02:43,892
Now back into our
AttackerSpawner script itself.
50

50

00:02:43,892  -->  00:02:47,300
We wanna saw that spawn is this notion of,
51

51

00:02:47,300  -->  00:02:49,430
can you be spawning, or
can you not be spawning.
52

52

00:02:49,430  -->  00:02:52,440
At the start, we'll say true, cuz what
I wanna do at the end of my level,
53

53

00:02:52,440  -->  00:02:54,230
I want to stop spawning.
54

54

00:02:54,230  -->  00:02:57,470
I need to stop things spawning, so
we'll have that as part of our mechanism.
55

55

00:02:57,470  -->  00:02:58,880
What is the mechanism, I hear you ask?
56

56

00:02:58,880  -->  00:03:01,580
Well, this is your challenge,
to spawn the attackers.
57

57

00:03:01,580  -->  00:03:05,320
So to turn our Start method
into a coroutine, so
58

58

00:03:05,320  -->  00:03:09,030
that when that Start method is
called at the very start of
59

59

00:03:09,030  -->  00:03:12,860
when the script comes alive,
we want this coroutine to start.
60

60

00:03:12,860  -->  00:03:17,635
And while our spawn bool is true,
to keep spawning.
61

61

00:03:17,635  -->  00:03:19,915
And then, a little bit of extra flavor,
62

62

00:03:19,915  -->  00:03:23,613
I want you to spawn randomly between
one second and five seconds.
63

63

00:03:23,613  -->  00:03:27,776
So creating this coroutine's not gonna
produce anything on the screen just yet,
64

64

00:03:27,776  -->  00:03:29,479
but see if you can get this shape.
65

65

00:03:29,479  -->  00:03:31,972
What I mean by that is,
nothing is actually gonna spawn just yet
66

66

00:03:31,972  -->  00:03:33,679
cuz we're not creating our spawn method.
67

67

00:03:33,679  -->  00:03:37,424
You can do that if you want, but
this is to create the coroutine, and
68

68

00:03:37,424  -->  00:03:40,670
the structure for
spawning between one and five seconds.
69

69

00:03:40,670  -->  00:03:42,613
So jump in, give that your best shot, and
70

70

00:03:42,613  -->  00:03:45,402
I'll see you back here when you
have given it a good old try.
71

71

00:03:47,057  -->  00:03:51,126
Okay, so let's turn our Start
method here into a coroutine.
72

72

00:03:51,126  -->  00:03:54,890
And we do that by, I think we know
we use this for initialization, so
73

73

00:03:54,890  -->  00:03:56,418
I'll delete the comment.
74

74

00:03:56,418  -->  00:04:05,139
So we write in,
if I delete this correctly, IEnumerator.
75

75

00:04:05,139  -->  00:04:11,069
Okay, IEnumerator Start, still needs to
be called Start, put in our parentheses.
76

76

00:04:11,069  -->  00:04:14,416
Open our brackets, close our brackets, get
rid of that extra bracket that was from me
77

77

00:04:14,416  -->  00:04:16,500
not knowing how to delete things properly.
78

78

00:04:16,500  -->  00:04:18,600
And within here, what do we want to do?
79

79

00:04:18,600  -->  00:04:23,053
Well, first of all, I'm going to
use my bool to say while(spawn),
80

80

00:04:23,053  -->  00:04:28,198
which is saying while(spawn) = true,
but we can just write while(spawn).
81

81

00:04:28,198  -->  00:04:32,560
What do we wanna do, well, we need to do
our yield because it's an IEnumerator.
82

82

00:04:32,560  -->  00:04:38,760
yield return new,
I've done this a few times now.
83

83

00:04:38,760  -->  00:04:41,970
WaitForSeconds, how many
seconds we wanna wait.
84

84

00:04:41,970  -->  00:04:44,820
Well, this is where we can just put
in here 1 and then we're done, or
85

85

00:04:44,820  -->  00:04:47,130
we could do a little bit of randomness.
86

86

00:04:47,130  -->  00:04:50,370
So I wanna do some randomness,
Random.Range,
87

87

00:04:50,370  -->  00:04:53,010
with a capital R, Random.Range.
88

88

00:04:53,010  -->  00:04:58,910
And then we'll have some concept
of a minimum spawn delay,
89

89

00:04:58,910  -->  00:05:05,295
through to a maxSpawnDelay, and
then our semicolon at the end.
90

90

00:05:05,295  -->  00:05:10,221
So let's go and create these, I'm gonna
copy that up to the very, very top.
91

91

00:05:10,221  -->  00:05:15,370
We'll have a serialized field that will
be, what, a float, I think we need
92

92

00:05:15,370  -->  00:05:20,286
this to be, called minSpawnDelay,
and we'll initialize that at 1F.
93

93

00:05:20,286  -->  00:05:25,069
So it's one second at the start, and
then I'm gonna copy that whole line and
94

94

00:05:25,069  -->  00:05:27,405
then paste that whole line below it.
95

95

00:05:27,405  -->  00:05:31,635
We have a serialized float, minSpawnDelay,
this'll be a maxSpawnDelay.
96

96

00:05:31,635  -->  00:05:36,166
And we will have this at, I'm gonna say 5,
I think that's what I asked you to do in
97

97

00:05:36,166  -->  00:05:40,125
the challenge today, yes, 5, so
I'd better do that as well, okay.
98

98

00:05:42,545  -->  00:05:43,806
Cool, so that's all looking pretty good.
99

99

00:05:43,806  -->  00:05:46,893
We've got our coroutine
with our randomness,
100

100

00:05:46,893  -->  00:05:51,150
now we need to spawn something,
what do we need to spawn?
101

101

00:05:51,150  -->  00:05:55,160
Well, let's go and create our method,
so I'm gonna yield first, and
102

102

00:05:55,160  -->  00:05:56,500
then spawn second.
103

103

00:05:56,500  -->  00:06:00,495
So that I have a little bit of that
randomness happens at the very start.
104

104

00:06:00,495  -->  00:06:04,899
You could put the spawn above the yield,
so everything would be like blink, and
105

105

00:06:04,899  -->  00:06:06,860
spawn immediately with no delay.
106

106

00:06:06,860  -->  00:06:09,550
But, I think this way allows
us to have a bit more control.
107

107

00:06:09,550  -->  00:06:15,868
So do your delay first, however long that
needs to be, and then SpawnAttacker.
108

108

00:06:15,868  -->  00:06:18,413
We haven't created that yet, so
we'll get red squiggly lines.
109

109

00:06:18,413  -->  00:06:25,326
Let's create our SpawnAttacker
just underneath,
110

110

00:06:25,326  -->  00:06:30,674
so private void SpawnAttacker, okay.
111

111

00:06:32,823  -->  00:06:34,640
And then I'm gonna keep
it really simple for now.
112

112

00:06:34,640  -->  00:06:37,950
We'll add more complexity to this
as we go, and as the need arises.
113

113

00:06:37,950  -->  00:06:40,759
But for now,
we'll just do our instantiate,
114

114

00:06:40,759  -->  00:06:44,080
instantiate, and
what do we know about instantiate?
115

115

00:06:44,080  -->  00:06:47,650
Well, it's going to be looking for
an object, and what is the object?
116

116

00:06:47,650  -->  00:06:52,360
We haven't told it what the object is yet,
we need to create a serialized field.
117

117

00:06:52,360  -->  00:06:55,910
We need to be able to assign to our
spawner which particular game object, and
118

118

00:06:55,910  -->  00:06:57,577
so for now, we'll keep it simple.
119

119

00:06:57,577  -->  00:07:00,590
We'll just have the lizard,
which we've just gone and prefabbed.
120

120

00:07:00,590  -->  00:07:04,770
So at the top, we'll create
a new variable serialized field.
121

121

00:07:04,770  -->  00:07:08,963
We could make this Attacker type,
okay, let's do that, yeah,
122

122

00:07:08,963  -->  00:07:10,963
I think, so of type Attacker.
123

123

00:07:10,963  -->  00:07:14,720
So that means we can only be dragging
into our field Attacker type.
124

124

00:07:14,720  -->  00:07:18,075
We could make a game object,
then any game object could be dragged in.
125

125

00:07:18,075  -->  00:07:23,042
We'll say this is the attackerPrefab
126

126

00:07:24,864  -->  00:07:27,734
Okay, save that, now down here,
what are we instantiating?
127

127

00:07:27,734  -->  00:07:30,864
Well, we're instantiating
the attackerPrefab,
128

128

00:07:30,864  -->  00:07:32,506
where do we want to do that?
129

129

00:07:32,506  -->  00:07:35,822
Well, we wanna do a transform.position, so
130

130

00:07:35,822  -->  00:07:39,822
where we currently are, and
then what is the rotation?
131

131

00:07:39,822  -->  00:07:44,180
Well, we can just do rotation.position,
we could do the quaternion approach.
132

132

00:07:44,180  -->  00:07:47,976
Both of those work just fine,
but we'll say rotation.position,
133

133

00:07:47,976  -->  00:07:50,383
so whatever our rotation is at the moment.
134

134

00:07:50,383  -->  00:07:55,520
Sorry, my bad, transform, back to front,
trying to speak and type at the same time.
135

135

00:07:55,520  -->  00:08:00,542
Transform.rotation, there we go,
that's the way we actually type that.
136

136

00:08:00,542  -->  00:08:03,945
Now what we should be doing here is
spawning our attacker, instantiating,
137

137

00:08:03,945  -->  00:08:06,883
let's see how this works,
I'm sure we'll find an issue or two.
138

138

00:08:06,883  -->  00:08:09,279
I will just remove my current lizard, so
139

139

00:08:09,279  -->  00:08:13,587
we're not getting confused by what
that little guy down there is doing.
140

140

00:08:13,587  -->  00:08:20,582
Delete him, and then we need to find our
spawner and assign our attacker prefab.
141

141

00:08:20,582  -->  00:08:25,449
By finding where our prefabs are,
dragging over Lizard,
142

142

00:08:25,449  -->  00:08:27,943
[SOUND] there we go, found it.
143

143

00:08:27,943  -->  00:08:31,390
Click on Play, watch for
any errors in the console.
144

144

00:08:33,090  -->  00:08:35,590
And then there should be a little bit of
a delay, then [SOUND] the guy comes out.
145

145

00:08:35,590  -->  00:08:38,724
And he's not moving because we,
[SOUND] and then another spawn,
146

146

00:08:38,724  -->  00:08:39,836
[LAUGH] another spawn.
147

147

00:08:39,836  -->  00:08:44,507
Because in the last video, you probably
noticed, when I was playing around with
148

148

00:08:44,507  -->  00:08:48,786
my lizard and giving it an attack,
we left the default to 0 of walk speed.
149

149

00:08:48,786  -->  00:08:53,240
So I'll put this walk speed to 1, and
I update, remember to update your
150

150

00:08:53,240  -->  00:08:56,640
prefab if you're working on a game
object that's in the scene.
151

151

00:08:56,640  -->  00:08:58,210
If you're working directly on the prefab,
152

152

00:08:58,210  -->  00:09:00,840
then you won't have that option
cuz it's updated already.
153

153

00:09:00,840  -->  00:09:04,473
So let's try this one more time,
we'll see how this looks when we have
154

154

00:09:04,473  -->  00:09:07,257
an attacker jump onto
the screen after a short delay.
155

155

00:09:07,257  -->  00:09:11,413
[SOUND] And then walk, walk, and
another one, [SOUND] walk, walk.
156

156

00:09:11,413  -->  00:09:15,377
And a little bit of extra excitement,
let's duplicate our spawner.
157

157

00:09:15,377  -->  00:09:18,594
I'm gonna call this spawner,
I'm gonna go from rows one, no, actually,
158

158

00:09:18,594  -->  00:09:19,465
back to front here.
159

159

00:09:19,465  -->  00:09:26,429
Because this coordinates down the bottom
is 1, 1, that's 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
160

160

00:09:26,429  -->  00:09:30,101
So the top one is 5 and
the bottom one is 1, so
161

161

00:09:30,101  -->  00:09:35,630
I will drag this down to the bottom,
rename it as Spawner1, okay.
162

162

00:09:35,630  -->  00:09:40,380
Just cuz it's lane one, it's grid position
one, the coordinates are one on here,
163

163

00:09:40,380  -->  00:09:42,210
you can see it's close-ish to one.
164

164

00:09:42,210  -->  00:09:45,615
And then we will duplicate that,
two, three, four, five.
165

165

00:09:45,615  -->  00:09:51,050
2 we'll put into lane number two,
3 we'll put into lane number three.
166

166

00:09:51,050  -->  00:09:54,092
These should all have our
spawner script already on them,
167

167

00:09:54,092  -->  00:09:55,901
it should know exactly what to do.
168

168

00:09:55,901  -->  00:10:00,551
5 we'll put up to five, and now when
we click on Play, we should have a mad
169

169

00:10:00,551  -->  00:10:05,880
cacophony of lizards leaping onto the
screen, short delay, welcome to the level.
170

170

00:10:05,880  -->  00:10:10,639
There we go, attack, one, two, three,
here they all come, this is great.
171

171

00:10:10,639  -->  00:10:13,767
And like I said before, there's a little
bit of messiness with our animation, but
172

172

00:10:13,767  -->  00:10:15,570
that's something we will
tune as time goes on.
173

173

00:10:15,570  -->  00:10:17,959
But look at that wave of
enemies coming along.
174

174

00:10:17,959  -->  00:10:20,583
Probably noticed that,
cuz of our position of the lizard and
175

175

00:10:20,583  -->  00:10:22,800
stuff, we need to move our
spawner up a little bit.
176

176

00:10:22,800  -->  00:10:25,460
That'll get it just looking
a little bit tidier.
177

177

00:10:25,460  -->  00:10:29,030
That's the only finesse I'll do for
now, because we will be doing lots of
178

178

00:10:29,030  -->  00:10:31,588
positioning finesse and
polishing later on.
179

179

00:10:31,588  -->  00:10:33,499
That's pretty good, how cool is that?
180

180

00:10:33,499  -->  00:10:37,310
We've got some attackers
running into our game.
181

181

00:10:37,310  -->  00:10:40,320
We do need some defenders to stop them
getting to the end of the base, but
182

182

00:10:40,320  -->  00:10:40,940
great progress.
183

183

00:10:40,940  -->  00:10:42,790
Well done, I'll see you in the next video.
