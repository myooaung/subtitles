[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,249  -->  00:00:07,964
In this video we're gonna add an extra
couple of hazards such as these spikes, or
3

3

00:00:07,964  -->  00:00:11,244
the water that when the player touches
them blink it triggers out a death
4

4

00:00:11,244  -->  00:00:12,220
state as well.
5

5

00:00:12,220  -->  00:00:16,258
So let's jump in and make some hazards,
couple of pieces of housekeeping first.
6

6

00:00:16,258  -->  00:00:20,633
I have made a misstep in my previous
video where I've re-introduced our
7

7

00:00:20,633  -->  00:00:23,210
being able to jump off the wall issue.
8

8

00:00:23,210  -->  00:00:26,720
That's because I changed the capture or
collide of the player to ease trigger.
9

9

00:00:26,720  -->  00:00:29,300
Instead of having
the player be the trigger
10

10

00:00:29,300  -->  00:00:33,995
we need to make the enemy be the trigger
when it comes to that collision moment so
11

11

00:00:33,995  -->  00:00:36,970
the Captual collider,
that's all the way up to be.
12

12

00:00:36,970  -->  00:00:41,651
Captual collider on the enemy is now
is_trigger, I'll apply that back to
13

13

00:00:41,651  -->  00:00:46,199
the prefab, click on my player and
apply that back to the prefab as well.
14

14

00:00:46,199  -->  00:00:50,104
Always good to make sure we apply that
back, now we have eliminated the issue
15

15

00:00:50,104  -->  00:00:53,293
that I was seeing when I was doing
the double jump off the wall.
16

16

00:00:53,293  -->  00:00:56,902
So I can no longer double jump so
the player is not the trigger, and
17

17

00:00:56,902  -->  00:00:59,077
I can die when bouncing into the enemy.
18

18

00:00:59,077  -->  00:01:02,876
Okay, and now let's make ourselves some
spikes, some hazards it doesn't have to
19

19

00:01:02,876  -->  00:01:05,850
be spikes it could be anything it
could be water it could be lava.
20

20

00:01:05,850  -->  00:01:09,730
The opportunities is as far
as your imagination but
21

21

00:01:09,730  -->  00:01:13,430
what I've given you, is a couple of
little spikes that I've handcrafted,
22

22

00:01:13,430  -->  00:01:15,700
let me find my sprite folder over here.
23

23

00:01:15,700  -->  00:01:17,600
I've just gone and
handcrafted very quickly so
24

24

00:01:17,600  -->  00:01:20,030
we've got something that
clearly represents an obstacle.
25

25

00:01:20,030  -->  00:01:23,914
Drop it into my scene here
some little spiky spikes,
26

26

00:01:23,914  -->  00:01:28,092
change the pixels per unit to 32 and
hit Apply on that.
27

27

00:01:28,092  -->  00:01:32,014
We're gonna go and do a little bit
of sprite editing on the collision,
28

28

00:01:32,014  -->  00:01:37,080
it's on the physics shape to jump in here
it's close-ish, it's probably good enough.
29

29

00:01:37,080  -->  00:01:41,666
I'm just gonna click on that point there,
Delete, and drag this in a little bit
30

30

00:01:41,666  -->  00:01:46,230
closer just so it's a little bit
tighter around our shape here.
31

31

00:01:46,230  -->  00:01:50,500
Delete that one click on this nodule,
delete that as well is that a nodule?
32

32

00:01:50,500  -->  00:01:54,780
It's probably a node, isn't it, and
then I don't need that other one there.
33

33

00:01:54,780  -->  00:01:57,160
Okay, so that's just a quick
tidy up of the physics shape,
34

34

00:01:57,160  -->  00:01:59,740
so this is a little bit more
reasonable click Apply.
35

35

00:02:00,810  -->  00:02:04,700
Remove that so that we've got our spikes
all set up with their physics shape
36

36

00:02:04,700  -->  00:02:06,600
ready to go as well, which is super cool.
37

37

00:02:06,600  -->  00:02:09,458
Okay, so now that we've got that, now that
we've got now we have a sprite we can use,
38

38

00:02:09,458  -->  00:02:10,670
I'm gonna give you the challenge.
39

39

00:02:10,670  -->  00:02:15,027
This should be something that you
should be able to smash through pretty
40

40

00:02:15,027  -->  00:02:17,932
straightforwardly, there's not much code,
41

41

00:02:17,932  -->  00:02:21,289
just one little addition to
our code to make this work.
42

42

00:02:21,289  -->  00:02:26,049
But, the idea is to make the spikes harm
the player, to create a tilemap, consider
43

43

00:02:26,049  -->  00:02:30,960
collision, and make sure that you trigger
death when the player touches the spikes.
44

44

00:02:30,960  -->  00:02:32,089
So that's the challenge,
45

45

00:02:32,089  -->  00:02:34,600
is to lay down some spikes that
the player can interact with.
46

46

00:02:34,600  -->  00:02:38,156
Or if you wanna put down water or if you
wanna put down little, all right, some
47

47

00:02:38,156  -->  00:02:41,911
little toy mushrooms or something that
you think the player would be damaged by.
48

48

00:02:41,911  -->  00:02:44,295
So pause the video jump in
take on that challenge and
49

49

00:02:44,295  -->  00:02:47,243
when we come back I'll quickly
go through my solution to this.
50

50

00:02:48,903  -->  00:02:52,498
Okay, welcome back so first of all we're
going to create yourselves a tilemap.
51

51

00:02:52,498  -->  00:02:57,795
Right-click to the Object Tilemap,
I am going to rename this tilemap hazards.
52

52

00:02:57,795  -->  00:03:01,064
You could call it instant death if you
wanted if you wanted to be a little bit
53

53

00:03:01,064  -->  00:03:02,395
more melodramatic about it.
54

54

00:03:02,395  -->  00:03:06,547
We'll call it hazards for now, and we've
got already on here a tilemap renderer,
55

55

00:03:06,547  -->  00:03:07,331
which is cool.
56

56

00:03:07,331  -->  00:03:10,732
We need to add in addition
to that a tilemap collider,
57

57

00:03:10,732  -->  00:03:13,845
tilemap collider 2D, so
we have that in there.
58

58

00:03:13,845  -->  00:03:18,215
And we also have to create ourselves
a layer for physics collisions, so
59

59

00:03:18,215  -->  00:03:21,395
you can come all the way up to the very
top, click on Layers go to Edit layers.
60

60

00:03:21,395  -->  00:03:24,655
This is another way to get to this
mechanism, and you can see in here we've
61

61

00:03:24,655  -->  00:03:28,275
got in here our layers that might be
closed up for you, expand that out.
62

62

00:03:28,275  -->  00:03:31,655
We can add in here
a hazards layer in here,
63

63

00:03:31,655  -->  00:03:35,904
while we're at it we need to
make a rendering layer so
64

64

00:03:35,904  -->  00:03:40,172
that we know where it sits
we will call this hazards.
65

65

00:03:40,172  -->  00:03:45,102
And the hazards should be above
the foreground above probably
66

66

00:03:45,102  -->  00:03:49,283
the same place as the enemy
I think is the right spot.
67

67

00:03:49,283  -->  00:03:53,446
Okay so that's how we got that there so
we've added sorting layer hazards and
68

68

00:03:53,446  -->  00:03:57,480
layers, nice and confusingly named
I'm gonna call this physics layers,
69

69

00:03:57,480  -->  00:03:59,485
six layers hazards in there as well.
70

70

00:03:59,485  -->  00:04:03,613
Back over into our hazards tilemap and
we need to say for
71

71

00:04:03,613  -->  00:04:07,380
the renderer the sorting layer is hazards.
72

72

00:04:07,380  -->  00:04:10,860
And up at the top here under layer
we will make sure this is hazards,
73

73

00:04:10,860  -->  00:04:12,860
the next step is to jump over to Edit.
74

74

00:04:13,910  -->  00:04:17,150
Project Setting, physics 2D and
to make sure that our
75

75

00:04:17,150  -->  00:04:21,035
hazards are appropriately
colliding with appropriate things.
76

76

00:04:21,035  -->  00:04:26,090
I'm gonna turn off collision for
every single thing except for the player.
77

77

00:04:26,090  -->  00:04:29,555
Which means the enemies will run through,
we need to be a little bit careful not
78

78

00:04:29,555  -->  00:04:32,090
to make that look silly, but
I think that should be okay.
79

79

00:04:32,090  -->  00:04:34,742
I'd rather have the enemies kinda
run through this spikes for
80

80

00:04:34,742  -->  00:04:36,126
now until we decide otherwise.
81

81

00:04:36,126  -->  00:04:39,545
So the player should be
ticked under hazards here,
82

82

00:04:39,545  -->  00:04:42,733
that should all line up nice and
perfectly now.
83

83

00:04:42,733  -->  00:04:46,601
Okay, so let's paint some in there,
you can see that I've made myself a little
84

84

00:04:46,601  -->  00:04:48,922
hole in my world here
pretty straightforward.
85

85

00:04:48,922  -->  00:04:53,507
While on my foreground I just use my rule
tile here, if you hold down Shift, It
86

86

00:04:53,507  -->  00:04:58,447
deletes if you don't hold down shift when
you left click then it paints back again,
87

87

00:04:58,447  -->  00:05:01,700
so I've just created
a little hole in here.
88

88

00:05:01,700  -->  00:05:06,694
I'm going to on my main pallet drag
the spikes in to my main pallet here,
89

89

00:05:06,694  -->  00:05:09,880
that will ask me where
I'd like to save that.
90

90

00:05:09,880  -->  00:05:14,608
It's going to be saved under tiles and
it is spikes, that is correct,
91

91

00:05:14,608  -->  00:05:17,587
see it comes in all super
good paint that in.
92

92

00:05:17,587  -->  00:05:18,254
As always,
93

93

00:05:18,254  -->  00:05:22,812
make sure you have clicked on the correct
tilemap here when you come to painting.
94

94

00:05:22,812  -->  00:05:26,016
Click on Hazards,
click back on our spiky tiles,
95

95

00:05:26,016  -->  00:05:29,002
paint a couple of spikes
in the hole just here.
96

96

00:05:29,002  -->  00:05:32,609
It is looking pretty good
actually I think, not too bad for
97

97

00:05:32,609  -->  00:05:37,060
five minutes of Rick art,
[LAUGH] pretty quick Rick art.
98

98

00:05:37,060  -->  00:05:40,175
Okay, so we have our spikes in
there last couple of steps.
99

99

00:05:40,175  -->  00:05:44,084
Back onto our Hazards layer,
we make sure that we don't forget
100

100

00:05:44,084  -->  00:05:48,825
the thing I usually forget, which is
the is trigger on the tarmac collider.
101

101

00:05:48,825  -->  00:05:51,239
So we now have that set up as a trigger,
102

102

00:05:51,239  -->  00:05:54,794
over into our scripts we need
to go to the player script.
103

103

00:05:54,794  -->  00:05:58,156
In play a script we will
go to the mask in here,
104

104

00:05:58,156  -->  00:06:01,083
we currently have Enemy is a bad thing.
105

105

00:06:01,083  -->  00:06:05,853
And to do our copy and paste,
head up to Layers at the very top right,
106

106

00:06:05,853  -->  00:06:11,491
down to Edit Layers&gt; Highlight Hazards,
copy that back over into our script.
107

107

00:06:11,491  -->  00:06:17,631
And under our die method where we have
our LayerMask.GetMask next to Enemy,
108

108

00:06:17,631  -->  00:06:21,505
we do comma quotation marks,
paste in hazards,
109

109

00:06:21,505  -->  00:06:26,718
close quotation and that should
add the extra hazard of hazards.
110

110

00:06:26,718  -->  00:06:29,096
Now let's go see how that works,
click on Play,
111

111

00:06:29,096  -->  00:06:32,697
make sure we don't accidentally bump
into our enemy before we get there.
112

112

00:06:32,697  -->  00:06:34,929
Run, run, run, run and blink, yes,
113

113

00:06:34,929  -->  00:06:39,208
[LAUGH] my flying into space far too
aggressively as we talked about before.
114

114

00:06:39,208  -->  00:06:42,724
But now we have some hazards we can put
that anywhere in our scene we can have
115

115

00:06:42,724  -->  00:06:46,373
spikes here, we can have spikes there,
have things the player jumps over.
116

116

00:06:46,373  -->  00:06:49,774
It doesn't have to look as spikes we
can add a new as in here, in fact,
117

117

00:06:49,774  -->  00:06:52,542
let's just do that very quickly
to show how that works.
118

118

00:06:52,542  -->  00:06:56,568
I'm gonna add one of these
little water tiles in over here,
119

119

00:06:56,568  -->  00:07:00,111
instead of these spikes
I'll add in some water, and
120

120

00:07:00,111  -->  00:07:04,149
then maybe I will delete these
other spikes we had in there.
121

121

00:07:04,149  -->  00:07:08,209
And now that we have on water, it's on the
hazards layer, depending on the hazards
122

122

00:07:08,209  -->  00:07:11,468
layer, and we drop into the water,
and the water kills us as well.
123

123

00:07:11,468  -->  00:07:15,155
So that's a great way for us to be
putting a lot of variety in our games so
124

124

00:07:15,155  -->  00:07:18,593
any of these different themes we
can just paint onto this layer and
125

125

00:07:18,593  -->  00:07:21,548
it will be hazardous to the player,
which is very cool.
126

126

00:07:21,548  -->  00:07:24,080
And while we're here let's have a look
at what's going on with our enemy.
127

127

00:07:24,080  -->  00:07:28,948
Why the enemy is unhappy I'll click Play
and then Pause just as he's getting to
128

128

00:07:28,948  -->  00:07:32,945
the wall there, zoom in a bunch and
step forward frame by frame.
129

129

00:07:32,945  -->  00:07:37,530
We can see that as the first trigger
volume exits he flips around
130

130

00:07:37,530  -->  00:07:42,288
which is good but our new problem
is that this collider that we only
131

131

00:07:42,288  -->  00:07:46,377
just now said is the trigger so
that it harms the player.
132

132

00:07:46,377  -->  00:07:50,525
We didn't have this before because this
capture collider wasn't the trigger as
133

133

00:07:50,525  -->  00:07:53,711
that trigger also exits a collision,
it flips around again.
134

134

00:07:53,711  -->  00:07:57,381
So, we need to just do a little bit of
editing on the size of those colliders and
135

135

00:07:57,381  -->  00:07:58,123
positioning.
136

136

00:07:58,123  -->  00:08:02,938
It's cuz of the center point of the enemy
and where our box collider is here so
137

137

00:08:02,938  -->  00:08:07,090
a little bit of repositioning I
think will do just nicely on that.
138

138

00:08:07,090  -->  00:08:10,880
I will go to the box collider,
that box collider here,
139

139

00:08:10,880  -->  00:08:15,180
oops, box collider, and
click on Edit collider,
140

140

00:08:15,180  -->  00:08:19,180
move this ad a little bit further,
move that as a little bit further as well.
141

141

00:08:19,180  -->  00:08:24,972
It's the point where the collider exits
the collision that we wanna know about,
142

142

00:08:24,972  -->  00:08:29,504
and then I'll tidy up my capture
collider a little bit as well.
143

143

00:08:29,504  -->  00:08:32,347
Edit collider just to make it
a little bit less big at the back,
144

144

00:08:32,347  -->  00:08:35,025
I think that the player kinda
brushes against the enemy and
145

145

00:08:35,025  -->  00:08:37,883
doesn't die that's fine
the player's gonna forgive that.
146

146

00:08:37,883  -->  00:08:41,557
And just if the player ;ands smack
bang in the middle of the enemy,
147

147

00:08:41,557  -->  00:08:45,114
then we definitely need to have
that the enemy hurts the player.
148

148

00:08:45,114  -->  00:08:51,700
So let's try one more time make sure
this is all good Pause, step forward.
149

149

00:08:51,700  -->  00:08:55,834
We'll see where the point of flip usage
still might be a little bit touching
150

150

00:08:55,834  -->  00:09:00,176
it's only just out of it okay, that's
pretty good, that should work fine now.
151

151

00:09:00,176  -->  00:09:02,300
If you find that your
enemy is still flipping,
152

152

00:09:02,300  -->  00:09:04,758
then you might need to do
a little bit more finessing.
153

153

00:09:04,758  -->  00:09:08,128
Okay, that looks pretty good and
do we still wow okay,
154

154

00:09:08,128  -->  00:09:10,048
I might need to turn that down.
155

155

00:09:10,048  -->  00:09:13,126
When I get sick of seeing my
player fly across the screen,
156

156

00:09:13,126  -->  00:09:15,130
I'll turn the amount of force down.
157

157

00:09:15,130  -->  00:09:18,690
But for now, I still find it kinda
humorous, so I'll leave it in there, okay,
158

158

00:09:18,690  -->  00:09:19,980
so great work in this video.
159

159

00:09:19,980  -->  00:09:23,840
We've now got to the point where you can
put anything into your hazards layer and
160

160

00:09:23,840  -->  00:09:26,730
it will add a lot of depth to your game.
161

161

00:09:26,730  -->  00:09:30,870
Your level by putting spikes, by putting
water, by putting hanging chandeliers that
162

162

00:09:30,870  -->  00:09:34,150
you bump your head onto,
whatever it is that your heart desires.
163

163

00:09:34,150  -->  00:09:36,890
Great work and
I'll see you in an upcoming video.
