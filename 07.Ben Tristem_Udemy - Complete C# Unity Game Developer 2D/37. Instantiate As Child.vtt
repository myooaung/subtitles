2

00:00:04.100  -->  00:00:07.550
Hello and welcome, in this video,
we're gonna have a problem and a solution.
3

3

00:00:07.550  -->  00:00:09.310
What is the problem, I hear you ask?
4

4

00:00:09.310  -->  00:00:13.150
Well, when our attackers are instantiated,
when they're spawning,
5

5

00:00:13.150  -->  00:00:16.540
you can see they're just being
plopped down in our hierarchy here.
6

6

00:00:16.540  -->  00:00:20.040
And the hierarchy gets pretty full
when we get more stuff in it.
7

7

00:00:20.040  -->  00:00:23.700
Generally, we've been not
really worrying about where
8

8

00:00:23.700  -->  00:00:25.510
new game objects are being instantiated.
9

9

00:00:25.510  -->  00:00:28.340
We're just saying put them wherever, but
now we're gonna start to tidy that up for
10

10

00:00:28.340  -->  00:00:29.290
two reasons.
11

11

00:00:29.290  -->  00:00:34.180
One is because we need to know exactly
where the attackers are spawning, so
12

12

00:00:34.180  -->  00:00:37.050
that we can say whether
the defender should shoot or not.
13

13

00:00:37.050  -->  00:00:40.984
So we need to be saying,
is there an attacker in my lane?
14

14

00:00:40.984  -->  00:00:43.210
And if there is, then I should shoot.
15

15

00:00:43.210  -->  00:00:46.750
So what I want you to do,
as a first challenge, is to
16

16

00:00:47.880  -->  00:00:52.335
remember to figure out where in our code
do we instantiate each new attacker.
17

17

00:00:52.335  -->  00:00:55.225
So we've done this in the past,
should be easy enough to find.
18

18

00:00:55.225  -->  00:00:58.085
But just a good chance for
you to go digging through your scripts and
19

19

00:00:58.085  -->  00:01:02.705
find aha, this is is the exact moment
that we instantiate a new attacker.
20

20

00:01:02.705  -->  00:01:05.425
So take on that challenge and
I'll see you back here in a moment.
21

21

00:01:07.220  -->  00:01:08.900
Right, so we'll do this logically.
22

22

00:01:08.900  -->  00:01:12.950
We'll have a look at it and we'll say,
when we are spawning attackers,
23

23

00:01:12.950  -->  00:01:14.950
what is the thing that spawns attackers?
24

24

00:01:14.950  -->  00:01:19.107
Well, I believe it's my spawners
that are spawning attackers.
25

25

00:01:19.107  -->  00:01:20.130
Double-click on there.
26

26

00:01:20.130  -->  00:01:24.008
And so, what I'll do is go find
my AttackerSpawner script,
27

27

00:01:24.008  -->  00:01:25.740
open that up, have a look in here.
28

28

00:01:25.740  -->  00:01:27.710
Is there anything that's instantiating?
29

29

00:01:27.710  -->  00:01:29.870
There we go, SpawnAttacker Instantiate.
30

30

00:01:29.870  -->  00:01:32.810
And first, we've gotta keep track of
what's going on with this object that
31

31

00:01:32.810  -->  00:01:33.640
we're instantiating.
32

32

00:01:33.640  -->  00:01:37.700
We want to instantiate it as something,
we'll instantiate it as an attacker.
33

33

00:01:37.700  -->  00:01:38.940
So make myself a new line here.
34

34

00:01:38.940  -->  00:01:42.910
I'll say, of type Attacker,
and we'll call this,
35

35

00:01:42.910  -->  00:01:48.570
what should we call it, newAttacker and
that will equal this Instantiate.
36

36

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:49.480
It's gonna be pretty long.
37

37

00:01:49.480  -->  00:01:50.690
We'll leave it long for a moment,
38

38

00:01:50.690  -->  00:01:53.480
then we'll figure out a way to
format it a little bit better.
39

39

00:01:53.480  -->  00:01:58.630
But instantiate, take a prefab transform
position, transform.rotation as what?
40

40

00:01:58.630  -->  00:02:02.630
What do we need to instantiate this as,
as an Attacker.
41

41

00:02:03.790  -->  00:02:08.780
Okay, and because this is super duper
long, let's go and instantiate.
42

42

00:02:08.780  -->  00:02:14.216
I'll make a new line for attackerPrefab,
position transform.rotation as Attacker.
43

43

00:02:14.216  -->  00:02:16.485
Okay, you can organize
this however you want.
44

44

00:02:16.485  -->  00:02:18.430
We've talked about this
a lot with your whitespace.
45

45

00:02:18.430  -->  00:02:23.480
But this for me makes sense so
that it fits on my screen.
46

46

00:02:23.480  -->  00:02:25.930
Okay, so then we're instantiating.
47

47

00:02:25.930  -->  00:02:27.230
Let's just go and test that.
48

48

00:02:27.230  -->  00:02:28.840
It's always good to test these things.
49

49

00:02:28.840  -->  00:02:33.869
I've had some people in the Q and A tell
me, Rick, sometimes, or specifically
50

50

00:02:33.869  -->  00:02:38.615
say on this instance Rick didn't go and
test the change of the code he made.
51

51

00:02:38.615  -->  00:02:40.720
Are we teaching new
programmers bad habits?
52

52

00:02:40.720  -->  00:02:43.430
Yes, we are, we should always go and
test what we've done.
53

53

00:02:43.430  -->  00:02:45.040
That's instantiated, that's instantiated.
54

54

00:02:45.040  -->  00:02:49.170
Okay, it's still being chucked
into the hierarchy any old place.
55

55

00:02:49.170  -->  00:02:51.190
That's what we're gonna go and
figure out now.
56

56

00:02:51.190  -->  00:02:53.790
So in this case,
because we know who the parent is,
57

57

00:02:53.790  -->  00:02:58.680
it's whatever the game object is, where
the AttackerSpawner script is located.
58

58

00:02:58.680  -->  00:03:01.370
For us,
that's gonna be a spawner in our world.
59

59

00:03:01.370  -->  00:03:05.828
So then we can say in here,
60

60

00:03:05.828  -->  00:03:14.562
newAttacker.transform.parent = transform.
61

61

00:03:14.562  -->  00:03:19.721
Okay, so it's a way of saying the parent
of this new thing we've just created,
62

62

00:03:19.721  -->  00:03:20.960
the new attacker.
63

63

00:03:20.960  -->  00:03:24.641
The parent is going to be transformed,
which is saying me,
64

64

00:03:24.641  -->  00:03:27.080
which is saying the transform up here.
65

65

00:03:27.080  -->  00:03:30.260
You can see if I click on the spawner,
there is the transform.
66

66

00:03:30.260  -->  00:03:32.640
That's a way of me having my identity.
67

67

00:03:32.640  -->  00:03:37.960
It's the who I am, where I am, what I am,
so to speak, so it's the transform.
68

68

00:03:37.960  -->  00:03:39.660
So save that up, back over into Unity.
69

69

00:03:39.660  -->  00:03:43.892
What we're looking for here is to see
where our lizards are instantiating.
70

70

00:03:43.892  -->  00:03:46.285
And you can see, there we go, within here,
71

71

00:03:46.285  -->  00:03:48.950
we've got all these
lizards starting to spawn.
72

72

00:03:48.950  -->  00:03:50.570
I'll just pause here so we can see it.
73

73

00:03:50.570  -->  00:03:52.166
So underneath Spawner,
74

74

00:03:52.166  -->  00:03:56.330
we can see we've got our new
attacker objects being spawned.
75

75

00:03:56.330  -->  00:03:59.439
And this is gonna be very useful
when we get there and say, okay,
76

76

00:03:59.439  -->  00:04:01.294
should this cactus shoot, yes or no?
77

77

00:04:01.294  -->  00:04:03.962
It's in lane three,
we'll have a look at lane three,
78

78

00:04:03.962  -->  00:04:07.520
currently there's no children for
lane three, so don't shoot.
79

79

00:04:07.520  -->  00:04:10.530
But if the cactus was in lane one,
down the bottom here,
80

80

00:04:10.530  -->  00:04:16.830
lane one currently has two children, so
if greater than zero children, then shoot.
81

81

00:04:16.830  -->  00:04:19.600
And as we go through our project,
we'll continue to tidy up where things
82

82

00:04:19.600  -->  00:04:24.100
are instantiated in our hierarchy, but for
now, just the attackers we've tidied up.
83

83

00:04:24.100  -->  00:04:25.480
So great stuff, well done.
84

84

00:04:25.480  -->  00:04:26.740
I will see you in the next video.
