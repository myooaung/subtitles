00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.570
In this video we're going to be adding our levels of visual breakage on our block so that as the block

2
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.800
gets more broken walk.

3
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.640
I still can't play my game very well.

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.400
So these ones down the bottom here have different levels of breakage on them so we'll just play that

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.310
different Sprite as it gets more damaged.

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.650
Again the last lecture we give ourselves some levels of damage on our blocks but there's a problem.

7
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.400
And let's talk about our current problem.

8
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.840
You know what is problem solution once we know our problem we can think about how to fix it and what

9
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.850
to work on next.

10
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.470
So the player carolee has no affordance I'll get to that word in a moment on how damaged a block is.

11
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.550
In other words we can't see it change at all.

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.570
So what is affordance what affordance is a term coined by a perceptual psychologist James Gibson came

13
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.450
up with this word of affordance basically affordance provides a strong clue to the operation of things.

14
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.880
In our case visual clues to tell the player how something works.

15
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.950
So you hear us talking about that quite a bit when we're working on our game.

16
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.990
What's the affordance how are we telling the player that something is going to happen or something has

17
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.520
happened.

18
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.510
So the player knows what's going on based upon what they see in our case what we're going to do is show

19
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.290
different levels of damage.

20
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.740
And I'm looking for my sprite's here this is from the Sprite pack that you downloaded at the start of

21
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.690
this section unless of course you pirated the course in which case you might not have these assets and

22
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.800
you can get out your crayon and draw directly onto your monitor.

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.250
That is if you pirated the course.

24
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.680
Otherwise there's an American Union there.

25
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.070
Otherwise you will have these levels of damage so level broken one and broken through.

26
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.010
So going to using those to show the player some progression.

27
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.400
Let's jump over into our block.

28
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.680
See script first of all at the very top what we need to do is to create an array.

29
00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.630
We've done this before so it should be recognizable to Will serialise field and this array of types.

30
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.250
Right.

31
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.740
The sprite's we're just wing in America an open Anglo's square brackets.

32
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.920
What shall we call this.

33
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.310
I think we should call this hit sprite's to show that they are the hits bracts.

34
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.350
Okay.

35
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.790
So we've created an array.

36
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.540
Next we need to find a place that we want to be showing the different Sprite or the different debt limit

37
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.840
debt limit them or what's a limited number delage level to the player a bit tongue tied today in this

38
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.170
lecture.

39
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.610
What's gone on with me.

40
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.560
Okay so let's have a look.

41
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.880
Where is the place that we are breaking our blocks or a handle here.

42
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.050
This is the place where we say if it's breakable than handle the hit within handle here we're saying

43
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.160
do some things if it's times hit is growing the max then destroy block.

44
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.740
Okay.

45
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.330
What if we're not ready to destroy the block yet.

46
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.450
Well at this point we can say else.

47
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.290
So we're destroying the block or we're doing something else Same else.

48
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.150
New line open and close out curly braces I say else.

49
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.630
Show you next hit sprite's hit sprite.

50
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.290
I think we'll say shaikhs It's bright.

51
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.750
And because it's a method we need out having close parentheses semicolon red squiggly line because this

52
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.350
doesn't exist yet.

53
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.370
Going to right click on shown exits fried's quick actions and three factors and then I have an option

54
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.230
to generate this as a method.

55
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.970
You can see just down below We've got show next hit sprite's Well the highlight out the fault code in

56
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.100
here just delete that so it's Show next hits right.

57
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.780
What does that mean.

58
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.870
What do we want to do at this point in time.

59
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.580
Well first of all we need to have a way of getting in and changing the Sprite.

60
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.500
We click on the game objectively click on our blog we can see that and wrasse bright renderer where

61
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.660
we're showing our Sprite is right here under material.

62
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.020
Sorry.

63
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.410
Under a sprite block square.

64
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.470
So Sprite renderer dot Sprite is where we're displaying what the Sprite looks like so we want to be

65
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.010
changing this in our code.

66
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.820
When the ball hits the block we want to say instead of this thing we want to show a different thing.

67
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.050
What's the different thing we want to show.

68
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.930
Well that's going to depend upon our array.

69
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.490
The array that we create at the top is because the array could take in one or two or three different

70
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.350
levels of hits.

71
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.810
Right.

72
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.940
So it's going to depend where we are without a race.

73
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.680
Let me scroll back down a show next hit Sprite and I will say in here I'll type in here get component.

74
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.150
Open and close.

75
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.340
Our angle bracers we're looking for these Sprite renderer Sprite renderer get components bright renderer

76
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.320
open and close parentheses because it's a method and we're just having a look.

77
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.650
Dot Sprite.

78
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.240
That's the field we're looking to change equals what's going to equal on here.

79
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.110
Well first of all say heat sprite's that's the array that we've created and what level are we at if

80
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.240
we say just level the zero.

81
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.150
Then there will be the very first entry in our array we'll close that day.

82
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.840
Now that's okay but it's only ever going to show the first level in the array the first array entry

83
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.610
it finds we don't have to go and say well nowadays are one now to two we want there to be a little bit

84
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.070
dynamic so it's a variable in here which we will call Sprite index in the Sprite index is something

85
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.000
that we can update and a bar-lev GET component we will declare what the Sprite index is so this is going

86
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.370
to be an int Sprite index equals What's it going to equal.

87
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.180
Well we know that the ball is bouncing So we know the number of times that we have hit the block.

88
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:42.980
So I'd say times hit but we can't say just times hit because the arrays starts at zero remember so any

89
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.880
array that we have starts at zero.

90
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.970
The very first entry point will be zero and the next one will be one and so on.

91
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.780
So I will say times here at minus 1 semicolon.

92
00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.770
So if the ball has gone bounce into our block once then the times hit will be one.

93
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.310
Therefore we want to show the first entry in the array which will be zero.

94
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.670
So we want this value to end up being zero on the first time something's hit.

95
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.340
So that what is being passed into our hits Brites variable is the value of zero.

96
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.140
Okay hopefully that makes sense in a save these and before we get into our back into the engine and

97
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.270
see if it works only gets you to do the next step as a challenge and the challenge is going to be to

98
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.350
create two new prefabs using the curry that we've created.

99
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.840
This all should work nicely.

100
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.170
The first prefab is a two hit block which has just the one damaged levels in other words we start off

101
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.150
with the default no damage and we go bonk into it once and we show the first damage level and then bonk

102
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.490
into it a second time and it destroys and the other prefab will be a three hit block that has the two

103
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.320
damage levels.

104
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:53.720
So a sign the damage sprite's to your prefabs and test that and see how it goes and all should be great.

105
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.630
So you've let your best shot and I'll see you back here in a moment.

106
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.320
Case we've got our code jump back over into unity.

107
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:11.520
I will be in my prefabs folder prefabs folder find breakable block old duplicate that once changed the

108
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.040
name to let's see.

109
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:24.590
One hit breakable breakable and then without one hit breakable you can see now unhit sprite's So under

110
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:31.190
our script in our inspector we have size and you see undersize if I change this to one that means we're

111
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.290
going to have our one hit Sprite size is now one.

112
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.800
And it's looking for accidently close it looking for what is the element element zero.

113
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:44.540
So click on our selector find broken block and it's a little bit counterintuitive here because if it's

114
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.820
only one hit then we want to go to the most broken level from an affordance point of view we want to

115
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.890
say that you only have to do one more hit.

116
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.690
This thing's going to be broken to bits.

117
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.750
It's going to be destroyed so we'll select that they're broken block broken to when its size one and

118
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.880
then let us instantiate one of these into the scene.

119
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.380
Dropit just there test this to see if it works before we go any further.

120
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.570
Click on play.

121
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.700
And I can already think of one problem that means this won't work.

122
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.950
And when I hit it's destroyed straightaway Why is that.

123
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.600
So I click on my block the max hits zero will put this up to two to the maximum and it's hit once and

124
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.480
that's okay.

125
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:27.510
It's the second time remember greater or equal then and on the second hit is when we want it to exploit

126
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.910
it or put it to our hits brides.

127
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.940
We have one size element in that when we click on Play this should all work nice and neatly.

128
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.100
Let's test it out.

129
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.390
We hit it once it damages and then if I can get it the second time yes and then it gets destroyed.

130
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:42.970
OK.

131
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.540
You might start to be seeing a rate index out of range issues that's something we're going to fix in

132
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.350
an upcoming lecture.

133
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.600
So for now it's a little bit naughty but we're going to ignore that.

134
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.090
You should always pounce on the warnings as soon as you find them by time.

135
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.120
I know about that one.

136
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.690
That's no we're going to fix that very shortly.

137
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.380
But what we've done I've created my first one level break will block I'm going to change the colour

138
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.870
of that just so it's super clear that it is orange colour.

139
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.210
So I know it will be different and then duplicate.

140
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.540
This will be my two hit sorry every name this incorrectly I have an eye.

141
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.560
This should be.

142
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.490
This first one should be the guy who hit because we hit at once.

143
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.980
That's okay.

144
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.880
We did the second time it breaks.

145
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.960
This one I'm creating now should be my third my threet breakable will change the colour of the three

146
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.210
breakable so it's very obvious.

147
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.920
Okay good.

148
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.930
Now we have that as the red colour dropped into the scene.

149
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:44.720
I need to on the prefab needed change the maximum hits from It's currently 0 I need to change that up

150
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.820
to three maximum hits and the size or change to 2.

151
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.530
It's going to look for another element and it automatically populate that populates with elements that

152
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.430
we had in there already.

153
00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:04.850
I'm going to change my element while 1 hour my elmina's ZERO The very first point on the array to the

154
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.760
first step of brokenness.

155
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:12.160
So ellman's has broken block one element one is broken what to generally whatever's the last element.

156
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.810
Sorry Almont one in this case the highest is going to have my last level of damage we will see if the

157
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.470
raid works.

158
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.630
Click on Play.

159
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.820
So it's of a race size to one level of damage that looks pretty good.

160
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.530
I'm crunching in.

161
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.380
Let's see if we can do this a little bit more neatly.

162
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.190
One and Two.

163
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.060
You're not to.

164
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.450
Here's a tip for you to make this go a little bit easier.

165
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.760
Click on my block.

166
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.370
Change the size of it by just scaling it very wide across the screen.

167
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.730
It looks ugly but this is for testing purposes.

168
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.720
So it's all good and click once broken.

169
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.390
Still can't play the game.

170
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.210
I didn't make that paddle massive don't I.

171
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.350
That's probably what I do.

172
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.160
See what I should do so your not having to sit there watching me.

173
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.870
I'll get there we go.

174
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:01.820
So that definitely did have the right number of levels and then definitely did destroy Ms any undo on

175
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.290
that so it's not so huge.

176
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:09.350
And remember just because we've got our prefab colour as yellow red and orange doesn't mean that we

177
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.340
have to have that in the game.

178
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.630
I can now go into my instance and change the colour on that so it could be whatever colour if I was

179
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.790
to make this say a bluey colour.

180
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:24.790
Then when we play that colour is going to be put over the top of any of the levels of Sprite and see

181
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:31.160
the Sprite damage levels that appear so I'm using that generic in my sobriety using these generic colour

182
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:37.370
shape sprites and our tint from ASP bright render renderer is going to be put over the top of that.

183
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.270
Okay great work we've got a couple of issues and a little bit of cleaning up to do but now we can show

184
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.630
the player that have fallen so they can see just how damaged a block is.

185
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.290
Well done and I'll see in the next lecture.
