00:00:04,269  -->  00:00:05,423
Hello again, in this video,
3

3

00:00:05,423  -->  00:00:07,885
we're gonna set ourselves up
a background that looks pretty.
4

4

00:00:07,885  -->  00:00:10,652
Some trees that have some layering and
some depth.
5

5

00:00:10,652  -->  00:00:14,110
And this is my little placeholder
game character, by the way.
6

6

00:00:14,110  -->  00:00:16,170
And our world coordinate system, so
7

7

00:00:16,170  -->  00:00:20,240
that we know that each of our
squares equals one game unit.
8

8

00:00:20,240  -->  00:00:22,890
So we can say that if something
is positioned at 7, 4,
9

9

00:00:22,890  -->  00:00:28,975
we know exactly which particular square it
would be in, versus if it's at, say, 1, 1.
10

10

00:00:28,975  -->  00:00:31,036
So let's jump in and get all this set up.
11

11

00:00:31,036  -->  00:00:34,036
Okay so we're comfortable with our
game now, we've got our safe zone.
12

12

00:00:34,036  -->  00:00:36,832
We know that when we have
a look at this in 4:3,
13

13

00:00:36,832  -->  00:00:41,499
that it doesn't chop off any of our core
gameplay grid, which is all excellent.
14

14

00:00:41,499  -->  00:00:45,800
And we know that our squares,
if we have nine of them in the play area,
15

15

00:00:45,800  -->  00:00:49,526
then they're gonna be 160
by 160 in terms of pixels.
16

16

00:00:49,526  -->  00:00:53,036
What we wanna do now is
convert our canvas so
17

17

00:00:53,036  -->  00:00:57,728
that we have it relating to
our play space and world unit.
18

18

00:00:57,728  -->  00:01:01,079
So that you can see all the way down here,
this is where our camera is at the moment.
19

19

00:01:01,079  -->  00:01:04,914
This is where our camera's saying, I think
the game should be down here with our
20

20

00:01:04,914  -->  00:01:07,086
units running around and
our towers and stuff.
21

21

00:01:07,086  -->  00:01:10,417
And the canvas is independent,
the canvas is just saying, well,
22

22

00:01:10,417  -->  00:01:12,751
whatever the game does
doesn't matter to me.
23

23

00:01:12,751  -->  00:01:16,027
I'm just gonna slap myself right
over the top of the screen.
24

24

00:01:16,027  -->  00:01:19,120
And if the screen is 16 by 9,
this is what I'll look like.
25

25

00:01:19,120  -->  00:01:22,813
But we want to be using our
background as our play space,
26

26

00:01:22,813  -->  00:01:25,099
so that we can see the background.
27

27

00:01:25,099  -->  00:01:28,426
We've put our background into UI, so
we're doing it a different way so
28

28

00:01:28,426  -->  00:01:29,710
you can see how this works.
29

29

00:01:29,710  -->  00:01:33,068
We haven't put our background into
the play space, we haven't gone and
30

30

00:01:33,068  -->  00:01:35,174
put our background right
behind the camera.
31

31

00:01:35,174  -->  00:01:38,475
We've put our background in the UI,
just as a different way of doing it.
32

32

00:01:38,475  -->  00:01:40,410
Okay, so what do we need to do?
33

33

00:01:40,410  -->  00:01:43,709
Well, first of all, we need to have
a look at our render mode for canvas.
34

34

00:01:43,709  -->  00:01:46,901
We're using screen space overlay,
which is what we normally do,
35

35

00:01:46,901  -->  00:01:48,320
we need to change that.
36

36

00:01:48,320  -->  00:01:49,340
Now, we haven't done much of this, but
37

37

00:01:49,340  -->  00:01:53,610
if you click on the little book next to
the canvas here, you can see the little
38

38

00:01:53,610  -->  00:01:57,700
books all over the place, that takes
you to the Unity help documentation.
39

39

00:01:57,700  -->  00:02:00,450
And when we're in here,
we can see the options we have for canvas.
40

40

00:02:00,450  -->  00:02:05,840
We have screen space overlay,
screen space camera, and world space.
41

41

00:02:05,840  -->  00:02:09,591
Theses correspond to, in here, screen
space overlay, camera, and world space.
42

42

00:02:09,591  -->  00:02:12,170
Now, what is the different
between each of these?
43

43

00:02:12,170  -->  00:02:16,310
We'll just very quickly, when we're in
screen space overlay, anything that we
44

44

00:02:16,310  -->  00:02:20,450
have in our UI, on our canvas,
will just sit over the top of the game.
45

45

00:02:20,450  -->  00:02:25,274
If we're in screen space camera,
anything that we have will
46

46

00:02:25,274  -->  00:02:30,106
fit within our view based upon
the distance from the camera.
47

47

00:02:30,106  -->  00:02:34,721
So if we say our UI is way a long distance
from the camera, but our game elements
48

48

00:02:34,721  -->  00:02:38,981
are really close to the camera,
then they will render on top of that UI.
49

49

00:02:38,981  -->  00:02:42,247
That's you can create a really
cool effect there, if you say,
50

50

00:02:42,247  -->  00:02:46,004
I want stuff like UI elements,
buttons and all these cool kinda things,
51

51

00:02:46,004  -->  00:02:48,155
behind what's showing on the front.
52

52

00:02:48,155  -->  00:02:51,555
What we're gonna use is world space,
cuz we want our world,
53

53

00:02:51,555  -->  00:02:54,605
we want our background,
which is currently on our canvas.
54

54

00:02:54,605  -->  00:02:58,275
You see, we've got our background which
is on our canvas, which is a UI element.
55

55

00:02:58,275  -->  00:03:02,165
We want to have it appear
like it's in the world, so
56

56

00:03:02,165  -->  00:03:04,415
our characters are jumping on top of it.
57

57

00:03:04,415  -->  00:03:07,738
We can have elements in our user
interface, which is in front,
58

58

00:03:07,738  -->  00:03:09,256
elements which are behind.
59

59

00:03:09,256  -->  00:03:13,857
And we wanna have that closer relationship
between, if something's moving three units
60

60

00:03:13,857  -->  00:03:17,964
from left to right, then it looks like
it's three units on the background, and
61

61

00:03:17,964  -->  00:03:20,140
it's actually three units in the world.
62

62

00:03:20,140  -->  00:03:24,840
So the first step is,
change your render mode to world space.
63

63

00:03:24,840  -->  00:03:28,700
Nothing happens straight away, but
there's a bunch of stuff we can now do.
64

64

00:03:28,700  -->  00:03:33,622
So it's still 1920 by 1080,
it's rounded in a bit of a wacky way, but
65

65

00:03:33,622  -->  00:03:37,066
that's 1080, trust me, 1920 by 1080.
66

66

00:03:37,066  -->  00:03:40,269
And we're in world space, so
what do we need to do next?
67

67

00:03:40,269  -->  00:03:44,138
Well, what I'm gonna do next, because I'm
happy with the size of my background,
68

68

00:03:44,138  -->  00:03:47,130
my play space, and
I'm happy with the number of squares.
69

69

00:03:47,130  -->  00:03:50,430
I don't need to go and prototype the game
because I've already prototyped it.
70

70

00:03:50,430  -->  00:03:55,257
But we take you through that journey on
our Unity RPG course where we actually go
71

71

00:03:55,257  -->  00:03:58,711
through, prototype things in
the order we would do it.
72

72

00:03:58,711  -->  00:04:01,631
Make the mistakes, changes,
iterate on it, and
73

73

00:04:01,631  -->  00:04:04,490
do that kind of genuine
game developer journey.
74

74

00:04:04,490  -->  00:04:08,530
But for now, I'm gonna say, well, I know
for a fact that nine by five is good.
75

75

00:04:08,530  -->  00:04:13,140
So I've given you some assets against
this lecture called Background Art.
76

76

00:04:13,140  -->  00:04:17,740
So if you wanna download that and unzip
that, open up your background art folder,
77

77

00:04:17,740  -->  00:04:18,860
and there's three things in there.
78

78

00:04:18,860  -->  00:04:25,020
There's a background which has been
created for us by an awesome guy, Chris.
79

79

00:04:25,020  -->  00:04:28,770
Thank you Chris,
over at 2D Game Art for Programmers.
80

80

00:04:28,770  -->  00:04:32,820
So Chris, he gets where you're coming
from, he's got a whole bunch of tutorials
81

81

00:04:32,820  -->  00:04:36,610
and great things that you can go through,
blog stuff that you can read.
82

82

00:04:36,610  -->  00:04:39,590
Just a good guy, he's living in Australia,
83

83

00:04:39,590  -->  00:04:42,640
which means he's a double good guy,
if you know what I mean.
84

84

00:04:42,640  -->  00:04:45,306
And thanks to him, he's tightened
up the background for us and
85

85

00:04:45,306  -->  00:04:47,720
made it look a little bit nicer
than I had previously, and
86

86

00:04:47,720  -->  00:04:49,749
we had in the previous
version of this project.
87

87

00:04:49,749  -->  00:04:52,611
So grab that, drag it into images, also,
88

88

00:04:52,611  -->  00:04:56,198
he's given us a couple of trees,
drag those over in.
89

89

00:04:56,198  -->  00:05:00,218
And if you wanna know more about how
to create your own art elements for
90

90

00:05:00,218  -->  00:05:04,375
your own game, then I've given you
a link to Chris's website as well,
91

91

00:05:04,375  -->  00:05:05,719
you can have a look at.
92

92

00:05:05,719  -->  00:05:08,623
So we've got our background here,
excellente,
93

93

00:05:08,623  -->  00:05:13,068
we need to connect that up to our
background in our scene, in our hierarchy.
94

94

00:05:13,068  -->  00:05:18,268
So I'm gonna click on source image, change
that to bg_glitchGarden, also change
95

95

00:05:18,268  -->  00:05:23,115
the color back to normal, so over to
white, so it's not being changed at all.
96

96

00:05:23,115  -->  00:05:28,405
I'm pretty confident that I can get
rid of my safe zone indicator here,
97

97

00:05:28,405  -->  00:05:32,540
so I'll find my safe zone and
just neutralize that.
98

98

00:05:32,540  -->  00:05:36,560
Okay, you can see it's all lining up
nicely when we've turned it off, but
99

99

00:05:36,560  -->  00:05:39,300
we've still selected it,
you can see the outline of it...
100

100

00:05:39,300  -->  00:05:42,110
That's great, and you can see that
my squares, how are they doing,
101

101

00:05:42,110  -->  00:05:45,324
they're pretty close, I was just playing
around with the position of these.
102

102

00:05:45,324  -->  00:05:51,521
But my squares, if I was to drag them up,
then it would be looking pretty good.
103

103

00:05:51,521  -->  00:05:54,472
If I had one more square down there,
let's just do that for completeness.
104

104

00:05:54,472  -->  00:05:57,070
Okay, that's looking pretty good,
and they're gonna line up.
105

105

00:05:57,070  -->  00:06:00,600
So the way you would do this if you
were working on your own art, or
106

106

00:06:00,600  -->  00:06:03,460
with an asset provider, is you'd make
your game, and you're like, okay,
107

107

00:06:03,460  -->  00:06:04,420
this all looks pretty good.
108

108

00:06:04,420  -->  00:06:06,610
I know this is rough and ready,
just moving around squares.
109

109

00:06:06,610  -->  00:06:09,470
You can do this as your own grid
that you made in Photoshop, or
110

110

00:06:09,470  -->  00:06:13,330
something, you don't have to do
it with little Unity squares.
111

111

00:06:13,330  -->  00:06:15,633
So you make it up and then you say,
yep, this is feeling pretty good.
112

112

00:06:15,633  -->  00:06:19,479
Hey artists, can you please create
something that looks pretty and
113

113

00:06:19,479  -->  00:06:23,391
make sure that you get the grid exactly
as I have the grid when I give you
114

114

00:06:23,391  -->  00:06:24,830
a screenshot for it?
115

115

00:06:24,830  -->  00:06:27,440
Make sure your dimensions
are 1920 by 1080,
116

116

00:06:27,440  -->  00:06:29,534
then your artist knows exactly what to do.
117

117

00:06:29,534  -->  00:06:32,695
So I'm just gonna get rid of my squares,
[SOUND] they're gone.
118

118

00:06:32,695  -->  00:06:35,420
We have our prettier looking background,
thank you Chris.
119

119

00:06:35,420  -->  00:06:38,118
And we have our couple of trees,
which I'll get to in a moment.
120

120

00:06:38,118  -->  00:06:40,930
So now we need to align our
121

121

00:06:42,390  -->  00:06:47,110
UI background with our game and
our game camera, so how do we do that?
122

122

00:06:47,110  -->  00:06:49,382
Well, couple of slides for you here,
123

123

00:06:49,382  -->  00:06:52,793
what I want to do is say one
grass square is one world unit.
124

124

00:06:52,793  -->  00:06:57,009
What I mean by that is, this square here,
if something moves from here to there,
125

125

00:06:57,009  -->  00:06:59,430
that's one unit, and that's another unit.
126

126

00:06:59,430  -->  00:07:03,550
So one, two, three, four,
five units, so to speak.
127

127

00:07:03,550  -->  00:07:08,480
So I know if I'm placing a tower down
just here, that's going to be at 1, 1.
128

128

00:07:08,480  -->  00:07:13,240
If I'm placing a tower here, that's gonna
be at one, two, three, four, five, six,
129

129

00:07:13,240  -->  00:07:17,571
seven, eight, nine, at 9, 1, if I was
going to place something down there.
130

130

00:07:17,571  -->  00:07:19,420
Okay, so how do we do that?
131

131

00:07:19,420  -->  00:07:22,980
One grass unit, one world unit, so
one grass square equals one world unit.
132

132

00:07:22,980  -->  00:07:27,100
Our canvas width is currently 1920 pixels,
if you remember.
133

133

00:07:27,100  -->  00:07:32,030
Click on our canvas,
it is 1920 that we've put in there.
134

134

00:07:32,030  -->  00:07:37,750
We know it is pixels, but Unity currently
is thinking that's 1920 world units.
135

135

00:07:37,750  -->  00:07:40,020
So you can see there's not
anywhere in here that says pixels.
136

136

00:07:40,020  -->  00:07:43,428
It just thinks, I'm 1920 world units, but
137

137

00:07:43,428  -->  00:07:48,523
we need to shrink this whole thing down so
it fits within here, how do we do that?
138

138

00:07:48,523  -->  00:07:51,876
Well, we know our squares are 160 by 160,
remember,
139

139

00:07:51,876  -->  00:07:55,716
we did that in the previous video,
160 by 160 for our squares.
140

140

00:07:55,716  -->  00:08:00,518
And we know the number of
squares therefore is 12,
141

141

00:08:00,518  -->  00:08:03,473
so 1920 divided by 160.
142

142

00:08:03,473  -->  00:08:07,511
So if we have 1920 along here,
and each of these is 160,
143

143

00:08:07,511  -->  00:08:12,329
then from the left side to the right side,
we're gonna have 12 squares.
144

144

00:08:12,329  -->  00:08:16,667
Or, otherwise, we're saying we want
12 world units as our width, okay,
145

145

00:08:16,667  -->  00:08:18,160
does that make sense?
146

146

00:08:18,160  -->  00:08:24,153
So from here, if we start all the way
there, 1, 2, 3, 4, [SOUND] 12,
147

147

00:08:24,153  -->  00:08:29,233
would take us to here,
we'd have 12 units from left to right.
148

148

00:08:29,233  -->  00:08:34,673
So we need to scale or
shrink our canvas by 12,
149

149

00:08:34,673  -->  00:08:39,443
is how many we want it to be, by 1920.
150

150

00:08:39,443  -->  00:08:44,289
And that equals,
we need to multiply our canvas
151

151

00:08:44,289  -->  00:08:49,023
by 0.00625, and that will shrink it.
152

152

00:08:49,023  -->  00:08:51,445
Okay, so
that's the information I've got for you.
153

153

00:08:51,445  -->  00:08:54,389
I was gonna go through this and do the
whole thing, but I think you need a little
154

154

00:08:54,389  -->  00:08:57,440
bit of a challenge to make sure you're
not just sitting there idly watching me.
155

155

00:08:57,440  -->  00:09:00,990
So I'm gonna give you a challenge now,
and that challenge is to scale and move.
156

156

00:09:00,990  -->  00:09:06,505
Scale your canvas so
that one world unit equals one square,
157

157

00:09:06,505  -->  00:09:09,505
a reminder, 0.00625.
158

158

00:09:09,505  -->  00:09:12,211
If you don't want to just use that number,
you can calculate it
159

159

00:09:12,211  -->  00:09:15,237
all yourself to make sure you
understand yourself how it's working.
160

160

00:09:15,237  -->  00:09:17,651
And also resize and align you camera.
161

161

00:09:17,651  -->  00:09:21,992
In previous sections of the course, we've
talked about how big your camera is, and
162

162

00:09:21,992  -->  00:09:23,348
how to know the size of it.
163

163

00:09:23,348  -->  00:09:26,989
So you might need to put back
on your remembering cap and
164

164

00:09:26,989  -->  00:09:29,455
have a think at camera discussions.
165

165

00:09:30,730  -->  00:09:35,458
And to add the trees that I gave you, so
they're in front of the grass background.
166

166

00:09:35,458  -->  00:09:40,003
And so that anything that was gonna
run along the grass will be going
167

167

00:09:40,003  -->  00:09:41,310
behind the trees.
168

168

00:09:41,310  -->  00:09:45,040
So it'll go trees and
then world elements and then background.
169

169

00:09:45,040  -->  00:09:46,790
And there's a bunch of ways to do that.
170

170

00:09:46,790  -->  00:09:49,350
I'm gonna show you a really quick and
simple way to do it.
171

171

00:09:49,350  -->  00:09:51,617
I'm not gonna go very
complex in how we do that.
172

172

00:09:51,617  -->  00:09:53,282
So there's your challenge,
jump in, take that on, and
173

173

00:09:53,282  -->  00:09:54,333
I'll see you back here in a moment.
174

174

00:09:56,590  -->  00:10:03,535
Okay, let's start by doing our scaling,
so if I remember, [SOUND] 0.00625.
175

175

00:10:03,535  -->  00:10:08,501
Okay, so we find our whole canvas,
we've changed to world space.
176

176

00:10:08,501  -->  00:10:14,155
We want it to be 0.00625, gonna copy that,
177

177

00:10:14,155  -->  00:10:19,547
and put that into y as well,
why, just because.
178

178

00:10:19,547  -->  00:10:23,439
And then put it into, [LAUGH] Rick,
and then z, we don't need any scaling.
179

179

00:10:23,439  -->  00:10:26,131
Just gonna leave it at zero cuz it's flat,
it's a 2D image.
180

180

00:10:26,131  -->  00:10:30,320
You can see now, our canvas is way off
over there cuz it thinks it needs to be at
181

181

00:10:30,320  -->  00:10:32,350
position 499 world units.
182

182

00:10:32,350  -->  00:10:35,190
And our camera, if you can see it
on my screen, is way down there.
183

183

00:10:35,190  -->  00:10:40,577
So let's, for now, reset our
position to 0, 0 for our background.
184

184

00:10:40,577  -->  00:10:43,931
You can see now they line up, double click
on the canvas, we zoom all the way in.
185

185

00:10:43,931  -->  00:10:44,821
Excellent, so
186

186

00:10:44,821  -->  00:10:49,137
you can see the middle of our canvas is
now right in the middle of our screen.
187

187

00:10:49,137  -->  00:10:54,000
And our camera is also right in the middle
of our screen at the 0, 0 origin point.
188

188

00:10:54,000  -->  00:10:58,033
Now what I wanna do is have the camera
match nicely to my background.
189

189

00:10:58,033  -->  00:11:03,395
And also, have it that my first point, so
the first point of my actual play space,
190

190

00:11:03,395  -->  00:11:06,842
this is 1, 1 down here,
let's do that one first.
191

191

00:11:06,842  -->  00:11:09,492
So if I click on canvas,
we're gonna just move it for now,
192

192

00:11:09,492  -->  00:11:10,800
just drag it up to the right.
193

193

00:11:10,800  -->  00:11:14,000
You can see where the camera is, that's
showing us where our origin point is,
194

194

00:11:14,000  -->  00:11:15,420
our 0, 0.
195

195

00:11:15,420  -->  00:11:19,625
So our 0, 0 is going to be down to
the left of wherever our 1, 1 is.
196

196

00:11:19,625  -->  00:11:24,390
Cuz remember, if we were go one to the
right and one up, that's going to be 1,
197

197

00:11:24,390  -->  00:11:26,770
1 from our 0, 0 that's down here.
198

198

00:11:26,770  -->  00:11:30,740
And you can see that's pretty
much 5 on the x position and
199

199

00:11:30,740  -->  00:11:34,090
pretty much 3 on the y position.
200

200

00:11:34,090  -->  00:11:38,609
Okay, the way that we can test
this is by throwing into our scene
201

201

00:11:38,609  -->  00:11:41,354
just a sprite that we can move around.
202

202

00:11:41,354  -->  00:11:45,240
So right-click, 2D object, sprite, we
need to give it some sort of imagery, so
203

203

00:11:45,240  -->  00:11:46,690
I'm gonna click on my select.
204

204

00:11:46,690  -->  00:11:48,790
I've just got default things
hanging around my scene.
205

205

00:11:48,790  -->  00:11:50,838
If you don't have these default things,
206

206

00:11:50,838  -->  00:11:54,232
then you might need to just grab
from somewhere on your directory, or
207

207

00:11:54,232  -->  00:11:57,625
on the Internet, or somewhere,
just grab a small image.
208

208

00:11:57,625  -->  00:12:01,020
I'd recommend not using our big old
background images or the trees, but
209

209

00:12:01,020  -->  00:12:02,740
just grab something online.
210

210

00:12:02,740  -->  00:12:06,430
If you've got something that is knob or
UI sprite, you can use those.
211

211

00:12:06,430  -->  00:12:09,480
I'm just gonna click on knob,
which I think is a default built-in
212

212

00:12:09,480  -->  00:12:11,670
thing that comes with Unity,
so you should have it.
213

213

00:12:11,670  -->  00:12:14,470
Don't worry if you don't,
you don't have to do this step,
214

214

00:12:14,470  -->  00:12:16,760
I'm just showing you for
illustrative purposes.
215

215

00:12:16,760  -->  00:12:18,900
Move it to the side,
you can see when I've got it over the top,
216

216

00:12:18,900  -->  00:12:22,760
it goes underneath the background,
we'll get to that in a moment.
217

217

00:12:22,760  -->  00:12:26,087
But for now, actually we'll get
to that right now, shall we?
218

218

00:12:26,087  -->  00:12:31,218
I was saying about having your elements
be on top of the grass background,
219

219

00:12:31,218  -->  00:12:33,051
but in front of the trees.
220

220

00:12:33,051  -->  00:12:38,542
The quickest way to do that is to find
the order in layer and have it greater.
221

221

00:12:38,542  -->  00:12:40,678
So whatever is the smallest
will be at the back, and
222

222

00:12:40,678  -->  00:12:42,423
whatever is highest will be at the front.
223

223

00:12:42,423  -->  00:12:45,457
So if I was to change this and
make it, say, 5, and
224

224

00:12:45,457  -->  00:12:49,054
then when I move it in front of my canvas,
it will be in front,
225

225

00:12:49,054  -->  00:12:53,458
cuz the canvas is sitting at 0, sorry,
the background is sitting at 0.
226

226

00:12:53,458  -->  00:12:57,364
So let's double check on that, click on
background, it is actually the canvas,
227

227

00:12:57,364  -->  00:12:59,550
sorry, my bad, the canvas is sitting at 0.
228

228

00:12:59,550  -->  00:13:01,640
So order in layer,
if I was to make this 10,
229

229

00:13:01,640  -->  00:13:04,886
now it's gonna be back over top of
our little sprite that's in there.
230

230

00:13:04,886  -->  00:13:08,420
So put it back to 0, okay,
okay, back on to my sprite.
231

231

00:13:08,420  -->  00:13:12,290
If I have it right down here at the 0,
0 origin ,then I move it to the 1, 1,
232

232

00:13:12,290  -->  00:13:16,246
I'll just type it in here 1, 1,
we can see it's in the 1,1 spot, great.
233

233

00:13:16,246  -->  00:13:19,874
If I move it to say, 5, 5,
it'll be at the top, okay,
234

234

00:13:19,874  -->  00:13:24,125
that's feeling really good,
it's feeling right in the middle.
235

235

00:13:24,125  -->  00:13:27,225
So we've got ourselves a coordinate
system, which is excellent.
236

236

00:13:27,225  -->  00:13:30,726
The last thing that we need to do is
make sure the camera is matching up, and
237

237

00:13:30,726  -->  00:13:31,975
doing what it needs to do.
238

238

00:13:31,975  -->  00:13:36,238
Let's find our camera, main camera,
I'm gonna call this game camera,
239

239

00:13:36,238  -->  00:13:39,357
game camera, excellent,
now, how do we move this?
240

240

00:13:39,357  -->  00:13:43,094
If you remember, our camera,
you can see it's currently 5.
241

241

00:13:43,094  -->  00:13:47,710
That means it is 5 from the middle of
the camera to the top of the camera, so
242

242

00:13:47,710  -->  00:13:50,698
it's showing us half
the height of the camera.
243

243

00:13:50,698  -->  00:13:54,607
I'm gonna move this loosely into
the middle of where we want it to be.
244

244

00:13:54,607  -->  00:13:57,819
If I was to move it exactly
into the middle, then I'd
245

245

00:13:57,819  -->  00:14:02,500
be saying the same thing I did before
with my background, I'd say 5 and 3.
246

246

00:14:02,500  -->  00:14:06,683
Now that should be right in the middle,
we want to shrink the camera, so
247

247

00:14:06,683  -->  00:14:09,289
to do that,
we need to change the size of it.
248

248

00:14:09,289  -->  00:14:14,286
What is size of our top to bottom,
so I'm gonna grab my calculator.
249

249

00:14:14,286  -->  00:14:19,050
Okay, what do we know here,
well, that's on my other screen.
250

250

00:14:19,050  -->  00:14:23,001
Well, what we know is that our
canvas originally was 1080,
251

251

00:14:23,001  -->  00:14:27,477
or our image background is 1080,
we know these squares are 160.
252

252

00:14:27,477  -->  00:14:32,369
So if we know that, 1080, height,
each square, so I'm gonna divide by 160,
253

253

00:14:32,369  -->  00:14:36,620
since each square's 160,
that means we'll have 6.75 squares.
254

254

00:14:36,620  -->  00:14:41,327
Which is cool, we want these five to be
intact, and there's a little bit less
255

255

00:14:41,327  -->  00:14:46,470
than one on each side, which is great,
that's enough room to have our UI element.
256

256

00:14:46,470  -->  00:14:51,486
So if it's 6.75 squares that would
fit along there, then our camera
257

257

00:14:51,486  -->  00:14:56,762
needs to be half of 6.75, cuz we now know,
one square is one world unit.
258

258

00:14:56,762  -->  00:15:01,191
So we find our camera,
and for main camera,
259

259

00:15:01,191  -->  00:15:05,259
we say, half of 6.75 is going to be,
260

260

00:15:05,259  -->  00:15:09,586
divided by 2, is going to be 3.375.
261

261

00:15:09,586  -->  00:15:12,427
So 3.375, and hey, presto,
262

262

00:15:12,427  -->  00:15:18,407
it fits exactly over the top of our
background, which is super excellent.
263

263

00:15:18,407  -->  00:15:21,898
Okay, now the last thing I was challenging
you to do was to put in a couple of trees,
264

264

00:15:21,898  -->  00:15:23,430
where's my little sprite in here?
265

265

00:15:23,430  -->  00:15:27,200
We'll make sure that it can help
us see whether we're on top of,
266

266

00:15:27,200  -->  00:15:29,760
I'm just gonna scale that up so
you can see it nice and clearly.
267

267

00:15:29,760  -->  00:15:31,610
Apologies if you couldn't see it before.
268

268

00:15:31,610  -->  00:15:34,851
Here it is, here's our little character,
[SOUND] coming to attack us.
269

269

00:15:34,851  -->  00:15:38,272
Now we'll grab our trees, we're gonna
put it within the canvas as well.
270

270

00:15:38,272  -->  00:15:44,223
So I'm gonna grab treeLeft, [SOUND] drag,
and I will put that into the canvas,
271

271

00:15:44,223  -->  00:15:48,020
treeRight, [SOUND] put it
into the canvas as well.
272

272

00:15:48,020  -->  00:15:51,823
Click on treeLeft, move it to around here.
273

273

00:15:51,823  -->  00:15:55,103
Now you can see that you can't see it,
it's behind.
274

274

00:15:55,103  -->  00:15:58,460
My challenge was to have this
over the top of the background.
275

275

00:15:58,460  -->  00:16:04,434
So order in layer, I've made my
characters that are running along 5,
276

276

00:16:04,434  -->  00:16:06,660
so I can make my tree 10.
277

277

00:16:06,660  -->  00:16:09,409
Then when I push it over the top here,
it's over the top of that, and
278

278

00:16:09,409  -->  00:16:10,966
it's over the top of the characters.
279

279

00:16:10,966  -->  00:16:14,530
So I'm gonna scale up a little bit, I can
do that by clicking on the scale tool.
280

280

00:16:14,530  -->  00:16:17,844
Find the scale tool, and
then just going [SOUND] drag it.
281

281

00:16:17,844  -->  00:16:19,135
We don't need to have it perfect,
282

282

00:16:19,135  -->  00:16:21,321
we don't need to exactly know
the coordinates and stuff.
283

283

00:16:21,321  -->  00:16:24,877
Okay, that's way too big and way in the
way, cuz I don't want it going over where
284

284

00:16:24,877  -->  00:16:27,987
I'm gonna be placing my defenders,
it's a bit too intrusive there.
285

285

00:16:27,987  -->  00:16:31,243
Put it back down a little bit,
probably back to exactly where it was,
286

286

00:16:31,243  -->  00:16:32,319
I'm just gonna undo.
287

287

00:16:32,319  -->  00:16:36,059
Maybe I don't need to scale it at all,
one of those things that live and learn.
288

288

00:16:36,059  -->  00:16:38,838
Okay, a little bit off the screen,
there we go, I think that's not too bad.
289

289

00:16:38,838  -->  00:16:45,517
Right tree, place it over there as well,
[SOUND] and change it to order of 10.
290

290

00:16:45,517  -->  00:16:48,980
Okay, there we have it, so
maybe down there a little bit,
291

291

00:16:48,980  -->  00:16:51,112
now I've got a little bit of trees.
292

292

00:16:51,112  -->  00:16:53,247
So that when we have our
pretend guy come in,
293

293

00:16:53,247  -->  00:16:55,625
they're gonna come from
underneath the trees.
294

294

00:16:55,625  -->  00:16:59,130
A little bit of depth, which makes
your game feel more interesting.
295

295

00:16:59,130  -->  00:17:01,480
You can have a couple of things in front,
if you wanted.
296

296

00:17:01,480  -->  00:17:04,190
This depth, I think's really neat,
and then off it goes underneath.
297

297

00:17:04,190  -->  00:17:06,752
If we're doing this at
our 4-3 aspect ration,
298

298

00:17:06,752  -->  00:17:10,053
we'll still see a little bit of
trees dangling onto the screen.
299

299

00:17:10,053  -->  00:17:13,760
Might not make full sense if someone's
playing on their iPad and doesn't
300

300

00:17:13,760  -->  00:17:17,911
quite know what's going on, so you might
need to give them a little bit more tree.
301

301

00:17:17,911  -->  00:17:20,630
This area's pretty safe,
we can't place things up here.
302

302

00:17:20,630  -->  00:17:23,765
In my game, I'm gonna say,
you can't place in these front two, so
303

303

00:17:23,765  -->  00:17:26,790
you can probably even move the tree,
or if you wanted to scale it,
304

304

00:17:26,790  -->  00:17:29,103
you can scale it and
move it in a little bit closer.
305

305

00:17:29,103  -->  00:17:33,413
But I'll let you finesse with that,
the main thing is that our sprite is going
306

306

00:17:33,413  -->  00:17:37,481
underneath them, and that it looks
okay on our different resolutions.
307

307

00:17:37,481  -->  00:17:41,837
Go to the game 4:3 it works, 3:2, works,
308

308

00:17:41,837  -->  00:17:47,250

309
16:10 it works, and 16:9, okay, fantastic.
309

310

00:17:47,250  -->  00:17:50,698
Last thing I'll point out before I
jump off is, if you wanna get more
310

311

00:17:50,698  -->  00:17:55,011
sophistication, then in terms of the
layering, and I've done it pretty crudely.
311

312

00:17:55,011  -->  00:17:58,559
It's all just on the default layer and
within the default layer,
312

313

00:17:58,559  -->  00:18:01,745
we have got our levels, so
I've got order in the layer.
313

314

00:18:01,745  -->  00:18:03,485
You could go and
create a new sorting layer,
314

315

00:18:03,485  -->  00:18:06,405
you could call one trees,
you could call another one background,
315

316

00:18:06,405  -->  00:18:09,545
you could call another one gameplay
elements, if you wanted to.
316

317

00:18:09,545  -->  00:18:11,676
If you have a lot of stuff,
that's a good way to do it.
317

318

00:18:11,676  -->  00:18:15,096
If you just have a few different layers,
then I think this is fine,
318

319

00:18:15,096  -->  00:18:17,000
putting the order in layer.
319

320

00:18:17,000  -->  00:18:20,513
Okay, well done, great work, we've got
a game that's starting to look like it's
320

321

00:18:20,513  -->  00:18:22,256
ready to have a game take place inside it.
321

322

00:18:22,256  -->  00:18:25,801
Weve messed around with our units,
lots of talking about aspect ratios and
322

323

00:18:25,801  -->  00:18:27,610
camera positioning and world units.
323

324

00:18:27,610  -->  00:18:31,005
So thanks for bearing with me on that,
sometimes the setup is a little bit dry.
324

325

00:18:31,005  -->  00:18:34,316
But we're ready to get into the next
part of making our game, so
325

326

00:18:34,316  -->  00:18:35,700
see you in the next video.
