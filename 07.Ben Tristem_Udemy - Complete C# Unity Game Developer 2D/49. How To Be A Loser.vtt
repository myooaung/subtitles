[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04.049  -->  00:00:07.589
Hi again, we need a way to lose, so
when our attacker reaches the end,
3

3

00:00:07.589  -->  00:00:09.870
pup, we wanna trigger
our game over screen.
4

4

00:00:09.870  -->  00:00:13.127
Also, to give us a mechanism
to have not just one life, but
5

5

00:00:13.127  -->  00:00:17.265
to have many lives in our game, so
all right let's jump in and set that up.
6

6

00:00:17.265  -->  00:00:19.709
Let's start by having
a look at our prefabs, and
7

7

00:00:19.709  -->  00:00:23.177
make sure that we have everything
prefabbed that we need prefabbed.
8

8

00:00:23.177  -->  00:00:27.996
So I'm gonna open up my core games
folder and just drag in core game area,
9

9

00:00:27.996  -->  00:00:30.130
which was our hit boxy thing.
10

10

00:00:30.130  -->  00:00:32.980
That allows us to click down,
drag in buttons as well,
11

11

00:00:32.980  -->  00:00:35.280
now that that's feeling pretty good,
that might change.
12

12

00:00:35.280  -->  00:00:38.634
Some levels we might have more buttons or
less buttons, so for
13

13

00:00:38.634  -->  00:00:41.998
now I'll put all the buttons in there,
I think that's okay.
14

14

00:00:41.998  -->  00:00:44.093
Spawners, we've talked about that,
15

15

00:00:44.093  -->  00:00:47.920
we aren't going to prefab our
high level cuz I'm using 2018.2.
16

16

00:00:47.920  -->  00:00:51.370
This is the last version on Unity
where we don't have nested prefabs.
17

17

00:00:51.370  -->  00:00:56.135
If you're using a later version, then you
could prefab the Spawners as a grouping,
18

18

00:00:56.135  -->  00:01:00.228
as a collective then also prefab
the individual Spawners, but for now,
19

19

00:01:00.228  -->  00:01:03.132
I'm just keeping the Spawner
level as the prefab.
20

20

00:01:03.132  -->  00:01:07.650
Okay, I think everything else should
be prefabbed and up-to-date, great.
21

21

00:01:07.650  -->  00:01:08.660
Now, what do we need to do?
22

22

00:01:08.660  -->  00:01:10.852
Well, we need to lose,
we need a lose condition.
23

23

00:01:10.852  -->  00:01:15.436
We need to give ourselves an area
where the attackers can go into, and
24

24

00:01:15.436  -->  00:01:18.596
give us some sort of hurt our base,
so to speak,
25

25

00:01:18.596  -->  00:01:23.000
cuz this is our base down this way,
our hypothetical base.
26

26

00:01:23.000  -->  00:01:27.986
And we need a way to display if we
want to have health on the screen, or
27

27

00:01:27.986  -->  00:01:32.729
base points, or hit points,
we need to have that on the screen.
28

28

00:01:32.729  -->  00:01:36.325
You could have it that when one
enemy gets the end, game over, bump,
29

29

00:01:36.325  -->  00:01:37.890
that's the easy way to do it.
30

30

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:40.180
So, throughout this video if
you wanna take the easy way,
31

31

00:01:40.180  -->  00:01:43.000
no problem cuz I'm gonna give
this to you as a challenge.
32

32

00:01:43.000  -->  00:01:46.450
You can do that or, you can do it
a little bit more sophisticated way,
33

33

00:01:46.450  -->  00:01:48.970
were you got three or
five or ten points and
34

34

00:01:48.970  -->  00:01:52.400
then when attackers come in if the reach
the end, then it decreases a point.
35

35

00:01:52.400  -->  00:01:55.710
So that's why I'm gonna do it in this
video, and I'm gonna start off by giving
36

36

00:01:55.710  -->  00:01:58.620
you a challenge, this is a good meaty,
chunky, challenge.
37

37

00:01:58.620  -->  00:02:01.710
So if you've been finding
the content easy so far, or
38

38

00:02:01.710  -->  00:02:04.490
if you think you've been
paying really good attention.
39

39

00:02:04.490  -->  00:02:07.300
This is going to build upon stuff that
we've been doing in this section and
40

40

00:02:07.300  -->  00:02:09.350
in previous sections so.
41

41

00:02:09.350  -->  00:02:13.372
We need to display our health
points on screen for the player, so
42

42

00:02:13.372  -->  00:02:15.918
remember to use your two string method.
43

43

00:02:15.918  -->  00:02:20.064
We need to set up so
when an attacker reaches our base into
44

44

00:02:20.064  -->  00:02:25.105
the collider they inflict damage so
we need an on trigger enter 2D.
45

45

00:02:26.310  -->  00:02:30.710
We need to have a mechanism so that we're
capturing our health, or our hit points,
46

46

00:02:30.710  -->  00:02:33.130
or our base points,
whatever you wanna call it,
47

47

00:02:33.130  -->  00:02:37.560
and when it's 0, that we load
the You Lose screen so that comes up.
48

48

00:02:37.560  -->  00:02:40.858
For extra bonus points, I'm not gonna
do this, but for extra bonus points,
49

49

00:02:40.858  -->  00:02:43.512
you could put a little bit of
a delay in so it's not immediate.
50

50

00:02:43.512  -->  00:02:46.915
But you get a little bit of time to
play your wah-wah sound effects, but
51

51

00:02:46.915  -->  00:02:49.210
I won't do that in this video just yet.
52

52

00:02:49.210  -->  00:02:53.320
And here's a hint, and this is what
I'll be going through with you just now,
53

53

00:02:53.320  -->  00:02:57.880
the hint is to use our
StarDisplay as inspiration.
54

54

00:02:57.880  -->  00:03:00.242
And if you do wanna take this on as
a challenge but you'd like a hint,
55

55

00:03:00.242  -->  00:03:01.619
let me just show you what I mean by that.
56

56

00:03:01.619  -->  00:03:04.393
If you're ready, jump in and
take on this challenge now, otherwise,
57

57

00:03:04.393  -->  00:03:05.470
let me show you what I mean.
58

58

00:03:05.470  -->  00:03:08.790
When we open up StarDisplay, we can see
that we need to have this notion of
59

59

00:03:08.790  -->  00:03:12.180
Stars or, in our new script
I'll have a notion of health or
60

60

00:03:12.180  -->  00:03:14.370
hit points,
not sure what I'll call it yet.
61

61

00:03:14.370  -->  00:03:17.891
We need to be able to display the text,
we need a mechanism for
62

62

00:03:17.891  -->  00:03:21.499
saying something along this wind,
something bumps into us.
63

63

00:03:21.499  -->  00:03:25.615
A public method that something can
call that says decrease our health or
64

64

00:03:25.615  -->  00:03:29.327
our point by a certain amount,
for me I'm just gonna make it 1.
65

65

00:03:29.327  -->  00:03:31.850
So that's kinda the general framework and
66

66

00:03:31.850  -->  00:03:34.659
then we need some sort
of collision mechanism.
67

67

00:03:34.659  -->  00:03:38.920
So, this should give you most of what
you need in terms of inspiration.
68

68

00:03:38.920  -->  00:03:41.765
So there's the challenge,
jump in and take that on now.
69

69

00:03:44.204  -->  00:03:48.740
Okay, back over into Unity,
I'm gonna create myself a new script.
70

70

00:03:48.740  -->  00:03:52.610
And we'll call this Create C# Script,
71

71

00:03:52.610  -->  00:03:56.530
we'll call this my health, or
my score, what should we call it?
72

72

00:03:56.530  -->  00:04:01.324
We'll call it points maybe,
lives- we'll call it lives, okay,
73

73

00:04:01.324  -->  00:04:03.354
that's a good one, lives.
74

74

00:04:03.354  -->  00:04:07.857
I just made that up on the spot, open up
lives, well done Rick you made up a name,
75

75

00:04:07.857  -->  00:04:11.519
[LAUGH] three cheers for Rick for
being able to make up a name live.
76

76

00:04:11.519  -->  00:04:14.977
And then we had to double click on it,
okay, so what do we need from StarDisplay?
77

77

00:04:14.977  -->  00:04:17.819
We're using star yes,
using update no, okay good to know,
78

78

00:04:17.819  -->  00:04:19.920
we need a couple of
variables from the star.
79

79

00:04:19.920  -->  00:04:21.580
This is how a lot of programming's done,
80

80

00:04:21.580  -->  00:04:23.730
you're like I've already
figured out this problem.
81

81

00:04:23.730  -->  00:04:26.694
Let me go and see what I figured out and
then take inspiration from that, and
82

82

00:04:26.694  -->  00:04:30.038
eventually there's little things you've
figured out that you don't need to go and
83

83

00:04:30.038  -->  00:04:32.130
have a look at cuz you just
know it from that point on.
84

84

00:04:32.130  -->  00:04:34.969
So let us create a serialized
field at the top here.
85

85

00:04:38.629  -->  00:04:42.910
Okay, serialized field,
and this will be what?
86

86

00:04:42.910  -->  00:04:45.990
We'll jump back to StarDisplay to have
a look, this is gonna be integer.
87

87

00:04:45.990  -->  00:04:48.589
Yes we only need whole numbers integer and
88

88

00:04:48.589  -->  00:04:51.640
we'll call this lives with
a little l not a big l.
89

89

00:04:51.640  -->  00:04:56.009
Lives =, and we'll start this off
at we'll give ourselves five lives.
90

90

00:04:58.689  -->  00:05:00.690
Great, now what do we see in StarDisplay?
91

91

00:05:00.690  -->  00:05:03.891
Well, we see that we need to
connect to our text, okay?
92

92

00:05:03.891  -->  00:05:09.901
So we'll create Text, and that's gonna
give us an issue because we haven't
93

93

00:05:09.901  -->  00:05:16.387
told that we're using the namespace,
so using UnityEngine, UnityEngine.UI.
94

94

00:05:16.387  -->  00:05:19.356
Okay, so text now text is happy,
what will we call this?
95

95

00:05:19.356  -->  00:05:24.849
Well we'll call it livesText, and
then semicolon is that what we did here?
96

96

00:05:24.849  -->  00:05:28.818
Yep, startText;, livesText;, startText;,
see how easy this is, see how easy it is
97

97

00:05:28.818  -->  00:05:32.100
to copy your own code after you've
been clever and figured it out, okay.
98

98

00:05:32.100  -->  00:05:35.625
And then we've got our starMethod
where we need to display the text and
99

99

00:05:35.625  -->  00:05:37.849
update display, so let's just copy that.
100

100

00:05:37.849  -->  00:05:42.818
Copy, pop it over into here,
into start, there we go, void Start.
101

101

00:05:42.818  -->  00:05:45.529
Instead of starText it will be livesText,
and
102

102

00:05:45.529  -->  00:05:49.569
again we're getting the component of text,
let me update display.
103

103

00:05:49.569  -->  00:05:52.339
We haven't created updateDisplay,
what is updateDisplay over here?
104

104

00:05:52.339  -->  00:05:58.325
Well, updateDisplay is basically our
integer being converted into a string,
105

105

00:05:58.325  -->  00:06:00.389
so we'll copy this again.
106

106

00:06:00.389  -->  00:06:05.669
Copy, jump back over into lives.cs and
Past our updateDisplay.
107

107

00:06:05.669  -->  00:06:14.004
Instead of starText it's gonna be
livesText.text = lives.toString.
108

108

00:06:14.004  -->  00:06:18.779
Okay, make sure when you're copying you
understand it, don't just copy blindly.
109

109

00:06:18.779  -->  00:06:21.329
But we've been through this
before in our previous code so,
110

110

00:06:21.329  -->  00:06:25.079
we should understand it reasonably well,
particularly when we've got this reminder.
111

111

00:06:25.079  -->  00:06:27.713
I'm gonna save here so
I don't lose anything, okay,
112

112

00:06:27.713  -->  00:06:29.099
now what are we looking for?
113

113

00:06:29.099  -->  00:06:33.189
We're looking for a way to decrease,
so I'm gonna copy this as well.
114

114

00:06:33.189  -->  00:06:34.878
Just going through this
process a different way,
115

115

00:06:34.878  -->  00:06:36.979
cuz this is content we've been
through a couple of times now.
116

116

00:06:36.979  -->  00:06:40.999
So I'm not explaining it in minute detail,
but we need a public method here.
117

117

00:06:40.999  -->  00:06:45.204
Instead of calling SpendStars,
we'll call it TakeLife,
118

118

00:06:45.204  -->  00:06:48.069
TakeLife, very dramatic, isn't it?
119

119

00:06:48.069  -->  00:06:53.491
And, I think I'm just gonna have it as
one, throughout my entire game forever,
120

120

00:06:53.491  -->  00:06:56.939
when one thing reaches the end,
you take one life.
121

121

00:06:56.939  -->  00:06:57.906
But in your game,
122

122

00:06:57.906  -->  00:07:01.849
you might wanna have big enemies take
more points than smaller enemies.
123

123

00:07:01.849  -->  00:07:05.660
In which case you would leave in this
Mechanism of passing in a parameter.
124

124

00:07:05.660  -->  00:07:10.049
I'm gonna take that out for now,
all I wanna know is that a life was taken.
125

125

00:07:10.049  -->  00:07:15.034
And then I don't need this if, because we
don't need to check if we've got enough
126

126

00:07:15.034  -->  00:07:17.140
lives, we know what our lives is.
127

127

00:07:18.720  -->  00:07:24.910
And so, therefore, lives -= what,
what will we put in here?
128

128

00:07:24.910  -->  00:07:29.276
We'll put in 1, now we could get
a little bit more sophisticated,
129

129

00:07:29.276  -->  00:07:32.579
this is a magic number usually 0s and
1s are okay.
130

130

00:07:32.579  -->  00:07:36.675
But because this is a value that we've
decided to give it, I'll actually
131

131

00:07:36.675  -->  00:07:40.919
serialize this so that we can give
ourselves that flexibility if we need it.
132

132

00:07:40.919  -->  00:07:45.980
So we'll say,
what's this damage or impact?
133

133

00:07:45.980  -->  00:07:49.321
Yeah we'll call it damage,
just nice and simple, so
134

134

00:07:49.321  -->  00:07:53.942
lives -= damage up the top we need to
give ourselves a serialized field.
135

135

00:07:53.942  -->  00:07:57.624
Be an integer called damage, and
we'll initialize that at 1, and
136

136

00:07:57.624  -->  00:08:02.090
I'm guessing that I won't change that in
my game, I'm just gonna leave it as 1.
137

137

00:08:03.951  -->  00:08:05.841
And then we update display,
138

138

00:08:05.841  -->  00:08:11.289
we've got an issue down the bottom here
because we didn't finish something off.
139

139

00:08:11.289  -->  00:08:13.127
Let's have a look,
that's okay, that's okay.
140

140

00:08:15.208  -->  00:08:20.808
This one is out of place, so one too many
of my squiggly brackets here curly braces,
141

141

00:08:20.808  -->  00:08:22.649
there we go, save that up.
142

142

00:08:22.649  -->  00:08:27.027
Now we've got our mechanism of
reducing our lives, storing our lives,
143

143

00:08:27.027  -->  00:08:28.690
and displaying our lives.
144

144

00:08:28.690  -->  00:08:36.141
Back over into Unity, let's jump into
our Canvas, Canvas, open you up, Canvas.
145

145

00:08:36.141  -->  00:08:38.539
Find starText,
I'm gonna duplicate starText, so
146

146

00:08:38.539  -->  00:08:42.089
this is more of a duplication approach,
often I do everything from scratch.
147

147

00:08:42.089  -->  00:08:43.890
And you're probably like why
don't we just copy stuff?
148

148

00:08:43.890  -->  00:08:48.499
So this time I'm gonna copy stuff,
call this LivesText,
149

149

00:08:48.499  -->  00:08:51.850
we'll remove the starDisplay script.
150

150

00:08:51.850  -->  00:08:54.689
Right click, Remove Component,
instead we want to add what?
151

151

00:08:54.689  -->  00:09:00.480
We wanna add Lives, and you can see I've
created a bit of an inconsistency here.
152

152

00:09:00.480  -->  00:09:05.510
It should probably be LivesDisplay,
not just starDisplay, to keep consistent.
153

153

00:09:05.510  -->  00:09:08.910
So it's a little bit pedantic,
but I am gonna change that now.
154

154

00:09:08.910  -->  00:09:13.750
So I'm going to change Lives, so
I'm gonna remove that component.
155

155

00:09:13.750  -->  00:09:18.430
I will change this, rename it, right-click
&gt; Rename from Lives to LivesDisplay,
156

156

00:09:18.430  -->  00:09:22.210
just so it's really consistent
with what we've got there already.
157

157

00:09:22.210  -->  00:09:26.030
LivesDisplay, need to open that up,
double-click, open,
158

158

00:09:26.030  -->  00:09:30.369
scroll up to the top, instead of Lives,
it should read LivesDisplay.
159

159

00:09:30.369  -->  00:09:33.089
Okay, so that's just a reminder,
I know you know that already,
160

160

00:09:33.089  -->  00:09:34.927
but just a reminder, how to rename things.
161

161

00:09:34.927  -->  00:09:38.652
I like to delete from where it was so
I don't get any conflict and
162

162

00:09:38.652  -->  00:09:42.095
then rename it on my script and
then also rename the class,
163

163

00:09:42.095  -->  00:09:45.080
cuz this is where defining
what the class is.
164

164

00:09:45.080  -->  00:09:49.404
So back over on the live script,
now we'll add LivesDisplay, excellent.
165

165

00:09:49.404  -->  00:09:53.512
Lives 5, damage 1, okay, that's good,
now that we have our lives text,
166

166

00:09:53.512  -->  00:09:55.933
let's drag it somewhere
else on the screen.
167

167

00:09:55.933  -->  00:10:00.044
I think up in the top left cuz that's
kind of nearish where our base is,
168

168

00:10:00.044  -->  00:10:02.219
that says it's related to the base.
169

169

00:10:02.219  -->  00:10:07.145
Let us click on text, change the color,
I'm gonna change mine to green,
170

170

00:10:07.145  -->  00:10:12.510
there we go, nice green, goodo,
keep it as the same font I think.
171

171

00:10:12.510  -->  00:10:15.262
And I'm just going to start it off at 99,
172

172

00:10:15.262  -->  00:10:19.774
just to see how that fits cuz my health
I don't intend it to be massive,
173

173

00:10:19.774  -->  00:10:23.539
I'll move it a little bit to
the left as well, there we go.
174

174

00:10:23.539  -->  00:10:25.655
Now let's go back to our StarText and
175

175

00:10:25.655  -->  00:10:29.692
we'll get inspiration from here as
well to see what we need to do next.
176

176

00:10:29.692  -->  00:10:35.150
See starDisplay, it's a script on there,
what else is happening in starDisplay?
177

177

00:10:35.150  -->  00:10:39.301
And if we scroll down we see we've created
this mechanism to decrease the amount of
178

178

00:10:39.301  -->  00:10:41.179
stars, okay, so that's all cool.
179

179

00:10:41.179  -->  00:10:45.785
We need to do the same thing to decrease
our number of points, to do that,
180

180

00:10:45.785  -->  00:10:48.960
I'm gonna create myself
a new thingamajiggy.
181

181

00:10:48.960  -->  00:10:53.472
So right-click &gt; Create Empty,
and we'll call this,
182

182

00:10:53.472  -->  00:10:58.179
Lives, no, HitHealth Damage,
Damage Collider, yeah.
183

183

00:10:58.179  -->  00:11:02.443
Damage Collider, so Damage Collider, okay,
184

184

00:11:02.443  -->  00:11:06.929
reset the transform so
I know exactly where it is.
185

185

00:11:06.929  -->  00:11:11.245
I will add a component which
will be a Box Collider 2D, and
186

186

00:11:11.245  -->  00:11:13.459
expand out our Box Collider.
187

187

00:11:13.459  -->  00:11:17.903
Move my entire game object to the left and
up a little bit,
188

188

00:11:17.903  -->  00:11:20.220
when do I want it to impact?
189

189

00:11:20.220  -->  00:11:22.370
Probably after they've gone
a little bit off screen,
190

190

00:11:22.370  -->  00:11:24.680
so the dramatic off screen effect,
191

191

00:11:24.680  -->  00:11:28.940
that if my game is being played on a
screen where the offscreen is just there.
192

192

00:11:28.940  -->  00:11:31.095
There's gonna be a little bit of a delay,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
193

193

00:11:31.095  -->  00:11:31.839
and then boom over there.
194

194

00:11:31.839  -->  00:11:34.981
If it's being played on a display
where the edge is there,
195

195

00:11:34.981  -->  00:11:39.750
then it'll be when they're off the screen,
so move it over to the edge here.
196

196

00:11:39.750  -->  00:11:44.722
That looks pretty good, click on the Edit
collider for our collision, click Off,
197

197

00:11:44.722  -->  00:11:47.219
which is what I often do, Edit collider.
198

198

00:11:47.219  -->  00:11:51.204
Grab the little squary thing, drag up
to the top, drag down to the bottom,
199

199

00:11:51.204  -->  00:11:54.540
drag a little bit to the left just so
it's nice and visible.
200

200

00:11:54.540  -->  00:11:59.249
Great, so we've got our Damage Collider,
do I think that any of my attackers
201

201

00:11:59.249  -->  00:12:03.460
are gonna throw projectiles that
might go into the Damage Collider?
202

202

00:12:03.460  -->  00:12:06.233
No, I don't, so for
now I'm not gonna get there and
203

203

00:12:06.233  -->  00:12:10.245
specify who can bump into it, I'm just
gonna say anything bumped into it.
204

204

00:12:10.245  -->  00:12:13.014
Cuz if it's only the attackers
that are gonna reach here,
205

205

00:12:13.014  -->  00:12:15.569
then we can say only attackers
are gonna bump into it.
206

206

00:12:15.569  -->  00:12:19.829
So no need to worry about that, okay,
now we will add ourselves a script.
207

207

00:12:19.829  -->  00:12:27.112
So right click, Create&gt; C# Script and
we'll call this DamageCollider,
208

208

00:12:27.112  -->  00:12:32.250
damage collision,
DamageCollider we'll call it.
209

209

00:12:35.203  -->  00:12:38.723
Click on the DamageCollider game object,
210

210

00:12:38.723  -->  00:12:42.839
drag over the DamageCollider
script excellent.
211

211

00:12:42.839  -->  00:12:47.210
Let's open up DamageCollider, now,
what do we need to do in here?
212

212

00:12:47.210  -->  00:12:49.320
So if you haven't been following
along with the challenge,
213

213

00:12:49.320  -->  00:12:52.080
here's a good chance for
you to do this part as a challenge,
214

214

00:12:52.080  -->  00:12:56.440
is create yourself the on
trigger enter 2D method.
215

215

00:12:56.440  -->  00:12:58.804
So here's a little challenge for
you now, you should be able to do that.
216

216

00:13:00.544  -->  00:13:05.156
Okay I'm gonna do this now so,
void OnTriggerInter2D, and
217

217

00:13:05.156  -->  00:13:10.653
it's passing in collision collision,
we don't need anything in here,
218

218

00:13:10.653  -->  00:13:13.860
we don't need to know what bumped into it.
219

219

00:13:13.860  -->  00:13:16.888
So we could just leave that, and
say well it's It's asking for something,
220

220

00:13:16.888  -->  00:13:17.799
we get the something.
221

221

00:13:17.799  -->  00:13:19.551
We're just not using the something, but
222

222

00:13:19.551  -->  00:13:23.307
I'll just remove that, just to acknowledge
within our code when we're looking through
223

223

00:13:23.307  -->  00:13:26.540
later on that we're not trying to think
what am I doing with that Collider?
224

224

00:13:26.540  -->  00:13:30.020
We'll just remove it, cuz we don't need to
know anything about who bumped into us.
225

225

00:13:30.020  -->  00:13:34.500
But we're gonna say, now what we
need to do, well we need to search
226

226

00:13:34.500  -->  00:13:39.474
through our seen and look for LivesDisplay
and call our take life method.
227

227

00:13:39.474  -->  00:13:40.374
So how do we look through?
228

228

00:13:40.374  -->  00:13:44.019
We say, FindObjectOfType,
what's the object we're looking for?
229

229

00:13:44.019  -->  00:13:48.247
It's LivesDisplay,
there should only be one so
230

230

00:13:48.247  -->  00:13:54.125
we're not looking for FindObjectOfType,
we're just looking for
231

231

00:13:54.125  -->  00:13:59.200
any old LivesDisplay and
we are calling TakeLife();.
232

232

00:13:59.200  -->  00:14:01.447
Okay, so, if we save that,
233

233

00:14:01.447  -->  00:14:06.044
that should decrease our lives so,
let's click on play.
234

234

00:14:12.142  -->  00:14:15.270
I'm gonna move out into scene view just so
I can see the moment of impact.
235

235

00:14:15.270  -->  00:14:20.023
It's currently on 5, that's good,
and then blink, it goes to 4,
236

236

00:14:20.023  -->  00:14:22.209
fantastic, yay for us, okay.
237

237

00:14:22.209  -->  00:14:25.354
Next step, now that we've done that,
we're taking lives,
238

238

00:14:25.354  -->  00:14:27.780
who is owning how many
lives we currently have?
239

239

00:14:27.780  -->  00:14:30.580
Well, that is the LivesDisplay, and
240

240

00:14:30.580  -->  00:14:35.140
so once we've taken life lives is minus
damage what happens when it gets to 0?
241

241

00:14:35.140  -->  00:14:37.187
We'll we then take life,
242

242

00:14:37.187  -->  00:14:42.129
let's create ourselves a little
if statement here, if what?
243

243

00:14:42.129  -->  00:14:47.420
If lives is not just equal to 0 but what?
244

244

00:14:47.420  -->  00:14:51.880
Less than or equal to 0,
then what do we wanna do?
245

245

00:14:51.880  -->  00:14:57.949
Well, we want to load our game over
screen, so let's clean up my space here.
246

246

00:14:57.949  -->  00:15:01.920
Load our game over screen so
we will look for FindObjectOfType.
247

247

00:15:01.920  -->  00:15:02.999
What's the object we are looking for?
248

248

00:15:02.999  -->  00:15:05.720
Let's go back into our script and
just give ourselves a little bit of
249

249

00:15:05.720  -->  00:15:08.010
inspiration, what would I be looking for
here?
250

250

00:15:08.010  -->  00:15:10.660
Cuz sometimes it's been a while since
we've touched these other scripts,
251

251

00:15:10.660  -->  00:15:14.080
I'm like, a-ha, levelLoad, that looks
like the sort of thing we would do.
252

252

00:15:14.080  -->  00:15:17.800
So let's go open up levelLoad,
what have we got in here so far?
253

253

00:15:17.800  -->  00:15:22.391
We've got just the start,
we've got loadNextScene,
254

254

00:15:22.391  -->  00:15:27.089
we've got Another LoadNextScene,
LoadScene, okay.
255

255

00:15:27.089  -->  00:15:31.240
So we're looking specifically to create a
LoadTheGameOverScreen, and we've done this
256

256

00:15:31.240  -->  00:15:34.799
before, so this is pretty straightforward,
just remove my update in here.
257

257

00:15:36.583  -->  00:15:39.896
Create ourselves a public void Load,
I don't wanna call
258

258

00:15:39.896  -->  00:15:44.120
it Game Over cuz you might say, well,
I wanna continue with this level.
259

259

00:15:44.120  -->  00:15:49.456
So Load, YouLose,
you lose screen we could say.
260

260

00:15:49.456  -->  00:15:54.523
But YouLose and then it's going to
261

261

00:15:54.523  -->  00:15:59.246
be SceneManager.LoadScene.
262

262

00:15:59.246  -->  00:16:03.106
And then, in our parentheses, I am gonna
do it this way cuz I know I'm only ever
263

263

00:16:03.106  -->  00:16:05.112
gonna call it Lose Screen nothing else.
264

264

00:16:05.112  -->  00:16:11.089
Call it Lose Screen like that,
we need to go create that in a moment.
265

265

00:16:11.089  -->  00:16:15.569
Okay, so we've got our lose screen that
we wanna load in there back over into
266

266

00:16:15.569  -->  00:16:17.674
damageCollide at notice, right?
267

267

00:16:17.674  -->  00:16:21.141
We better save that back over into
livesDisplay find object of type,
268

268

00:16:21.141  -->  00:16:22.889
which it's not happy about that.
269

269

00:16:22.889  -->  00:16:26.722
I've left halfway in my process here,
but we wanna be looking for
270

270

00:16:26.722  -->  00:16:30.639
level not looking for
love there's a Freudian slip, LevelLoad.
271

271

00:16:30.639  -->  00:16:37.288
If you pause the video and see,
I was halfway through typing love,
272

272

00:16:37.288  -->  00:16:41.578
poor Rick, LevelLoad.YouLose();.
273

273

00:16:41.578  -->  00:16:45.028
Okay, we'll save that up,
it should be pretty good,
274

274

00:16:45.028  -->  00:16:48.179
I'm gonna change my
livesText down to the lives.
275

275

00:16:48.179  -->  00:16:52.370
So by clicking on lives text, I'm going
to change our number of lives down to 1.
276

276

00:16:52.370  -->  00:16:57.290
And then for my Lizard, I'm gonna
move it all the way over to the left,
277

277

00:16:58.390  -->  00:17:04.100
just so it triggers it very quickly,
and I will select my Damage Collider.
278

278

00:17:04.100  -->  00:17:07.595
Click on Scene, bonk, okay, and
we're getting an error there, which
279

279

00:17:07.595  -->  00:17:11.919
I believe is saying, you haven't created a
lose screen yet, Rick, what are you doing?
280

280

00:17:11.919  -->  00:17:15.593
So let's go and we'll clear our error,
this is looking pretty good so far.
281

281

00:17:15.593  -->  00:17:22.030
And last thing I think we need to do is
go find our Scenes, there's our Scenes.
282

282

00:17:22.030  -->  00:17:25.640
Now, we have our startScreen,
I'm gonna duplicate my startScreen,
283

283

00:17:25.640  -->  00:17:28.430
just make sure I've saved in my Level 1.
284

284

00:17:28.430  -->  00:17:35.585
Change StartScreen to be called
Lose Screen, and then open up LoseScreen.
285

285

00:17:35.585  -->  00:17:40.124
Canvas, okay, and I change my
image just to put a tint on it so
286

286

00:17:40.124  -->  00:17:42.710
I know that it's a different one.
287

287

00:17:42.710  -->  00:17:49.019
Yellow, Yeah,
it was all yellow [LAUGH] well done.
288

288

00:17:49.019  -->  00:17:52.184
Okay, so you might wanna go and
put a different image in there so
289

289

00:17:52.184  -->  00:17:55.129
it's a little bit more interesting,
back to my Level 1.
290

290

00:17:55.129  -->  00:17:56.643
Actually, you know what we need to do?
291

291

00:17:56.643  -->  00:18:01.551
Build a setting, so file,
build settings, and
292

292

00:18:01.551  -->  00:18:06.100
then find my blue spring and
drag that on up and
293

293

00:18:06.100  -->  00:18:09.469
drag my Level 1 in there as well.
294

294

00:18:09.469  -->  00:18:14.343
We don't have a Level 1 in there, crazy,
okay, make sure we order it so that start,
295

295

00:18:14.343  -->  00:18:18.170
and then level one, and
then loseScreen looks pretty good.
296

296

00:18:18.170  -->  00:18:22.980
Close that up, open back up Level 1,
297

297

00:18:22.980  -->  00:18:25.960
click on Canvas so
it zooms in a little bit, click on Play.
298

298

00:18:25.960  -->  00:18:31.939
Let's see what happens here when we have
a creature bump into the end of our game.
299

299

00:18:31.939  -->  00:18:36.791
And then we're getting this last error
which I'm guessing is because we
300

300

00:18:36.791  -->  00:18:40.380
don't have our level loader
anywhere in this scene.
301

301

00:18:40.380  -->  00:18:44.587
So let's see if we can figure that out,
click on LevelLoad,
302

302

00:18:44.587  -->  00:18:47.319
right click find References In Scene.
303

303

00:18:47.319  -->  00:18:50.551
I don't see any references in there,
so let's create a mechanism,
304

304

00:18:50.551  -->  00:18:51.790
where should we put that?
305

305

00:18:51.790  -->  00:18:55.410
Where should we put our level loader
Core Game Area might be a place to do it,
306

306

00:18:55.410  -->  00:18:57.890
Spawners, no, Trophy, Canvas.
307

307

00:18:57.890  -->  00:19:01.720
I don't wanna create too many
more specialized game objects,
308

308

00:19:01.720  -->  00:19:05.559
I'm gonna put it on Core Game Area,
we'll add our Level Load.
309

309

00:19:05.559  -->  00:19:09.490
So I'm pretty sure every of our level
is gonna have this Core Game Area.
310

310

00:19:09.490  -->  00:19:13.167
So let's click Save, click on Play,
see if it's happy now that we've
311

311

00:19:13.167  -->  00:19:16.309
got everything that we need, so
wait until it bumps into it.
312

312

00:19:16.309  -->  00:19:20.782
Boink, and then we load onto the
LoseScreen, and cuz I am not on game view,
313

313

00:19:20.782  -->  00:19:21.990
okay, there we go.
314

314

00:19:21.990  -->  00:19:24.993
Click Start Game, nothing happens cuz
we haven't hooked that up yet, but
315

315

00:19:24.993  -->  00:19:27.529
that's all cool,
we've created most of the functionality.
316

316

00:19:27.529  -->  00:19:31.337
We'll do a little bit of tidying up of our
game flow and our lose and our restart and
317

317

00:19:31.337  -->  00:19:32.737
stuff later on, but for now,
318

318

00:19:32.737  -->  00:19:35.950
I just wanted to get the mechanism
where you can actually lose.
319

319

00:19:35.950  -->  00:19:39.950
To test it out fully, we would be our
numbers back to 5, we'd have the actual
320

320

00:19:39.950  -->  00:19:43.440
spawn attackers come through, rather than
just the one guy I dropped in there.
321

321

00:19:43.440  -->  00:19:46.648
But I'm pretty confident this is all
working as it's expected to do so,
322

322

00:19:46.648  -->  00:19:47.759
great work, well done.
323

323

00:19:47.759  -->  00:19:50.890
We now have a way to lose our game and
I'll see you on the next video.
