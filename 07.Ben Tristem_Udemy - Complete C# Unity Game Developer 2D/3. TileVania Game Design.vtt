2

00:00:04.175  -->  00:00:05.262
Let's talk about game design.
3

3

00:00:05.262  -->  00:00:07.909
In this section,
we're making a 2D platformer.
4

4

00:00:07.909  -->  00:00:10.857
And I'm sure you have played
a ton of 2D platformers and
5

5

00:00:10.857  -->  00:00:12.990
you know exactly how they go down.
6

6

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:16.600
We need a start point, we need
a finish point, we need some ladders,
7

7

00:00:16.600  -->  00:00:19.530
we need some enemies to avoid,
to create some threats,
8

8

00:00:19.530  -->  00:00:22.550
some obstacles to plonk
into that harm the player.
9

9

00:00:22.550  -->  00:00:26.990
And also,
if this is our overall world in our scene,
10

10

00:00:26.990  -->  00:00:29.420
we need to consider where
the camera fits within that.
11

11

00:00:29.420  -->  00:00:31.850
So this would be the camera size.
12

12

00:00:31.850  -->  00:00:35.840
The camera obviously screen size is gonna
be smaller than the overall world, and
13

13

00:00:35.840  -->  00:00:36.780
we've got two options.
14

14

00:00:36.780  -->  00:00:40.792
We can either have it when the player gets
down to here, it snaps the game window to
15

15

00:00:40.792  -->  00:00:45.047
this point, and then down here and snatch
that point, all will have a follow camera.
16

16

00:00:45.047  -->  00:00:48.781
Now, I just wanna point out that tile
based games has been around for ages.
17

17

00:00:48.781  -->  00:00:52.734
For example, Castlevania here, you can
see, here are the blocks that fit within
18

18

00:00:52.734  -->  00:00:55.130
the world, and
this is an example of a tile map.
19

19

00:00:55.130  -->  00:00:57.601
And the tile maps are very small in size,
20

20

00:00:57.601  -->  00:01:01.245
very efficient way of getting
information into your game.
21

21

00:01:01.245  -->  00:01:04.574
Rather than have to create this asset,
and that asset, and
22

22

00:01:04.574  -->  00:01:09.420
that asset, we just get one tile and then
we paint those tiles to create our world.
23

23

00:01:09.420  -->  00:01:13.358
Another example, Mega Man, there's dozens
and dozens, and probably thousands,
24

24

00:01:13.358  -->  00:01:15.927
of these cool old school games
that I could draw upon that
25

25

00:01:15.927  -->  00:01:18.625
you might have known and
played and have fond memories of.
26

26

00:01:18.625  -->  00:01:22.062
But a lot of them are using tiles for
the way that they construct their world.
27

27

00:01:22.062  -->  00:01:25.418
More of a modern example,
still a few years old now, but
28

28

00:01:25.418  -->  00:01:29.095
Spelunky which has done very
well as an indy game using tile.
29

29

00:01:29.095  -->  00:01:33.209
As you can see, each of these elements
here is a tile in the foreground and
30

30

00:01:33.209  -->  00:01:35.846
elements over the top of
it to add some flavor.
31

31

00:01:35.846  -->  00:01:39.893
And a side note as well, this system
of creating tasks can be used for
32

32

00:01:39.893  -->  00:01:44.657
a top-town game, you can make a top-down
road like like the Binding of Isaac.
33

33

00:01:44.657  -->  00:01:49.024
More of a world adventure game like
Hyperlight Drifter, a beautiful,
34

34

00:01:49.024  -->  00:01:50.420
wonderful game here.
35

35

00:01:50.420  -->  00:01:53.780
Or a fast-paced action shooter
like Enter The Gungeon.
36

36

00:01:53.780  -->  00:01:57.750
The mechanism for creating the tiles and
putting behavior on tiles is the same.
37

37

00:01:57.750  -->  00:02:00.375
In our instance,
we're doing a platformer and
38

38

00:02:00.375  -->  00:02:04.256
using Unity's physics system to be
doing jumping and falling, etc.
39

39

00:02:04.256  -->  00:02:07.534
But you totally could do more
of a top-down approach as well,
40

40

00:02:07.534  -->  00:02:10.010
if that is more of what
you're interested in.
41

41

00:02:10.010  -->  00:02:13.250
For the game design for TileVania,
which is what I've called it here,
42

42

00:02:13.250  -->  00:02:17.230
player experience we are looking to create
a pressure situation, under pressure.
43

43

00:02:17.230  -->  00:02:19.530
I'd like to have a countdown timer going.
44

44

00:02:19.530  -->  00:02:21.848
Our Core Mechanic, well, it's run and
jump cuz it's a platformer.
45

45

00:02:21.848  -->  00:02:24.880
And you wanna get from a to b
by navigating platforms and
46

46

00:02:24.880  -->  00:02:27.960
avoiding traps and enemies,
standard platformer stuff.
47

47

00:02:27.960  -->  00:02:29.690
Our game theme is to escape.
48

48

00:02:29.690  -->  00:02:30.800
You're a prisoner!
49

49

00:02:30.800  -->  00:02:31.920
The clock is ticking.
50

50

00:02:31.920  -->  00:02:33.620
You've gotta get the heck out of there.
51

51

00:02:33.620  -->  00:02:36.310
That's the theme that we're going for
in our game.
52

52

00:02:36.310  -->  00:02:40.831
Tech Setup, what we need to consider right
from the start, multiple tilemap layers.
53

53

00:02:40.831  -->  00:02:43.676
One for the background to have all those
visuals, the flavor on the background.
54

54

00:02:43.676  -->  00:02:48.640
And for the foreground to have the
gameplay functionality with the collision,
55

55

00:02:48.640  -->  00:02:52.580
and the platforms, and the enemies,
and the player and so on.
56

56

00:02:52.580  -->  00:02:55.460
We're gonna be implementing
keyboard controls for movement.
57

57

00:02:55.460  -->  00:02:58.647
We need to make a decision on snapping or
follow camera.
58

58

00:02:58.647  -->  00:03:01.582
I also need to think about
from a tech point of view,
59

59

00:03:01.582  -->  00:03:06.090
a high level tech point of view, how we
go about creating an automated painting
60

60

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:10.220
system to give flavor to when
we're painting down our tiles.
61

61

00:03:10.220  -->  00:03:12.720
The MVP Gameplay Features
a minimal viable product.
62

62

00:03:12.720  -->  00:03:15.510
We've gotta be able to run and
jump, we need to have traps and
63

63

00:03:15.510  -->  00:03:17.536
obstacles that kill the player,
a start and
64

64

00:03:17.536  -->  00:03:21.189
end point to say this is where you start
in the level, this is where you finish.
65

65

00:03:21.189  -->  00:03:25.340
And a countdown timer I think would be
cool just to give the game some urgency.
66

66

00:03:25.340  -->  00:03:29.090
And a reason to, why am I trying to
get through this level so quickly?
67

67

00:03:29.090  -->  00:03:32.199
Now the challenge for you to
Find Your Art Assets, if you'd like.
68

68

00:03:32.199  -->  00:03:35.747
Now the caveat here is we'll be providing
some basic assets for the world and
69

69

00:03:35.747  -->  00:03:36.750
the character.
70

70

00:03:36.750  -->  00:03:40.559
So you can follow along no problem
whatsoever using our assets if you don't
71

71

00:03:40.559  -->  00:03:42.688
wanna find your own, or create your own.
72

72

00:03:42.688  -->  00:03:47.289
But if you're up for the challenge, this
is a time to create your artistic muscles
73

73

00:03:47.289  -->  00:03:50.769
by creating some assets or
to find an asset pack that you like.
74

74

00:03:50.769  -->  00:03:56.088
And specifically, you'll need world tiles,
character and enemy to make this work.
75

75

00:03:56.088  -->  00:03:58.600
And I wanna give you some ideas
on where to find these things.
76

76

00:03:58.600  -->  00:04:00.873
I'll also put link in
the resources section.
77

77

00:04:00.873  -->  00:04:03.669
You can jump over to the Kenny's website,
kenny.nl.
78

78

00:04:03.669  -->  00:04:07.372
And there is a ton of great tile
assets in here, all free for
79

79

00:04:07.372  -->  00:04:11.650
you to use however you like,
no attribution or license required.
80

80

00:04:11.650  -->  00:04:15.972
opengameart.org there's lots and
lots of different assets in here as well.
81

81

00:04:15.972  -->  00:04:18.001
Also free, also to use how you like.
82

82

00:04:18.001  -->  00:04:21.405
There's some different licences
that you need to check out.
83

83

00:04:21.405  -->  00:04:23.174
Some people need attribution,
84

84

00:04:23.174  -->  00:04:27.102
in other words saying our assets came
from this person other's do not.
85

85

00:04:27.102  -->  00:04:31.202
Of course you can go to the Unity asset
store we've talked about a bunch and
86

86

00:04:31.202  -->  00:04:34.971
for us we'll be using an asset pack
from the asset store called super
87

87

00:04:34.971  -->  00:04:36.174
platformer assets.
88

88

00:04:36.174  -->  00:04:39.540
that we have spoken with
the assets pack creators and
89

89

00:04:39.540  -->  00:04:44.260
they've have said, yes, that you
can use this as well in your game.
90

90

00:04:44.260  -->  00:04:46.590
But only with a non-commercial license.
91

91

00:04:46.590  -->  00:04:48.952
So that means you're not
allowed to publish your game,
92

92

00:04:48.952  -->  00:04:50.430
unless you buy the assets.
93

93

00:04:50.430  -->  00:04:53.225
And that's something that I'd
consider if you dig the assets.
94

94

00:04:53.225  -->  00:04:55.826
And I'd urge you to
consider buying them and
95

95

00:04:55.826  -->  00:05:01.000
contributing to the asset pack creator as
well who's letting us use these for now.
96

96

00:05:01.000  -->  00:05:03.673
I'll talk about that more when we're
actually implementing the assets.
97

97

00:05:03.673  -->  00:05:06.450
But for now, I wanted to show you that
these are the ones that we'll be using.
98

98

00:05:06.450  -->  00:05:09.754
So you've got the context of what
we will do, if you wanna go out and
99

99

00:05:09.754  -->  00:05:11.352
create your own or get your own.
100

100

00:05:11.352  -->  00:05:15.300
And if you do wanna create your own, then
you might wanna check out our GIMP course.
101

101

00:05:15.300  -->  00:05:21.307
Gimp is a free 2D creation, similar to
Photoshop, but it's the free Photoshop.
102

102

00:05:21.307  -->  00:05:24.630
You might wanna have a look at that when
you're thinking about your challenge here
103

103

00:05:24.630  -->  00:05:28.140
that, well, maybe it's a good time to
learn a little bit of 2D art creation.
104

104

00:05:28.140  -->  00:05:30.990
And GameDev.tv does have a GIMP
course that you might wanna have
105

105

00:05:30.990  -->  00:05:31.925
a look at for that.
106

106

00:05:31.925  -->  00:05:34.630
So,there's your challenge, there's
the context of what we're doing in this
107

107

00:05:34.630  -->  00:05:36.690
section, and
I'll see you in the next video.
