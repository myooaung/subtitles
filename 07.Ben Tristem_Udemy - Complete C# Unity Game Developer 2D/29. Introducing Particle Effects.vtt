00:00:00.050  -->  00:00:05.386
[SOUND] In this video,
we're gonna be using a Particle System
2

2

00:00:05.386  -->  00:00:11.994
to create some stars that are slowly
moving in the background of our games.
3

3

00:00:11.994  -->  00:00:14.940
So let's jump in and
start doing some particles.
4

4

00:00:14.940  -->  00:00:19.430
Let's start this process by adding
a particle system into our hierarchy.
5

5

00:00:19.430  -->  00:00:24.270
So, over in the hierarchy, right click,
scroll down until you find effects, and
6

6

00:00:24.270  -->  00:00:25.890
then particle system.
7

7

00:00:25.890  -->  00:00:27.920
And here we have a standard
particle system,
8

8

00:00:27.920  -->  00:00:32.180
just pumping out some
white fluffy snowdrops.
9

9

00:00:32.180  -->  00:00:33.970
So this is our particle system.
10

10

00:00:33.970  -->  00:00:34.750
What's going on here?
11

11

00:00:34.750  -->  00:00:35.890
What exactly is happening?
12

12

00:00:35.890  -->  00:00:37.600
Well if you're not familiar
with particle systems,
13

13

00:00:37.600  -->  00:00:40.540
let me just give you a quick
little diagram to show.
14

14

00:00:40.540  -->  00:00:42.390
Particle systems have an emitter.
15

15

00:00:42.390  -->  00:00:46.350
We have one emitter and
it emits a whole bunch of particles.
16

16

00:00:46.350  -->  00:00:49.330
And we have full control over the
particle, well when I say full control,
17

17

00:00:49.330  -->  00:00:51.810
we have lots of control
over the particles.
18

18

00:00:51.810  -->  00:00:56.860
How fast they go, how many there are,
how they move, what shape they're in,
19

19

00:00:56.860  -->  00:00:59.740
what color they are, lots and
lots of control over that.
20

20

00:00:59.740  -->  00:01:02.590
And with our particle systems,
we can make tons of great stuff.
21

21

00:01:02.590  -->  00:01:07.020
So a particle system itself is
a component that we add to a game object.
22

22

00:01:07.020  -->  00:01:08.410
So that's what a particle system is.
23

23

00:01:08.410  -->  00:01:11.410
It's a component that's
added to a game object.
24

24

00:01:11.410  -->  00:01:13.470
And then we use modules for
25

25

00:01:13.470  -->  00:01:17.570
controlling the behavior of our
particles in our particle system.
26

26

00:01:17.570  -->  00:01:20.740
And so jumping back over here in our
particle system, which I'm gonna,
27

27

00:01:20.740  -->  00:01:22.760
up at the top of the particle
system in the inspector,
28

28

00:01:22.760  -->  00:01:27.160
I'm gonna rename this as star field
because we're creating a star field.
29

29

00:01:27.160  -->  00:01:31.620
And you see on the star field we have
a whole bunch of information and
30

30

00:01:31.620  -->  00:01:33.740
my apologies, I've scaled my screen up.
31

31

00:01:33.740  -->  00:01:38.290
But for some reason, the particle systems
stays a little bit small and doesn't scale
32

32

00:01:38.290  -->  00:01:42.360
up when Unity scales up, so it's probably
a little bit smaller on your screen.
33

33

00:01:42.360  -->  00:01:43.510
So my apologies for that.
34

34

00:01:43.510  -->  00:01:46.620
So at the top where it says Starfield,
this is the main module.
35

35

00:01:46.620  -->  00:01:49.260
This has got, I guess, our main controls.
36

36

00:01:49.260  -->  00:01:51.470
And then, underneath,
we have a whole bunch of other modules.
37

37

00:01:51.470  -->  00:01:54.160
We have the emission module,
the shape module,
38

38

00:01:54.160  -->  00:01:56.663
the velocity over lifetime module and
so on.
39

39

00:01:56.663  -->  00:02:01.864
And now there's hundreds maybe thousands
of tweaks and tunes and fiddles that
40

40

00:02:01.864  -->  00:02:07.087
we can do with our particle system which
to be honest, is a designer's dream.
41

41

00:02:07.087  -->  00:02:10.835
There's so much we can do in here, but I'm
not not gonna go in and sort of point out
42

42

00:02:10.835  -->  00:02:14.217
this is what this does, this is what
this does, that's what that does.
43

43

00:02:14.217  -->  00:02:17.160
We're gonna learn by doing,
we're just gonna jump in and create, and
44

44

00:02:17.160  -->  00:02:19.417
a lot of the time you'll
find yourselves saying, hm,
45

45

00:02:19.417  -->  00:02:22.508
I need to make it a little bit this and
you scroll around and then you'll find
46

46

00:02:22.508  -->  00:02:25.378
the thing that relates a little bit
of this and a little bit of that.
47

47

00:02:25.378  -->  00:02:28.158
And you're scrolling up and down,
so I just want you to be really
48

48

00:02:28.158  -->  00:02:31.521
comfortable with this system for
working when you're creating particles.
49

49

00:02:31.521  -->  00:02:34.978
There's just a lot of bouncing around,
a lot of fiddling, and
50

50

00:02:34.978  -->  00:02:37.010
a lot of experimentation, so cool.
51

51

00:02:37.010  -->  00:02:38.930
Hopefully that sounds okay.
52

52

00:02:38.930  -->  00:02:44.150
Now we've got our star field, what we need
to do is position it up the top of our
53

53

00:02:44.150  -->  00:02:48.910
game and have the stars flying
downwards on the screen.
54

54

00:02:48.910  -->  00:02:51.860
I'm gonna hit W on my keyboard,
55

55

00:02:51.860  -->  00:02:56.260
move my particle system up to
the top of my game screen.
56

56

00:02:56.260  -->  00:02:59.440
Hit E which allows me to rotate and
then rotate so
57

57

00:02:59.440  -->  00:03:03.310
we are pointing pretty much straight.
58

58

00:03:03.310  -->  00:03:04.890
That's the red one I'm looking for.
59

59

00:03:04.890  -->  00:03:07.600
Straight down, that looks pretty good.
60

60

00:03:07.600  -->  00:03:12.660
Okay, now within our inspector,
I'm gonna look for the shape.
61

61

00:03:12.660  -->  00:03:14.820
You can see we have a shape here,
it's currently ticked.
62

62

00:03:14.820  -->  00:03:17.540
Ticked means it's using it,
not ticked doesn't mean it's using it.
63

63

00:03:17.540  -->  00:03:21.750
To expand them you just click on where
the words are, that opens up our module.
64

64

00:03:21.750  -->  00:03:25.200
We have a cone at the moment, you can
see the shape of our particle system as
65

65

00:03:25.200  -->  00:03:29.670
a cone, that means the particles
are spreading outwards in a cone shape.
66

66

00:03:29.670  -->  00:03:32.910
If I change that from cone to box and
67

67

00:03:32.910  -->  00:03:36.085
the box starts off pretty little, but
it's just pointing them all straight down.
68

68

00:03:36.085  -->  00:03:37.790
They're all coming down
in a straight line.
69

69

00:03:37.790  -->  00:03:42.780
I'm going to underneath scale, drag the x
70

70

00:03:42.780  -->  00:03:47.760
size of my box until it is just
a little bit wider than my game screen.
71

71

00:03:47.760  -->  00:03:49.630
Let's position it so
it's a bit more in the middle.
72

72

00:03:50.730  -->  00:03:53.610
Again, so you can see, it kind of
looks like it's snowing at the moment.
73

73

00:03:53.610  -->  00:03:56.530
Not exactly what we're going for,
but we're getting pretty close,
74

74

00:03:56.530  -->  00:03:57.690
getting in the ballpark.
75

75

00:03:57.690  -->  00:04:03.520
We have our stars that will be flying
down as we are flying up through the sky.
76

76

00:04:03.520  -->  00:04:04.930
Now, what do we need to do next?
77

77

00:04:04.930  -->  00:04:06.960
I'm gonna change the size of my stars.
78

78

00:04:06.960  -->  00:04:09.050
They're way too big and fluffy.
79

79

00:04:09.050  -->  00:04:14.243
And so, under our main module you
can see we have our start size.
80

80

00:04:14.243  -->  00:04:17.459
And there's one value in here,
we can just drop this down to say 0.1,
81

81

00:04:17.459  -->  00:04:19.220
that will make all of our stars 0.1.
82

82

00:04:19.220  -->  00:04:22.330
Now I want some of my stars
to be that small, but
83

83

00:04:22.330  -->  00:04:24.090
I want some of them to be
a little bit bigger as well.
84

84

00:04:24.090  -->  00:04:25.060
I want some variation.
85

85

00:04:25.060  -->  00:04:28.125
And the way we do that,
next to a lot of our fields in our module,
86

86

00:04:28.125  -->  00:04:31.930
you'lll see a little
arrow to the right of it.
87

87

00:04:31.930  -->  00:04:34.890
If you click on that,
then it gives us a few options, Constant,
88

88

00:04:34.890  -->  00:04:37.970
Curve, Random Between Two Constants and
Random Between Two Curves.
89

89

00:04:37.970  -->  00:04:42.355
We do Random Between Two Constants, which
allows us to choose two numbers, in other
90

90

00:04:42.355  -->  00:04:46.587
words, constants, and we say that it will
be randomly sized between those two.
91

91

00:04:46.587  -->  00:04:49.145
So at the moment we have between 1 and
0.1,
92

92

00:04:49.145  -->  00:04:53.352
I like to do it the other way around,
so I'll say between 0.1 and 0.4.
93

93

00:04:53.352  -->  00:04:56.378
I tend to have the smaller value on the
left and the larger value on the right,
94

94

00:04:56.378  -->  00:04:57.335
but it works both ways.
95

95

00:04:57.335  -->  00:05:01.028
You can see here it looks a little
bit more, no, some small, some large,
96

96

00:05:01.028  -->  00:05:02.174
that's pretty good.
97

97

00:05:02.174  -->  00:05:04.955
Now they're all going
at a very uniform rate.
98

98

00:05:04.955  -->  00:05:08.326
I wanna get some variation there as well,
so we look for start speed.
99

99

00:05:08.326  -->  00:05:10.788
Same thing, find the little
selector to the right of it.
100

100

00:05:10.788  -->  00:05:14.282
Random between between two constants, and
101

101

00:05:14.282  -->  00:05:19.674
then our start speed I'm going to
have between say, one and three.
102

102

00:05:19.674  -->  00:05:24.258
Okay, that's feeling better, but
you can see they're blinking out.
103

103

00:05:24.258  -->  00:05:27.956
The stars are getting to the end of
their lifetime and disappearing.
104

104

00:05:27.956  -->  00:05:30.116
That's cuz currently our lifetime is five.
105

105

00:05:30.116  -->  00:05:34.931
That means that each particle,
once it's formed from our emitter will
106

106

00:05:34.931  -->  00:05:38.760
last five seconds and
then it will be destroyed.
107

107

00:05:38.760  -->  00:05:43.515
So I'm gonna increase my star lifetime
to say 20 and that looks much better,
108

108

00:05:43.515  -->  00:05:45.690
that's flying on through the air.
109

109

00:05:45.690  -->  00:05:48.420
Cool, good, they're all going to where I
want them to and it looks like there's
110

110

00:05:48.420  -->  00:05:51.530
a little bit of parallax because
some of them are faster and
111

111

00:05:51.530  -->  00:05:52.230
some of them are slower.
112

112

00:05:52.230  -->  00:05:55.870
I'm gonna slow it down,
just a little bit more two and
113

113

00:05:55.870  -->  00:05:59.980
to say 0.5, okay so
there's my variation at the moment.
114

114

00:05:59.980  -->  00:06:03.250
Now they're a bit too bright I think,
they're a little bit too standing out,
115

115

00:06:03.250  -->  00:06:06.230
they're gonna get in the way, looks like
I could bump into them at the moment.
116

116

00:06:06.230  -->  00:06:10.490
So if we scroll down we find,
I'm just gonna close up shape here.
117

117

00:06:10.490  -->  00:06:12.830
By clicking on it I'm gonna find,
oops sorry,
118

118

00:06:12.830  -->  00:06:15.468
my bad, at the top of your start color.
119

119

00:06:15.468  -->  00:06:18.780
And if we click on the select
a nexus start color,
120

120

00:06:18.780  -->  00:06:21.500
we can say random between two colors and
121

121

00:06:21.500  -->  00:06:24.760
that's gonna allow me to click on the
first color and we could change the color.
122

122

00:06:24.760  -->  00:06:27.280
We can make it red, we can make it green,
make it whatever we want,
123

123

00:06:27.280  -->  00:06:29.380
maybe a little bit yellow,
it's interesting.
124

124

00:06:29.380  -->  00:06:34.300
I have them a little bit of a solar
look to them which is fine, but
125

125

00:06:34.300  -->  00:06:37.435
I'm most interested in
is grabbing the opacity,
126

126

00:06:37.435  -->  00:06:40.244
so the alpha down the bottom
of the color selector.
127

127

00:06:40.244  -->  00:06:46.230
Drag it in to the left and having some
of them alphered out and then sets out
128

128

00:06:46.230  -->  00:06:50.730
first color and the second color I'm also
going to drag down in the alpha so it's
129

129

00:06:50.730  -->  00:06:55.420
alphered out a bit as well, so they're
a lot more faint, more in the backround.
130

130

00:06:55.420  -->  00:06:57.400
A little bit fuzzier,
but that is all fine.
131

131

00:06:57.400  -->  00:07:04.828
Okay so we've got a star field, if we
click on play, We'll notice another issue.
132

132

00:07:04.828  -->  00:07:10.535
You see on my Scene view over here,
the particles are starting to be admitted,
133

133

00:07:10.535  -->  00:07:13.535
but when I look at my Game view,
although my player's disappeared,
134

134

00:07:13.535  -->  00:07:16.365
the stars look like they took a while and
then they're finally arrive.
135

135

00:07:16.365  -->  00:07:17.375
That's not so cool.
136

136

00:07:17.375  -->  00:07:21.035
The way we get around that
is to click on Prewarm.
137

137

00:07:21.035  -->  00:07:25.570
What Prewarm means is that it's
gonna start the particles somewhere
138

138

00:07:25.570  -->  00:07:30.580
within their full lifecyle as opposed to
just at the start where they are emitted.
139

139

00:07:30.580  -->  00:07:35.081
And so if we click on play now,
we can see that the particles are already
140

140

00:07:35.081  -->  00:07:40.044
populated into our world and they're
slowly going along in the background so
141

141

00:07:40.044  -->  00:07:42.740
I'm reasonably happy with that effect.
142

142

00:07:42.740  -->  00:07:45.690
There's tons more we can do,
look at all these things we can tweak and
143

143

00:07:45.690  -->  00:07:48.620
tune and play with, but for
now that's not too bad.
144

144

00:07:48.620  -->  00:07:53.190
But I'd like to do is give you a challenge
and that is to make a second star field.
145

145

00:07:53.190  -->  00:07:56.950
So you create a second faster in other
words these are stars that might be
146

146

00:07:56.950  -->  00:08:01.670
a little bit closer to us,
star field particle system.
147

147

00:08:01.670  -->  00:08:04.880
And then tune your two particles systems
until you think they look pretty rad.
148

148

00:08:04.880  -->  00:08:08.130
So jump in now, take on that challenge,
create your second particle system and
149

149

00:08:08.130  -->  00:08:10.239
do some tuning and
I'll see you back when you're done.
150

150

00:08:12.218  -->  00:08:16.160
Okay so I'm gonna click on star field,
rename that while I'm where to star field
151

151

00:08:16.160  -->  00:08:19.070
five, it's gonna be
the slower further away ones.
152

152

00:08:19.070  -->  00:08:22.672
And than to duplicate so
control d star field far one,
153

153

00:08:22.672  -->  00:08:26.025
we'll call this star field closer or
close.
154

154

00:08:26.025  -->  00:08:27.405
Star field close.
155

155

00:08:27.405  -->  00:08:29.655
And what I'm gonna do in here
is change a couple of things.
156

156

00:08:29.655  -->  00:08:32.105
First of all, I'll change the emission.
157

157

00:08:32.105  -->  00:08:34.855
Now the emission is the,
we've got the rate over time,
158

158

00:08:34.855  -->  00:08:37.495
it's how many particles
are being produced each second.
159

159

00:08:37.495  -->  00:08:40.300
I'm gonna drop this down to, say, four.
160

160

00:08:40.300  -->  00:08:45.100
So there's less of them in this
particular particle system.
161

161

00:08:45.100  -->  00:08:46.260
And then back up the top,
162

162

00:08:46.260  -->  00:08:50.520
I'm gonna increase the start speed from,
say, three to five.
163

163

00:08:50.520  -->  00:08:53.100
So these are the ones
that are zinging along,
164

164

00:08:53.100  -->  00:08:58.280
five might be a little bit too fast,
just down to four and two.
165

165

00:08:58.280  -->  00:08:59.940
Two and four I think, not too bad.
166

166

00:09:01.720  -->  00:09:03.660
Let's have a look at our other star field.
167

167

00:09:03.660  -->  00:09:08.380
Now it's going to be a little bit too
fast so I'm gonna drop this down to 1 and
168

168

00:09:08.380  -->  00:09:09.594
say 0.2.
169

169

00:09:09.594  -->  00:09:14.010
Okay and I think the emission on them, you
can see they're not making the whole way
170

170

00:09:14.010  -->  00:09:17.210
to the end so I'm gonna increase
my start lifetime to 30.
171

171

00:09:17.210  -->  00:09:20.925
Make sure they make it the whole way
to the end, you know what I think?
172

172

00:09:20.925  -->  00:09:24.171
I'm gonna go for a little bit more
dust feeling on these close ones, so
173

173

00:09:24.171  -->  00:09:26.827
they're going really fast but
they feel more like dust.
174

174

00:09:26.827  -->  00:09:31.360
So I'm gonna drop the start
size down to 0.1 and 0.2,
175

175

00:09:31.360  -->  00:09:36.905
the start speed I'll increase 5 and
10, making that go really fast.
176

176

00:09:36.905  -->  00:09:38.578
Let's see how that looks when I do that.
177

177

00:09:38.578  -->  00:09:40.126
They've disappeared for some reason.
178

178

00:09:40.126  -->  00:09:44.705
Click on place so you've got this
little I haven't talked about this,
179

179

00:09:44.705  -->  00:09:47.620
this little dialogue here you can stop,
you can play,
180

180

00:09:47.620  -->  00:09:52.030
you can restart and I think,
yeah that's now looking like bits of dust.
181

181

00:09:52.030  -->  00:09:54.200
You might have trouble
seeing it on the video but
182

182

00:09:54.200  -->  00:09:57.060
I've got a little bits of dust
that are flying through the world.
183

183

00:09:57.060  -->  00:10:02.850
Probably increase the emission to seven,
okay, that's feeling pretty good.
184

184

00:10:02.850  -->  00:10:06.600
Let's click on Play, see how those
two systems are matching up together.
185

185

00:10:06.600  -->  00:10:09.830
We've got our foreground,
got our background, and
186

186

00:10:09.830  -->  00:10:15.320
little bits of dust might
need to be a tiny bit faster.
187

187

00:10:15.320  -->  00:10:18.090
And I think probably the last
thing I'll do is just change that.
188

188

00:10:18.090  -->  00:10:20.810
I think they're going a little bit too
quick now, so from three to seven.
189

189

00:10:20.810  -->  00:10:23.390
So you can see, as I said before,
it's a lot of just fiddling around.
190

190

00:10:23.390  -->  00:10:24.840
Is it a bit too fast, a bit too slow?
191

191

00:10:24.840  -->  00:10:25.810
How does this look?
192

192

00:10:25.810  -->  00:10:27.030
How do I like that?
193

193

00:10:27.030  -->  00:10:29.680
I don't think it's perfect, but
I'm reasonably happy with the effect.
194

194

00:10:29.680  -->  00:10:30.210
So there you go.
195

195

00:10:30.210  -->  00:10:31.970
We've created some particle systems.
196

196

00:10:31.970  -->  00:10:33.260
We've only just scratched the surface.
197

197

00:10:33.260  -->  00:10:36.820
We'll be doing more particles In this
section to give you a little bit more
198

198

00:10:36.820  -->  00:10:39.890
exposure to it, but for now I think
our game is looking pretty cool.
199

199

00:10:39.890  -->  00:10:40.770
I'll see you in the next video.
