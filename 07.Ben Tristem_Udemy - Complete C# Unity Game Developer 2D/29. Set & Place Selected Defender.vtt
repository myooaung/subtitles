2

00:00:03.930  -->  00:00:07.580
Hello, again in this video, we're gonna
be able to click on our defenders and
3

3

00:00:07.580  -->  00:00:10.750
place down different defenders where
we want them to be on the grid.
4

4

00:00:10.750  -->  00:00:12.840
So, let's jump in and get started.
5

5

00:00:12.840  -->  00:00:16.160
Let's start by taking a look at the
scripts that we'll be using in the next
6

6

00:00:16.160  -->  00:00:19.380
few videos, and the scripts we
need to make everything work.
7

7

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:23.650
We need a Defender Spawner, Star Display,
Defender, and Defender Button.
8

8

00:00:23.650  -->  00:00:25.610
The Defender Spawner is
gonna be responsible for
9

9

00:00:25.610  -->  00:00:28.840
storing whoever the defender
is that is being selected.
10

10

00:00:28.840  -->  00:00:30.330
So whoever is being clicked on,
11

11

00:00:30.330  -->  00:00:33.400
we need to find the cost
through the Defender Spawner.
12

12

00:00:33.400  -->  00:00:35.810
Find if we have enough stars.
13

13

00:00:35.810  -->  00:00:38.060
So we need to make sure
that if the bank is empty,
14

14

00:00:38.060  -->  00:00:40.340
we don't let people place down a defender.
15

15

00:00:40.340  -->  00:00:42.630
We need to tell the stars to be spent.
16

16

00:00:42.630  -->  00:00:47.020
So over in our Star Display, we haven't
created yet, but we will create a script
17

17

00:00:47.020  -->  00:00:50.870
that will allow us to have a reference for
what the current resources are.
18

18

00:00:50.870  -->  00:00:54.410
How many money you have in the bank, and
then to answer the question of do you have
19

19

00:00:54.410  -->  00:00:59.300
enough stars to buy a particular
defender and to spend the stars,.
20

20

00:00:59.300  -->  00:01:02.260
So therefore to decrease
the number of resources
21

21

00:01:02.260  -->  00:01:06.810
as well as increasing spend stars and
increase stars.
22

22

00:01:06.810  -->  00:01:09.640
And then we need a Defender script and
that's gonna provide the cost.
23

23

00:01:09.640  -->  00:01:14.140
So a cactus costs this amount and
a trophy costs that amount, for example.
24

24

00:01:14.140  -->  00:01:16.240
And then the Defender Button,
which we've been working on.
25

25

00:01:16.240  -->  00:01:20.340
This is where we're setting the defender
prefab, so when you click the button,
26

26

00:01:20.340  -->  00:01:23.610
it says,
this particular defender is the defender.
27

27

00:01:23.610  -->  00:01:26.130
That's who we're interested
in as their prefab.
28

28

00:01:26.130  -->  00:01:29.550
Next up, what I'm wanna do is create
a script that says, you're a defender.
29

29

00:01:29.550  -->  00:01:34.070
So, right click Create &gt; C# script,
which we will call Defender.
30

30

00:01:34.070  -->  00:01:37.910
We're not going to do a lot in this script
just yet, but I want to have it around.
31

31

00:01:37.910  -->  00:01:41.470
So, double click to open up in
Visual Studio, I wanna have it around so
32

32

00:01:41.470  -->  00:01:45.462
that I can be tagging things
as type Defender as well.
33

33

00:01:45.462  -->  00:01:48.570
That's gonna be very useful, so
we're being specific with the type.
34

34

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:50.850
So, in here,
what you will do is straight out, what?
35

35

00:01:50.850  -->  00:01:55.800
Pretty simple, we're just going to
start by getting rid of our Start and
36

36

00:01:55.800  -->  00:01:57.880
Update methods, don't need those.
37

37

00:01:57.880  -->  00:02:01.214
I'll create a SerializedField,
really simply,
38

38

00:02:01.214  -->  00:02:03.860
integer and we'll call this starCost.
39

39

00:02:03.860  -->  00:02:07.932
Star is the currency that I'm using,
so you could be coins or moolah or
40

40

00:02:07.932  -->  00:02:09.943
schmeckles, whatever you want.
41

41

00:02:09.943  -->  00:02:13.150
StarCost = 100 is how I'll start that off.
42

42

00:02:13.150  -->  00:02:18.070
So that means for each defender we
can say how many stars they cost.
43

43

00:02:18.070  -->  00:02:18.730
We'll go back over,
44

44

00:02:18.730  -->  00:02:23.880
we'll find our trophy and
drag our Defender script onto the trophy.
45

45

00:02:23.880  -->  00:02:26.270
At the parent level, same with the cactus,
46

46

00:02:26.270  -->  00:02:30.300
drag our Defender script on to
the parent level of the cactus, okay.
47

47

00:02:30.300  -->  00:02:33.350
So these are now defenders
through the night for
48

48

00:02:33.350  -->  00:02:36.680
the fact that they have to Defender class
or Defender script sitting on them.
49

49

00:02:36.680  -->  00:02:39.680
Next we're gonna jump into
the Defender Button script and
50

50

00:02:39.680  -->  00:02:41.270
do a little bit of work in here.
51

51

00:02:41.270  -->  00:02:43.750
First thing we need to do is
create a notion of who is
52

52

00:02:43.750  -->  00:02:45.640
the prefab you have selected.
53

53

00:02:45.640  -->  00:02:50.459
At the moment we've got cactus and
trophy, but we need to serializeField and
54

54

00:02:50.459  -->  00:02:54.912
then I'll type Defender and
that will complete because we've gone and
55

55

00:02:54.912  -->  00:02:58.992
created type Defender just now
with our class, with our script,
56

56

00:02:58.992  -->  00:03:02.141
and we will call this
defenderPrefab semicolon.
57

57

00:03:02.141  -->  00:03:06.430
Save that, now let's go into our
buttons and assign that straight away.
58

58

00:03:06.430  -->  00:03:10.980
So find Button &gt; Background &gt; cactus.
59

59

00:03:10.980  -->  00:03:16.403
Now the Cactus has a defender prefab,
let's click on that there and
60

60

00:03:16.403  -->  00:03:22.609
we will assign cactus and then trophy and
we will assign trophy, there we go.
61

61

00:03:22.609  -->  00:03:23.182
Okay, so
62

62

00:03:23.182  -->  00:03:27.862
we've linked the button to the particular
prefab that we have in our folder.
63

63

00:03:27.862  -->  00:03:31.390
Okay, so save that,
that's all looking pretty good, what next?
64

64

00:03:31.390  -->  00:03:35.410
Well, let's jump over to
the DefenderSpawner script, and
65

65

00:03:35.410  -->  00:03:36.250
see what's going on in here.
66

66

00:03:36.250  -->  00:03:38.830
First of all,
we've got this notion of, previously,
67

67

00:03:38.830  -->  00:03:41.950
we didn't have a Defender type, so
we're calling things GameObject.
68

68

00:03:41.950  -->  00:03:43.450
Let's go and change that, so
69

69

00:03:43.450  -->  00:03:46.120
that they're all Defender where
we're referring to defender.
70

70

00:03:46.120  -->  00:03:48.900
So this will be defender defender and
71

71

00:03:48.900  -->  00:03:52.180
also we don't need the serialized
field anymore on the DefenderSpawner
72

72

00:03:52.180  -->  00:03:55.950
because that is being determined by
what is being clicked on on the buttons.
73

73

00:03:55.950  -->  00:03:59.070
So we're not gonna let the designer go and
monkey around that.
74

74

00:03:59.070  -->  00:04:00.960
We'll get rid of the serialized field.
75

75

00:04:00.960  -->  00:04:05.360
It's just now defender defender,
where else is that gonna be relevant?
76

76

00:04:05.360  -->  00:04:07.250
Well, let's see where
defender is being called.
77

77

00:04:07.250  -->  00:04:09.160
And you see we've got the red
squiggly line down here,
78

78

00:04:09.160  -->  00:04:13.080
it's saying I'm not a game object anymore,
I am a defender.
79

79

00:04:13.080  -->  00:04:15.001
So defender instantiate,
80

80

00:04:15.001  -->  00:04:19.768
[SOUND] as defender much more
specific than just saying GameObject.
81

81

00:04:19.768  -->  00:04:21.200
Okay, it looks pretty good and
82

82

00:04:21.200  -->  00:04:24.730
I think we're referring to game
object anywhere else, good.
83

83

00:04:24.730  -->  00:04:29.680
Next we need a way of creating a public
method within the DefenderSpawner,
84

84

00:04:29.680  -->  00:04:33.260
we say this is who should be selected.
85

85

00:04:33.260  -->  00:04:36.310
And then within the DefenderButton,
we could then say hey,
86

86

00:04:36.310  -->  00:04:40.720
I will to select my particular defender
at the thing you should spawn.
87

87

00:04:40.720  -->  00:04:44.300
So start with the public method in,
DefenderSpawner.
88

88

00:04:44.300  -->  00:04:50.791
So I'll say public void
SetSelectedDefender and
89

89

00:04:50.791  -->  00:04:56.054
then we need to pass in of type Defender.
90

90

00:04:56.054  -->  00:05:00.430
And we'll call this defenderToSelect.
91

91

00:05:00.430  -->  00:05:03.750
That's the one that somewhere
else is saying, hey select me and
92

92

00:05:03.750  -->  00:05:05.220
then we have our parentheses.
93

93

00:05:05.220  -->  00:05:09.350
Now what I'd like for you to do in here is
to just finish off as a little challenge.
94

94

00:05:09.350  -->  00:05:15.210
Finish off to assign the passed in
defender as the current defender.
95

95

00:05:15.210  -->  00:05:20.360
So we're pasing in this defenderToSelect,
which will be called in DefenderButton.
96

96

00:05:20.360  -->  00:05:25.040
We'll say, okay, give us the defender and
then we want to assign that to
97

97

00:05:25.040  -->  00:05:29.640
the current defender, so pretty simple
just two words and one equal sign.
98

98

00:05:29.640  -->  00:05:33.324
There's a big hint for you, so
just finish that for me now if you will.
99

99

00:05:33.324  -->  00:05:37.527
Okay, straightforward so
100

100

00:05:37.527  -->  00:05:42.730
defender = defenderToSelect.
101

101

00:05:42.730  -->  00:05:47.660
So, the thing that's getting passed in
is now being assigned to defender and
102

102

00:05:47.660  -->  00:05:48.650
we'll save that.
103

103

00:05:48.650  -->  00:05:51.060
Last step in this process,
back to DefenderButton.
104

104

00:05:51.060  -->  00:05:53.820
We need somewhere in here that we say,
okay,
105

105

00:05:53.820  -->  00:05:57.600
I would now like to tell
everybody who to spawn.
106

106

00:05:57.600  -->  00:05:58.810
Who is the selected defender.
107

107

00:05:58.810  -->  00:06:02.750
So on the OnMouseDown method
right there the very bottom,
108

108

00:06:02.750  -->  00:06:06.590
underneath GetComponentSpriteRenderer
where we're changing the color to white,
109

109

00:06:06.590  -->  00:06:09.720
we're gonna be calling
our SetSelectedDefender.
110

110

00:06:09.720  -->  00:06:14.690
So first of all we need to
FindObjectOfType and the type is what?
111

111

00:06:14.690  -->  00:06:16.400
It is DefenderSpawner.
112

112

00:06:17.890  -->  00:06:23.890
That's where we've created our
public method .SetSelectedDefender.
113

113

00:06:23.890  -->  00:06:27.111
Now, we need to pass something in,
what are we gonna pass in from here?
114

114

00:06:27.111  -->  00:06:29.820
Well, pretty straightforward,
we're gonna pass in the defenderPrefab.
115

115

00:06:29.820  -->  00:06:32.890
So we know who the defenderPrefab is,
if this is on the cactus,
116

116

00:06:32.890  -->  00:06:34.700
the defenderPrefab is the cactus.
117

117

00:06:34.700  -->  00:06:39.650
So defenderPrefab in here, excellent!
118

118

00:06:39.650  -->  00:06:43.020
When that's called that will pass it in,
so we know what to spawn.
119

119

00:06:43.020  -->  00:06:47.060
Now save everything up, if that's all
gone to plan when we click on Play,
120

120

00:06:47.060  -->  00:06:50.550
we should be able to select the cactus
which has been what we've spawning up
121

121

00:06:50.550  -->  00:06:54.420
until now, works, and
the trophy, and it works!
122

122

00:06:54.420  -->  00:06:59.210
Nice and lovely, now one thing you
might have noticed is the trophy
123

123

00:06:59.210  -->  00:07:01.870
looks a little bit weird, a little bit
strange, it's not in the right spot.
124

124

00:07:01.870  -->  00:07:05.450
So let's fix that, first of all,
now click on trophy,
125

125

00:07:05.450  -->  00:07:08.740
my one trophy that I've got in my
world here, have a look at it.
126

126

00:07:08.740  -->  00:07:13.840
Okay, it looks like when we place it,
there's a bit of an offset, so if I have
127

127

00:07:13.840  -->  00:07:19.230
this at exactly four and four, you can
see that it's a little bit too high.
128

128

00:07:19.230  -->  00:07:22.380
So our child object a little bit too high.
129

129

00:07:22.380  -->  00:07:24.300
Now, here's a really interesting thing,
130

130

00:07:24.300  -->  00:07:27.770
really interesting problem that we can
create for ourselves with animation
131

131

00:07:27.770  -->  00:07:32.640
is that when I click on base, I can
move the base up and down, no problem.
132

132

00:07:32.640  -->  00:07:33.860
I can move it right down and
133

133

00:07:33.860  -->  00:07:37.100
say yeah that's exactly where I
want the base of my trophy to be.
134

134

00:07:37.100  -->  00:07:39.290
Now if I click on the top and
135

135

00:07:39.290  -->  00:07:42.080
move it down,
yeah that's exactly where I want it to be.
136

136

00:07:42.080  -->  00:07:43.590
Watch what happens when I click play.
137

137

00:07:47.284  -->  00:07:50.590
The top of the trophy's
gone back up again.
138

138

00:07:50.590  -->  00:07:53.170
So to make that even clearer,
if I was to drag that way, way, way, way,
139

139

00:07:53.170  -->  00:07:55.470
way down here, and
I've clicked on the top.
140

140

00:07:55.470  -->  00:07:58.400
I select the trophy bounce
animation in the animation window.
141

141

00:07:58.400  -->  00:08:03.566
And scroll through that see it immediately
goes blink run up here already,
142

142

00:08:03.566  -->  00:08:08.486
[SOUND] straight away because the rotation
we've got in here is relative
143

143

00:08:08.486  -->  00:08:09.966
to the bases itself.
144

144

00:08:09.966  -->  00:08:13.665
It's not saying go to a particular
coordinates, so you look at the base you
145

145

00:08:13.665  -->  00:08:17.660
can drill into it here so we've got
rotation, rotation is saying rotate.
146

146

00:08:17.660  -->  00:08:19.720
So not saying anything about
where to be on the screen.
147

147

00:08:19.720  -->  00:08:23.606
However, the position that we've got off
the top is saying on the very first frame
148

148

00:08:23.606  -->  00:08:25.765
I want you to be whatever this is, 0.48.
149

149

00:08:25.765  -->  00:08:30.980
And as we scroll through it's saying
I want you now to be at 0.6788.
150

150

00:08:30.980  -->  00:08:32.370
So, what do we do about that?
151

151

00:08:32.370  -->  00:08:37.130
How can we move this once we've
created our positional animation.
152

152

00:08:37.130  -->  00:08:41.350
Well, there's a little technique that took
me forever to find while I was trying to
153

153

00:08:41.350  -->  00:08:42.290
debug this for you.
154

154

00:08:42.290  -->  00:08:47.150
If you click on Curves while
we've got your position selected
155

155

00:08:47.150  -->  00:08:50.050
to the left here,
see how there's this white line?
156

156

00:08:50.050  -->  00:08:54.460
If you drag that, that will allow you to
drag every single one of your key frames
157

157

00:08:54.460  -->  00:08:57.530
up or down on that particular parameter or
that particular axis.
158

158

00:08:57.530  -->  00:09:00.450
So at the moment,
we're exchanging the y position.
159

159

00:09:00.450  -->  00:09:04.770
If I was to click on x,
then it would move it left and right.
160

160

00:09:04.770  -->  00:09:06.590
So super handy to know, so
161

161

00:09:06.590  -->  00:09:09.400
let's find where we want our
animation to be starting.
162

162

00:09:09.400  -->  00:09:12.930
Just there, if we scrub through
it goes up and then down.
163

163

00:09:12.930  -->  00:09:16.160
Okay, it still looks like
it's going a bit too high.
164

164

00:09:16.160  -->  00:09:19.510
Basically, I don't want it overlapping
the top square cuz then we'll get weird
165

165

00:09:19.510  -->  00:09:22.200
overlapping issues that we don't
really wanna deal with at the moment.
166

166

00:09:22.200  -->  00:09:28.530
So let's drag the whole thing down and
a little bit to there, bang, and bang.
167

167

00:09:28.530  -->  00:09:29.950
Yeah, it looks pretty good.
168

168

00:09:29.950  -->  00:09:33.350
Could probably make this whole
star a little bit smaller,
169

169

00:09:33.350  -->  00:09:34.790
so I can do that naturally.
170

170

00:09:34.790  -->  00:09:37.030
I don't have to do that with
animate that with a key frame.
171

171

00:09:37.030  -->  00:09:41.470
I'll just click on my Scale tool,
make it a little bit smaller, and
172

172

00:09:41.470  -->  00:09:45.270
now it will retain that,
yeah, that's cool.
173

173

00:09:45.270  -->  00:09:48.549
Cuz it's changing the position,
that's what's being animated, okay,
174

174

00:09:48.549  -->  00:09:49.830
up to the top there.
175

175

00:09:49.830  -->  00:09:52.580
And maybe I'll, how's that look everyone?
176

176

00:09:52.580  -->  00:09:56.040
Let's see, just have a little look
see at that, make sure it looks okay,
177

177

00:09:56.040  -->  00:09:59.590
we don't want the star now to be,
yeah, and bam.
178

178

00:09:59.590  -->  00:10:02.090
Okay, yeah, I'm pretty happy with that.
179

179

00:10:02.090  -->  00:10:05.200
Okay, so click on Trophy,
apply that to the prefab.
180

180

00:10:05.200  -->  00:10:08.700
As a final tweak I'm gonna
bring it up a tiny bit bigger.
181

181

00:10:08.700  -->  00:10:10.040
Yeah, so
it looks a little bit more natural.
182

182

00:10:10.040  -->  00:10:13.290
I want it to look like it's slamming down,
slam slam.
183

183

00:10:13.290  -->  00:10:15.930
Okay, good, all done,
excellent, okay, great stuff.
184

184

00:10:15.930  -->  00:10:19.260
So we can now place our defenders,
we can choose the defender and place them.
185

185

00:10:19.260  -->  00:10:21.360
Next up we need to start
our resource system so
186

186

00:10:21.360  -->  00:10:24.770
that our defenders cost points, and
that we can start seeing whether
187

187

00:10:24.770  -->  00:10:26.700
you have enough points to place
these things down or not.
188

188

00:10:26.700  -->  00:10:28.550
So great stuff,
I'll see you in the next video.
