[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:03,888  -->  00:00:07,269
In this video, we're gonna create
the two extra states of running and
3

3

00:00:07,269  -->  00:00:09,470
climbing to go along
with our idling state.
4

4

00:00:09,470  -->  00:00:11,890
And I'll introduce you to transitions.
5

5

00:00:11,890  -->  00:00:15,860
We'll make some parameters so that we
can transition from one state to another
6

6

00:00:15,860  -->  00:00:20,420
simply by clicking the checkbox here to
show now my character is climbing, and
7

7

00:00:20,420  -->  00:00:22,290
now my character is running.
8

8

00:00:22,290  -->  00:00:23,750
Let's jump in and get started.
9

9

00:00:23,750  -->  00:00:27,650
Okay, let's navigate our way to
the sprite sheet for the character.
10

10

00:00:27,650  -->  00:00:28,470
We can see it there.
11

11

00:00:28,470  -->  00:00:30,890
We've got a bunch of
sprites to choose from.
12

12

00:00:30,890  -->  00:00:34,538
What we're going to start off
with is running, I think.
13

13

00:00:34,538  -->  00:00:36,066
So we're gonna scroll down and
look for the running.
14

14

00:00:36,066  -->  00:00:39,123
I'm just gonna go and
open up the sprite sheet itself so
15

15

00:00:39,123  -->  00:00:40,856
I can see where that goes from.
16

16

00:00:40,856  -->  00:00:45,250
If I look in there, it's this bottom
one here that's the run animation.
17

17

00:00:45,250  -->  00:00:49,551
So it'd be the very last frame
starting from 19 and going until 28.
18

18

00:00:49,551  -->  00:00:52,478
So that's gonna be our run.
19

19

00:00:52,478  -->  00:00:53,960
Don't worry about doing that.
20

20

00:00:53,960  -->  00:00:56,900
Okay, so let's go find 19 in our
sprite sheet here, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
21

21

00:00:56,900  -->  00:01:01,888
As we did before, we're gonna
highlight everything all the way down
22

22

00:01:01,888  -->  00:01:06,712
to the final one down here,
right-click, Create &gt; Animation.
23

23

00:01:09,423  -->  00:01:13,450
We'll call this Running, wonderful.
24

24

00:01:13,450  -->  00:01:15,570
Now from here, we can, as we did before,
25

25

00:01:15,570  -->  00:01:19,320
drag that into our Animator,
Animator Controller.
26

26

00:01:19,320  -->  00:01:23,170
We have this state of Running that at the
moment consists of our running animation
27

27

00:01:23,170  -->  00:01:24,082
and not much else.
28

28

00:01:24,082  -->  00:01:28,410
While we're here, let's click on
Running and make sure we loop that and
29

29

00:01:28,410  -->  00:01:31,460
drag Running into the Animations folder.
30

30

00:01:31,460  -->  00:01:32,799
So now we have Running and Idle.
31

31

00:01:32,799  -->  00:01:36,750
As a piece of consistency,
I'm gonna rename Idle to Idling.
32

32

00:01:36,750  -->  00:01:38,922
It's not really a word, but
33

33

00:01:38,922  -->  00:01:43,225
I wanna have my states very clearly be the
thing that you are doing at the moment.
34

34

00:01:43,225  -->  00:01:45,320
You're running at the moment,
you're climbing at the moment,
35

35

00:01:45,320  -->  00:01:46,680
you're idling at the moment.
36

36

00:01:46,680  -->  00:01:48,430
So that's super duper clear on that.
37

37

00:01:48,430  -->  00:01:50,910
Okay, now we have our Running state.
38

38

00:01:50,910  -->  00:01:54,130
We need to make a transition
from Idling to Running so
39

39

00:01:54,130  -->  00:01:56,650
that we can say what needs to happen for
40

40

00:01:56,650  -->  00:02:00,240
the player to stop being in an idling
state and start being in a running state.
41

41

00:02:00,240  -->  00:02:04,830
To make a transition, right-click on
the state, click on Make Transition and
42

42

00:02:04,830  -->  00:02:07,530
then you'll have this arrow
that you can point elsewhere.
43

43

00:02:07,530  -->  00:02:10,267
We'll point over the Running and
left-click on there.
44

44

00:02:10,267  -->  00:02:12,800
So now I have a state transition
leading into Running.
45

45

00:02:12,800  -->  00:02:14,700
If you click on the arrow itself or
46

46

00:02:14,700  -->  00:02:18,505
the line itself, let me show you
what's going on with that transition.
47

47

00:02:18,505  -->  00:02:20,255
There's a couple of things
in here to have a look at.
48

48

00:02:20,255  -->  00:02:23,355
First of all,
we've got a little bit of blending that
49

49

00:02:23,355  -->  00:02:25,805
Unity is trying to do from
one state to another.
50

50

00:02:25,805  -->  00:02:28,735
Now that ends up looking a little
bit crumby because we've got nice,
51

51

00:02:28,735  -->  00:02:30,645
clean 2D animation here.
52

52

00:02:30,645  -->  00:02:33,907
We don't need it to blend as
we might do with 3D animation.
53

53

00:02:33,907  -->  00:02:37,551
So I'm going to open up Settings and
54

54

00:02:37,551  -->  00:02:43,760
just turn Exit Time to 0 and
the Fixed Duration to 0 as well.
55

55

00:02:43,760  -->  00:02:45,998
Now there won't be any of that
blending that needs to take place.
56

56

00:02:45,998  -->  00:02:49,160
So we can probably just do
the transition duration if we wanna be
57

57

00:02:49,160  -->  00:02:50,980
a little bit quicker about it.
58

58

00:02:50,980  -->  00:02:52,355
So we've put that to 0.
59

59

00:02:52,355  -->  00:02:54,535
Now we have this movement into Running.
60

60

00:02:54,535  -->  00:02:59,525
We need to say what condition is going to
be met for this trigger to take place.
61

61

00:02:59,525  -->  00:03:01,929
So in our Animator window,
make sure Parameters is clicked.
62

62

00:03:01,929  -->  00:03:06,281
We're gonna click the + icon just here,
and we've got a choice of Float, Int,
63

63

00:03:06,281  -->  00:03:07,433
Bool, and Trigger.
64

64

00:03:07,433  -->  00:03:11,399
For now we're going to set up a Bool,
and this Bool we will call Running.
65

65

00:03:12,820  -->  00:03:15,906
We come back over onto our Conditions.
66

66

00:03:15,906  -->  00:03:19,495
Make sure you have your transition
selected here, click +.
67

67

00:03:19,495  -->  00:03:21,969
And the only condition we've
got at the moment is Running.
68

68

00:03:21,969  -->  00:03:23,761
That's the only one
we've set up over here.
69

69

00:03:23,761  -->  00:03:25,616
And Running is true.
70

70

00:03:25,616  -->  00:03:29,137
So basically, it's saying when
the Bool of Running is true,
71

71

00:03:29,137  -->  00:03:32,350
then we transition into
the state of Running.
72

72

00:03:32,350  -->  00:03:33,470
That's pretty straightforward.
73

73

00:03:33,470  -->  00:03:35,087
If we click on Running, right-click,
74

74

00:03:35,087  -->  00:03:38,800
Make Transition,
we can transition back to Idling.
75

75

00:03:38,800  -->  00:03:39,726
And a micro challenge for you.
76

76

00:03:39,726  -->  00:03:44,390
What's the condition where we will
transition from Running back to Idling?
77

77

00:03:44,390  -->  00:03:50,180
That would be + Running is false,
of course.
78

78

00:03:50,180  -->  00:03:54,650
Same as before,
I'm gonna make the Transition Duration 0
79

79

00:03:54,650  -->  00:03:56,940
just to make sure we don't
have any of that overlap here.
80

80

00:03:56,940  -->  00:04:00,257
I'll put this to 0 as well, okay, just so
it's nice and clear this is gonna happen.
81

81

00:04:00,257  -->  00:04:04,520
I just click straight into that
other state without any blend.
82

82

00:04:04,520  -->  00:04:06,620
Okay, so now we've got that flow going on.
83

83

00:04:06,620  -->  00:04:11,080
This is all hooked up to the player still
cuz the player has the Animator Controller
84

84

00:04:11,080  -->  00:04:14,270
in here called Player, so
it knows this straight away.
85

85

00:04:14,270  -->  00:04:19,530
If we click on Play, you should see
the player sitting there idling.
86

86

00:04:19,530  -->  00:04:22,140
I'll just go back to my Scene view so
I can get in nice and close.
87

87

00:04:22,140  -->  00:04:23,690
The player's sitting there idling.
88

88

00:04:23,690  -->  00:04:27,350
If we click on this, this is to simulate
if we were to call it in code and
89

89

00:04:27,350  -->  00:04:30,360
say, turn the Bool to true.
90

90

00:04:30,360  -->  00:04:32,260
Now the player's running,
run, run, run, run, run.
91

91

00:04:32,260  -->  00:04:34,150
And then if we click on it to simulate,
92

92

00:04:34,150  -->  00:04:38,200
now code's saying turn the Bool to false,
then back to animation again.
93

93

00:04:38,200  -->  00:04:43,020
So we've got this nice flow from
state to state, very excellent.
94

94

00:04:43,020  -->  00:04:47,390
Now the next state we're going to set
up is going to be the climb ladder.
95

95

00:04:47,390  -->  00:04:49,820
That's the other main state
we'll have in our game.
96

96

00:04:49,820  -->  00:04:53,060
Let's just go have a look at our sprite
sheet to see which one that would be.
97

97

00:04:53,060  -->  00:04:56,737
Climb ladder is pretty much
just gonna be these two here.
98

98

00:04:56,737  -->  00:05:00,700
So 14 and 15,
I've got those in my sprites here.
99

99

00:05:00,700  -->  00:05:04,040
So what I want you to do as
a challenge is to implement climb and
100

100

00:05:04,040  -->  00:05:07,880
run animation states,
create the transitions from idle, and
101

101

00:05:07,880  -->  00:05:10,610
create the triggers for
each of the states.
102

102

00:05:10,610  -->  00:05:13,060
So go ahead and do that for
climb and run, and
103

103

00:05:13,060  -->  00:05:15,010
I'll see you back here
when you've got that done.
104

104

00:05:16,770  -->  00:05:19,362
Okay, so it was 14 and 15, I believe.
105

105

00:05:19,362  -->  00:05:20,278
Let's find those.
106

106

00:05:20,278  -->  00:05:25,357
There's 14 and 15 [SOUND] excellent,
looks like a wonderful ladder climbing.
107

107

00:05:25,357  -->  00:05:30,080
Right-click, Create &gt; Animation,
if I can find it, there it is, Animation.
108

108

00:05:30,080  -->  00:05:33,660
This will be Climbing animation.
109

109

00:05:33,660  -->  00:05:37,368
Drag that into our state machine in here.
110

110

00:05:37,368  -->  00:05:41,150
From Idling, right-click,
Make Transition into Climbing.
111

111

00:05:41,150  -->  00:05:44,510
And I'll do the other one straight away,
Make Transition back to Idling.
112

112

00:05:44,510  -->  00:05:47,597
Click on this first one and
just tidy up little of this.
113

113

00:05:47,597  -->  00:05:51,232
You don't have to tidy up the blending,
but as I've mentioned,
114

114

00:05:51,232  -->  00:05:53,700
I like to do this, dot dot dah, wonderful.
115

115

00:05:53,700  -->  00:05:56,890
Click on the + button and create
another Bool, which will be Climbing.
116

116

00:05:58,330  -->  00:06:00,140
Climbing is our parameter.
117

117

00:06:00,140  -->  00:06:01,040
Then over on here,
118

118

00:06:01,040  -->  00:06:06,270
our condition going from Idling to
Climbing should be Climbing is true.
119

119

00:06:06,270  -->  00:06:09,340
And then if we click on
the other direction,
120

120

00:06:09,340  -->  00:06:15,130
the condition of Climbing should be false.
121

121

00:06:15,130  -->  00:06:17,393
And again, just tidy this up.
122

122

00:06:17,393  -->  00:06:21,820
Okay, and you can see in here, we've got
something that's called Has Exit Time.
123

123

00:06:21,820  -->  00:06:23,145
Basically, this is saying,
124

124

00:06:23,145  -->  00:06:25,908
you've got a number of ways of
exiting this animation state.
125

125

00:06:25,908  -->  00:06:29,692
One way is if you want
the animation to play.
126

126

00:06:29,692  -->  00:06:31,830
And then as soon as
the animation finishes playing,
127

127

00:06:31,830  -->  00:06:36,670
go back or transition back to the state.
128

128

00:06:36,670  -->  00:06:37,799
Then you can use Exit Time.
129

129

00:06:37,799  -->  00:06:40,210
So it said there's ten
frames of animation.
130

130

00:06:40,210  -->  00:06:41,276
You do those ten frames.
131

131

00:06:41,276  -->  00:06:42,720
If Has Exit Time is on,
132

132

00:06:42,720  -->  00:06:46,340
after the ten frames,
it can return back to the other state.
133

133

00:06:46,340  -->  00:06:50,300
So I wanna click Has Exit Time off cuz
what we're using here is the condition of
134

134

00:06:50,300  -->  00:06:52,970
the Bool to say when
the transition takes place.
135

135

00:06:52,970  -->  00:06:56,470
Have a look over here,
turn off Has Exit Time there, and
136

136

00:06:56,470  -->  00:07:00,130
same with all these other ones,
just turning off Has Exit Time.
137

137

00:07:00,130  -->  00:07:05,170
We only want that in a situation where we
definitely end after we play a particular
138

138

00:07:05,170  -->  00:07:07,250
single shot animation.
139

139

00:07:07,250  -->  00:07:10,303
Now let's click Play,
see if we've hooked all this up correctly.
140

140

00:07:10,303  -->  00:07:13,600
The character should
be defaulting to Idle.
141

141

00:07:13,600  -->  00:07:15,390
And you can see the Idle
clicking through here.
142

142

00:07:15,390  -->  00:07:16,240
This is the state we're in.
143

143

00:07:16,240  -->  00:07:17,405
It's playing through the frames.
144

144

00:07:17,405  -->  00:07:20,120
We click on Running, yes, it runs.
145

145

00:07:20,120  -->  00:07:22,190
And Climbing, no,
it's not climbing at the moment.
146

146

00:07:22,190  -->  00:07:23,260
What have we done wrong here?
147

147

00:07:23,260  -->  00:07:25,320
Let's have a look at our transitions.
148

148

00:07:25,320  -->  00:07:27,010
We have Running is true.
149

149

00:07:27,010  -->  00:07:30,390
You're probably yelling at the screen,
saying, Rick, you put in Running.
150

150

00:07:30,390  -->  00:07:32,020
You should've put in Climbing.
151

151

00:07:32,020  -->  00:07:33,390
There we go, we've found it.
152

152

00:07:33,390  -->  00:07:34,460
Let's click Play here.
153

153

00:07:35,640  -->  00:07:36,860
Thank you for yelling at the screen,
154

154

00:07:36,860  -->  00:07:40,030
if you did yell at the screen
in that instance, Climbing, yep.
155

155

00:07:40,030  -->  00:07:45,240
And it's stuck, which says that we
are not looping, if I am correct.
156

156

00:07:45,240  -->  00:07:47,650
We haven't clicked on
looping time in there.
157

157

00:07:47,650  -->  00:07:50,220
That stays in play mode,
which is all good.
158

158

00:07:50,220  -->  00:07:55,180
Now that we've got it, our character
can run and our character can climb.
159

159

00:07:55,180  -->  00:07:56,910
So these are all the states
that we need for now.
160

160

00:07:56,910  -->  00:08:00,790
As our game gets more complex, we might
wish to add in rolling or shooting or
161

161

00:08:00,790  -->  00:08:01,570
jumping.
162

162

00:08:01,570  -->  00:08:02,116
But for now,
163

163

00:08:02,116  -->  00:08:05,710
all we need functionality-wise is the
player can run and the player can climb.
164

164

00:08:05,710  -->  00:08:08,158
And after we put all of that
gameplay functionality in,
165

165

00:08:08,158  -->  00:08:11,246
we might revisit our states in here and
our animations and add more in.
166

166

00:08:11,246  -->  00:08:15,667
But we don't want to overinvest in this
until we've got our core gameplay created
167

167

00:08:15,667  -->  00:08:18,500
and we know how it all fits together and
how it looks.
168

168

00:08:18,500  -->  00:08:20,930
So great work in this video, and
I'll see you in the next video.
