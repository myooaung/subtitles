00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:04.723
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Hello again,
2

2

00:00:04.723  -->  00:00:07.897
in this video we are evolving our
attackers so that when they bump into
3

3

00:00:07.897  -->  00:00:11.480
a defender and, here we go,
something, don't shoot, there we go.
4

4

00:00:11.480  -->  00:00:14.520
They start to switch animation
state to attacking and
5

5

00:00:14.520  -->  00:00:15.790
start to attack the defenders.
6

6

00:00:15.790  -->  00:00:17.150
So let's jump in and get started.
7

7

00:00:17.150  -->  00:00:18.700
Right, let's have a look
at what we have got.
8

8

00:00:18.700  -->  00:00:23.120
In our attackers, we have got one attacker
which is the lizard and looking at it now,
9

9

00:00:23.120  -->  00:00:24.872
the collision is in
slightly the wrong spot.
10

10

00:00:24.872  -->  00:00:29.045
So I'm gonna change the collision,
clicking on Edit Collider, just move it up
11

11

00:00:29.045  -->  00:00:32.928
so it's actually over the lizard and
not just hanging out in a weird spot.
12

12

00:00:32.928  -->  00:00:34.912
There we go, apply that back to be PreFab.
13

13

00:00:34.912  -->  00:00:36.380
All right, now I've got one lizard.
14

14

00:00:36.380  -->  00:00:37.370
What else do we need?
15

15

00:00:37.370  -->  00:00:38.470
Who else do we need in our game?
16

16

00:00:38.470  -->  00:00:39.292
Well, let's have a look at that.
17

17

00:00:39.292  -->  00:00:43.897
I am gonna have in my execution of this
game a lizard, a fox, a weird jelly or
18

18

00:00:43.897  -->  00:00:48.209
jello kind of dude, and this guy
who's called Jabba for some reason,
19

19

00:00:48.209  -->  00:00:51.010
I guess because he looks
like Jabba the Hutt.
20

20

00:00:51.010  -->  00:00:52.010
And well done, Rick.
21

21

00:00:52.010  -->  00:00:52.559
Good work.
22

22

00:00:52.559  -->  00:00:56.350
[LAUGH] I'm just like Sherlock Holmes for
figuring that out, aren't I?
23

23

00:00:56.350  -->  00:01:00.180
Okay, so I've got speed, attack,
health, and a special ability.
24

24

00:01:00.180  -->  00:01:03.390
This speed and attack and health,
I'm not gonna go into too much detail.
25

25

00:01:03.390  -->  00:01:06.360
It's kind of regular guy, fast guy.
26

26

00:01:06.360  -->  00:01:08.030
And then this guy's
a little bit different, and
27

27

00:01:08.030  -->  00:01:09.630
that guy's a little bit different as well.
28

28

00:01:09.630  -->  00:01:11.770
In terms of the special,
the lizard doesn't have a special,
29

29

00:01:11.770  -->  00:01:13.550
he just runs up and hits things.
30

30

00:01:13.550  -->  00:01:16.820
The fox is gonna jump
over particular things,
31

31

00:01:16.820  -->  00:01:19.970
specifically the gravestone or the,
is that what we're calling it?
32

32

00:01:19.970  -->  00:01:20.820
Gravestone, yes.
33

33

00:01:20.820  -->  00:01:23.390
That we put into our game
doesn't stop the fox.
34

34

00:01:23.390  -->  00:01:28.430
The Jello guy, gotta make myself
North Americanized, is Ghosting.
35

35

00:01:28.430  -->  00:01:31.210
So he doesn't bump into anything.
36

36

00:01:31.210  -->  00:01:34.480
Just goes walk, walk, walk, walk,
walk, right through everything.
37

37

00:01:34.480  -->  00:01:37.320
And then this big old
guy goes really slowly.
38

38

00:01:37.320  -->  00:01:39.520
Classic kind of tank
dude smashes into stuff.
39

39

00:01:39.520  -->  00:01:40.780
And I'll leave a question mark here.
40

40

00:01:40.780  -->  00:01:43.700
This is gonna be something that at
some point you can go ahead and
41

41

00:01:43.700  -->  00:01:47.320
make a cool special move for
the Java character.
42

42

00:01:47.320  -->  00:01:49.850
Now what do we need to do in what spot?
43

43

00:01:49.850  -->  00:01:52.120
We've gone our three scripts
I'm gonna be referring to.
44

44

00:01:52.120  -->  00:01:55.120
Attacker and then Lizard script or
45

45

00:01:55.120  -->  00:01:58.620
Fox scripts is gonna be specific
to the individual attackers.
46

46

00:01:58.620  -->  00:02:03.080
So each character, each attacker will
have its own script and then health.
47

47

00:02:03.080  -->  00:02:05.890
With an attacker, we want it to move left,
we've done that, set speed,
48

48

00:02:05.890  -->  00:02:09.890
done that, update animation state, we'll
do that, and attack a specific target,
49

49

00:02:09.890  -->  00:02:10.940
we'll do that as well.
50

50

00:02:10.940  -->  00:02:14.510
What I mean by specific is we want
our attackers to only be attacking
51

51

00:02:14.510  -->  00:02:16.700
one defender at once.
52

52

00:02:16.700  -->  00:02:20.658
And then on, say, the lizard script,
or on the Fox script, or
53

53

00:02:20.658  -->  00:02:24.124
on the Java script,
we will listen for the collision.
54

54

00:02:24.124  -->  00:02:26.276
So I'm gonna see when
collision takes place, and
55

55

00:02:26.276  -->  00:02:29.160
then we're gonna be executing
the specific behavior of jump etc.
56

56

00:02:29.160  -->  00:02:32.930
And also saying now it's time to attack.
57

57

00:02:32.930  -->  00:02:35.380
And then on our health script, well,
we're tracking current health and
58

58

00:02:35.380  -->  00:02:37.020
decrease in health.
59

59

00:02:37.020  -->  00:02:40.070
Okay, so, let's start the process
of giving our lizard what it needs.
60

60

00:02:40.070  -->  00:02:43.380
First of all, it needs an attack
animation, so let us go and
61

61

00:02:43.380  -->  00:02:44.500
get ourselves sorted out there.
62

62

00:02:44.500  -->  00:02:49.970
If you look for sprites, for me, it's the
Not In Use and we've got Lizard Attacking.
63

63

00:02:49.970  -->  00:02:52.060
I'm gonna drag that into Lizard.
64

64

00:02:52.060  -->  00:02:56.916
Now there might be something specific
about the lizard attacking Sprite sheet.
65

65

00:02:56.916  -->  00:02:59.590
when you have a look at it,
yep this is happening here.
66

66

00:02:59.590  -->  00:03:05.980
You can see 2048x607, and when we do our
calculations, there is I believe 15x6,
67

67

00:03:05.980  -->  00:03:09.220
it ends up with a weird something,
something point, something or rather.
68

68

00:03:09.220  -->  00:03:10.540
It doesn't quite make sense.
69

69

00:03:10.540  -->  00:03:14.280
What's happening here, is our original,
Sprite is bigger than that.
70

70

00:03:14.280  -->  00:03:17.303
Let me see if I right-click,
Show In Explorer,
71

71

00:03:17.303  -->  00:03:20.124
we'll see what the original
file is in here.
72

72

00:03:20.124  -->  00:03:24.994
I'm gonna right-click,
Show Properties, Properties,
73

73

00:03:24.994  -->  00:03:29.583
and we can see it is under Details,
3765x1116.
74

74

00:03:29.583  -->  00:03:34.328
So it's a much bigger image, but when
we look in Unity, it thinks it is 2048.
75

75

00:03:34.328  -->  00:03:37.937
And the reason that's happening
is our maximum size for
76

76

00:03:37.937  -->  00:03:40.640
our default has been capped at 2048.
77

77

00:03:40.640  -->  00:03:44.032
So if you click on default, you might
be clicked on one of the other buttons,
78

78

00:03:44.032  -->  00:03:46.320
this one that looks like the override for
PC, etc.
79

79

00:03:46.320  -->  00:03:51.025
If you click on Default and
change the maximum size to 4096,
80

80

00:03:51.025  -->  00:03:55.645
That means that it will allow that
size of image in our game, and
81

81

00:03:55.645  -->  00:04:01.069
it won't try to compress it when we
import our asset into our Unity build.
82

82

00:04:01.069  -->  00:04:02.720
So if I click, whoops,
[LAUGH] I clicked Revert.
83

83

00:04:02.720  -->  00:04:06.515
If I click the right size and
Apply, by default,
84

84

00:04:06.515  -->  00:04:11.060
then when we have a look at it,
it's 3765x1116.
85

85

00:04:11.060  -->  00:04:14.720
Now we can go ahead and
click on our Sprite editor,
86

86

00:04:14.720  -->  00:04:17.350
and you see all this stuff in here.
87

87

00:04:17.350  -->  00:04:21.580
I know, from doing my calculation already,
that when I do my cell size, it's going to
88

88

00:04:21.580  -->  00:04:28.400
be similar to previously, with the Lizard,
251x186, and then slice that up.
89

89

00:04:28.400  -->  00:04:31.762
Check on that,
looks like we've got it correct, good.
90

90

00:04:31.762  -->  00:04:33.473
And then click Apply.
91

91

00:04:33.473  -->  00:04:35.990
All right,
now we've sliced up our Sprite sheet.
92

92

00:04:35.990  -->  00:04:40.070
You might say, well, do we wanna not
have such big Sprite sheets in our game?
93

93

00:04:40.070  -->  00:04:42.150
Yes, if you're making
a mobile game in particular,
94

94

00:04:42.150  -->  00:04:43.760
you might wanna try to limit the size.
95

95

00:04:43.760  -->  00:04:49.130
We don't really need what's that,
15x6 animations of the guy eating.
96

96

00:04:49.130  -->  00:04:52.060
It's way too many animations,
but we're kind of constrained by
97

97

00:04:52.060  -->  00:04:56.170
the assets that we've got from this
asset pack, so we'll deal with it.
98

98

00:04:56.170  -->  00:04:59.810
But what's going on here is
Unity when you build your game,
99

99

00:04:59.810  -->  00:05:05.860
when you export it as a PC build, or
as a web build, or as a Android build.
100

100

00:05:05.860  -->  00:05:11.330
Then it will apply compression so that
raw file that I was looking at before,
101

101

00:05:11.330  -->  00:05:17.400
where is it, this raw file here won't end
up being, I think this was 16 megabytes.
102

102

00:05:17.400  -->  00:05:19.240
Pull this up, yeah, 16 megabytes.
103

103

00:05:19.240  -->  00:05:22.320
It'll be smaller in
whatever the game package
104

104

00:05:22.320  -->  00:05:25.710
is that's exported because Unity
is doing its own compression.
105

105

00:05:25.710  -->  00:05:27.470
Okay, now what do we need to do.
106

106

00:05:27.470  -->  00:05:29.590
Well we need to have a new animation.
107

107

00:05:29.590  -->  00:05:31.290
So let's click on our Lizard.
108

108

00:05:31.290  -->  00:05:33.160
Go to Animation.
109

109

00:05:33.160  -->  00:05:36.520
And where it says Lizard Jump,
Create New Click.
110

110

00:05:36.520  -->  00:05:42.040
Save this in Assets Animations, Attackers.
111

111

00:05:42.040  -->  00:05:47.800
This will be Lizard Attack
when the lizards attack, okay.
112

112

00:05:47.800  -->  00:05:49.290
Now, what do we wanna have in here?
113

113

00:05:49.290  -->  00:05:51.680
Well we need to click on our lizard?
114

114

00:05:51.680  -->  00:05:53.096
Yes, Add Property.
115

115

00:05:53.096  -->  00:05:54.172
Find the Body.
116

116

00:05:54.172  -->  00:05:55.470
Done this a few times now.
117

117

00:05:55.470  -->  00:05:58.290
Sprite Renderer,
all the way down to Sprite, click on plus.
118

118

00:05:58.290  -->  00:05:59.625
That'll bring in a couple of Sprites.
119

119

00:05:59.625  -->  00:06:01.496
I'm gonna go to my
Lizard Attacking Sprites.
120

120

00:06:01.496  -->  00:06:05.120
So they're being cut up, all 88 of them,
which is a little bit excessive.
121

121

00:06:05.120  -->  00:06:07.670
Generally I recommend not
bothering with 88, but
122

122

00:06:07.670  -->  00:06:09.500
we'll deal with what we've been given.
123

123

00:06:09.500  -->  00:06:11.500
Drag those over in.
124

124

00:06:11.500  -->  00:06:12.976
Okay, that all should be pretty good.
125

125

00:06:12.976  -->  00:06:13.890
Click on Play.
126

126

00:06:13.890  -->  00:06:15.142
Munch, munch, munch, munch.
127

127

00:06:15.142  -->  00:06:15.900
Munch, munch, munch, munch.
128

128

00:06:15.900  -->  00:06:20.410
All right, it looks cool, looks cool
indeed, and change it to 24 frames so
129

129

00:06:20.410  -->  00:06:21.280
we got the right speed.
130

130

00:06:23.220  -->  00:06:24.530
Yeah, nom, nom, nom, nom.
131

131

00:06:24.530  -->  00:06:25.520
Okay, nom noms!
132

132

00:06:25.520  -->  00:06:27.040
Good, we got our nom nom attack.
133

133

00:06:27.040  -->  00:06:28.400
Is that an attack?
134

134

00:06:28.400  -->  00:06:31.140
The attack of the nom noms, I'm sure
someone out there has heard of a game that
135

135

00:06:31.140  -->  00:06:33.860
has a nom nom attacking it somewhere.
136

136

00:06:33.860  -->  00:06:36.610
Okay, I hit Save cuz I haven't saved for
a while.
137

137

00:06:36.610  -->  00:06:38.550
Go to Animation, I run down to Animator,
138

138

00:06:38.550  -->  00:06:40.920
you can see Lizard Attack
has been dropped in there.
139

139

00:06:40.920  -->  00:06:42.520
Let me give ourselves
a little bit of space.
140

140

00:06:42.520  -->  00:06:45.740
Now, we need to be transitioning from
Walk to Attack, and Attack to Walk.
141

141

00:06:45.740  -->  00:06:50.020
We don't need to be transitioning from
Jump to Attack, because we're not going to
142

142

00:06:50.020  -->  00:06:54.560
allow the lizard to be attacking anything
until it's totally entered the scene and
143

143

00:06:54.560  -->  00:06:55.310
finished its jump.
144

144

00:06:55.310  -->  00:06:58.990
So click on Lizard Walk, right-click
Make Transition to Lizard Attack.
145

145

00:06:58.990  -->  00:07:01.740
Lizard Attack, right-click
Make Transition to Lizard Walk.
146

146

00:07:01.740  -->  00:07:05.530
We'll click on over in parameters,
we need to add a new parameter
147

147

00:07:05.530  -->  00:07:10.220
which will be a ball, and
the ball will be called is attacking.
148

148

00:07:11.780  -->  00:07:13.430
Great stuff, click click.
149

149

00:07:14.540  -->  00:07:17.112
Lets just test that out with
the guy we've got now seen,
150

150

00:07:17.112  -->  00:07:18.821
once he's finished doing his jump.
151

151

00:07:20.518  -->  00:07:24.610
Jump, now if I click on Attacking,
he's attacking, yep.
152

152

00:07:24.610  -->  00:07:25.320
Starting and stopping.
153

153

00:07:25.320  -->  00:07:25.840
Okay, cool.
And
154

154

00:07:25.840  -->  00:07:28.150
the problem is he's still
moving across the screen.
155

155

00:07:28.150  -->  00:07:29.570
What do we need to do there?
156

156

00:07:29.570  -->  00:07:31.092
Little mini challenge for you.
157

157

00:07:31.092  -->  00:07:33.829
How do we stop him sliding
across the screen?
158

158

00:07:33.829  -->  00:07:38.280
Okay, the way we do that is
we find the attack animation.
159

159

00:07:38.280  -->  00:07:41.080
We put in a event right
at the very very start.
160

160

00:07:41.080  -->  00:07:43.652
Click on our Event button there,
Add Event.
161

161

00:07:43.652  -->  00:07:48.105
And in our Function, we select
SetMovementSpeed, and set that to 0.
162

162

00:07:48.105  -->  00:07:52.800
Now, when we click on our Animator,
click on Play.
163

163

00:07:52.800  -->  00:07:56.140
We've got our little checkbox we
can click isAttacking on and off.
164

164

00:07:56.140  -->  00:08:00.712
Attacking, he stops,
turn off isAttacking, [SOUND] okay, and
165

165

00:08:00.712  -->  00:08:04.195
what's happening here is another test for
you.
166

166

00:08:04.195  -->  00:08:06.680
Why is he staying in his lizard attack.
167

167

00:08:06.680  -->  00:08:10.250
It's because we're not setting,
168

168

00:08:10.250  -->  00:08:13.540
where are we in here in our
lizard attack transition.
169

169

00:08:13.540  -->  00:08:17.230
We have Exit Time ticked on,
so we tick Exit Time off.
170

170

00:08:17.230  -->  00:08:21.160
On here I'm going to transition to 0,
just cuz I like to do that.
171

171

00:08:21.160  -->  00:08:24.161
And then transition is 0,
and has Exit Time off.
172

172

00:08:24.161  -->  00:08:26.076
So the moment the transition happens,
173

173

00:08:26.076  -->  00:08:28.404
we want it to go into
the other animation state.
174

174

00:08:28.404  -->  00:08:31.357
It's good to do these things when you
can still just tick your box on and off,
175

175

00:08:31.357  -->  00:08:34.589
cuz if you have to wait until you've got
your code written, sometimes it's a bit of
176

176

00:08:34.589  -->  00:08:38.080
a pain to figure out is that my code or
is that the way I've set up my animator?
177

177

00:08:38.080  -->  00:08:41.770
Okay, so he's not stopping at all,
178

178

00:08:41.770  -->  00:08:47.710
that is because I've broken something,
my transition here, okay, so,
179

179

00:08:47.710  -->  00:08:51.060
my tick box some of you have been probably
yelling at me Rick, you're an idiot.
180

180

00:08:51.060  -->  00:08:51.840
I am an idiot.
181

181

00:08:51.840  -->  00:08:52.770
I've been ticking the box,
182

182

00:08:52.770  -->  00:08:56.410
it hasn't actually been doing anything
because I hadn't put my conditions in yet.
183

183

00:08:56.410  -->  00:08:58.850
It was just going from Walk,
to Attack, and then back to Walk.
184

184

00:08:58.850  -->  00:09:01.267
And I thought, I made one of those,
I'm pushing the button, and
185

185

00:09:01.267  -->  00:09:02.800
[LAUGH] it's working, it wasn't.
186

186

00:09:02.800  -->  00:09:06.150
Okay, so let's add our conditions on
the transition from Walk to Attack.
187

187

00:09:06.150  -->  00:09:09.090
It'd be isAttacking is true,
that's correct.
188

188

00:09:09.090  -->  00:09:12.990
Now, on the other way around,
it's gonna be isAttacking is false.
189

189

00:09:12.990  -->  00:09:14.717
So I was clicking
the little + button there,
190

190

00:09:14.717  -->  00:09:17.862
isAttacking populated automatically, and
then changing it from true to false.
191

191

00:09:17.862  -->  00:09:22.730
Now, unless I've done some other
dumb thing, which is quite possible.
192

192

00:09:22.730  -->  00:09:25.140
Let me click the box,
bump, stops, and eats.
193

193

00:09:26.520  -->  00:09:28.910
There we go, golden, okay.
194

194

00:09:28.910  -->  00:09:31.740
So we've got the behavior that we want,
nom, nom, nom, nom.
195

195

00:09:31.740  -->  00:09:34.180
And now we're ready for him to do what?
196

196

00:09:34.180  -->  00:09:38.420
We're ready for him to have that code,
so let's click on Lizard.
197

197

00:09:38.420  -->  00:09:41.130
Just make sure everything's
applied back in the prefab.
198

198

00:09:41.130  -->  00:09:43.280
We'll go open a script,
which script should we open up?
199

199

00:09:43.280  -->  00:09:45.253
We'll open up the Attacker script.
200

200

00:09:46.604  -->  00:09:50.060
We'll start by creating a variable
which will be the current target, so
201

201

00:09:50.060  -->  00:09:52.280
I'll make it a game object for now.
202

202

00:09:52.280  -->  00:09:54.000
We might make it a defender in the future,
but
203

203

00:09:54.000  -->  00:09:57.180
we'll make a GameObject
called this currentTarget.
204

204

00:09:57.180  -->  00:09:58.320
So this is who you're targeting,
205

205

00:09:58.320  -->  00:10:01.100
only one at a time in our
particular game at the moment.
206

206

00:10:01.100  -->  00:10:04.010
And now we can scroll all the way down
to the bottom of our script underneath
207

207

00:10:04.010  -->  00:10:05.220
SetMovementSpeed.
208

208

00:10:05.220  -->  00:10:10.810
We'll make ourselves a public method,
public void, and we'll call this Attack.
209

209

00:10:10.810  -->  00:10:13.500
And in Attack we need to
know who we are attacking.
210

210

00:10:13.500  -->  00:10:16.590
So we're going to ask for
a GameObject and we'll call it target.
211

211

00:10:17.640  -->  00:10:18.980
And the moment we are attacking,
212

212

00:10:18.980  -->  00:10:22.440
what we want to do is set
our animator to attacking.
213

213

00:10:22.440  -->  00:10:24.120
So here's another mini challenge for you.
214

214

00:10:24.120  -->  00:10:30.350
Go ahead and write the line that will
set our animation to being attacking.
215

215

00:10:30.350  -->  00:10:32.220
Might need to go have a look
at some of our other code, but
216

216

00:10:32.220  -->  00:10:33.630
there's a little mini challenge for you.
217

217

00:10:34.660  -->  00:10:36.530
Okay, first of all we
need to get the animator.
218

218

00:10:36.530  -->  00:10:41.325
So GetComponent, Animator,
and what we'll do,
219

219

00:10:41.325  -->  00:10:47.580
what we'll SetBool and
we'll SetBool to be what, isAttacking.
220

220

00:10:47.580  -->  00:10:51.302
Now I made a big mess up last time
on this, let's go to isAttacking.
221

221

00:10:51.302  -->  00:10:56.217
And highlight it, copy,
back over into here, paste.
222

222

00:10:56.217  -->  00:10:58.500
That actually did get it correct,
but you never know.
223

223

00:10:58.500  -->  00:11:00.170
And we'll say that will now be true.
224

224

00:11:01.300  -->  00:11:06.470
And then we also need to set whatever
we've just parsed in when this called,
225

225

00:11:06.470  -->  00:11:08.690
when attack is called,
we parsed in the target.
226

226

00:11:08.690  -->  00:11:16.090
So now we'll say that our
currentTarget = what, equals target.
227

227

00:11:16.090  -->  00:11:16.590
There we go.
228

228

00:11:17.820  -->  00:11:21.650
Now, we need to have the moment
where we call out attack.
229

229

00:11:21.650  -->  00:11:23.720
And to do that we'll create
ourselves a new script.
230

230

00:11:23.720  -->  00:11:27.330
And I said before we'll have a script for
every particular attacker.
231

231

00:11:27.330  -->  00:11:29.007
Say now, scripts folder, right click.
232

232

00:11:32.946  -->  00:11:35.690
Create C# Script, I'll call this Lizard.
233

233

00:11:37.540  -->  00:11:39.020
Let's open up Lizard.
234

234

00:11:39.020  -->  00:11:41.800
Gonna get rid of Start and Update,
I don't think I'm gonna need those.
235

235

00:11:41.800  -->  00:11:47.590
What we do need is an OnTrigger into 2D,
so void OnTrigger, enter 2D.
236

236

00:11:48.660  -->  00:11:50.990
And just to be really clear
instead of calling it collision,
237

237

00:11:50.990  -->  00:11:53.420
I'm gonna call it otherCollider.
238

238

00:11:55.000  -->  00:11:55.810
otherCollider, or
239

239

00:11:55.810  -->  00:11:59.710
the thing we collided with's collider
is basically what this is in here.
240

240

00:11:59.710  -->  00:12:04.780
And then we'll create ourselves
a GameObject that we'll call otherObject,
241

241

00:12:04.780  -->  00:12:06.620
the other thing that we've
bumped into just now.
242

242

00:12:06.620  -->  00:12:13.040
And that will equal
the otherCollider.gameObject.
243

243

00:12:13.040  -->  00:12:15.677
Okay, just establishing that
we have this game object.
244

244

00:12:15.677  -->  00:12:20.010
So we're taking it from just being,
I know about the collider of an object,
245

245

00:12:20.010  -->  00:12:23.349
to be being I now about the game
object I've just bumped into.
246

246

00:12:23.349  -->  00:12:27.260
Now, I want to write an if statement.
247

247

00:12:27.260  -->  00:12:30.950
Where I'm looking to see if it's
a defender, and if it is an attack.
248

248

00:12:30.950  -->  00:12:33.320
And this is where I've got a challenge for
you.
249

249

00:12:33.320  -->  00:12:35.180
That challenge is finish
our collision event.
250

250

00:12:35.180  -->  00:12:38.910
So, I've written this in my,
this is a pretty bright green, isn't it?
251

251

00:12:38.910  -->  00:12:41.180
Okay, in my little pseudo
comment code here.
252

252

00:12:41.180  -->  00:12:44.400
If the other object has
a defender component,
253

253

00:12:44.400  -->  00:12:47.850
then call our public attack
method we just created.
254

254

00:12:47.850  -->  00:12:50.740
So there's a little if statement I'd
like for you to take on and write.
255

255

00:12:50.740  -->  00:12:52.961
So give it your best shot and
I'll see you back here when you're done.
256

256

00:12:54.912  -->  00:13:02.210
Okay, so if otherObject, that we've
just created, otherObject.GetComponent.
257

257

00:13:02.210  -->  00:13:04.645
And what sort of component
does it need to have?
258

258

00:13:04.645  -->  00:13:06.320
It needs to have a Defender component.
259

259

00:13:06.320  -->  00:13:08.040
We wanna know, are you a defender?
260

260

00:13:08.040  -->  00:13:11.570
If not, we are not interested, but
if you do have a defender component,
261

261

00:13:11.570  -->  00:13:16.410
that means you're worthy of being
attacked, then we wanna get my object, so
262

262

00:13:16.410  -->  00:13:19.310
my lizard object's attacker script.
263

263

00:13:19.310  -->  00:13:22.885
So GetComponent, because that
belongs to me as a game object, so
264

264

00:13:22.885  -->  00:13:24.970
I have a component which is Attacker.
265

265

00:13:26.230  -->  00:13:30.570
And then on that we call the attack
script, sorry the attack method.
266

266

00:13:30.570  -->  00:13:33.918
And the attack will attack what,
otherObject.
267

267

00:13:33.918  -->  00:13:37.390
It's a little bit tricky but
basically we are bumping into something,
268

268

00:13:37.390  -->  00:13:41.410
we're saying it's a game object, does it
have a defender script and then now we
269

269

00:13:41.410  -->  00:13:45.550
know from this point on that this is the
thing we're attacking, this otherObject.
270

270

00:13:45.550  -->  00:13:46.530
So let's see how this work.
271

271

00:13:46.530  -->  00:13:47.830
Save that up.
272

272

00:13:47.830  -->  00:13:49.370
Jump back over into Unity.
273

273

00:13:49.370  -->  00:13:50.185
Now click on Lizard.
274

274

00:13:50.185  -->  00:13:54.539
Remember or remembering, I've just spent
the last five minutes wondering why my
275

275

00:13:54.539  -->  00:13:58.955
code hasn't work and I've just edited that
piece out, is I've forgotten to add my
276

276

00:13:58.955  -->  00:14:02.323
Lizard component to my Lizard,
which is what we should do now.
277

277

00:14:02.323  -->  00:14:04.633
So add lizard, apply that to the prefab so
278

278

00:14:04.633  -->  00:14:07.350
it actually knows the code
that we've created.
279

279

00:14:07.350  -->  00:14:08.212
It knows about it.
280

280

00:14:08.212  -->  00:14:11.960
And then, well I'm here I'm gonna
click on isTrigger as well, and
281

281

00:14:11.960  -->  00:14:14.642
the box Collider for
the lizard, click on Apply.
282

282

00:14:14.642  -->  00:14:19.600
Click Play, and then I think it's gonna be
the tombstone that's gonna work the best
283

283

00:14:19.600  -->  00:14:22.080
for this,
cuz currently we've tuned our cactus,
284

284

00:14:22.080  -->  00:14:26.040
and our gnome to completely
smash things as they come along.
285

285

00:14:26.040  -->  00:14:29.320
So he stops and starts nibbling on it,
that's great, nom, nom, nom, nom.
286

286

00:14:29.320  -->  00:14:32.850
And we'll see if we can get it as well
with a cactus, and there we go yeah.
287

287

00:14:32.850  -->  00:14:35.690
So they're now stopping, they're
attacking, we don't have the proper
288

288

00:14:35.690  -->  00:14:38.930
health component setup just yet so they're
gonna stand there forever attacking.
289

289

00:14:38.930  -->  00:14:42.060
But they're now switching into
their transition state based upon
290

290

00:14:42.060  -->  00:14:43.140
our animation trigger.
291

291

00:14:43.140  -->  00:14:46.690
So great work, you can probably
tune your colliders a little bit so
292

292

00:14:46.690  -->  00:14:50.080
it's a little bit tighter, so it looks
like they're actually nibbling on things.
293

293

00:14:50.080  -->  00:14:51.630
So great stuff and
I'll see you in the next video.
