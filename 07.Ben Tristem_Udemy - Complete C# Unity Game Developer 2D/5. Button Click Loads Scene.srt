2

00:00:04,049  -->  00:00:07,988
Hello again, in this video, we're going
to hook up some functionality for
3

3

00:00:07,988  -->  00:00:08,980
our start button.
4

4

00:00:08,980  -->  00:00:11,660
So when we click the start button,
it loads to the next scene,
5

5

00:00:11,660  -->  00:00:15,230
not much to see at the moment but that
is loading from one scene to the next.
6

6

00:00:15,230  -->  00:00:16,580
So we'll be writing the script and
7

7

00:00:16,580  -->  00:00:21,580
setting out our method to be able to
do that, let's jump in and get started.
8

8

00:00:21,580  -->  00:00:24,130
Okay, we have three scenes
in our game at the moment,
9

9

00:00:24,130  -->  00:00:28,600
we have our start menu,
our core game scene and our win screen.
10

10

00:00:28,600  -->  00:00:31,500
And we want the player,
when they click the start button,
11

11

00:00:31,500  -->  00:00:35,770
to load core game when they click
the that's it button or success button, or
12

12

00:00:35,770  -->  00:00:38,370
you got it correct button,
whatever you like to label it as.
13

13

00:00:38,370  -->  00:00:39,950
Then we go to the win screen and
14

14

00:00:39,950  -->  00:00:43,430
then you click play again,
we return back to the Start menu.
15

15

00:00:43,430  -->  00:00:48,740
So we have a cyclical flow
here from one to two,
16

16

00:00:48,740  -->  00:00:53,225
to three, to four, to whatever we
get to and then back to the start.
17

17

00:00:53,225  -->  00:00:56,305
And each of these scenes needs
to have a build index, so
18

18

00:00:56,305  -->  00:00:59,985
we start off at 0 and then 1 and 2.
19

19

00:00:59,985  -->  00:01:04,755
We could load by saying,
let's just load Scene Index Number 1 and
20

20

00:01:04,755  -->  00:01:08,315
we happen to know that that means
we're loading the Core Game.
21

21

00:01:08,315  -->  00:01:12,575
We could say it load Scene Index Number
2 but that becomes a problem if and
22

22

00:01:12,575  -->  00:01:14,800
I'm gonna get my pen here.
23

23

00:01:14,800  -->  00:01:20,340
If we were, for example, to add an extra
scene in here, it might be between our
24

24

00:01:20,340  -->  00:01:25,110
core game and our Win,
our play again screen, our Win Screen.
25

25

00:01:25,110  -->  00:01:28,340
Windscreen is the sort of thing you
have on the front of your car, isn't it?
26

26

00:01:28,340  -->  00:01:31,550
Anyway, we might insert
another scene in here,
27

27

00:01:31,550  -->  00:01:34,740
that for whatever reason because
we think it'll be neat and then,
28

28

00:01:34,740  -->  00:01:39,030
we want to have that indexed as two,
so we can still keep it in order.
29

29

00:01:39,030  -->  00:01:42,810
Go from Core Game to whatever our
neat new thing is, into Win Screen.
30

30

00:01:42,810  -->  00:01:45,900
This would then need to be Number 3,
so if we've gone ahead and
31

31

00:01:45,900  -->  00:01:50,481
said hard coded or
type straining, let's load 2.
32

32

00:01:50,481  -->  00:01:55,206
Now 2, we have to remember has
change from this to this, so
33

33

00:01:55,206  -->  00:02:01,350
it's always kind of manual work,
which is not a good way to set things up.
34

34

00:02:01,350  -->  00:02:03,542
So what we want to do instead is to say,
35

35

00:02:03,542  -->  00:02:06,758
we'll find out what scene
are we currently on.
36

36

00:02:06,758  -->  00:02:10,644
So what are we on at the moment,
what's the scene number and
37

37

00:02:10,644  -->  00:02:14,683
the what we wish to add load from
one scene to the next, we say,
38

38

00:02:14,683  -->  00:02:18,940
take whatever I am at the moment,
for example 0 and just add 1.
39

39

00:02:18,940  -->  00:02:22,830
And then when I'm on this scene, take
whatever we are at the moment and add 1.
40

40

00:02:22,830  -->  00:02:26,250
So we would go from 1 and we would
add 1 and we would say that's now 2.
41

41

00:02:26,250  -->  00:02:30,680
So the add one allows us to progress
along our chain when we're loading.
42

42

00:02:30,680  -->  00:02:33,790
And we'll have a different challenge when
we wanna load back to the very start but
43

43

00:02:33,790  -->  00:02:35,760
we'll get to that challenge
in an upcoming video.
44

44

00:02:35,760  -->  00:02:39,540
For now, we wanna go through this
mechanism as saying, what scene am I on
45

45

00:02:39,540  -->  00:02:44,220
and how do I +1 to load the new scene,
that is our loading mechanism.
46

46

00:02:44,220  -->  00:02:47,199
And I know those of you who have been
itching to write more code will be excited
47

47

00:02:47,199  -->  00:02:49,350
because we are about to
write some more code.
48

48

00:02:49,350  -->  00:02:52,970
First thing we will do in our
hierarchy is create a new game object,
49

49

00:02:52,970  -->  00:02:57,105
so right click, Create Empty, that's
why am saying create empty game object.
50

50

00:02:57,105  -->  00:03:01,970
Or we can come up to Game Object and
Create Empty, we'll rename this and
51

51

00:03:01,970  -->  00:03:04,044
we'll call it scene loader.
52

52

00:03:04,044  -->  00:03:07,970
So via scene loader game object,
it doesn't look like anything and
53

53

00:03:07,970  -->  00:03:11,605
it doesn't have any components.
54

54

00:03:11,605  -->  00:03:16,380
We're just gonna use this a container that
will allows us to load the next scene.
55

55

00:03:16,380  -->  00:03:20,260
As it's good practice, I'm gonna right
click and reset my transform, just so
56

56

00:03:20,260  -->  00:03:22,540
it's in the middle of our game,
57

57

00:03:22,540  -->  00:03:25,580
just one of these things we get into
a habit of doing it this point.
58

58

00:03:25,580  -->  00:03:29,223
Okay, so now that we have our scene
loader game object, our container,
59

59

00:03:29,223  -->  00:03:33,300
we're going to add a script, so I click
Add Component, we'll call this scene.
60

60

00:03:33,300  -->  00:03:37,005
I don't know why button was [LAUGH] I
think that was cuz I was typing in button,
61

61

00:03:37,005  -->  00:03:39,887
[LAUGH] funny thing to have
halfway complete, wasn't it?
62

62

00:03:39,887  -->  00:03:44,170
Anywho, so who are we going to call this,
so whatever we type in here is what our
63

63

00:03:44,170  -->  00:03:47,880
script will be called, we'll call
it Scene, what should we call it?
64

64

00:03:47,880  -->  00:03:50,780
Scene Loader, yeah, Scene Loader as well.
65

65

00:03:50,780  -->  00:03:53,470
So that will be a Scene Loader script and
of course,
66

66

00:03:53,470  -->  00:03:58,000
we have no spaces and we have capital S
and capital L, Scene loader, it's the same
67

67

00:03:58,000  -->  00:04:02,190
name as our game object, which is okay,
they're two totally separate entities.
68

68

00:04:02,190  -->  00:04:04,260
This is our script,
that's our game object.
69

69

00:04:04,260  -->  00:04:08,210
Scene loader, hit Enter and
create and add.
70

70

00:04:08,210  -->  00:04:09,800
That will create our new script and
71

71

00:04:09,800  -->  00:04:14,330
that has attached it as a component
to our scene loader game object.
72

72

00:04:14,330  -->  00:04:16,940
Now scene loader script doesn't
have anything in it at the moment,
73

73

00:04:16,940  -->  00:04:17,650
let's go find it.
74

74

00:04:17,650  -->  00:04:19,430
It will be in our asset's directory.
75

75

00:04:19,430  -->  00:04:23,350
While we're here, I'm going to right click
create folder and call this scripts.
76

76

00:04:23,350  -->  00:04:26,110
We don't need to add folders
all the time like this but
77

77

00:04:26,110  -->  00:04:27,330
it's a good habit to get into.
78

78

00:04:27,330  -->  00:04:30,520
We're trying to create habits in ourselves
here, so it's easier later on and
79

79

00:04:30,520  -->  00:04:32,560
you can see that we have
our scripts folder, so
80

80

00:04:32,560  -->  00:04:36,650
it let's me double click, okay and
see loaded.cs, double check, yep.
81

81

00:04:36,650  -->  00:04:40,686
And scene loader is the class name, so
I'll just double click on that to open up
82

82

00:04:40,686  -->  00:04:44,810
Visual Studio And
83

83

00:04:44,810  -->  00:04:48,980
we can see that we've got our
SceneLoader class right here.
84

84

00:04:48,980  -->  00:04:51,750
Great.
We're not going to need our start
85

85

00:04:51,750  -->  00:04:53,310
method or our update method, so
86

86

00:04:53,310  -->  00:04:57,270
I'm going to delete both of those,
giving ourselves a little bit of space.
87

87

00:04:57,270  -->  00:05:02,310
Okay cuz we're going scene loading, I need
to use the name space of scene management.
88

88

00:05:02,310  -->  00:05:08,565
So using, we'll type at the very top
of our script here, under using engine,
89

89

00:05:08,565  -->  00:05:15,340
we'll type UnityEngine.SceneManagement;,
that means we can
90

90

00:05:15,340  -->  00:05:19,705
now use the name space of scene management
and all that is contained within.
91

91

00:05:19,705  -->  00:05:24,530
We're gonna create a public
method called load next scene,
92

92

00:05:24,530  -->  00:05:25,660
now, if you know how to do that,
93

93

00:05:25,660  -->  00:05:30,590
if you know how to create a public method
called LoadNextScene, with no return type.
94

94

00:05:30,590  -->  00:05:33,070
Then pause the video and type that in now.
95

95

00:05:33,070  -->  00:05:34,100
I'll give you a moment to do that.
96

96

00:05:36,560  -->  00:05:39,840
And generally, I wanna give you a few
micro-challenges in this lecture.
97

97

00:05:39,840  -->  00:05:41,190
There won't be a big main challenge.
98

98

00:05:41,190  -->  00:05:44,940
Just, if you know what I'm talking about,
see if you can type it in before I type it
99

99

00:05:44,940  -->  00:05:47,890
or type it at the same time without
just waiting for me to type it.
100

100

00:05:47,890  -->  00:05:49,730
So, Public method.
101

101

00:05:49,730  -->  00:05:55,670
It's public method no return type, so void
and we're clearing at load next scene.
102

102

00:05:55,670  -->  00:05:59,160
Capital L, N and S and
then parenthesis at the end.
103

103

00:05:59,160  -->  00:06:02,930
We need our curly braces, great.
104

104

00:06:02,930  -->  00:06:06,850
Now in here, we need a way of saying,
what is our current scene index?
105

105

00:06:06,850  -->  00:06:09,370
And we want to define a variable,
106

106

00:06:09,370  -->  00:06:14,140
wanna declare a variable that
is getting the scene index.
107

107

00:06:14,140  -->  00:06:18,630
So what we'll say is end to say
this is an integer cuz our scene
108

108

00:06:18,630  -->  00:06:22,680
index is going to be one or two, or three,
or four and those are integers, so,
109

109

00:06:22,680  -->  00:06:27,200
it's an integer type and
we'll call it currentSceneIndex.
110

110

00:06:28,580  -->  00:06:29,650
What is currentSceneIndex?
111

111

00:06:29,650  -->  00:06:32,780
Well this is a little bit hairy what
we're gonna type here but bear with me.
112

112

00:06:32,780  -->  00:06:36,850
First of all, we're gonna start
off with our SceneManager class,
113

113

00:06:36,850  -->  00:06:40,940
SceneManager., within here,
we've got a whole lot of
114

114

00:06:40,940  -->  00:06:45,190
options within this class that we can
use and we are trying to get this scene.
115

115

00:06:45,190  -->  00:06:48,970
We want to know what scene we are on,
so we want to get the active scene.
116

116

00:06:48,970  -->  00:06:51,630
We can either click on active scene or
we'll type it.
117

117

00:06:51,630  -->  00:06:55,190
Get active scene as soon as
you can see in order to place,
118

118

00:06:55,190  -->  00:06:57,810
you can hit tab A and
end it in auto complete.
119

119

00:06:57,810  -->  00:06:59,670
Now, what are our options here?
120

120

00:06:59,670  -->  00:07:03,610
So within our class of scene manager,
we have our method we can
121

121

00:07:03,610  -->  00:07:08,060
use GetActiveScene and we then get
ActiveScene, what are our options in here?
122

122

00:07:08,060  -->  00:07:10,170
What are the parameters
that we can dig into?
123

123

00:07:10,170  -->  00:07:14,052
Well, what what we want to find,
sorry I forgot, on here is a method, so
124

124

00:07:14,052  -->  00:07:16,930
we need our parenthesis,
my bad, forgot that.
125

125

00:07:16,930  -->  00:07:21,280
And then., we need to say what's
the very first option here?
126

126

00:07:21,280  -->  00:07:25,600
Build index, so buildindex.
127

127

00:07:25,600  -->  00:07:27,130
Okay and then semicolon.
128

128

00:07:27,130  -->  00:07:32,170
So what we've done here is we've declared
and defined an integer variable called
129

129

00:07:32,170  -->  00:07:36,150
currentSceneIndex and
it is within the same manager class.
130

130

00:07:36,150  -->  00:07:37,520
We're saying dot.
131

131

00:07:37,520  -->  00:07:39,860
We're saying run the method
of GetActiveScene.
132

132

00:07:39,860  -->  00:07:41,040
What's my current active scene?
133

133

00:07:41,040  -->  00:07:44,630
Well, there's some things that we
can find out about the ActiveScene.
134

134

00:07:44,630  -->  00:07:47,250
The thing that we wanna
know is the buildIndex.
135

135

00:07:47,250  -->  00:07:52,100
What is the current buildIndex of
the Scene that we are presently on for
136

136

00:07:52,100  -->  00:07:53,270
this instance?
137

137

00:07:53,270  -->  00:07:58,410
Okay, then we want to load our next scene.
138

138

00:07:58,410  -->  00:07:59,060
Not the scene we're on.
139

139

00:07:59,060  -->  00:08:03,149
We're loading the next scene so,
140

140

00:08:03,149  -->  00:08:08,508
we will type in
Scene Manager.loadScene and
141

141

00:08:08,508  -->  00:08:13,310
in here, we want to load the next scene.
142

142

00:08:13,310  -->  00:08:14,890
So the one we're on and the next one.
143

143

00:08:14,890  -->  00:08:19,750
So if you know how to do that,
right in the little formula in here for
144

144

00:08:19,750  -->  00:08:21,420
loading the next scene.
145

145

00:08:21,420  -->  00:08:24,420
And if you're writing that, if you're
typing that in now, that's great,
146

146

00:08:24,420  -->  00:08:25,870
I'll give you a little bit of a hint.
147

147

00:08:25,870  -->  00:08:28,050
We want to know what is the scene.
148

148

00:08:28,050  -->  00:08:31,940
We want to load the scene that is
one more than our current scene.
149

149

00:08:32,950  -->  00:08:39,590
So to do that,
we say current scene index +1.
150

150

00:08:39,590  -->  00:08:41,780
That will load whatever our
front zero at the moment.
151

151

00:08:41,780  -->  00:08:46,390
Which we are because we are attaching
this in our start menu,
152

152

00:08:46,390  -->  00:08:48,350
which we know it's scene zero.
153

153

00:08:48,350  -->  00:08:52,570
Then it is going to be 0 + 1, which
will take us to scene index number 1.
154

154

00:08:52,570  -->  00:08:54,560
Okay, let's save that.
155

155

00:08:54,560  -->  00:08:59,195
The important step that we need to
do is go up to file, yep, okay,
156

156

00:08:59,195  -->  00:09:02,750
build settings.
157

157

00:09:02,750  -->  00:09:05,430
And you see that we currently
have no builds in our scene or
158

158

00:09:05,430  -->  00:09:06,920
scenes in our build I'd say.
159

159

00:09:06,920  -->  00:09:08,370
Builds in our scene that makes sense.
160

160

00:09:08,370  -->  00:09:16,170
And what we can do is click on our scenes
folder and then just drag in start menu.
161

161

00:09:16,170  -->  00:09:19,700
Drag in core game and drag in win screen.
162

162

00:09:19,700  -->  00:09:22,810
And while we're in here we can
reorder these by dragging up and down,
163

163

00:09:22,810  -->  00:09:24,535
wanna make sure the correct order,
164

164

00:09:24,535  -->  00:09:28,995
so start, cool game, win screen,
zero, one and two, excellent.
165

165

00:09:28,995  -->  00:09:32,235
We don't need to click build or run for
now, we're just setting up our scenes
166

166

00:09:32,235  -->  00:09:35,385
in the build and that's automatically we
don't need to save this window either.
167

167

00:09:35,385  -->  00:09:40,255
So out of that, we've saved,
now, as a final step,
168

168

00:09:40,255  -->  00:09:45,690
we need to tell something
to call that public method.
169

169

00:09:45,690  -->  00:09:49,240
So we've just created a public method
that we can use outside of this class.
170

170

00:09:49,240  -->  00:09:52,290
That's what public means,
it's outside of this class in here.
171

171

00:09:52,290  -->  00:09:55,910
We need to find a place to put
LoadNextScene, and we're gonna to that.
172

172

00:09:55,910  -->  00:09:58,430
We're gonna put it on
our start button here.
173

173

00:09:58,430  -->  00:10:02,260
So on the start button itself, not on
the start text, we don't need to do that.
174

174

00:10:02,260  -->  00:10:04,490
But on the start button itself,
175

175

00:10:04,490  -->  00:10:08,740
scroll down until you find this
field in here that says unclick.
176

176

00:10:08,740  -->  00:10:11,070
At the moment, it should say,
list is empty.
177

177

00:10:11,070  -->  00:10:14,060
This is where we can put in our rules for
178

178

00:10:14,060  -->  00:10:16,130
what is going to happen when
this button is clicked on.
179

179

00:10:16,130  -->  00:10:19,860
So we click the little plus symbol,
you can see we have none object.
180

180

00:10:19,860  -->  00:10:24,290
What we're going to do is grab our scene
loader and drag that in because that is
181

181

00:10:24,290  -->  00:10:30,270
the game object where we just put our
script which has the public method on it.
182

182

00:10:30,270  -->  00:10:34,140
Now, when we look at the pool down here,
it says no function.
183

183

00:10:34,140  -->  00:10:37,150
We have the SceneLoader and
from SceneLoader,
184

184

00:10:37,150  -->  00:10:43,100
which is the name of our script, we can
find what do we call load next scenes.
185

185

00:10:43,100  -->  00:10:46,460
So we just created that public method,
it's now in our list here.
186

186

00:10:46,460  -->  00:10:49,070
We click on load next scene, so
187

187

00:10:49,070  -->  00:10:52,230
just one more time in this cuz people
often get stuck on this depth.
188

188

00:10:52,230  -->  00:10:55,000
We've dragged in our scene loader.
189

189

00:10:55,000  -->  00:10:57,790
Our scene loader has our
scene loader script on it.
190

190

00:10:57,790  -->  00:11:00,858
Our scene loader script has
within it our public method.
191

191

00:11:00,858  -->  00:11:03,720
So from,
I'm just back up my start button here.
192

192

00:11:03,720  -->  00:11:09,370
So I've dragged in scene loader and then
within scene loader, we need to click on
193

193

00:11:09,370  -->  00:11:13,850
scene loader as an option down the bottom
here and load next scene, okay.
194

194

00:11:13,850  -->  00:11:15,440
So, I've just clicked off.
195

195

00:11:15,440  -->  00:11:18,860
So do that a couple of times slowly cuz
that's something that people get stuck on
196

196

00:11:18,860  -->  00:11:23,470
and now when we click on our play button,
give my self a little bit more room,
197

197

00:11:23,470  -->  00:11:25,580
my game,
it's pretty tiny on the side here.
198

198

00:11:25,580  -->  00:11:27,290
Maybe a bit more room when I click start,
199

199

00:11:27,290  -->  00:11:32,500
it's going to load into our core game
scene that has a our success button on it.
200

200

00:11:32,500  -->  00:11:36,790
So we've loaded from our first to
our second scene and in our game,
201

201

00:11:36,790  -->  00:11:40,940
when I click out of play,
it will take me back to the start screen.
202

202

00:11:40,940  -->  00:11:44,180
So it remembers where we were,
when we're in the editor.
203

203

00:11:44,180  -->  00:11:46,970
Rather than where we go to
when we played our game.
204

204

00:11:46,970  -->  00:11:48,510
Okay, so we'll wrap up the video there.
205

205

00:11:48,510  -->  00:11:52,070
This is a big tool to have in your
arsenal, the ability to click a button and
206

206

00:11:52,070  -->  00:11:53,740
load a new scene.
207

207

00:11:53,740  -->  00:11:54,330
Very cool.
208

208

00:11:54,330  -->  00:11:56,500
In the next video,
we'll hook up the other buttons.
209

209

00:11:56,500  -->  00:11:58,500
So great work and
I'll see you in the next lecture.
