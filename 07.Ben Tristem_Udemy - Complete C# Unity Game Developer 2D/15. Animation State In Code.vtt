00:00:04.420  -->  00:00:08.750
Next up, we are going to use code to say
when our player should transition from
2

2

00:00:08.750  -->  00:00:11.180
idling to running so
that we can hold down the key.
3

3

00:00:11.180  -->  00:00:14.360
And as we do that the player
not only flips but
4

4

00:00:14.360  -->  00:00:16.840
also goes into that running state.
5

5

00:00:16.840  -->  00:00:19.260
So, let's make our player run.
6

6

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:21.940
So let's remind ourselves of what's
going on with our state machine.
7

7

00:00:21.940  -->  00:00:24.120
Here we have the default idling state and,
8

8

00:00:24.120  -->  00:00:26.380
through a transition,
we go into the running state.
9

9

00:00:26.380  -->  00:00:29.100
And then, after a transition,
we come back to the idling state.
10

10

00:00:29.100  -->  00:00:34.460
What makes that transition happen is,
when our condition of running is true.
11

11

00:00:34.460  -->  00:00:38.170
So running is a bool that we've set
up over here, so this is a bool.
12

12

00:00:38.170  -->  00:00:40.080
It could mean a trigger or a float.
13

13

00:00:40.080  -->  00:00:43.460
When this bool becomes true,
because bools are true or false,
14

14

00:00:43.460  -->  00:00:48.410
then it says execute this transition,
because the condition is being met.
15

15

00:00:48.410  -->  00:00:50.750
And then when the bool becomes false,
16

16

00:00:50.750  -->  00:00:55.420
then you can see this condition is the
transition of returning back to idling.
17

17

00:00:55.420  -->  00:01:00.170
So this is the important string that we
need to be referencing in our script,
18

18

00:01:00.170  -->  00:01:02.960
to say when that is true or
when that is false.
19

19

00:01:02.960  -->  00:01:05.040
And so what do we need to do
first with our player script?
20

20

00:01:05.040  -->  00:01:09.160
We need to grab the animator,
we need to get the animator component.
21

21

00:01:09.160  -->  00:01:10.680
Cuz that sits on the player here.
22

22

00:01:10.680  -->  00:01:13.700
That has the information about
the player animated controller.
23

23

00:01:13.700  -->  00:01:18.450
And the player animated controller
has our running reference just here.
24

24

00:01:18.450  -->  00:01:21.620
So let's jump over into out player
script and start setting that up.
25

25

00:01:21.620  -->  00:01:27.260
First of all we need to cache
our reference to the animator.
26

26

00:01:27.260  -->  00:01:29.790
So we need a type of animator.
27

27

00:01:29.790  -->  00:01:33.770
And we will call this myAnimator similar
to what we did with the RigidBody above.
28

28

00:01:33.770  -->  00:01:38.360
And then, in the start method,
same as with the RigidBody as well,
29

29

00:01:38.360  -->  00:01:42.370
we need to say myAnimator
equals GetComponent and
30

30

00:01:42.370  -->  00:01:45.810
that is of type Animator, okay.
31

31

00:01:45.810  -->  00:01:46.720
So, now we got that one,
32

32

00:01:46.720  -->  00:01:51.140
I wanna just take a moment to give
some headings to our areas in here.
33

33

00:01:51.140  -->  00:01:54.650
Just so you can see the way Ben and
I have been structuring our classes.
34

34

00:01:54.650  -->  00:01:57.420
This one will get reasonably large,
not huge, but reasonably large.
35

35

00:01:57.420  -->  00:02:00.070
So, just to be very clear,
where we put things, so
36

36

00:02:00.070  -->  00:02:03.070
that you can be placing them in
the same place as us, in the future.
37

37

00:02:03.070  -->  00:02:07.890
So the star we put in our Config,
sorry not Congig, Config.
38

38

00:02:07.890  -->  00:02:11.770
Anything to do with before we
start playing the game we can set
39

39

00:02:11.770  -->  00:02:17.090
these parameters and variables to certain
values so we can serialize our field.
40

40

00:02:17.090  -->  00:02:20.240
And to have for example runSpeed here and
41

41

00:02:20.240  -->  00:02:24.830
other parameters about how
our script should operate.
42

42

00:02:24.830  -->  00:02:28.770
Underneath that we tend to put,
or we usually put state.
43

43

00:02:28.770  -->  00:02:32.280
We don't have any state at the moment so
I'm going to go ahead and create one so
44

44

00:02:32.280  -->  00:02:33.170
that you can see in here.
45

45

00:02:33.170  -->  00:02:39.830
This would be a variable of bool type and
isalive = true.
46

46

00:02:39.830  -->  00:02:43.460
And so I'll keep this around because we
will need this not in this lecture not for
47

47

00:02:43.460  -->  00:02:45.590
a few lectures until we
get into death state.
48

48

00:02:45.590  -->  00:02:50.760
But this is a state not at the moment
the state is saying the player is alive,
49

49

00:02:50.760  -->  00:02:53.640
but at some time we will
need to turn this to false.
50

50

00:02:53.640  -->  00:02:56.430
As we're playing, as we're running
the game, we'll turn it to false and
51

51

00:02:56.430  -->  00:03:00.970
in that case the player will be dead,
isAlive won't be true.
52

52

00:03:00.970  -->  00:03:06.910
After that, we set up our cached or
cached, depending on how you want to say
53

53

00:03:06.910  -->  00:03:12.510
it, component References, as we've
just gone through that exercise there.
54

54

00:03:12.510  -->  00:03:17.640
We've gone and set up the references for
rigid body and animator.
55

55

00:03:17.640  -->  00:03:22.000
And then following from that, I'm just
gonna get rid of this standard study thing
56

56

00:03:22.000  -->  00:03:27.060
here, we put in our messages,
then methods.
57

57

00:03:28.460  -->  00:03:31.290
Okay, so that's the general flow
when we're putting things in there.
58

58

00:03:31.290  -->  00:03:33.810
And as you're doing challenges,
that'll give you a good anchor for
59

59

00:03:33.810  -->  00:03:37.890
where you can lay your things out so
it's consistent with what we're doing.
60

60

00:03:37.890  -->  00:03:39.480
Now, back to making our player run.
61

61

00:03:39.480  -->  00:03:43.570
If we go down to our run method we've got
down here, what do we need to add in here?
62

62

00:03:43.570  -->  00:03:48.820
Well, we need to be setting the bool
when we're in this state of run,
63

63

00:03:48.820  -->  00:03:52.950
so the player is running, therefore we
want the player to do run animation,
64

64

00:03:52.950  -->  00:03:54.740
underneath this run method here.
65

65

00:03:54.740  -->  00:03:57.180
So if we say, myAnimator.
66

66

00:03:57.180  -->  00:04:00.100
And have a look at what our options
are in here, we'll see what we got,
67

67

00:04:00.100  -->  00:04:07.260
if we scroll down we can see that we
have a set bool, so I've set bool.
68

68

00:04:07.260  -->  00:04:11.350
We can set our bool to now let's
have a look at what it's asking for.
69

69

00:04:11.350  -->  00:04:16.680
What it's asking for, I think the string
name and then the bool value.
70

70

00:04:16.680  -->  00:04:18.910
So the string name,
let's jump back over onto here.
71

71

00:04:18.910  -->  00:04:22.790
I know, Ben cringes, he winces and
72

72

00:04:22.790  -->  00:04:25.520
cringes each time I type things
in without copying and pasting.
73

73

00:04:25.520  -->  00:04:27.850
So this will give him warm and
fuzzy feelings.
74

74

00:04:27.850  -->  00:04:28.870
Let's all do this together.
75

75

00:04:28.870  -->  00:04:32.450
Let's go and copy running and
then come back and do our script here and
76

76

00:04:32.450  -->  00:04:36.100
past running between some quotation marks.
77

77

00:04:36.100  -->  00:04:39.120
So we now have running and
then it was looking for a bool value.
78

78

00:04:39.120  -->  00:04:40.580
So either true or false?
79

79

00:04:40.580  -->  00:04:43.340
So for the moment,
I'm going to say this is true.
80

80

00:04:43.340  -->  00:04:46.850
This isn't going to be the final solution,
I'm gonna give that to you as a challenge.
81

81

00:04:46.850  -->  00:04:48.440
But we'll set it to true and
82

82

00:04:48.440  -->  00:04:51.110
we'll see what happens in our
game when that is the case.
83

83

00:04:52.450  -->  00:04:56.120
So we should start off,
if I click play, we should start off
84

84

00:04:56.120  -->  00:05:00.170
our default should be idling, and
our default goes straight to running.
85

85

00:05:00.170  -->  00:05:03.130
Okay, so it is immediately to running.
86

86

00:05:03.130  -->  00:05:06.800
Which is good we've gone and
told through our code, start to run.
87

87

00:05:06.800  -->  00:05:09.880
But there's a problem here.
88

88

00:05:09.880  -->  00:05:13.500
Because at any point in time,
the player is always running.
89

89

00:05:13.500  -->  00:05:14.600
So what do we need to do?
90

90

00:05:14.600  -->  00:05:19.210
We need to do something
before this to establish what
91

91

00:05:19.210  -->  00:05:23.150
condition needs to be met in here for
the player to be running.
92

92

00:05:23.150  -->  00:05:26.010
So this is going to be your challenge for
this lecture.
93

93

00:05:27.880  -->  00:05:29.410
To Finish The Run State.
94

94

00:05:29.410  -->  00:05:33.480
Feed in to our running animation a way
to say true if the player is running and
95

95

00:05:33.480  -->  00:05:35.330
false if the player is not.
96

96

00:05:35.330  -->  00:05:36.340
Now I'm going to give you a hint.
97

97

00:05:36.340  -->  00:05:38.600
If you don't need a hint,
then jump in and solve this now.
98

98

00:05:38.600  -->  00:05:40.090
It's one line of code.
99

99

00:05:40.090  -->  00:05:45.420
And the hint is, use the code we
created for flipping our sprite.
100

100

00:05:45.420  -->  00:05:51.000
Basically to say that the player
has horizontal speed,
101

101

00:05:51.000  -->  00:05:54.440
or the player does not have horizontal
speed, because that's what we're going to
102

102

00:05:54.440  -->  00:05:57.090
be using to see if the player
is running or not.
103

103

00:05:57.090  -->  00:05:58.050
So there's a clue.
104

104

00:05:58.050  -->  00:06:02.510
Use the code that we created for
flipping, jumping, and
105

105

00:06:02.510  -->  00:06:06.610
give that a shot to have the run
state turn on and turn off.
106

106

00:06:06.610  -->  00:06:07.640
Based upon whether we're running.
107

107

00:06:09.780  -->  00:06:10.570
Welcome back.
So
108

108

00:06:10.570  -->  00:06:14.990
the line of code we're interested in
is this playerHasHorizontalSpeed bool.
109

109

00:06:14.990  -->  00:06:17.130
It is true if we are moving,
110

110

00:06:17.130  -->  00:06:20.410
it is false if we're not moving
on the horizontal axis here.
111

111

00:06:20.410  -->  00:06:27.360
So I'm going to copy that and paste
that above my Animation bool up here.
112

112

00:06:27.360  -->  00:06:28.790
And then what do we need to do?
113

113

00:06:28.790  -->  00:06:31.620
We need to feed in,
instead of putting true or false,
114

114

00:06:31.620  -->  00:06:35.250
we need to put in this bool of
player has horizontal speed.
115

115

00:06:35.250  -->  00:06:37.230
So this variable is either true or
is false,
116

116

00:06:37.230  -->  00:06:41.400
meaning our running state will be
either set to true or set to false.
117

117

00:06:41.400  -->  00:06:46.390
Let's save that and have a look to see
if our player now runs and doesn't run.
118

118

00:06:46.390  -->  00:06:50.360
Okay, standing around just idling,
I move and I run, I move and I run.
119

119

00:06:50.360  -->  00:06:53.820
Fantastic, it looks like, and you can
even see down in the animation here,
120

120

00:06:53.820  -->  00:06:58.840
it triggers, and it turns off
the trigger when I let go, let go.
121

121

00:06:58.840  -->  00:07:03.085
So that's the foundation for controlling
our animation from our code we set up our
122

122

00:07:03.085  -->  00:07:07.755
state machine, we make sure that we
have a parameter which we can access.
123

123

00:07:07.755  -->  00:07:10.885
And then in our code,
when particular things are happening, for
124

124

00:07:10.885  -->  00:07:14.985
example we are using the run method
to give horizontal velocity,
125

125

00:07:14.985  -->  00:07:19.315
we say that the running
transition condition is met, and
126

126

00:07:19.315  -->  00:07:22.915
that condition being met means
that this state is true.
127

127

00:07:24.700  -->  00:07:25.780
Great stuff, well done.
128

128

00:07:25.780  -->  00:07:27.820
I will see you in the next video.
