2

00:00:04.049  -->  00:00:04.660
Hello again.
3

3

00:00:04.660  -->  00:00:08.270
In this video we're going to be creating
ourselves a text field that will
4

4

00:00:08.270  -->  00:00:11.760
pump into it the number of stars
that the player currently has.
5

5

00:00:11.760  -->  00:00:12.850
See, it has 100.
6

6

00:00:12.850  -->  00:00:15.461
And we'll be creating
ourselves the mechanism so
7

7

00:00:15.461  -->  00:00:19.270
that in upcoming videos we can add or
decrease that number of resources.
8

8

00:00:19.270  -->  00:00:21.600
So let's jump in and get started.
9

9

00:00:21.600  -->  00:00:25.820
Just a reminder, whenever we do anything
in our hierarchy to things like our
10

10

00:00:25.820  -->  00:00:30.710
cactus, or to our trophy, make sure
you apply it back to the prefabs so
11

11

00:00:30.710  -->  00:00:34.330
that everything is getting
back on the prefab.
12

12

00:00:34.330  -->  00:00:36.950
Okay, so let's jump in and do some stuff.
13

13

00:00:36.950  -->  00:00:38.240
What stuff, I hear you ask.
14

14

00:00:38.240  -->  00:00:42.360
Well, let's create some
text to display the stars.
15

15

00:00:42.360  -->  00:00:46.680
That's my resources, and I'd love to see
someone out there have some schmeckles for
16

16

00:00:46.680  -->  00:00:51.780
their resources instead of stars to
store the current stars in a variable,
17

17

00:00:51.780  -->  00:00:56.300
to display our starts onto the screen,
to take it from an integer,
18

18

00:00:56.300  -->  00:01:01.530
which is what we're storing it as into
a string, so it can display it in text.
19

19

00:01:01.530  -->  00:01:05.430
And then to create two public methods,
one to add stars, and
20

20

00:01:05.430  -->  00:01:07.290
the other is to spend stars.
21

21

00:01:07.290  -->  00:01:11.327
And we'll also throw in there, I don't
have it on my do stuff list here, but
22

22

00:01:11.327  -->  00:01:14.672
we'll also add a little mechanism
to make sure you cannot spend
23

23

00:01:14.672  -->  00:01:17.340
stars if you don't have
the mungos in the bank.
24

24

00:01:17.340  -->  00:01:20.390
Mungos, moolah, the wangos,
that's what I was going for.
25

25

00:01:20.390  -->  00:01:22.330
That's what Ben says, wungos, okay?
26

26

00:01:22.330  -->  00:01:24.680
So let's do some of that stuff right now.
27

27

00:01:24.680  -->  00:01:25.756
I'll start off with our text.
28

28

00:01:25.756  -->  00:01:26.449
So you know what?
29

29

00:01:26.449  -->  00:01:27.627
I'm going to make a little bit of space.
30

30

00:01:27.627  -->  00:01:30.217
I want my text to be down
here in the bottom left, so
31

31

00:01:30.217  -->  00:01:33.950
I'm gonna grab my Cactus and my Trophy and
just move them out of the way.
32

32

00:01:33.950  -->  00:01:37.190
I'm gonna give myself a lot of
space down here, this big chunk.
33

33

00:01:37.190  -->  00:01:38.391
Why is my text down there?
34

34

00:01:38.391  -->  00:01:43.060
Well, I'll have the cost of these
defenders right next to the image here.
35

35

00:01:43.060  -->  00:01:45.770
And then I'll have the text here,
so you can see the text.
36

36

00:01:45.770  -->  00:01:48.810
And then you can see how much it cost
without having to look up to there to see
37

37

00:01:48.810  -->  00:01:52.923
how many resources you've got, then back
down there to see how much it costs.
38

38

00:01:52.923  -->  00:01:56.190
Okay, so that's looking pretty good.
39

39

00:01:56.190  -->  00:01:59.789
Now let us start by clicking,
40

40

00:01:59.789  -->  00:02:02.300
or just do it anywhere in
the hierarchy to make a point.
41

41

00:02:02.300  -->  00:02:07.790
So right-click to UI,
and then to add Text.
42

42

00:02:07.790  -->  00:02:09.750
Now it's gonna put it
underneath the canvas.
43

43

00:02:09.750  -->  00:02:13.172
It's a UI element and UI elements
need to be underneath the canvas.
44

44

00:02:13.172  -->  00:02:18.070
I'm gonna delete my old things that I'm
not using from my Canvas while I'm here.
45

45

00:02:18.070  -->  00:02:19.570
That will break the prefab.
46

46

00:02:19.570  -->  00:02:20.930
No problem, click Apply.
47

47

00:02:20.930  -->  00:02:24.840
That will re-unbreak,
[LAUGH] fix the prefab.
48

48

00:02:24.840  -->  00:02:26.330
That's the word I'm after.
49

49

00:02:26.330  -->  00:02:31.378
Now I'm gonna click on Text,
change this to StarsText.
50

50

00:02:31.378  -->  00:02:32.137
StarText?
51

51

00:02:32.137  -->  00:02:36.340
StarsText I think, because it's
gonna show how many stars I have.
52

52

00:02:36.340  -->  00:02:39.450
And then drag that roughly
down to where I want it to be.
53

53

00:02:39.450  -->  00:02:42.829
Increase it in size so
we can see what it is we're working with.
54

54

00:02:42.829  -->  00:02:45.467
50, and where is it in order?
55

55

00:02:45.467  -->  00:02:49.107
If I drag over to there, okay,
it might be I made it 50.
56

56

00:02:49.107  -->  00:02:52.958
But I need create, sorry, I need to
change, so I click on my T tool, and
57

57

00:02:52.958  -->  00:02:56.300
actually give myself some
space in here to see it.
58

58

00:02:56.300  -->  00:03:00.020
If you've got your text box too small,
then no matter what you do,
59

59

00:03:00.020  -->  00:03:03.790
you won't be able to see that text because
it thinks it's too big to fit in the box.
60

60

00:03:03.790  -->  00:03:08.910
Okay, we're gonna change this to 999 to
show we're gonna have up to 999 resources,
61

61

00:03:08.910  -->  00:03:12.640
change the color to be
some sort of yellow.
62

62

00:03:12.640  -->  00:03:16.670
And it was all yellow, seventh time
I've made that joke in this course.
63

63

00:03:16.670  -->  00:03:17.960
I'm gonna keep doing it.
64

64

00:03:17.960  -->  00:03:21.980
Okay, if you're not sure,
it's a reference to a Coldplay song.
65

65

00:03:21.980  -->  00:03:23.999
Now we've got 999.
66

66

00:03:23.999  -->  00:03:25.340
The font's looking a little bit crummy.
67

67

00:03:25.340  -->  00:03:28.980
I don't like the font that I've got at
the moment for this particular moment, so
68

68

00:03:28.980  -->  00:03:32.285
I've gone and grabbed myself from DaFont,
the wonderful DaFont,
69

69

00:03:32.285  -->  00:03:34.290
I've grabbed myself the Garden font.
70

70

00:03:34.290  -->  00:03:36.238
So if you wanna use that, you can as well.
71

71

00:03:36.238  -->  00:03:39.030
I'm not gonna provide it to
you because I don't own it, so
72

72

00:03:39.030  -->  00:03:41.550
I'm gonna let you go get it yourself.
73

73

00:03:41.550  -->  00:03:43.330
Drag that on over.
74

74

00:03:43.330  -->  00:03:48.490
Now we have Garden and then, so I just
drag that from my, where I downloaded it.
75

75

00:03:48.490  -->  00:03:50.550
There it is, sneaky off-screen download.
76

76

00:03:50.550  -->  00:03:51.370
Dragged it in.
77

77

00:03:51.370  -->  00:03:56.545
Now I'm gonna drag the Garden font over on
top of my Font where it says Character and
78

78

00:03:56.545  -->  00:03:58.660
Font over in my inspector.
79

79

00:03:58.660  -->  00:03:59.770
And now it has changed it.
80

80

00:03:59.770  -->  00:04:00.510
It's way too small.
81

81

00:04:00.510  -->  00:04:02.090
Let's make it 100 to see how that goes.
82

82

00:04:02.090  -->  00:04:03.286
That's pretty good.
83

83

00:04:03.286  -->  00:04:06.245
And change the font style
from Normal to Bold, and
84

84

00:04:06.245  -->  00:04:08.365
probably even have it a bit bigger.
85

85

00:04:08.365  -->  00:04:12.550
120, there we go it's looking good,
looking fancy.
86

86

00:04:12.550  -->  00:04:14.170
Now we need a way to change our font,
87

87

00:04:14.170  -->  00:04:17.396
so let us create a script
in my script folder.
88

88

00:04:17.396  -->  00:04:20.340
Right-click, Create C# Script.
89

89

00:04:20.340  -->  00:04:24.395
We will call this StarDisplay.
90

90

00:04:25.440  -->  00:04:26.100
I'm having trouble saying it.
91

91

00:04:26.100  -->  00:04:27.330
StarDisplay.
92

92

00:04:27.330  -->  00:04:31.870
You could call it StarsDisplay if you
wanted, but I'll call it StarDisplay.
93

93

00:04:31.870  -->  00:04:37.178
And then while I'm here I'm going to
drag that over the top of my StarText
94

94

00:04:37.178  -->  00:04:43.292
once it finishes compiling and creating,
and drag that over the top of StarsText.
95

95

00:04:43.292  -->  00:04:45.365
You know what?
If I'm calling it StarDisplay,
96

96

00:04:45.365  -->  00:04:48.710
then I should probably call it StarText,
shouldn't I?
97

97

00:04:48.710  -->  00:04:52.644
We'll just use Star singular always from
now on so we don't get confused, or so
98

98

00:04:52.644  -->  00:04:55.360
I don't get confused, I know you won't.
99

99

00:04:55.360  -->  00:04:58.460
You're far cleverer than I am
at these things, I imagine.
100

100

00:04:58.460  -->  00:05:01.170
Okay, so here we have StarDisplay.
101

101

00:05:01.170  -->  00:05:02.950
Now what do we need to
be doing in StarDisplay?
102

102

00:05:02.950  -->  00:05:07.480
First of all, we need to give
the player some starting Stars.
103

103

00:05:07.480  -->  00:05:09.208
I'm gonna get rid of my comment for Start.
104

104

00:05:09.208  -->  00:05:10.350
I'm gonna get rid my Update.
105

105

00:05:10.350  -->  00:05:13.499
We won't be doing anything on
every frame in this script.
106

106

00:05:13.499  -->  00:05:19.847
And we will start by serializing,
so SerializedField int stars.
107

107

00:05:19.847  -->  00:05:21.644
And we'll give the player, what should we?
108

108

00:05:21.644  -->  00:05:25.420
We'll be generous,
we'll say 100 at the start, 100 stars.
109

109

00:05:26.480  -->  00:05:30.680
Next, because we're gonna be accessing the
text component quite a bit in this script,
110

110

00:05:30.680  -->  00:05:32.870
we want to get ourselves a handle to that,
so
111

111

00:05:32.870  -->  00:05:35.725
we'll create a variable
that is of type Text.
112

112

00:05:35.725  -->  00:05:39.420
Whoops, you see my auto-complete
there didn't know what text was?
113

113

00:05:39.420  -->  00:05:41.500
So that means, what does that mean?
114

114

00:05:41.500  -->  00:05:42.050
I'll give you a hint.
115

115

00:05:42.050  -->  00:05:45.240
When I was moving my mouse up
to the top of my script it means
116

116

00:05:45.240  -->  00:05:47.420
we are not accessing the namespace.
117

117

00:05:47.420  -->  00:05:52.564
So we need to access using UnityEngine.UI.
118

118

00:05:52.564  -->  00:05:55.630
Now Text bump,
that knows what it is, excellent.
119

119

00:05:55.630  -->  00:06:01.072
Text, and we'll call this starText;.
120

120

00:06:01.072  -->  00:06:06.990
Now within Start, what do we need
to do to access the component text?
121

121

00:06:06.990  -->  00:06:13.043
We need to say, well, we'll say starText
122

122

00:06:13.043  -->  00:06:19.104
= GetComponent of type &lt;Text&gt; ();.
123

123

00:06:19.104  -->  00:06:22.390
Just a reminder, I know that we've done
this just a bunch of times already, but
124

124

00:06:22.390  -->  00:06:24.565
just to be superdy-duperdy clear,
is that a word?
125

125

00:06:24.565  -->  00:06:25.945
I don't think so.
126

126

00:06:25.945  -->  00:06:29.490
Super-duper clear is what I meant, and
then nonsense came out of my mouth.
127

127

00:06:29.490  -->  00:06:34.310
Here we go, so in starText we have,
this is the text component just here.
128

128

00:06:34.310  -->  00:06:36.040
And just to confuse all of us,
129

129

00:06:36.040  -->  00:06:39.120
the text component has a text
field just underneath it.
130

130

00:06:39.120  -->  00:06:43.630
Currently our text field is
999 within the text component,
131

131

00:06:43.630  -->  00:06:46.840
which is within a game object
that we have called starText.
132

132

00:06:46.840  -->  00:06:50.360
I could just call that Text [LAUGH] so
that we could relive the fond memories of
133

133

00:06:50.360  -->  00:06:53.900
having text.text.text,
but no, I won't do that.
134

134

00:06:53.900  -->  00:06:54.630
Next what do we wanna do?
135

135

00:06:54.630  -->  00:06:59.090
Well, let's create ourselves
a method to update the display.
136

136

00:06:59.090  -->  00:07:03.600
Let's go down here a bit and
then it will be a private method,
137

137

00:07:03.600  -->  00:07:07.980
private void, and
we'll call it UpdateDisplay.
138

138

00:07:07.980  -->  00:07:10.290
Call a horse a horse, is that the saying?
139

139

00:07:10.290  -->  00:07:11.760
Call an apple an apple.
140

140

00:07:11.760  -->  00:07:16.520
Okay, and then within UpdateDisplay
we need to be converting our
141

141

00:07:16.520  -->  00:07:21.800
integer into our text, and
we do that using two string.
142

142

00:07:21.800  -->  00:07:25.030
And this line just here is a challenge
that I'm gonna give to you,
143

143

00:07:25.030  -->  00:07:27.630
is to display our current star amount.
144

144

00:07:27.630  -->  00:07:31.570
Use ToString() to display the star amount.
145

145

00:07:31.570  -->  00:07:33.160
So give that your best shot.
146

146

00:07:33.160  -->  00:07:35.829
You might need to go back to have
a look at some of our old work just to
147

147

00:07:35.829  -->  00:07:37.642
jog your memory, or you might remember it.
148

148

00:07:37.642  -->  00:07:40.581
But jump in, take on that challenge,
see you back here when you're done.
149

149

00:07:43.298  -->  00:07:49.880
Okay, well, what we wanna be
doing is turning this into that.
150

150

00:07:49.880  -->  00:07:54.040
Or written the other way around, we want
this to become the value of that, so
151

151

00:07:54.040  -->  00:07:55.350
we write that this way.
152

152

00:07:55.350  -->  00:08:02.613
We say starText.text, that's the field
we were talking about before,
153

153

00:08:02.613  -->  00:08:06.850
is assigned, becomes stars.ToString.
154

154

00:08:06.850  -->  00:08:11.610
Needs to be ToString because our string
here doesn't know what it means to be
155

155

00:08:11.610  -->  00:08:12.840
passed in this int.
156

156

00:08:12.840  -->  00:08:16.760
So we need to say, whatever this is,
literally turn it into a string so
157

157

00:08:16.760  -->  00:08:18.840
that the player can read that as a string.
158

158

00:08:18.840  -->  00:08:19.930
Okay, we'll save that up.
159

159

00:08:19.930  -->  00:08:21.560
That's looking pretty sharp so far.
160

160

00:08:21.560  -->  00:08:22.620
Let's click on,
161

161

00:08:22.620  -->  00:08:26.130
actually before we do that, there's
one last step we need to do in here.
162

162

00:08:26.130  -->  00:08:29.500
So we've created our
method of UpdateDisplay.
163

163

00:08:29.500  -->  00:08:31.565
What do we need to do in here for
this to work?
164

164

00:08:33.518  -->  00:08:36.100
Okay, that was me pausing for
you to yell it out at the screen.
165

165

00:08:36.100  -->  00:08:38.340
What we need to do is call the method.
166

166

00:08:38.340  -->  00:08:44.573
So in here we'll call UpdateDisplay();.
167

167

00:08:44.573  -->  00:08:46.930
Back over into Unity, all going to plan.
168

168

00:08:46.930  -->  00:08:52.337
Our magic 999 should transform into 100.
169

169

00:08:54.305  -->  00:08:55.880
And that it does, excellent.
170

170

00:08:55.880  -->  00:09:00.770
Okay, first part is a success, we've got
our first part of our resources system.
171

171

00:09:00.770  -->  00:09:01.920
Next, what do we need to do?
172

172

00:09:01.920  -->  00:09:04.150
Back over to my slide over here.
173

173

00:09:04.150  -->  00:09:08.910
We need to display and then create our two
public methods, so we can be spending and
174

174

00:09:08.910  -->  00:09:11.340
we can be building up stars.
175

175

00:09:11.340  -->  00:09:13.825
So first of all, let's do the AddStars so
176

176

00:09:13.825  -->  00:09:18.163
that we can attach that to our trophy
which will be generating new stars.
177

177

00:09:18.163  -->  00:09:22.280
And we'll create a public method, so
public void, we'll call it AddStars.
178

178

00:09:22.280  -->  00:09:24.180
It's public so other things can call it.
179

179

00:09:24.180  -->  00:09:26.724
And we need to know how many stars to add.
180

180

00:09:26.724  -->  00:09:29.260
That will be the responsibility
of something else.
181

181

00:09:29.260  -->  00:09:32.940
When it generates stars we need to know,
how many stars would you like me to add?
182

182

00:09:32.940  -->  00:09:36.200
So we will create
a parameter which is an int.
183

183

00:09:36.200  -->  00:09:38.410
And we will say we need an amount.
184

184

00:09:38.410  -->  00:09:40.653
And then what are we going
to do with the amount?
185

185

00:09:40.653  -->  00:09:45.180
Well, first of all we know that we have
a certain amount in the bank already.
186

186

00:09:45.180  -->  00:09:46.700
We have stars amount.
187

187

00:09:46.700  -->  00:09:48.030
I'll say stars.
188

188

00:09:48.030  -->  00:09:49.890
And then, how do we finish this?
189

189

00:09:49.890  -->  00:09:54.017
What do we need to do to
increase our number of stars when
190

190

00:09:54.017  -->  00:09:56.187
something calls AddStars?
191

191

00:09:56.187  -->  00:10:01.335
We write, that was me pausing again for
you to do it,
192

192

00:10:01.335  -->  00:10:05.553
we write +=, not +-, += amount;.
193

193

00:10:05.553  -->  00:10:10.240
And then what's the final step we need to
do so that we can see this on the screen?
194

194

00:10:10.240  -->  00:10:12.130
What do we need to do to
see this on the screen?
195

195

00:10:12.130  -->  00:10:14.615
We need to call UpdateDisplay.
196

196

00:10:14.615  -->  00:10:18.426
Our nice little method we've made there
that says each time something happens we
197

197

00:10:18.426  -->  00:10:21.470
will update the number of stars
that the player sees on the screen.
198

198

00:10:21.470  -->  00:10:23.905
Okay, so that's adding stars, excellent.
199

199

00:10:23.905  -->  00:10:26.525
Now we need a mechanism for
spending stars.
200

200

00:10:26.525  -->  00:10:28.303
So little mini-challenge for you as well.
201

201

00:10:28.303  -->  00:10:32.723
It's pretty much exactly the same as
this but with one detail change, so
202

202

00:10:32.723  -->  00:10:36.134
go ahead and create a public method for
spending stars.
203

203

00:10:38.449  -->  00:10:40.320
Okay, hopefully you paused and
gave that a shot.
204

204

00:10:40.320  -->  00:10:46.370
I'm gonna copy and then paste,
public void, this will be SpendStars.
205

205

00:10:46.370  -->  00:10:49.060
Again, we need an amount to be passed in.
206

206

00:10:49.060  -->  00:10:53.766
And then we're going to
create stars -= amount.
207

207

00:10:53.766  -->  00:10:57.380
The number of stars you have,
minus the amount we've been asking for
208

208

00:10:57.380  -->  00:10:59.270
that we've been passing in.
209

209

00:10:59.270  -->  00:11:00.570
And then update the display.
210

210

00:11:00.570  -->  00:11:05.399
Now the one final step I'll do in
here just to make sure that we can't
211

211

00:11:05.399  -->  00:11:09.719
accidentally spend more than
we have is to say, if, again,
212

212

00:11:09.719  -->  00:11:12.118
back over to you for a challenge.
213

213

00:11:12.118  -->  00:11:13.990
This is a good challenge one, isn't it?
214

214

00:11:13.990  -->  00:11:17.700
What do we need to say in here to
make sure that the player only
215

215

00:11:17.700  -->  00:11:22.030
is decreasing the amount of stars,
if it is the right circumstances?
216

216

00:11:22.030  -->  00:11:24.120
So, if something, then do this.
217

217

00:11:24.120  -->  00:11:29.550
If what?
if the (stars &gt;= amount)
218

218

00:11:29.550  -->  00:11:35.450
being passed in, then we will do all this.
219

219

00:11:35.450  -->  00:11:37.094
So then stars.
220

220

00:11:37.094  -->  00:11:40.407
[SOUND] Bit of tidy up.
221

221

00:11:40.407  -->  00:11:43.101
So I just need to wrap our, there we go,
222

222

00:11:43.101  -->  00:11:46.712
wrap our code block and
then get rid of that last one.
223

223

00:11:46.712  -->  00:11:48.942
Check that it all lines up.
224

224

00:11:48.942  -->  00:11:50.978
Okay, it doesn't.
225

225

00:11:50.978  -->  00:11:53.960
Okay, so [LAUGH] just playing
around with my curly braces there.
226

226

00:11:53.960  -->  00:11:56.895
So curly brace, and
then if stars is greater than or
227

227

00:11:56.895  -->  00:12:00.440
= to the amount we've passed in,
then we've got our code block.
228

228

00:12:01.620  -->  00:12:05.180
And then curly brace to end our
code block under the SpendStars,
229

229

00:12:05.180  -->  00:12:10.220
and then curly brace at the very end
to end our class, our entire script.
230

230

00:12:10.220  -->  00:12:11.450
Okay, save all this up.
231

231

00:12:11.450  -->  00:12:12.630
We're not gonna use these at the moment.
232

232

00:12:12.630  -->  00:12:14.978
This will be the subject for
the next video or two.
233

233

00:12:14.978  -->  00:12:18.306
So this is a pretty cool little system
that you could use over and over for
234

234

00:12:18.306  -->  00:12:21.081
a lot of different types of games,
and you could retrofit or
235

235

00:12:21.081  -->  00:12:24.100
you could add this game design
mechanism to a lot of other games.
236

236

00:12:24.100  -->  00:12:26.630
You could add this somewhere
to Block Breaker, for example.
237

237

00:12:26.630  -->  00:12:29.125
You could add this somewhere to
Laser Defender, for example.
238

238

00:12:29.125  -->  00:12:33.870
So there's some reusability of this code
is all I wanted to mention at this point.
239

239

00:12:33.870  -->  00:12:36.970
So great stuff, we've now created
ourselves a foundation for
240

240

00:12:36.970  -->  00:12:37.830
our resource system.
241

241

00:12:37.830  -->  00:12:39.490
I'll see you in the next video.
