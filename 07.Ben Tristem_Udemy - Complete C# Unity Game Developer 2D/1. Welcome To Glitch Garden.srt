00:00:04,121  -->  00:00:08,298
Welcome to the next section of the course,
this section's called Glitch Garden,
3

3

00:00:08,298  -->  00:00:12,295
it's based upon an old well-known game
called Plants vs Zombies which is a lane
4

4

00:00:12,295  -->  00:00:13,682
based tower defense game.
5

5

00:00:13,682  -->  00:00:17,926
I wanna show you a little bit of my
prototype that I've been working on and
6

6

00:00:17,926  -->  00:00:21,056
tidying up and
putting a little bit more love into, so
7

7

00:00:21,056  -->  00:00:23,790
that you can see what
we're working towards.
8

8

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:27,365
Here's our prototype, and if I click on
Play, I'll show you the core gameplay.
9

9

00:00:27,365  -->  00:00:33,031
We have attackers that are coming in from
the right in their particular lanes.
10

10

00:00:33,031  -->  00:00:37,333
We can place down defenders, like these
cactuses, they shoot, they also block.
11

11

00:00:37,333  -->  00:00:40,276
This grave stone blocks
attackers when they come in.
12

12

00:00:40,276  -->  00:00:42,213
We've got foxes and we've got the lizards.
13

13

00:00:42,213  -->  00:00:47,737
We can also place down our, what is this,
the Star thing that generate stars and
14

14

00:00:47,737  -->  00:00:51,129
increases our amount of
resources that we have.
15

15

00:00:51,129  -->  00:00:54,815
I can see I've got an error, so
my prototype's not quite finished here,
16

16

00:00:54,815  -->  00:00:56,790
ignore the error for now, if you will.
17

17

00:00:56,790  -->  00:00:59,014
I'm wanna show you a couple of
things that we'll be digging into.
18

18

00:00:59,014  -->  00:01:01,477
We'll be spending a bunch
of time in the animator,
19

19

00:01:01,477  -->  00:01:04,181
getting you familiarized
with how the animator works.
20

20

00:01:04,181  -->  00:01:08,210
We'll be looking at animations,
let me find an animation to show you.
21

21

00:01:08,210  -->  00:01:11,597
So from the fox, the fox has say,
a walk animation.
22

22

00:01:11,597  -->  00:01:15,550
And what is very interesting that's
gonna be a little different is within
23

23

00:01:15,550  -->  00:01:19,453
the animation itself, we're gonna
be adding these animation events.
24

24

00:01:19,453  -->  00:01:23,715
And that is where when we get to this
particular frame in the animation,
25

25

00:01:23,715  -->  00:01:25,858
it will call particular function.
26

26

00:01:25,858  -->  00:01:26,958
This function has no name.
27

27

00:01:26,958  -->  00:01:28,613
The first one's probably
a bit more relevant.
28

28

00:01:28,613  -->  00:01:31,877
Set speed, so at that point at
the start of this animation,
29

29

00:01:31,877  -->  00:01:33,459
it's gonna call set speed.
30

30

00:01:33,459  -->  00:01:34,637
So that's really cool.
31

31

00:01:34,637  -->  00:01:37,555
That's a very interesting
different way for artists or
32

32

00:01:37,555  -->  00:01:41,413
specifically for animators,
to be controlling things within the game.
33

33

00:01:41,413  -->  00:01:43,845
Specifically, if you
had a fighting game and
34

34

00:01:43,845  -->  00:01:48,133
you wanted to say that at the moment the
player goes just there, that's where we
35

35

00:01:48,133  -->  00:01:52,686
wanna trigger the particle effects should
trigger the damage should appear, etc.
36

36

00:01:52,686  -->  00:01:55,313
So rather than just saying the very
moment of starting the swing,
37

37

00:01:55,313  -->  00:01:56,376
all those things happen.
38

38

00:01:56,376  -->  00:02:00,418
We wanna say the precise moment, so this
will be interesting for those of you that
39

39

00:02:00,418  -->  00:02:04,470
wanna dig a little bit deeper into how
that specific timing of things could work.
40

40

00:02:04,470  -->  00:02:06,524
Okay, what else have we got in
here that I wanna show you?
41

41

00:02:06,524  -->  00:02:10,782
So I've got my spawners, the spawners
we can choose how many different things
42

42

00:02:10,782  -->  00:02:14,844
to spawn, so we can spawn just the fox,
we can change this array to two, and
43

43

00:02:14,844  -->  00:02:19,126
then we can spawn foxes and lizards,
for example, from, where is my lizard?
44

44

00:02:19,126  -->  00:02:21,224
There it is, from that particular lane.
45

45

00:02:21,224  -->  00:02:25,124
So there's some changes we can do there,
and on my error down at the bottom there,
46

46

00:02:25,124  -->  00:02:28,007
that's just me still working
on my prototype, not having it
47

47

00:02:28,007  -->  00:02:31,590
exactly buttoned up just yet, but
look at that, the error has been fixed.
48

48

00:02:31,590  -->  00:02:34,609
[LAUGH] Okay, so no,
the error hasn't been fixed.
49

49

00:02:34,609  -->  00:02:35,224
I just cleared it.
50

50

00:02:35,224  -->  00:02:38,579
That was just me cheating, but I promise
you when we go through the course,
51

51

00:02:38,579  -->  00:02:41,790
we'll fix up all those particular things,
little things that pop up.
52

52

00:02:41,790  -->  00:02:45,367
And this section is gonna be a little bit
more challenging, a little bit deeper.
53

53

00:02:45,367  -->  00:02:47,457
It is building upon our spiral syllabus,
so
54

54

00:02:47,457  -->  00:02:51,183
a lot of the things that we've covered
before, we'll be covering again, and
55

55

00:02:51,183  -->  00:02:54,964
getting a little bit more complexity to
them, and getting you to be getting a bit
56

56

00:02:54,964  -->  00:02:58,206
more hands on with how we create it,
but I wanna focus on animation.
57

57

00:02:58,206  -->  00:03:02,409
I wanna focus on the core things that make
2D games really amazing, so let's jump in,
58

58

00:03:02,409  -->  00:03:05,346
talk a little bit more about
the design in the next video, and
59

59

00:03:05,346  -->  00:03:07,433
then get our hands dirty making this game.
