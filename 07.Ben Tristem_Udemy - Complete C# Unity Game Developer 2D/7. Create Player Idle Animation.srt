[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,023  -->  00:00:08,270
Welcome, in this video, we're gonna be
creating some animation for our character.
3

3

00:00:08,270  -->  00:00:10,000
Just an initial idle animation,
4

4

00:00:10,000  -->  00:00:13,030
setting up our animator controller,
creating a player.
5

5

00:00:13,030  -->  00:00:14,560
And adding the components to the player,
6

6

00:00:14,560  -->  00:00:17,480
so that we can visualize
this on the screen.
7

7

00:00:17,480  -->  00:00:19,210
First of all I'm gonna do
a little bit of tidy up.
8

8

00:00:19,210  -->  00:00:21,810
I've clicked on my eraser
in tile palate here.
9

9

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:25,010
And I'm going to just tidy up
the platforms when I was messing around
10

10

00:00:25,010  -->  00:00:26,430
with my rule tiles.
11

11

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:29,190
In terms of the palate over here
we're calling it manual tiles.
12

12

00:00:29,190  -->  00:00:33,710
I'm just gonna update the name
of that to be main palate.
13

13

00:00:33,710  -->  00:00:36,160
Given that we'll probably
only have one and
14

14

00:00:36,160  -->  00:00:39,160
you can see it updates
there on the palette, cool.
15

15

00:00:39,160  -->  00:00:43,070
Now, the first step in getting our
character animate, we need a player.
16

16

00:00:43,070  -->  00:00:46,570
So, right click,
create empty over in our hierarchy,
17

17

00:00:46,570  -->  00:00:48,640
I'm going to rename this player.
18

18

00:00:48,640  -->  00:00:51,630
It's always exciting when you put the
player into your game for the first time.
19

19

00:00:51,630  -->  00:00:54,500
There's nothing there yet, but
we now officially have a player.
20

20

00:00:54,500  -->  00:00:57,650
Right click Reset, transform as we do.
21

21

00:00:57,650  -->  00:01:00,800
Okay, so we've got our player,
you'll also need for this video, for
22

22

00:01:00,800  -->  00:01:02,850
this lecture, your Animator window.
23

23

00:01:02,850  -->  00:01:06,770
So go to Window and find Animator,
I've placed mine down the bottom here,
24

24

00:01:06,770  -->  00:01:08,590
I'm just gonna give it
a little bit of resizing.
25

25

00:01:08,590  -->  00:01:12,210
Not gonna be doing Tile Palette stuff so
we could probably close that.
26

26

00:01:12,210  -->  00:01:16,400
But for now I'm going to, I'm gonna
drag this down next to the Animator,
27

27

00:01:16,400  -->  00:01:18,030
just out of the way.
28

28

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:21,060
So we go to our Animator
here in our scene.
29

29

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:24,290
Okay, so now that we have our player,
we need to add a few components.
30

30

00:01:24,290  -->  00:01:27,130
And I want to explain a little bit of
the terminology we'll be using in this
31

31

00:01:27,130  -->  00:01:29,160
lecture, if you're not
familiar with animation and
32

32

00:01:29,160  -->  00:01:32,030
not familiar with 2D animation
in particular, in Unity.
33

33

00:01:32,030  -->  00:01:33,560
So here's some terminology.
34

34

00:01:33,560  -->  00:01:36,680
We have the Animator Component
we'll be adding to the player.
35

35

00:01:36,680  -->  00:01:42,280
This assigns animations to the game
object through an Animator Controller.
36

36

00:01:42,280  -->  00:01:46,150
The Animator Controller is an arrangement
of animations and transitions and
37

37

00:01:46,150  -->  00:01:48,260
we can think of this as a state machine.
38

38

00:01:48,260  -->  00:01:52,500
And then we have our Animation files.
39

39

00:01:52,500  -->  00:01:56,160
Our animation assets,
which are specific pieces of motion.
40

40

00:01:56,160  -->  00:02:00,920
And then, we have the Sprite Renderer that
we will need to add to our player and
41

41

00:02:00,920  -->  00:02:05,250
anything that we want to display
on the screen as a 2D sprite.
42

42

00:02:05,250  -->  00:02:07,060
I have an early challenge for you,
43

43

00:02:07,060  -->  00:02:09,750
particularly if you've been
through this process before.
44

44

00:02:09,750  -->  00:02:12,830
Here's the challenge,
to set up your character's idle.
45

45

00:02:12,830  -->  00:02:16,250
So, if you've done this process before,
maybe in one of our other Unity courses.
46

46

00:02:16,250  -->  00:02:19,790
Might be a good chance to flex your
muscles and dig back in to the memory
47

47

00:02:19,790  -->  00:02:23,600
bank, to see if you can remember how
to go about setting up this process.
48

48

00:02:23,600  -->  00:02:25,070
I've created assets for
49

49

00:02:25,070  -->  00:02:29,360
you, so I've given you a spritesheet
against this lecture of a character.
50

50

00:02:29,360  -->  00:02:33,510
So grab the spritesheet, slice them up,
add the sprite renderer to the player,
51

51

00:02:33,510  -->  00:02:39,180
create an idle animation clip Create
the Character Animator Controller.
52

52

00:02:39,180  -->  00:02:45,670
Add the idle animation to the Animator
Controller and add Animator to Player.
53

53

00:02:46,760  -->  00:02:49,880
Finally assign
Character Animator Controller to Player.
54

54

00:02:49,880  -->  00:02:53,200
So if you're looking at that and
none of that makes sense no problem,
55

55

00:02:53,200  -->  00:02:55,710
we're about to go through
that in this lecture.
56

56

00:02:55,710  -->  00:02:58,830
Just wanted to give those of you who
are familiar with this already a chance to
57

57

00:02:58,830  -->  00:03:01,510
jump in and flex your muscles and
to get that done.
58

58

00:03:01,510  -->  00:03:03,790
So, let's do this together now.
59

59

00:03:03,790  -->  00:03:07,090
First step in here, I am going to
add my components to the player.
60

60

00:03:07,090  -->  00:03:09,610
We'll add an animator component.
61

61

00:03:09,610  -->  00:03:11,300
Animator, there we go in there.
62

62

00:03:11,300  -->  00:03:14,220
At the moment, you can see
the controller there is none and
63

63

00:03:14,220  -->  00:03:17,500
we want to create ourselves
an animator controller.
64

64

00:03:17,500  -->  00:03:21,750
I'm going to actually jump over in
my assets and make a new folder.
65

65

00:03:21,750  -->  00:03:25,230
Give myself a little bit more space
over here so I can see it all.
66

66

00:03:25,230  -->  00:03:27,760
A new folder I will call animations.
67

67

00:03:29,780  -->  00:03:32,910
And I'll put all thing
animations in there.
68

68

00:03:32,910  -->  00:03:36,834
Animations, the first, though,
is if we click into there,
69

69

00:03:36,834  -->  00:03:40,539
we will right-click and
create an animator controller.
70

70

00:03:40,539  -->  00:03:44,080
We'll call that animator
controller Player.
71

71

00:03:44,080  -->  00:03:44,940
And then you can see,
72

72

00:03:44,940  -->  00:03:48,910
in our animator window, which is
displaying our animator controller.
73

73

00:03:48,910  -->  00:03:51,480
That we have a couple of states in here.
74

74

00:03:51,480  -->  00:03:52,720
So, we'll drag exit over here.
75

75

00:03:52,720  -->  00:03:54,270
These are states and basically,
76

76

00:03:54,270  -->  00:03:58,830
a state is a condition that the player
will be in at any point in time.
77

77

00:03:58,830  -->  00:04:03,780
They can only be in one state and
we tell the player
78

78

00:04:03,780  -->  00:04:07,900
that we want them to be in this state, or
in a different state by using transitions.
79

79

00:04:07,900  -->  00:04:10,070
So, that'll become clear in just a moment.
80

80

00:04:10,070  -->  00:04:12,510
The next step is we need
to grab our spritesheet.
81

81

00:04:12,510  -->  00:04:14,740
I've given that to you
against this lecture.
82

82

00:04:14,740  -->  00:04:16,960
And I have created two variations.
83

83

00:04:16,960  -->  00:04:22,960
The default is the character sheet
that came with the asset pack itself.
84

84

00:04:22,960  -->  00:04:23,690
And then I've gone and
85

85

00:04:23,690  -->  00:04:25,650
recolored it a little bit to
make it a little bit different.
86

86

00:04:25,650  -->  00:04:30,050
And I'm gonna use these
sbplayer_ginger for my character.
87

87

00:04:30,050  -->  00:04:35,340
So I drag that into my sprites folder,
so we now have player in there.
88

88

00:04:35,340  -->  00:04:38,680
As we've done before we're gonna
slice that up, click on multiple,
89

89

00:04:38,680  -->  00:04:43,100
convert it to 32 pixels per unit,
hit apply.
90

90

00:04:43,100  -->  00:04:48,360
Jump into the Sprite Editor and click on
Slice, jump over to Grid by Cell Size,
91

91

00:04:48,360  -->  00:04:52,340
same as before, 32 by 32,
a padding of six.
92

92

00:04:52,340  -->  00:04:56,130
Not sure about the offset yet,
let's slice this and see how it looks.
93

93

00:04:56,130  -->  00:05:00,770
That looks like, my goal here is to have
the player's feet right at the bottom
94

94

00:05:00,770  -->  00:05:04,770
of the Sprite selection area.
95

95

00:05:04,770  -->  00:05:06,610
So, that all looks pretty good.
96

96

00:05:06,610  -->  00:05:09,090
The feet are at the bottom,
good and nice and consistent.
97

97

00:05:09,090  -->  00:05:10,400
You can see when we zoom in here,
98

98

00:05:10,400  -->  00:05:15,920
there is a few different assets that the
asset pack creator has provided for us.
99

99

00:05:15,920  -->  00:05:19,490
We're gonna be focused mostly on
the idle and the run, and the climb.
100

100

00:05:19,490  -->  00:05:23,610
We'll slice all of these up for
now, click Apply, okay.
101

101

00:05:23,610  -->  00:05:26,130
Jump back over into our sprite sheet.
102

102

00:05:26,130  -->  00:05:29,620
And I'm going to find the idle animation
that we're doing in this video.
103

103

00:05:29,620  -->  00:05:32,030
So, we can see a little
preview of it over there.
104

104

00:05:32,030  -->  00:05:39,134
If I scroll through, this looks like
the idle from five through to eight,
105

105

00:05:39,134  -->  00:05:43,570
five through to eight is our idle, okay.
106

106

00:05:43,570  -->  00:05:47,600
So I'm going to highlight five,
six, seven, eight.
107

107

00:05:48,700  -->  00:05:51,950
Five six seven eight for
our four frames of idol, and
108

108

00:05:51,950  -->  00:05:55,660
right click, create, animation.
109

109

00:05:57,380  -->  00:05:59,170
Now we use those four frames
to create an animation,
110

110

00:05:59,170  -->  00:06:00,810
we will call this animation Idol.
111

111

00:06:02,090  -->  00:06:03,730
We now have an idle animation.
112

112

00:06:03,730  -->  00:06:07,150
We'll drag that idle animation
into our animations folder, so
113

113

00:06:07,150  -->  00:06:08,080
it's sitting in there.
114

114

00:06:08,080  -->  00:06:10,020
And then from the animation folder,
115

115

00:06:10,020  -->  00:06:12,900
I'm going to drag this into
my animator controller.
116

116

00:06:12,900  -->  00:06:18,680
And then we now have this idle state
that consists of the idle animation.
117

117

00:06:18,680  -->  00:06:22,710
You can see the entry point into this
animation to the animated controller
118

118

00:06:22,710  -->  00:06:24,010
goes immediately into idle.
119

119

00:06:24,010  -->  00:06:27,310
So idle is going to be our
default state in most of this
120

120

00:06:27,310  -->  00:06:28,900
state machine we've got in here.
121

121

00:06:28,900  -->  00:06:29,800
Let's have a look at idle.
122

122

00:06:29,800  -->  00:06:30,550
What's going on here?
123

123

00:06:30,550  -->  00:06:33,280
We can see that we have
the idle animation.
124

124

00:06:33,280  -->  00:06:34,200
See the speed is 1.
125

125

00:06:34,200  -->  00:06:35,780
There's currently no transitions.
126

126

00:06:35,780  -->  00:06:37,720
That's fine.
We don't need transitions yet.
127

127

00:06:37,720  -->  00:06:39,700
But we do need a way to visualize this.
128

128

00:06:39,700  -->  00:06:43,140
At the moment, it's just an orange box,
and that doesn't really help us much.
129

129

00:06:43,140  -->  00:06:45,690
So back over to the player and
130

130

00:06:45,690  -->  00:06:48,500
from the player we need to say
what is the animated controller.
131

131

00:06:48,500  -->  00:06:50,710
Grab this player animated controller.
132

132

00:06:50,710  -->  00:06:54,235
We've got a put in our animations
folder and assign that in there.
133

133

00:06:54,235  -->  00:06:56,765
Or if you're not sure you can click
on this lectern, there's only one at
134

134

00:06:56,765  -->  00:06:59,735
the moment so that makes it pretty
to know what we need to do.
135

135

00:06:59,735  -->  00:07:02,165
So now we have animation on our player but
136

136

00:07:02,165  -->  00:07:04,685
we can't actually see
the player in the scene.
137

137

00:07:04,685  -->  00:07:07,235
What we need to do next is
have a way to see the player.
138

138

00:07:07,235  -->  00:07:08,675
So I'm going to add a component,
139

139

00:07:08,675  -->  00:07:13,470
add sprite renderer, the sprite
renderer allows us to see the player.
140

140

00:07:13,470  -->  00:07:14,870
But there's no sprite on it yet.
141

141

00:07:14,870  -->  00:07:17,323
So we need to give it a default sprite, so
142

142

00:07:17,323  -->  00:07:20,439
we can visualize something
in our scene view here.
143

143

00:07:20,439  -->  00:07:23,200
What I'll do there is click on Select.
144

144

00:07:23,200  -->  00:07:30,210
And just find any of these individual
sprites that represent our player.
145

145

00:07:30,210  -->  00:07:31,530
So I'm just gonna choose this one here.
146

146

00:07:31,530  -->  00:07:33,340
I think it's one of the idles.
147

147

00:07:33,340  -->  00:07:37,420
And now have a visualization we will
drag the player off the slide now.
148

148

00:07:37,420  -->  00:07:40,420
But it's hidden if we drag
it all the way over here.
149

149

00:07:40,420  -->  00:07:42,970
Hey presto there's our
player in the scene but
150

150

00:07:42,970  -->  00:07:44,970
we want the player in
front of the background.
151

151

00:07:44,970  -->  00:07:50,830
So a micro challenge for you, sit up
your player so that your player fits
152

152

00:07:50,830  -->  00:07:55,410
in front of the background but
behind the foreground.
153

153

00:07:55,410  -->  00:07:58,100
So there is a quick micro-challenge,
see if you can do that now.
154

154

00:08:00,040  -->  00:08:02,650
Okay, if you remember back to
when we set up our layers,
155

155

00:08:02,650  -->  00:08:05,670
we have our sorting layers, edit layers.
156

156

00:08:05,670  -->  00:08:08,030
Expand out sorting layers here,
we need to add a new one.
157

157

00:08:08,030  -->  00:08:09,020
We'll call this player.
158

158

00:08:11,140  -->  00:08:12,150
Player layer.
159

159

00:08:12,150  -->  00:08:15,320
And we'll move the player layer in
between background and foreground and
160

160

00:08:15,320  -->  00:08:17,350
then back, click on our player.
161

161

00:08:17,350  -->  00:08:19,450
We need to assign our.
162

162

00:08:19,450  -->  00:08:21,320
Sorting layer here into player.
163

163

00:08:21,320  -->  00:08:24,900
Now the player is in front of the
background doing what it's supposed to do.
164

164

00:08:24,900  -->  00:08:28,490
Let's see if we click
on play what happens.
165

165

00:08:31,350  -->  00:08:33,020
Okay.
Nothing much the player looked like it was
166

166

00:08:33,020  -->  00:08:35,160
starting to do some animation but stopped.
167

167

00:08:35,160  -->  00:08:40,300
And you can see that our idle has
is locked on this blue bar here.
168

168

00:08:40,300  -->  00:08:41,540
Now, there's gonna be a reason for
169

169

00:08:41,540  -->  00:08:44,590
that, which is to do
the looping of our animation.
170

170

00:08:44,590  -->  00:08:47,800
So our animation is played once very
quickly, but we're not seeing it again.
171

171

00:08:47,800  -->  00:08:50,270
So if you click on the animation anim,
172

172

00:08:50,270  -->  00:08:54,720
the .anim down here, file itself,
and then click on Loop Time.
173

173

00:08:54,720  -->  00:08:57,320
Basically that means when
this animation is called or
174

174

00:08:57,320  -->  00:08:59,940
being used,
just keep looping over and over.
175

175

00:08:59,940  -->  00:09:03,350
Let's click play now and
see if that has solve our problem.
176

176

00:09:03,350  -->  00:09:04,330
It has indeed.
177

177

00:09:04,330  -->  00:09:07,180
I'll zoom in a little bit so
you can see there we go.
178

178

00:09:07,180  -->  00:09:10,630
Just sitting on this bouncing,
bouncing which is very cool.
179

179

00:09:10,630  -->  00:09:12,170
And of course we have
nothing else going on.
180

180

00:09:12,170  -->  00:09:13,490
We can't move the character around.
181

181

00:09:13,490  -->  00:09:16,430
We can't transition in and out but
this is the start of play and
182

182

00:09:16,430  -->  00:09:19,750
the start of having our
animation state set up.
183

183

00:09:19,750  -->  00:09:22,710
A reminder of the challenge end
of the steps in this process.
184

184

00:09:22,710  -->  00:09:24,500
If I bounced around,
you weren't following.
185

185

00:09:24,500  -->  00:09:26,060
Spritesheet, slice it up.
186

186

00:09:26,060  -->  00:09:29,200
Add the sprite renderer to the Player so
you can see the sprite.
187

187

00:09:29,200  -->  00:09:31,210
Create an idle animation clip.
188

188

00:09:31,210  -->  00:09:36,110
Create the Character Animator Controller
so that we can tell the states, and
189

189

00:09:36,110  -->  00:09:39,090
we can put in for now the idle state.
190

190

00:09:39,090  -->  00:09:42,000
Add the idle animations to
the Animator Controller which will create
191

191

00:09:42,000  -->  00:09:47,180
the idle state and then add the Animator
to the Player make sure you do that
192

192

00:09:47,180  -->  00:09:50,470
with in the animator
component to the player.
193

193

00:09:50,470  -->  00:09:55,560
And then assign the character animator
controller to the player component.
194

194

00:09:56,840  -->  00:09:59,680
So those are the steps, hopefully
you've done well on that challenge.
195

195

00:09:59,680  -->  00:10:00,900
Here we go, we've got our guy,
196

196

00:10:00,900  -->  00:10:05,430
I affectionately called him Conan
the Librarian, ready to roll.
197

197

00:10:05,430  -->  00:10:07,480
In upcoming videos,
we're gonna make him move around,
198

198

00:10:07,480  -->  00:10:11,260
do a whole bunch more, transitions and
animations and excellent cool stuff.
199

199

00:10:11,260  -->  00:10:13,940
Well done in this video and
I'll see you in an upcoming video.
