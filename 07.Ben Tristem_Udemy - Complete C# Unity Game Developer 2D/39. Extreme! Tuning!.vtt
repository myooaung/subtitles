2

00:00:04.100  -->  00:00:05.592
I'm super excited for this video.
3

3

00:00:05.592  -->  00:00:09.750
But a warning, if you have a phobia
of game design conversations,
4

4

00:00:09.750  -->  00:00:13.010
then you might wanna look away now
cuz we are talking about game design.
5

5

00:00:13.010  -->  00:00:16.290
We're talking about how do you
make your game more engaging,
6

6

00:00:16.290  -->  00:00:18.700
more compelling, more interesting,
for your players.
7

7

00:00:18.700  -->  00:00:21.060
And we're gonna talk about extreme tuning.
8

8

00:00:21.060  -->  00:00:24.740
And you have to say it in that voice
whenever you say it, extreme tuning.
9

9

00:00:24.740  -->  00:00:27.740
And I don't mean chewing,
as in you're gonna chew something.
10

10

00:00:27.740  -->  00:00:29.270
This is my accent.
11

11

00:00:29.270  -->  00:00:32.300
If you are from North America,
you might say tuning.
12

12

00:00:32.300  -->  00:00:35.690
And what I mean is how you tune or
tune your game.
13

13

00:00:35.690  -->  00:00:40.420
And the extreme part is when we look
at our our variables, our parameters,
14

14

00:00:40.420  -->  00:00:41.950
the features we've created.
15

15

00:00:41.950  -->  00:00:45.061
Instead of saying,
let's say I tune it from 1 to 1.2,
16

16

00:00:45.061  -->  00:00:48.744
you tune it from 1 to 10,000
just to see what's gonna happen,
17

17

00:00:48.744  -->  00:00:52.570
because you'll discover things that
you hadn't even thought about.
18

18

00:00:52.570  -->  00:00:55.880
So this is the part of your project
where you've prototyped the features,
19

19

00:00:55.880  -->  00:00:57.940
we've got a really cool
little game in there.
20

20

00:00:57.940  -->  00:01:01.020
The ball's bouncing around, we've got
blocks, we've got our functionality.
21

21

00:01:01.020  -->  00:01:02.990
Now is where you say,
how is this different?
22

22

00:01:02.990  -->  00:01:04.210
How is this special?
23

23

00:01:04.210  -->  00:01:08.620
How is this gonna make my player go, what,
and get really pumped up about the game?
24

24

00:01:08.620  -->  00:01:13.120
And the way we do that is exploring and
experimenting and playing around with it.
25

25

00:01:13.120  -->  00:01:15.500
And always,
when you're looking at your game design,
26

26

00:01:15.500  -->  00:01:20.070
when you look at your prototype, when
you look at your game, always first say,
27

27

00:01:20.070  -->  00:01:23.670
how can I tune what I have differently,
rather than saying,
28

28

00:01:23.670  -->  00:01:26.570
how can I add an extra
feature to make it different.
29

29

00:01:26.570  -->  00:01:30.098
Features take time and hassle and there's
complexity, but tuning you can do straight
30

30

00:01:30.098  -->  00:01:32.960
away and quickly and easily, [SOUND] and
you've got a different game.
31

31

00:01:32.960  -->  00:01:36.395
So let's have a look now at our game and
see what we can experiment with,
32

32

00:01:36.395  -->  00:01:38.912
how we can push it,
how we can be extreme with it, and
33

33

00:01:38.912  -->  00:01:40.930
just what all the different options are.
34

34

00:01:40.930  -->  00:01:44.017
And at the end of the video I'm gonna
challenge you to come up with something
35

35

00:01:44.017  -->  00:01:46.920
crazy and cool and interesting,
no matter how strange it feels like.
36

36

00:01:46.920  -->  00:01:49.244
Just let go of the inhibitions and
37

37

00:01:49.244  -->  00:01:53.650
just welcome the extreme into your life,
is what I'm saying.
38

38

00:01:53.650  -->  00:01:55.890
So let's jump in and
have a look at our game.
39

39

00:01:55.890  -->  00:01:59.890
Okay back in our project, let's have
a look at the process for extreme tuning.
40

40

00:01:59.890  -->  00:02:03.675
What I like to do is look at every single
aspect of my game one piece at a time and
41

41

00:02:03.675  -->  00:02:05.640
say, how could I be extreme with this?
42

42

00:02:05.640  -->  00:02:09.450
So you can look through your hierarchy and
question every part of it.
43

43

00:02:09.450  -->  00:02:12.290
You can look through your game scene,
look through your scripts.
44

44

00:02:12.290  -->  00:02:15.780
Let's start by looking our hierarchy,
level two, every little piece of it.
45

45

00:02:15.780  -->  00:02:18.330
Level two,
let's think about what could be extreme.
46

46

00:02:18.330  -->  00:02:21.990
One extreme we could just have one
level that just goes on and on and on.
47

47

00:02:21.990  -->  00:02:24.420
Another extreme we could
have thousands of levels.
48

48

00:02:24.420  -->  00:02:27.450
Maybe when you hit one block
you go to the next level.
49

49

00:02:27.450  -->  00:02:30.460
So it's all about quickly
bouncing between levels.
50

50

00:02:30.460  -->  00:02:31.960
You could have huge levels.
51

51

00:02:31.960  -->  00:02:33.730
So at the moment, where's our camera?
52

52

00:02:33.730  -->  00:02:38.165
We could have our camera really,
really close, the other way, really close.
53

53

00:02:38.165  -->  00:02:40.780
[LAUGH] Then that's a little bit extreme.
54

54

00:02:40.780  -->  00:02:41.860
I'm not sure if that'd be fun,
55

55

00:02:41.860  -->  00:02:44.390
but maybe the camera could move
with the ball in the future.
56

56

00:02:44.390  -->  00:02:47.450
You could have the camera
all the way out and
57

57

00:02:47.450  -->  00:02:49.520
this tiny little thing on the screen
that you're trying to play.
58

58

00:02:49.520  -->  00:02:51.910
So maybe you have a little
television screen, and
59

59

00:02:51.910  -->  00:02:55.650
you're simulating the fact that it's way
down the end of a tunnel or something.
60

60

00:02:55.650  -->  00:02:58.080
So we can go extreme
with our camera as well.
61

61

00:02:58.080  -->  00:02:59.750
Let me put that back to where it was.
62

62

00:02:59.750  -->  00:03:03.080
You could do that just on that point,
just ideas, brainstorming here.
63

63

00:03:03.080  -->  00:03:09.243
You could have one level, and you could
create another instance of your paddle and
64

64

00:03:09.243  -->  00:03:14.030
another ball and some more blocks and
another background.
65

65

00:03:14.030  -->  00:03:16.270
And you could have copies of your game, so
66

66

00:03:16.270  -->  00:03:20.390
you could have three games side by side,
maybe nine games.
67

67

00:03:20.390  -->  00:03:23.220
So you have to play nine
game simultaneously,
68

68

00:03:23.220  -->  00:03:24.770
try to watch where the ball is going.
69

69

00:03:24.770  -->  00:03:26.803
And that would be crazy interesting,
70

70

00:03:26.803  -->  00:03:29.540
just multiple games going
on at once on that point.
71

71

00:03:29.540  -->  00:03:30.812
So what else have we got?
72

72

00:03:30.812  -->  00:03:34.378
Play space, we could change what
the colliders do, maybe when the ball hits
73

73

00:03:34.378  -->  00:03:37.620
the collider it bounces off really
fast and that gives it a big boost.
74

74

00:03:37.620  -->  00:03:39.910
So you're trying to avoid the colliders.
75

75

00:03:39.910  -->  00:03:41.640
Looking at the level,
what are our hints in here?
76

76

00:03:41.640  -->  00:03:44.140
Breakable blocks,
we don't wanna play around with that.
77

77

00:03:44.140  -->  00:03:47.420
Paddle, well for me this is one
of the things I am gonna tune.
78

78

00:03:47.420  -->  00:03:50.500
We could go extreme by saying let's
make the paddle really skinny.
79

79

00:03:50.500  -->  00:03:54.520
That would be extreme and
difficult, I'd love to see that.
80

80

00:03:54.520  -->  00:03:59.660
For me my idea is to have the paddle
wider, I'm just gonna stretch it.
81

81

00:03:59.660  -->  00:04:02.580
This is a little bit of a clumsy
way to make my paddle wider.
82

82

00:04:02.580  -->  00:04:05.040
But for now I'm gonna have it wider and
see how that feels.
83

83

00:04:05.040  -->  00:04:07.930
For now we're seeing what works, right,
we're just playing around with it.
84

84

00:04:07.930  -->  00:04:10.380
So a massive paddle for the ball.
85

85

00:04:10.380  -->  00:04:11.320
What else is going on with the ball?
86

86

00:04:11.320  -->  00:04:13.890
Well one of the things with the ball
is what's the push that we give it at
87

87

00:04:13.890  -->  00:04:14.660
the start.
88

88

00:04:14.660  -->  00:04:19.080
So the y push here at the moment is 15,
we could turn this up to a 100 and
89

89

00:04:19.080  -->  00:04:21.180
the ball would be going really fast.
90

90

00:04:21.180  -->  00:04:23.290
We could turn it all
the way down to one so
91

91

00:04:23.290  -->  00:04:26.810
the ball is going slow,
maybe it builds up speed overtime.
92

92

00:04:26.810  -->  00:04:29.205
Each time it bounces into something
you give it more velocity,
93

93

00:04:29.205  -->  00:04:30.570
you give it more velocity.
94

94

00:04:30.570  -->  00:04:33.333
Also while we clicked on the ball here,
let's see what else we've got.
95

95

00:04:33.333  -->  00:04:35.097
We've got draggity, draggity, I was
trying to say we've got gravity and drag.
96

96

00:04:35.097  -->  00:04:38.770
We've got gravity and
drag we can play around with,
97

97

00:04:38.770  -->  00:04:41.115
we can change how the ball looks.
98

98

00:04:41.115  -->  00:04:43.600
Maybe it's really, really faint.
99

99

00:04:43.600  -->  00:04:48.380
So remember extremes that you can hardly
even see it, it's very transparent.
100

100

00:04:48.380  -->  00:04:49.590
It's like, where is the ball?
101

101

00:04:49.590  -->  00:04:50.830
It's a ghost ball.
102

102

00:04:50.830  -->  00:04:53.510
Or you could have the ball really huge, so
103

103

00:04:53.510  -->  00:04:56.470
this massive ball bouncing around and
it gets stuck in things.
104

104

00:04:56.470  -->  00:04:58.850
You have the ball tiny,
you could do something.
105

105

00:04:58.850  -->  00:05:03.100
One of my all time favorite things to
do when I'm doing extreme tuning is,
106

106

00:05:03.100  -->  00:05:06.330
what happened if we duplicated and
had a whole bunch of these things?
107

107

00:05:06.330  -->  00:05:10.589
So let's start off with four, five, six.
108

108

00:05:10.589  -->  00:05:13.709
How many should we start off with?
109

109

00:05:13.709  -->  00:05:16.460
I don't know, let's start off with,
duplicate that again.
110

110

00:05:16.460  -->  00:05:18.398
That's probably about ten or
so, and put them up there.
111

111

00:05:18.398  -->  00:05:20.490
Is it gonna work?
112

112

00:05:20.490  -->  00:05:23.170
We might need to tweak our
code a little bit cuz there's,
113

113

00:05:23.170  -->  00:05:26.330
the ball might not be looking
correctly for the paddle.
114

114

00:05:26.330  -->  00:05:27.810
It might not know how to push off, etc.
115

115

00:05:27.810  -->  00:05:31.190
So a little bit of tweaking we need to
do when we're doing our extreme tuning.
116

116

00:05:31.190  -->  00:05:33.630
But for now we're just sort of
grabbing it and playing with it and
117

117

00:05:33.630  -->  00:05:36.150
feeling that joy of messing around.
118

118

00:05:36.150  -->  00:05:37.220
What else could we do in here?
119

119

00:05:37.220  -->  00:05:39.400
We could change the sound effects,
have a lot of sound effects or
120

120

00:05:39.400  -->  00:05:40.430
not a lot of sound effects.
121

121

00:05:40.430  -->  00:05:44.460
We can have them really loud or
really quiet, very distracting.
122

122

00:05:44.460  -->  00:05:47.500
What else?
In game session, what have we got in here?
123

123

00:05:47.500  -->  00:05:48.430
Points per block.
124

124

00:05:48.430  -->  00:05:51.820
Well we could make this
830,000 per block [LAUGH].
125

125

00:05:51.820  -->  00:05:55.260
That extreme,
it doesn't really change the game play but
126

126

00:05:55.260  -->  00:05:56.930
it's kinda weird and interesting.
127

127

00:05:56.930  -->  00:05:59.300
Game speed, here’s one really obvious one.
128

128

00:05:59.300  -->  00:06:01.910
Make it really slow, make it really fast,
129

129

00:06:01.910  -->  00:06:05.990
just by tweaking this one parameter we
can make our game feel a lot different.
130

130

00:06:05.990  -->  00:06:08.360
So for my game, I’ve made the paddle huge,
131

131

00:06:08.360  -->  00:06:13.020
I’ve put in a whole bunch of extra balls,
I’ve increased the game speed.
132

132

00:06:13.020  -->  00:06:17.880
And when we first push off, okay,
on our ball script here we have the push.
133

133

00:06:17.880  -->  00:06:18.550
So we can change it.
134

134

00:06:18.550  -->  00:06:19.750
We have different for different balls.
135

135

00:06:19.750  -->  00:06:21.920
This first ones gonna go off at,
I don't know,
136

136

00:06:21.920  -->  00:06:25.620
50 and this maybe this one goes off at 30.
137

137

00:06:25.620  -->  00:06:27.090
So we change it around a little bit.
138

138

00:06:27.090  -->  00:06:30.470
This one can go off at 100,
see how that goes.
139

139

00:06:30.470  -->  00:06:34.820
And then every now and again, so
I'm going through the approach.
140

140

00:06:34.820  -->  00:06:37.520
How do you go about your extreme tuning?
141

141

00:06:37.520  -->  00:06:38.520
What do you look for?
142

142

00:06:38.520  -->  00:06:40.670
And you look for every last little aspect.
143

143

00:06:40.670  -->  00:06:42.720
Just play this to see how
it’s feeling at the moment.
144

144

00:06:42.720  -->  00:06:46.830
It’s probably gonna feel crazy,
but that is the point.
145

145

00:06:46.830  -->  00:06:49.460
Okay, now see if they all launch.
146

146

00:06:49.460  -->  00:06:51.460
Okay, well that was extreme.
147

147

00:06:51.460  -->  00:06:52.780
Yo, that was really fast.
148

148

00:06:52.780  -->  00:06:55.910
I think I just won the level just
by pushing one button and they,
149

149

00:06:55.910  -->  00:06:58.980
gonna do that again cuz
that was out of control.
150

150

00:07:00.450  -->  00:07:03.270
That was I either won really quickly or
lost.
151

151

00:07:03.270  -->  00:07:06.290
Actually you know what's happening
here is our lose collider,
152

152

00:07:06.290  -->  00:07:09.930
when any the balls touch
the lose collider I lose.
153

153

00:07:09.930  -->  00:07:12.020
So that's another thing that
we could play around with and
154

154

00:07:12.020  -->  00:07:14.540
maybe have that it doesn't work that way.
155

155

00:07:14.540  -->  00:07:18.158
For now I'm just gonna turn off
the lose collider and see if it's fun.
156

156

00:07:18.158  -->  00:07:21.910
Play space, [SOUND] lose collider.
157

157

00:07:21.910  -->  00:07:25.886
Obviously you don't need to be doing
this as you are working through
158

158

00:07:25.886  -->  00:07:27.220
your extreme tuning.
159

159

00:07:27.220  -->  00:07:29.540
Just watch me and
see what I'm coming up with.
160

160

00:07:29.540  -->  00:07:30.960
Let's see, turn off the lose collider.
161

161

00:07:30.960  -->  00:07:32.539
We'll see if this changes how it feels.
162

162

00:07:33.636  -->  00:07:35.160
Okay, nearly got it.
163

163

00:07:35.160  -->  00:07:38.220
You know what?
164

164

00:07:38.220  -->  00:07:39.310
I kind of like that.
165

165

00:07:40.450  -->  00:07:41.920
And boom, look at that,
that was kinda cool.
166

166

00:07:41.920  -->  00:07:46.400
Then we need to have more blocks in there,
maybe blocks with a ton more damage on it.
167

167

00:07:46.400  -->  00:07:50.130
Are whole bunch of these are invincible
blocks so it's really difficult.
168

168

00:07:50.130  -->  00:07:54.500
You've got a lot of firepower, but you've
also got a lot of wall to break through.
169

169

00:07:54.500  -->  00:07:57.200
So this is the philosophy
of extreme tuning.
170

170

00:07:57.200  -->  00:08:01.400
Just experiment,
just have a good time, just be crazy.
171

171

00:08:01.400  -->  00:08:03.860
And this leads me to my challenge.
172

172

00:08:03.860  -->  00:08:06.450
Challenge is extreme to the max, yo.
173

173

00:08:06.450  -->  00:08:10.710
Pick one or more aspect of your game and
push it to the extreme.
174

174

00:08:10.710  -->  00:08:14.830
Create a gif, or gif, depends where
you live, or a short video or
175

175

00:08:14.830  -->  00:08:18.040
a screenshot and share with
the community what you've come up with.
176

176

00:08:18.040  -->  00:08:21.820
Or even just describe what it is that
you're doing, and really give it to it.
177

177

00:08:21.820  -->  00:08:24.300
Really give it a good shot and
let us know what you've come up to.
178

178

00:08:24.300  -->  00:08:25.020
I'd love to see it.
179

179

00:08:25.020  -->  00:08:28.420
You've been so
awesome with sharing up to this point.
180

180

00:08:28.420  -->  00:08:33.440
So jump in, take that on now, take on
that challenge, do something extreme, and
181

181

00:08:33.440  -->  00:08:36.820
when you're done and when you've shared
I will see you in the next video.
