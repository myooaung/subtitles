2

00:00:04.170  -->  00:00:08.276
Welcome again my friend, in this video,
we are going to create three scenes and
3

3

00:00:08.276  -->  00:00:12.566
each of those scenes is going to have a
nice-ish looking button with some nice-ish
4

4

00:00:12.566  -->  00:00:13.382
looking font.
5

5

00:00:13.382  -->  00:00:16.455
I say nice-ish cuz I haven't
spent a ton of time on this.
6

6

00:00:16.455  -->  00:00:20.473
So when we mouse over we get our
highlighted effect and when we click on
7

7

00:00:20.473  -->  00:00:24.927
it, we get click effect and we have each
of those in each of our three scenes.
8

8

00:00:24.927  -->  00:00:26.848
The correct button for the correct scene,
9

9

00:00:26.848  -->  00:00:29.367
set up with that nice text
other in the following video.
10

10

00:00:29.367  -->  00:00:32.596
And we're gonna ready to load our
scenes when we click the button.
11

11

00:00:32.596  -->  00:00:35.562
So let's jump in and
make the buttons and the scenes.
12

12

00:00:35.562  -->  00:00:37.828
We've been playing around
with aspect ratio a bunch,
13

13

00:00:37.828  -->  00:00:41.389
I'm just gonna leave mine at 10AD for now,
I find that makes it look nice and crisp.
14

14

00:00:41.389  -->  00:00:43.699
We're gonna turn our attention to buttons,
15

15

00:00:43.699  -->  00:00:46.687
we have a button already with
some pretty yucky text on it.
16

16

00:00:46.687  -->  00:00:48.851
And we can't really even read, so
let's do something about that.
17

17

00:00:48.851  -->  00:00:51.677
First, I will rename my
button to start button, so
18

18

00:00:51.677  -->  00:00:54.515
I'm very clear this is
what we'll start our game.
19

19

00:00:54.515  -->  00:00:58.524
And change that, actually I'm gonna delete
the text underneath cuz this is created
20

20

00:00:58.524  -->  00:00:59.600
with a standard text.
21

21

00:00:59.600  -->  00:01:03.290
We want to use our TextMesh Pro text
which is much nicer looking text.
22

22

00:01:03.290  -->  00:01:07.507
So I'm going to delete the text game
object child that we had on the start
23

23

00:01:07.507  -->  00:01:09.556
button and jump down to packages.
24

24

00:01:09.556  -->  00:01:12.339
You can see that in
the version of Unity I'm using,
25

25

00:01:12.339  -->  00:01:15.460
we have packages folder
underneath our project window.
26

26

00:01:15.460  -->  00:01:20.304
And I have in there TextMeshPro which
means TextMeshPro is already installed.
27

27

00:01:20.304  -->  00:01:24.267
If you don't see it there you
might need to go up to Window, and
28

28

00:01:24.267  -->  00:01:26.259
open up your Package Manager.
29

29

00:01:26.259  -->  00:01:29.481
Click on All, and
find TextMeshPro from in here.
30

30

00:01:29.481  -->  00:01:32.360
And go about the process through here,
we're installing it,
31

31

00:01:32.360  -->  00:01:34.112
we did that in the previous sections.
32

32

00:01:34.112  -->  00:01:35.677
So I'm not gonna go through that again.
33

33

00:01:35.677  -->  00:01:39.187
Hopefully, you can see TextMeshPro
is packages because it's here.
34

34

00:01:39.187  -->  00:01:41.917
That means that we can start
using it's components and
35

35

00:01:41.917  -->  00:01:43.527
it's elements straight away.
36

36

00:01:43.527  -->  00:01:47.118
So I'm gonna click on Start Button
in our hierarchy right-click.
37

37

00:01:47.118  -->  00:01:51.470
Go to UI and add TextMeshPro-Text.
38

38

00:01:51.470  -->  00:01:54.451
You can see we have TextMeshPro-Text,
edit here,
39

39

00:01:54.451  -->  00:01:56.630
change the name of that to Start Text.
40

40

00:01:56.630  -->  00:02:01.513
And within the text input box and
the inspector, I will change the wording
41

41

00:02:01.513  -->  00:02:05.865
here from button to Start,
that should be written on the button.
42

42

00:02:05.865  -->  00:02:09.998
I will change the color, and color vertex
to something that we can see for now.
43

43

00:02:09.998  -->  00:02:14.570
Not putting too much time in to colors in
this moment, just getting it in there, so
44

44

00:02:14.570  -->  00:02:15.647
that we can see it.
45

45

00:02:15.647  -->  00:02:18.173
And changing the font up to,
I don't know up to size 80.
46

46

00:02:18.173  -->  00:02:19.335
Okay, it's good enough for now.
47

47

00:02:19.335  -->  00:02:22.932
Now we're using just whatever
the standard preset font is.
48

48

00:02:22.932  -->  00:02:27.515
I'm gonna go ahead and grab my own font
and cuz we have a wizardry kind of theme,
49

49

00:02:27.515  -->  00:02:28.985
I'm over dafont.com.
50

50

00:02:28.985  -->  00:02:30.528
And I've searched for wizard,
51

51

00:02:30.528  -->  00:02:33.520
I find a font called Wizardry
which I'm going to install.
52

52

00:02:33.520  -->  00:02:36.213
I'm not providing this font
although it's a 100% free,
53

53

00:02:36.213  -->  00:02:38.761
I don't necessarily have
distribution rights for that.
54

54

00:02:38.761  -->  00:02:41.465
So again, if you want to have
some different font go ahead and
55

55

00:02:41.465  -->  00:02:44.286
find some cool font that you think
is pretty neat from the font.
56

56

00:02:44.286  -->  00:02:47.564
Try to make sure you get something
that's either 100% free or
57

57

00:02:47.564  -->  00:02:52.190
if it's donation where chip ins the money
to the person who has provided it.
58

58

00:02:52.190  -->  00:02:53.820
So I do have that for me.
59

59

00:02:53.820  -->  00:02:56.270
You can just use the font that
is there at the moment and
60

60

00:02:56.270  -->  00:02:57.900
everything will work just fine.
61

61

00:02:57.900  -->  00:02:59.271
I have mine look a little bit prettier.
62

62

00:02:59.271  -->  00:03:02.660
And just to note, I'll just gonna
drag this in which is what we can do.
63

63

00:03:02.660  -->  00:03:05.930
If dragging in is not working for you and
I've seen a couple of questions in
64

64

00:03:05.930  -->  00:03:08.754
the Q&amp;A, how else can we do that
if dragging in doesn't work?
65

65

00:03:08.754  -->  00:03:15.083
We can go in Assets &gt; Import New Asset,
and then find the font file.
66

66

00:03:15.083  -->  00:03:19.053
For me, it's called wizardry, double-click
on that, and that will import our font.
67

67

00:03:19.053  -->  00:03:23.239
Asset file that's a different way
to import things into your game.
68

68

00:03:23.239  -->  00:03:25.581
Okay, and so we have our font here.
69

69

00:03:25.581  -->  00:03:30.255
I'm going to right-click Create folder,
and call this font.
70

70

00:03:30.255  -->  00:03:31.560
Nice to keep things tidy, at the moment.
71

71

00:03:31.560  -->  00:03:35.636
We have small projects, but
good habit to trust me when you have your
72

72

00:03:35.636  -->  00:03:39.940
massive amazing killer games that's
gonna earn you fame and fortune.
73

73

00:03:39.940  -->  00:03:43.711
You wanna have your folders set up cuz
you'll have a lot of content in there.
74

74

00:03:43.711  -->  00:03:46.930
Drag out font into the font folders.
75

75

00:03:46.930  -->  00:03:52.651
Now next step is frost within TextMeshPro,
so it's going to find TextMeshPro Window
76

76

00:03:52.651  -->  00:03:57.027
&gt; TextMeshPro &gt; Font Asset Creator,
we've done this before.
77

77

00:03:57.027  -->  00:04:00.853
Font Source, I'm gonna click the selecto,
we've only got one font, Wizardry.
78

78

00:04:00.853  -->  00:04:03.804
Double-click on that, Generate Font Atlas,
79

79

00:04:03.804  -->  00:04:07.357
wait a moment for it to generate,
generation progress.
80

80

00:04:07.357  -->  00:04:09.965
[MUSIC]
81

81

00:04:09.965  -->  00:04:11.141
Elevator music while we're doing that.
82

82

00:04:11.141  -->  00:04:12.358
Okay, that was pretty quick.
83

83

00:04:12.358  -->  00:04:16.648
SaveTextMeshPro font asset
into our fonts folder.
84

84

00:04:16.648  -->  00:04:18.401
We're in there already, Save that.
85

85

00:04:18.401  -->  00:04:22.602
Beautiful, now, we can close the Asset
creator, we don't need you anymore,
86

86

00:04:22.602  -->  00:04:23.617
thanks very much.
87

87

00:04:23.617  -->  00:04:26.735
And we have ourselves in here TextMeshPro.
88

88

00:04:26.735  -->  00:04:30.394
In our Fonts folder,
we have WIZARDRY.asset Bryant.
89

89

00:04:30.394  -->  00:04:34.959
Okay, back over at our Start Text,
we're going to change the Font Asset by
90

90

00:04:34.959  -->  00:04:38.951
clicking the selector we find
whatever font you've brought in.
91

91

00:04:38.951  -->  00:04:40.217
Mine's called wizardry, and
92

92

00:04:40.217  -->  00:04:42.853
we see a little bit of wizardry
magic going on on our button here.
93

93

00:04:42.853  -->  00:04:46.021
Cool that works just
the way we want it to work.
94

94

00:04:46.021  -->  00:04:49.473
Now while I'm here,
I'm gonna change my text box,
95

95

00:04:49.473  -->  00:04:53.485
so it fits nice and
neatly within our button there and there.
96

96

00:04:53.485  -->  00:04:56.977
Just to tidy it up, so
that's snapping perfectly in the middle.
97

97

00:04:56.977  -->  00:04:59.541
Now with the button itself,
let's make it a slightly different color.
98

98

00:04:59.541  -->  00:05:02.075
If we go over to our start button,
99

99

00:05:02.075  -->  00:05:05.978
we can either change up here
the color on the image.
100

100

00:05:05.978  -->  00:05:09.571
So I can change that to say red,
we change that color here, or
101

101

00:05:09.571  -->  00:05:12.473
undo that, or
I could click on the normal color.
102

102

00:05:12.473  -->  00:05:14.827
Click on that, and
change it to red as well, undo that.
103

103

00:05:14.827  -->  00:05:16.986
I'm gonna make a yellowish kind of button.
104

104

00:05:16.986  -->  00:05:18.791
Just so it pops nice and neatly.
105

105

00:05:18.791  -->  00:05:20.070
There we go.
106

106

00:05:20.070  -->  00:05:21.690
Yellow button for start.
107

107

00:05:21.690  -->  00:05:22.741
There we are with yellow.
108

108

00:05:22.741  -->  00:05:24.810
What color do we want for
our text now over the top,
109

109

00:05:24.810  -->  00:05:26.204
doesn't really matter so much.
110

110

00:05:26.204  -->  00:05:27.772
I'll just leave it black for now, but
111

111

00:05:27.772  -->  00:05:30.360
you can play around with
the colors if you would like.
112

112

00:05:30.360  -->  00:05:35.183
Now, the cool thing about buttons is
that when we mouse over a button we want
113

113

00:05:35.183  -->  00:05:36.417
to have it change.
114

114

00:05:36.417  -->  00:05:40.378
We wanna have some sort of feedbacks, some
affordance is the technical word for that.
115

115

00:05:40.378  -->  00:05:44.073
And we have options in here under our
button to change the highlight color and
116

116

00:05:44.073  -->  00:05:45.063
then press colors.
117

117

00:05:45.063  -->  00:05:48.431
So the Highlight Color,
I'll make that kind of a darker yellow,
118

118

00:05:48.431  -->  00:05:52.413
then we've got it ready something that
maybe a little bit more orange to say,
119

119

00:05:52.413  -->  00:05:54.021
yes, I've moused over that.
120

120

00:05:54.021  -->  00:06:00.722
And then for the Pressed Color we'll give
that more of a darker again, I think.
121

121

00:06:00.722  -->  00:06:02.615
Then I can then say there clunk,
you pressed on it.
122

122

00:06:02.615  -->  00:06:04.496
See how it goes.
Okay, so now I've got three colors,
123

123

00:06:04.496  -->  00:06:06.851
the Normal Color, the Highlight Color and
the Pressed Color.
124

124

00:06:06.851  -->  00:06:09.960
If we click Play,
we can see this in action.
125

125

00:06:09.960  -->  00:06:14.074
Wait for the game to compile, and
I've got maximize on play clicked on,
126

126

00:06:14.074  -->  00:06:16.643
that's why my window
went very large there.
127

127

00:06:16.643  -->  00:06:20.626
And as we mouse over,
I can see that it changes color and
128

128

00:06:20.626  -->  00:06:23.841
when I click there is some feedback, cool.
129

129

00:06:23.841  -->  00:06:27.757
Okay, I'm gonna turn off,
maximize on play from now on just, so
130

130

00:06:27.757  -->  00:06:30.335
we don't accidentally maximize on play.
131

131

00:06:30.335  -->  00:06:35.234
And as I've mentioned before, if you go
into your TextMeshPro settings you can do
132

132

00:06:35.234  -->  00:06:38.500
a whole bunch of magic in here
change a bunch of things.
133

133

00:06:38.500  -->  00:06:42.206
I'm not gonna play around with that at the
moment, but if you'd like to prohibit more
134

134

00:06:42.206  -->  00:06:45.049
flare into your text on your button,
you can absolutely do that.
135

135

00:06:45.049  -->  00:06:48.364
What we're going to do now is
a little bit of a challenge.
136

136

00:06:48.364  -->  00:06:53.381
Your mission if you choose to accept
it is, make three scenes and buttons.
137

137

00:06:53.381  -->  00:06:56.910
Create a nice looking Start
button as a starting point, and
138

138

00:06:56.910  -->  00:07:01.300
then create the following scenes and
the following buttons in the scene.
139

139

00:07:01.300  -->  00:07:02.730
So you want a Start Menu Scene,
140

140

00:07:02.730  -->  00:07:05.543
which is what we've just been
doing with this Start button.
141

141

00:07:05.543  -->  00:07:10.771
As well as two more scenes
a Core Game Scene and a Win Screen Scene.
142

142

00:07:10.771  -->  00:07:14.274
And on the Core Game Scene have a Success
button that can be placed any where,
143

143

00:07:14.274  -->  00:07:17.469
don't worry about the placement for
now, just have a button there.
144

144

00:07:17.469  -->  00:07:20.034
And on the Win Screen,
we're looking to have a Play Again button.
145

145

00:07:20.034  -->  00:07:23.599
So that's your challenge,
create those scenes and those buttons.
146

146

00:07:23.599  -->  00:07:27.000
You should have all the information
that you need to do that.
147

147

00:07:27.000  -->  00:07:29.085
When you come back,
I'll go through my solution to that.
148

148

00:07:29.085  -->  00:07:30.110
Good luck and see you in a moment.
149

149

00:07:33.125  -->  00:07:34.373
Okay, welcome back.
150

150

00:07:34.373  -->  00:07:38.413
I'm gonna start off by making sure
I've saved my Start Menu Scene.
151

151

00:07:38.413  -->  00:07:41.663
And then I'll duplicate these
by doing Ctrl+D or Cmd+D,
152

152

00:07:41.663  -->  00:07:45.180
that will duplicate the entire scene and
everything within it.
153

153

00:07:45.180  -->  00:07:52.083
I'll rename this to Core Game,
I have a Core Game now, Core Game Scene.
154

154

00:07:52.083  -->  00:07:55.617
And double-click on Core Game, and
you can see that it's exactly the same.
155

155

00:07:55.617  -->  00:07:59.323
That's really cool, just to demonstrate
that I'm going to Start menu,
156

156

00:07:59.323  -->  00:08:01.495
move the Start button
up just a little bit.
157

157

00:08:01.495  -->  00:08:03.684
I hit the W key to get my move tool, and
158

158

00:08:03.684  -->  00:08:08.071
then save each time you're switching
scene, you need to save to make sure
159

159

00:08:08.071  -->  00:08:11.779
the changes you've made are saved
from that previous scene.
160

160

00:08:11.779  -->  00:08:15.685
We are now in Core Game, it's a little bit
different to Start menu, which is cool.
161

161

00:08:15.685  -->  00:08:18.882
In my Core Game, I don't need this
handsome looking fellow in there,
162

162

00:08:18.882  -->  00:08:19.865
[LAUGH] get rid of him.
163

163

00:08:19.865  -->  00:08:23.138
What I do need is a button
that is going to be,
164

164

00:08:23.138  -->  00:08:26.244
what this needs to be our correct button.
165

165

00:08:26.244  -->  00:08:30.320
So pretty easy,
I need to rename from Start button,
166

166

00:08:30.320  -->  00:08:35.709
rename this to Success button,
just a side note on creating scenes.
167

167

00:08:35.709  -->  00:08:39.782
We could've gone up to File &gt; New Scene
and then edit things manually.
168

168

00:08:39.782  -->  00:08:43.617
But this way we get to keep out progress
with that button, by duplicating it.
169

169

00:08:43.617  -->  00:08:47.346
So we have our Core Game, and
I shouldn't say start our Success button,
170

170

00:08:47.346  -->  00:08:49.804
I should be saying,
I'll change this up here.
171

171

00:08:49.804  -->  00:08:52.615
Success Text that's going to be nice and
clear.
172

172

00:08:52.615  -->  00:08:55.175
In our naming, we'll call this SUCCESS.
173

173

00:08:55.175  -->  00:09:00.056
It's not going to fit into my button,
so I can either reduce the font size or
174

174

00:09:00.056  -->  00:09:01.384
change the button.
175

175

00:09:01.384  -->  00:09:03.279
For now,
I will change the size of the button.
176

176

00:09:03.279  -->  00:09:06.917
And you can see,
when I click on the button itself,
177

177

00:09:06.917  -->  00:09:11.069
click on our Rect Tool,
as I change the size of the button.
178

178

00:09:11.069  -->  00:09:14.865
It changes the scaling of
the child underneath it,
179

179

00:09:14.865  -->  00:09:19.823
cuz we've anchored that to these
sides of our button, very cool.
180

180

00:09:19.823  -->  00:09:23.129
Okay, we have SUCCESS, now save that and
181

181

00:09:23.129  -->  00:09:28.229
I'm going to let's see I'll
duplicate my Start menu Ctrl+D or
182

182

00:09:28.229  -->  00:09:31.545
Cmd+D, we now have another Start menu.
183

183

00:09:31.545  -->  00:09:34.993
We'll rename this one to Win Screen,
184

184

00:09:34.993  -->  00:09:40.395
double-click on Win Screen,
get rid of that fine fellow.
185

185

00:09:40.395  -->  00:09:44.747
I've given you again one of the previous
lectures, I gave you a Ben image.
186

186

00:09:44.747  -->  00:09:49.711
Let's go to canvas,
right-click, UI &gt; Image.
187

187

00:09:49.711  -->  00:09:54.855
We will drag the image to where we
want it to be, down the side there.
188

188

00:09:54.855  -->  00:09:57.216
They make it bigger with the Rect Tool.
189

189

00:09:57.216  -->  00:09:59.827
Blank, blank, just as a starting point.
190

190

00:09:59.827  -->  00:10:01.771
Click on the image itself,
191

191

00:10:01.771  -->  00:10:07.529
change the source image from sprite
none to Benny Porter, ha-ha, hilarious.
192

192

00:10:07.529  -->  00:10:09.375
I can't wait for
Ben to watch this, [LAUGH] and
193

193

00:10:09.375  -->  00:10:12.159
say what he thinks about me putting
some goggles on even a funny hat.
194

194

00:10:12.159  -->  00:10:17.297
Set Native Size button, move into
the corner and incur in the bottom
195

195

00:10:17.297  -->  00:10:22.177
corner as we've done before, and
holding down shift scale up.
196

196

00:10:22.177  -->  00:10:23.035
There we go.
197

197

00:10:23.035  -->  00:10:27.333
So Ben represents game over and
finish, and work represents the start.
198

198

00:10:27.333  -->  00:10:29.854
So we keep track of our
different scenes there.
199

199

00:10:29.854  -->  00:10:31.321
We still have the START button.
200

200

00:10:31.321  -->  00:10:39.254
Switch the START button to the Play Again
button, up on the inspector.
201

201

00:10:39.254  -->  00:10:44.021
Now I click on open up the text, we have
Start Text, just while I'm here, bad form.
202

202

00:10:44.021  -->  00:10:47.143
Shouldn't leave that as image,
should leave that as Ben image, just so
203

203

00:10:47.143  -->  00:10:49.497
we're very clear when we
have 100 images in there,
204

204

00:10:49.497  -->  00:10:51.463
we don't wanna be trying
to guess what it is.
205

205

00:10:51.463  -->  00:10:54.523
Change the START text to what is this?
206

206

00:10:54.523  -->  00:10:57.704
It's PLAY AGAIN text, and
207

207

00:10:57.704  -->  00:11:02.277
then within the text box, PLAY AGAIN.
208

208

00:11:02.277  -->  00:11:04.677
Now our button is not quite fitting, so
209

209

00:11:04.677  -->  00:11:07.525
let's click on the PLAY AGAIN
button itself.
210

210

00:11:07.525  -->  00:11:11.850
On the Rect Tool, just drag it out, so
it's a bit more space, drag it down, so
211

211

00:11:11.850  -->  00:11:12.653
it fits okay.
212

212

00:11:12.653  -->  00:11:15.546
We can see that our words
are right touching each other.
213

213

00:11:15.546  -->  00:11:16.390
Let's go and
214

214

00:11:16.390  -->  00:11:21.078
figure out how to give a little bit
more space between our text down here.
215

215

00:11:21.078  -->  00:11:23.744
And we can see under Font Settings
we have Spacing options.
216

216

00:11:23.744  -->  00:11:27.166
I can see there is a Line,
so we can do Characters,
217

217

00:11:27.166  -->  00:11:30.438
which would space out our characters or
words.
218

218

00:11:30.438  -->  00:11:31.750
Oops, I click the autosize button there.
219

219

00:11:31.750  -->  00:11:33.930
For Line, let's put that up to say 10.
220

220

00:11:33.930  -->  00:11:36.505
Okay, that looks nicely spaced apart,
little bit better.
221

221

00:11:36.505  -->  00:11:38.919
Make my button box a bit larger.
222

222

00:11:38.919  -->  00:11:42.189
Note, the actual button box a bit larger.
223

223

00:11:42.189  -->  00:11:43.043
There we go.
224

224

00:11:43.043  -->  00:11:44.886
I'd accidentally clicked on
the text when I was changing.
225

225

00:11:44.886  -->  00:11:47.213
So when you clicked on the text and
you're changing that,
226

226

00:11:47.213  -->  00:11:49.029
that will just change
the text positioning.
227

227

00:11:49.029  -->  00:11:52.909
But if we click on the button which is the
parent, it will change the button size,
228

228

00:11:52.909  -->  00:11:55.435
and the text underneath will be scaled,
very cool.
229

229

00:11:55.435  -->  00:11:59.081
Let's click Play and
just check that our highlighting works,
230

230

00:11:59.081  -->  00:12:00.673
that we've brought it in.
231

231

00:12:00.673  -->  00:12:01.917
Okay, yeah, it seems to work.
232

232

00:12:01.917  -->  00:12:03.822
Click on it and mouse over it, great.
233

233

00:12:03.822  -->  00:12:06.574
Okay, so now we have three scenes and
three buttons.
234

234

00:12:06.574  -->  00:12:09.325
We have a Start menu,
Core Game and Wins Screen.
235

235

00:12:09.325  -->  00:12:10.616
I'm gonna save this.
236

236

00:12:10.616  -->  00:12:14.121
Each of those has the button within it, so
we're ready to hook up the functionality.
237

237

00:12:14.121  -->  00:12:15.199
In the next video, we'll be doing that.
238

238

00:12:15.199  -->  00:12:18.725
So clicking the button
will load the next scene.
239

239

00:12:18.725  -->  00:12:21.260
Okay, great work and
see you in the next lecture.
