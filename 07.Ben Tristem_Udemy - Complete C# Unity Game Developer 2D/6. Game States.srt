1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:05,543
[SOUND] In this video, we're gonna get
some context for what states are and
1

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:10,438
state machines aren't, and
write ourselves a little bit of our first
2

3
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:14,801
state of our story and
our first decisions for the player.
3

4
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:18,510
So let's jump in and
have a look at states and state machines.
4

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,370
In order for us to create
an interesting text adventure game,
5

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,780
we're gonna need a lot of text and
a lot of adventure, to state the obvious.
6

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,980
To do that, we are going to need to
organize our bits of information,
7

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,060
our pieces of the story
to give to the player.
8

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,750
We're gonna need a good way
to organize our states.
9

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,830
But what do I mean by states and
what do I mean by state machines?
10

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,910
Well, a state is an action or a process or
11

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,240
a behavior,
the thing that we are doing usually.
12

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,400
A state machine assumes
only 1 state at a time.
13

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,290
I'll show you a state machine in a moment.
14

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,270
And conditions, in other words,
15

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,040
requirements, transition
from one state to the next.
16

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,090
So that's state, and
state machines, what do we mean?
17

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,220
You'll see the start symbol here,
we'll lead into our first state, so
18

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,100
this is state A we'll call it.
19

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,510
And from state A we have a decision.
20

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,280
This diamond is a symbol in state machines
used to symbolize a decision point.
21

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,370
From the decision, we might say,
Yes, from our decision and
22

23
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,370
that leads us to State B which is
a different state to State A, State B, or
23

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,730
might say No, that leads to State C.
24

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,720
Let's make that real
with some examples here.
25

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,710
So from our Start, we might with a Room
with 2 exits,that might be our state.
26

27
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,400
And we would have in our game some text,
some flavor to that.
27

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,950
It could be you stroll into a room, there
is a smell of burned toast in the air.
28

29
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,630
Does that mean there's something
wrong with your brain or
29

30
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,340
does that mean that
someone is cooking toast?
30

31
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,321
Whatever it might be,
I just made that up on the spot,
31

32
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:46,609
that's why it wasn't so clever.
32

33
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:51,430
But, [LAUGH] so our first state is,
you're in a room there are 2 exits.
33

34
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,680
So the player has a choice,
choice is very, very important in games,
34

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,930
we have a choice.
35

36
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,675
Which way do you go?
36

37
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,970
That's what we present to the player.
37

38
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,290
To the Blue Door
represents the Real world.
38

39
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,140
And then we would go into the next state,
and in that next state we would say,
39

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,770
you've entered a world that looks very
real and tangible and photo-realistic.
40

41
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,230
If you were to choose the Red Door for
example, might be like go to fantasy land.
41

42
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,330
You walk through the door and
42

43
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,510
you are encountered with a whole bunch
of people who address brightly and
43

44
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,080
dancing around and having a wonderful
time, whatever our story might be.
44

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,702
So, this is our state machine, and this
suggest 3 states and 1 decision point.
45

46
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:29,704
In our game it's gonna be much,
much bigger, you go through a door,
46

47
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:34,550
you go in another room, maybe have some
conflict, do you go left, do you go right?
47

48
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,130
Do you do this,
do you shoot the person, do you run,
48

49
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,800
do you climb up the ladder,
all these different states,
49

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,650
all these different conditions,
all these different transitions.
50

51
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,590
So we may have hundreds of states,
51

52
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,830
each state may have many
lines of story within it.
52

53
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,330
So, it might have a lot more text,
53

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,470
a lot more of that flavor that I am
talking about, in out text adventure.
54

55
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,250
Descriptive elements to it and
55

56
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,900
we need a way to manage all this
data as I was saying before.
56

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,070
So, this is our problem,
almost specifically our requirements and
57

58
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,500
we need to come out with a solution.
58

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,220
If we are doing this all within a single
text file that's managing all this states,
59

60
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,060
we would have all of these states.
60

61
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,690
And then for each of these states,
we would have the text that's required.
61

62
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,227
We need to some concatenation here,
which is where cuz we can't fit
62

63
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:21,580
outline all the way across here but
we're not about to read it.
63

64
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,327
After all so we have to break it up and
then we need to, for
64

65
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:27,958
each of these states we need to say
what the key input is every single time.
65

66
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,391
So there's sort of repeated code, there
is a lot of typing in text into that text
66

67
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,311
file and there is a lot of if something
goes wrong somewhere in here,
67

68
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:35,614
then it could break the flow.
68

69
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:39,200
And there is also a difficulty
in keeping track of okay,
69

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,719
this state down here lock_0 from
there I want to go up to stairs_2.
70

71
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,679
But also I want to
transition into corridor_0.
71

72
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:51,258
So, this is a valid way for us to organize
our story and our state, but it's a little
72

73
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:55,470
bit difficult and a little bit clunky
to use and it doesn't scale very well.
73

74
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,260
So our approach will be to
use scriptable objects, and
74

75
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,600
that's what we'll talk about
in the very next lecture.
75

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,890
This lecture, I just wanted to give you
the context of our state machine and
76

77
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,990
to give you a quick challenge, which was
to come up with your starting state.
77

78
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,740
So what is the first thing that
your player is confront with?
78

79
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,940
What's the first piece
of text in your game
79

80
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,270
that you're going to give to the player?
80

81
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,590
Now later on, we're gonna talk a little
bit more about game design and game float
81

82
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,840
to manage your state machine and
how you can create that in a nice tool.
82

83
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll give you my input on a good
tool to use to create that but
83

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,780
for now we're saying
something pretty quick.
84

85
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,110
We're saying what's the first state to get
the ball rolling, so we've got something
85

86
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,920
to enter in the next video when
we're talking out that first state.
86

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,910
So, come up with 2 or
3 sentences that will start your game.
87

88
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,370
For example, you walk into a room,
you smell, what did I say before?
88

89
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,200
You smell burnt toast, it could be that,
89

90
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,500
it could be even cleverer than that,
perhaps.
90

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,380
And what are the 2 choices
your player can make?
91

92
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,720
So this is important at the start,
92

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,710
let's think about what choices
are you going to give your player?.
93

94
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,272
What format should you write this up in?
94

95
00:04:57,272 --> 00:05:00,950
And let me give you a quick little idea,
here.
95

96
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,585
If you are into Visual Studio and
right up to the top New
96

97
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:10,850
file, you can choose a Text File.
97

98
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,920
So, double click on Text File, and
here we get a blank text file.
98

99
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,140
It's not gonna have any
of the autocomplete and
99

100
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,920
any of the errors that we would have if we
were in a C Sharp's file or a .CS file.
100

101
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,750
We can just type in here, so
type in the first couple of
101

102
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,368
sentences and then here are the 2 choices.
102

103
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:36,490
So go ahead and create your first
couple of sentences for your story and
103

104
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,500
first 2 choices.
104

105
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,890
When you've done that I'll see
you back in here in a moment and
105

106
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,150
I'll give you a quick taste of what
I've come up with just very quickly.
106

107
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,080
Welcome back, this is what I've written,
little bit of dialogue at the top here.
107

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,350
You can read that if you want, but
I'd like you to do something that is your
108

109
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,610
story, and
not just follow what I've done with mine.
109

110
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,150
I've said there's a whole bunch of stuff
going on, I could try doing A or B.
110

111
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,950
What should I do, take them head on or
to sneak my way to the emergency exit.
111

112
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,281
So, this is going to give us some text,
little bit of real context when we're
112

113
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,580
creating our states in the upcoming
videos and starting up.
113

114
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,010
Now, if you wanna save this, you should
probably say you lose it File, Save As.
114

115
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,146
I'm gonna save mine right in my
Unity project, just so it in there.
115

116
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:23,139
This is not typically behaviour, normally
we don't use text files to keep notes and
116

117
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,356
save them within Unity.
117

118
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:28,048
But I wanted to make sure that no matter
what platform you're operating on or
118

119
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:31,626
operating system you have, or
what you've installed on your computer,
119

120
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,990
that you absolutely would be able
to follow along with this lecture.
120

121
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,850
And you weren't racing off trying to find
a text file editor or some other thing and
121

122
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,610
figuring out what to do.
122

123
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,011
So I'm gonna save mine just
in the assets folder here and
123

124
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:51,850
call it First state of my game.
124

125
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,440
And then save that, and interestingly,
if we jump back over into Unity,
125

126
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,590
you will see, we have this text file,
which is the first state of our game.
126

127
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,520
Which is pretty handy to have, it's
right in the middle of our Unity file,
127

128
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,630
keeping it nice and
organized to remind me where it is.
128

129
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,490
We're not gonna do that long term,
this is just to keep some notes,
129

130
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,090
