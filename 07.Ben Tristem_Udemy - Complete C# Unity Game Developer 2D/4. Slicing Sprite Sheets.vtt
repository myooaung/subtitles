2

00:00:04.130  -->  00:00:08.785
In this video, we're gonna be using Unity
sprite editor to slice up our sprite
3

3

00:00:08.785  -->  00:00:10.920
sheets into individual sprites.
4

4

00:00:10.920  -->  00:00:12.670
Let's jump in and get started.
5

5

00:00:12.670  -->  00:00:14.850
First things first,
let's set up a new project.
6

6

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:16.330
I've called mine TileVania.
7

7

00:00:16.330  -->  00:00:19.530
Make sure you've clicked on 2D and
then Create project.
8

8

00:00:19.530  -->  00:00:22.250
I've created mine already so
I'm just gonna pretend click.
9

9

00:00:22.250  -->  00:00:23.184
And here we are in here.
10

10

00:00:23.184  -->  00:00:26.127
I'm gonna start off by
just saving what I've got,
11

11

00:00:26.127  -->  00:00:28.320
which will allow me to save my scene.
12

12

00:00:28.320  -->  00:00:32.280
I'll save this scene as Sandbox, just so
we can be clear this is where we're just
13

13

00:00:32.280  -->  00:00:34.870
mucking around and
seeing what happens in the sandbox.
14

14

00:00:34.870  -->  00:00:38.450
Later on, we'll start getting
proper levels with level flow.
15

15

00:00:38.450  -->  00:00:42.200
Now what we're gonna do is grab the assets
that I've attached to this lecture.
16

16

00:00:42.200  -->  00:00:45.980
We've got a background brown tint and
a Rock_Grass_Water.
17

17

00:00:45.980  -->  00:00:49.760
Grab those,
drag them into your Assets window.
18

18

00:00:49.760  -->  00:00:50.920
So I've got those two in here.
19

19

00:00:50.920  -->  00:00:54.190
And a quick note that
these are coming from
20

20

00:00:54.190  -->  00:00:58.420
the Super Platformer Assets
asset pack on Unity.
21

21

00:00:58.420  -->  00:01:04.070
My friend from Foxfin has said yes,
we can use these assets to be super clear.
22

22

00:01:04.070  -->  00:01:06.680
We can use these with
a non commercial license.
23

23

00:01:06.680  -->  00:01:09.430
So, you guys are welcome to do
what ever you want as you're
24

24

00:01:09.430  -->  00:01:12.530
following along with the cause, playing
around with these, checking it out.
25

25

00:01:12.530  -->  00:01:15.950
But, if you wish to publish
your game anywhere online,
26

26

00:01:15.950  -->  00:01:19.000
then please make sure you go ahead and
buy these assets.
27

27

00:01:19.000  -->  00:01:23.310
But for practice and for prototyping,
you can do what your heart desires.
28

28

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:25.300
Now, I have made some changes.
29

29

00:01:25.300  -->  00:01:27.650
I've changed the color a little bit.
30

30

00:01:27.650  -->  00:01:29.250
I've sliced these up
a little bit differently.
31

31

00:01:29.250  -->  00:01:33.322
I've rearranged them to make them easier
for you to implement into your game and
32

32

00:01:33.322  -->  00:01:37.269
also to make them a little bit easier for
us to see on screen as I'm recording,
33

33

00:01:37.269  -->  00:01:39.184
as we're going through doing this.
34

34

00:01:39.184  -->  00:01:41.640
So, they're the assets we're going to use.
35

35

00:01:41.640  -->  00:01:44.390
If you'll only use your own assets,
then just follow along, and
36

36

00:01:44.390  -->  00:01:47.140
make sure you've got a background and
you've got a full ground.
37

37

00:01:47.140  -->  00:01:47.860
So in other words,
38

38

00:01:47.860  -->  00:01:52.470
rocks to jump on as well as background
to place into behind the scene.
39

39

00:01:52.470  -->  00:01:53.940
So in this video let's go ahead and
40

40

00:01:53.940  -->  00:01:57.480
slice up these assets,
little bit of a rundown on how that works.
41

41

00:01:57.480  -->  00:02:00.090
Click on the sprite itself.
42

42

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:03.300
And then you'll see in the inspector,
we've got some options here.
43

43

00:02:03.300  -->  00:02:06.495
Make sure the texture type is on sprite,
2D and UI.
44

44

00:02:06.495  -->  00:02:09.780
And the sprite mode,
we need to change to multiple.
45

45

00:02:09.780  -->  00:02:13.533
Now, at this point,
I'm gonna leave the other elements but
46

46

00:02:13.533  -->  00:02:16.485
we'll come back to those
in an upcoming video.
47

47

00:02:16.485  -->  00:02:18.880
Scroll down and click on Apply.
48

48

00:02:18.880  -->  00:02:23.240
And then click on sprite editor under the
button you see there within the inspector.
49

49

00:02:23.240  -->  00:02:25.540
You can see we've got
these sprites laid out.
50

50

00:02:25.540  -->  00:02:27.386
We've got 16, so there's 4 by 4.
51

51

00:02:27.386  -->  00:02:29.590
And there's a couple of
ways to slice these up.
52

52

00:02:29.590  -->  00:02:31.810
As it is, this is just one image.
53

53

00:02:31.810  -->  00:02:34.910
This is one png and Unity doesn't yet
54

54

00:02:34.910  -->  00:02:40.350
know that this bit up here is one sprite
and that bit there is another sprite.
55

55

00:02:40.350  -->  00:02:44.840
So we click on Slice and we can allow
Unity to do this automatically.
56

56

00:02:44.840  -->  00:02:46.780
And I think for
this we'll get some pretty good results.
57

57

00:02:46.780  -->  00:02:48.610
You click Slice,
nothing seemed to have happened.
58

58

00:02:48.610  -->  00:02:53.900
But if we click on our window, hold down
Ctrl, then you will see the outline and
59

59

00:02:53.900  -->  00:02:57.560
these green outlines show
where these sprites are.
60

60

00:02:57.560  -->  00:03:00.390
So it's actually mapped
it out really nicely.
61

61

00:03:00.390  -->  00:03:03.940
If it doesn't work out as nicely as that,
as cleanly as that.
62

62

00:03:03.940  -->  00:03:11.130
Then you can click on Slice, and instead
of automatic, go to grid by cell size.
63

63

00:03:11.130  -->  00:03:13.763
And I know that these are 32 by 32.
64

64

00:03:13.763  -->  00:03:17.080
If you go and grab the original
asset pack, they're 16 by 16.
65

65

00:03:17.080  -->  00:03:22.510
But I've upsized these a bit to give us a
little more fidelity, so they're 32 by 32.
66

66

00:03:22.510  -->  00:03:23.650
Pixel size.
67

67

00:03:23.650  -->  00:03:26.810
And I know that there's a padding of 6x6.
68

68

00:03:26.810  -->  00:03:29.830
The original had 3x3 but
I've doubled it, so this is 6x6.
69

69

00:03:29.830  -->  00:03:34.500
So the padding basically means there's
transparency in between one sprite and
70

70

00:03:34.500  -->  00:03:35.660
the next sprite.
71

71

00:03:35.660  -->  00:03:39.680
So if I click Slice and hold down Ctrl,
you'll see this same result here.
72

72

00:03:39.680  -->  00:03:44.650
One other thing I'll show you on
here is sometimes these sprite sheet
73

73

00:03:44.650  -->  00:03:47.940
isn't nice and
clean in terms of these sprites being
74

74

00:03:47.940  -->  00:03:50.450
touching right up at
the top corner up here.
75

75

00:03:50.450  -->  00:03:54.489
If that's the case we can click on,
we can add an offset and
76

76

00:03:54.489  -->  00:03:59.434
the offset the x and the y basically
is saying if the first sprite is below
77

77

00:03:59.434  -->  00:04:04.484
the horizontal up here then we add
some X padding, X offsetting to that.
78

78

00:04:04.484  -->  00:04:06.940
Or if it's over to the right,
we add a Y offset.
79

79

00:04:06.940  -->  00:04:07.910
Now you can click on each of these.
80

80

00:04:07.910  -->  00:04:12.700
You can see that it's been cut up nicely
and you see down here information of each
81

81

00:04:12.700  -->  00:04:17.450
of it, it's given it a name starting at 0,
1, 2, 3 and so on.
82

82

00:04:17.450  -->  00:04:21.513
So now we have, if we click Apply,
close out that window and
83

83

00:04:21.513  -->  00:04:24.046
you go over to our spreadsheet here.
84

84

00:04:24.046  -->  00:04:28.778
Click on that, and as it expands,
you can see all these different sprites
85

85

00:04:28.778  -->  00:04:32.458
that are being created and
numbered from 0 down to 15.
86

86

00:04:32.458  -->  00:04:35.974
So for the second spreadsheet I'll
issue that as a challenge to slice up
87

87

00:04:35.974  -->  00:04:39.970
both of the sprite sheets so that we have
both background and foreground assets.
88

88

00:04:39.970  -->  00:04:42.470
So, in other words,
go ahead if you don't follow me just now,
89

89

00:04:42.470  -->  00:04:44.740
slice up that first background asset.
90

90

00:04:44.740  -->  00:04:48.110
And then also slice up the other asset,
so that you have crisp
91

91

00:04:48.110  -->  00:04:51.180
individual sprites that we can
be working with in future video.
92

92

00:04:51.180  -->  00:04:54.340
So, pause the video and
slice your sprite sheets now.
93

93

00:04:56.770  -->  00:05:01.390
Okay, I'll go through that, so that
you can see the process one more time.
94

94

00:05:01.390  -->  00:05:04.900
Click on your Sprite Sheet, over here,
make sure the text you type is Sprite.
95

95

00:05:04.900  -->  00:05:08.066
Click on multiple scroll down and
hit Apply.
96

96

00:05:08.066  -->  00:05:11.352
And just a side note, often this thing
gets tucked down in there if you're
97

97

00:05:11.352  -->  00:05:13.260
wondering, why has Rick got one of those?
98

98

00:05:13.260  -->  00:05:15.450
But I don't,
it's just hidden down in there,
99

99

00:05:15.450  -->  00:05:17.030
often happens with animations as well.
100

100

00:05:17.030  -->  00:05:18.190
Well where's my animation gone?
101

101

00:05:18.190  -->  00:05:20.349
It's just hiding down in there.
102

102

00:05:20.349  -->  00:05:22.222
So we are going to click on Sprite Editor,
103

103

00:05:22.222  -->  00:05:24.265
you can see our sprites
laid out nicely here.
104

104

00:05:24.265  -->  00:05:27.849
Click on Slice, we'll try the automatic
again to see how that goes.
105

105

00:05:27.849  -->  00:05:33.445
And holding down Ctrl, it helps if i
actually click on the Slice button here,
106

106

00:05:33.445  -->  00:05:38.710
Slice, that looks like it worked
very nicely, 1, 2, 3 and so on.
107

107

00:05:38.710  -->  00:05:39.770
Okay, we've got our sprites.
108

108

00:05:39.770  -->  00:05:40.360
Click Apply.
109

109

00:05:41.805  -->  00:05:42.770
There we go, simple as that.
110

110

00:05:42.770  -->  00:05:46.428
We've got all of our sprites in that
sprite sheet which is going to represent
111

111

00:05:46.428  -->  00:05:49.800
a lot of our platforms to jump on
whereas this is gonna represent a lot of
112

112

00:05:49.800  -->  00:05:51.139
the background just here.
113

113

00:05:51.139  -->  00:05:52.550
One last step in this process.
114

114

00:05:52.550  -->  00:05:55.630
I'm going to create a new folder and
tidy things up.
115

115

00:05:55.630  -->  00:05:56.610
This project's gonna be great.
116

116

00:05:56.610  -->  00:05:59.470
We're gonna have lots of folders,
lots of scripts, lots of dependencies.
117

117

00:05:59.470  -->  00:06:02.540
So right from the start we're gonna
get ourselves organized nicely.
118

118

00:06:02.540  -->  00:06:08.880
So we'll call this Sprites, and Tiles.
119

119

00:06:08.880  -->  00:06:11.630
Cuz I know that tiles
are coming down the pipe.
120

120

00:06:11.630  -->  00:06:14.768
So we'll put these two into that folder.
121

121

00:06:14.768  -->  00:06:17.600
Make sure that we save, so
it's all saved up nice and neatly.
122

122

00:06:17.600  -->  00:06:18.450
Excellent, great work.
123

123

00:06:18.450  -->  00:06:19.990
I'll see you in the next video.
