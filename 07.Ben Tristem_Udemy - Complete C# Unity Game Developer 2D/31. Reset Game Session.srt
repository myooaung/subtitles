00:00:04,202  -->  00:00:09,654
Hello again, this video is gonna be
somewhat a problem solution style lecture.
3

3

00:00:09,654  -->  00:00:14,698
And the problem, let me articulate it for
you, the problem is that when
4

4

00:00:14,698  -->  00:00:20,520
we finish our game, or lose our life,
or want to restart, we have a score, 83.
5

5

00:00:20,520  -->  00:00:23,370
When I click Play Again, and
go back to my first screen and
6

6

00:00:23,370  -->  00:00:27,710
click start, my score is still 83,
it hasn't reset and it goes up from there.
7

7

00:00:27,710  -->  00:00:29,101
So if I was to lose the game here,
8

8

00:00:29,101  -->  00:00:32,573
of course the ball's gonna go way up to
the top and [SOUND] lose the game 1826.
9

9

00:00:32,573  -->  00:00:35,746
Play Again 1826 is still hanging out,
okay so
10

10

00:00:35,746  -->  00:00:40,215
that is our problem and that is what
we will be solving in this lecture.
11

11

00:00:40,215  -->  00:00:43,991
I wanna reinforce something for
you and then ask you to do a challenge.
12

12

00:00:43,991  -->  00:00:47,350
The aspect of our approach
I wanna reinforce,
13

13

00:00:47,350  -->  00:00:52,970
is this concept of in Script A we have
a public method that we have created.
14

14

00:00:52,970  -->  00:00:58,170
Which controls an aspect about code,
it does a particular thing, it updates
15

15

00:00:58,170  -->  00:01:03,302
a state or changes in variable or tells
the game to take a particular action.
16

16

00:01:03,302  -->  00:01:07,437
And then we have in Script B, we call
the Public Method that's in Script A,
17

17

00:01:07,437  -->  00:01:11,984
cuz we're requesting that something
happens, it's not happening in Script B.
18

18

00:01:11,984  -->  00:01:16,160
But Script B has an awareness that says,
now I would like you to do a particular
19

19

00:01:16,160  -->  00:01:20,350
thing, you own that particular thing,
Script A, so could you please do it?
20

20

00:01:20,350  -->  00:01:24,966
And this is a very safe way for us to
structure our code so that Script B isn't
21

21

00:01:24,966  -->  00:01:29,389
accidentally going and doing something
that Script A isn't aware of.
22

22

00:01:29,389  -->  00:01:32,188
If a particular thing changes,
for example, our score,
23

23

00:01:32,188  -->  00:01:34,701
we go and we look at where
the score is being managed or
24

24

00:01:34,701  -->  00:01:37,752
controlled, and we know that's
what we need to be looking at.
25

25

00:01:37,752  -->  00:01:43,237
Okay, so here's the challenge for you,
I want you to reset or restart the score.
26

26

00:01:43,237  -->  00:01:47,899
So here's our paradigm again,
we're looking in GameStatus.cs for
27

27

00:01:47,899  -->  00:01:49,700
our public method.
28

28

00:01:49,700  -->  00:01:56,262
And in here, we're wanting the game
persistence, so the don't destroy on load,
29

29

00:01:56,262  -->  00:02:01,151
or this whole GameStatus.cs,
we want it to destroy itself.
30

30

00:02:01,151  -->  00:02:03,843
That's what we want to do in here,
we want it to destroy itself.
31

31

00:02:03,843  -->  00:02:08,717
And what we're requesting is that
SceneLoader.cs is calling a public method,
32

32

00:02:08,717  -->  00:02:13,602
calling this public method we've created
in here when we want the game to reset.
33

33

00:02:13,602  -->  00:02:19,582
And just a quick note on that,
let me open up my SceneLoader.
34

34

00:02:19,582  -->  00:02:23,497
Okay, in here, there's a place where
we say we want to load this dot scene.
35

35

00:02:23,497  -->  00:02:26,776
That's the place that I think that
it's a right time for us to say,
36

36

00:02:26,776  -->  00:02:28,605
let's reset our game at that point.
37

37

00:02:28,605  -->  00:02:33,433
So here is your challenge, create the
public method and call the public method,
38

38

00:02:33,433  -->  00:02:35,000
so that our game is reset.
39

39

00:02:35,000  -->  00:02:37,174
Take that on and
I'll see you back here when you're done.
40

40

00:02:40,358  -->  00:02:44,522
Okay, I really hope that you stopped and
thought about that cuz we've done this now
41

41

00:02:44,522  -->  00:02:47,816
three or four or maybe more times,
this calling a public method.
42

42

00:02:47,816  -->  00:02:51,999
So hopefully it's really starting to sink
in, if it hasn't then stop the video and
43

43

00:02:51,999  -->  00:02:54,650
really look at it and
really take this challenge on.
44

44

00:02:54,650  -->  00:02:55,690
Now, what have I got here?
45

45

00:02:55,690  -->  00:02:59,796
SceneLoader, Block and Level, I don't
actually have open the script that I
46

46

00:02:59,796  -->  00:03:02,269
made which is game status
Let's open that up.
47

47

00:03:02,269  -->  00:03:05,130
GameStatus, great,
I'm gonna drag GameStatus and
48

48

00:03:05,130  -->  00:03:07,874
SceneLoader they're the two
scripts that I need.
49

49

00:03:07,874  -->  00:03:12,845
Within GameStatus, we need to find a place
where we are going to say to create a new
50

50

00:03:12,845  -->  00:03:17,249
public method I'll do this down
the bottom, underneath AddToScore.
51

51

00:03:17,249  -->  00:03:21,113
We'll say, public void and
52

52

00:03:21,113  -->  00:03:25,627
I'm gonna call mine reset game.
53

53

00:03:25,627  -->  00:03:29,522
And we're not parsing in anything,
open and close curly brackets,
54

54

00:03:29,522  -->  00:03:31,007
what are we doing in here?
55

55

00:03:31,007  -->  00:03:35,866
Well we want to, up at the top, we say
Don'tDestroyOnLoad as we're doing our
56

56

00:03:35,866  -->  00:03:41,126
singleton but at some point we have to say
well, now it's time to destroy yourself.
57

57

00:03:41,126  -->  00:03:46,054
And we're gonna do that whenever
something else says now it's time
58

58

00:03:46,054  -->  00:03:50,469
to reset the game,
can you please Destroy(gameObject).
59

59

00:03:50,469  -->  00:03:54,436
gameObject with a small g, cuz we're
talking about this particular instance of
60

60

00:03:54,436  -->  00:03:57,529
gameObject, we're not talking
about the class GameObject,
61

61

00:03:57,529  -->  00:04:00,706
that would be a capital G,
it's an instance so it's a little j.
62

62

00:04:00,706  -->  00:04:04,162
Okay, this is why we're saying,
destroy yourselves, now let's go and
63

63

00:04:04,162  -->  00:04:05,848
call that from a particular place.
64

64

00:04:05,848  -->  00:04:07,471
I'm gonna go and SceneLoader,
65

65

00:04:07,471  -->  00:04:10,845
find this part where it says now
it's time to load the StartScene.
66

66

00:04:10,845  -->  00:04:14,709
So the SceneManager loads Scene zero,
and by the way,
67

67

00:04:14,709  -->  00:04:18,610
while you're there,
we need to call that public method.
68

68

00:04:18,610  -->  00:04:22,297
So firstly we need to say,
FindObjectOfType, it's only object,
69

69

00:04:22,297  -->  00:04:25,739
we don't need objects in this instance,
FindObjectOfType.
70

70

00:04:25,739  -->  00:04:26,898
And what are we looking for?
71

71

00:04:26,898  -->  00:04:30,910
Well, we're looking for GameStatus,
72

72

00:04:30,910  -->  00:04:36,102
GameStatus()., and it will be ResetGame(),
73

73

00:04:36,102  -->  00:04:41,183
cuz we're not passing anything in and
semicolon.
74

74

00:04:41,183  -->  00:04:45,686
Okay, so this us calling the reset, let's
jump back in and see out behavior now,
75

75

00:04:45,686  -->  00:04:46,546
click on Play.
76

76

00:04:46,546  -->  00:04:50,034
I should get 83 when I destroy
this particular block and
77

77

00:04:50,034  -->  00:04:53,022
then in our game over
screen 83 is still there.
78

78

00:04:53,022  -->  00:04:55,305
I quite like that,
I think that's a good time to do it.
79

79

00:04:55,305  -->  00:05:00,074
We'll click Play Again 83 is gone don't
destroy unload that was there a second ago
80

80

00:05:00,074  -->  00:05:03,968
is gone and when I click Start,
we get a new don't destroy unload that
81

81

00:05:03,968  -->  00:05:07,211
is protecting our game status and
our score is back to 0.
82

82

00:05:07,211  -->  00:05:12,635
If I get a score 249 and
then Play Again and its back to 0 again.
83

83

00:05:12,635  -->  00:05:14,914
Excellent, okay so
mission accomplished on that,
84

84

00:05:14,914  -->  00:05:17,570
I wanna do one last thing in
the selection while we're here.
85

85

00:05:17,570  -->  00:05:21,076
I know a couple of you have been asking
about how do I rename a class if
86

86

00:05:21,076  -->  00:05:22,845
we've renamed it incorrectly.
87

87

00:05:22,845  -->  00:05:27,044
And I've gone and called this GameStatus,
at this point I'm thinking, you know what?
88

88

00:05:27,044  -->  00:05:29,213
Let's call this GameSession,
89

89

00:05:29,213  -->  00:05:34,447
because that gives a better indication
of the fact that this session exists.
90

90

00:05:34,447  -->  00:05:37,294
And then when we finish,
when it's time to restart,
91

91

00:05:37,294  -->  00:05:41,044
then we want to destroy that game
session and start a new game session.
92

92

00:05:41,044  -->  00:05:43,189
If you just go and
rename it here and there, and
93

93

00:05:43,189  -->  00:05:46,118
rename it in your class sort of
in your script it might not work.
94

94

00:05:46,118  -->  00:05:49,110
So I'll show you the way
that we go about renaming.
95

95

00:05:49,110  -->  00:05:52,547
If we double click on the GameStatus and
Ctrl + R + R.
96

96

00:05:52,547  -->  00:05:57,322
So a Ctrl + R and
then hit R again while holding down Ctrl,
97

97

00:05:57,322  -->  00:06:03,807
that will allow us to do a Rename, or if
we right click and go to Rename in menu.
98

98

00:06:03,807  -->  00:06:07,329
So if you're on Mac and
the Ctrl + R + R doesn't work,
99

99

00:06:07,329  -->  00:06:10,177
then you can highlight and
click on Rename.
100

100

00:06:10,177  -->  00:06:14,154
And it says here, make sure that
it renames in multiple files,
101

101

00:06:14,154  -->  00:06:17,920
you can see, Rename will update
4 references in 3 files.
102

102

00:06:17,920  -->  00:06:20,544
If there's any particular
option you see that says,
103

103

00:06:20,544  -->  00:06:23,761
only rename in this file,
then we don't want that at this point.
104

104

00:06:23,761  -->  00:06:27,812
We wanna rename it everywhere, including
references in other scripts where we
105

105

00:06:27,812  -->  00:06:30,728
are referring to it, for
example, in our SceneLoader.
106

106

00:06:30,728  -->  00:06:33,730
It acknowledges aha that is also in there.
107

107

00:06:33,730  -->  00:06:38,553
Okay, so we will rename this,
highlight once it's highlight
108

108

00:06:38,553  -->  00:06:43,477
in green it's gonna rename it GameSession,
hit Enter, okay.
109

109

00:06:43,477  -->  00:06:46,127
But my script is still
called GameStatus and
110

110

00:06:46,127  -->  00:06:48,422
Unity is not going to like that at all.
111

111

00:06:48,422  -->  00:06:52,769
So we come back over into Unity,
I find GameStatus, I click on it,
112

112

00:06:52,769  -->  00:06:57,057
and then wait a little bit, and
then click on the name once again.
113

113

00:06:57,057  -->  00:07:00,809
And that will allow us to type straight
in there, we could also right-click and
114

114

00:07:00,809  -->  00:07:03,051
click on Rename,
that will allow us to rename.
115

115

00:07:03,051  -->  00:07:08,353
I'm gonna change this to GameSession,
whoop, spell it correctly, Session.
116

116

00:07:10,073  -->  00:07:11,426
Right, that's updated in there.
117

117

00:07:11,426  -->  00:07:14,204
And then the final place,
this is not critical but
118

118

00:07:14,204  -->  00:07:16,533
our Game Object is to called Game Status.
119

119

00:07:16,533  -->  00:07:19,435
We know that this is a prefab,
so I'll find the prefab and
120

120

00:07:19,435  -->  00:07:20,770
rename it prefab itself.
121

121

00:07:20,770  -->  00:07:25,414
Little hint here, if you If you right
click on a Game Object that is Prefab,
122

122

00:07:25,414  -->  00:07:27,498
that's an instance of a Prefab.
123

123

00:07:27,498  -->  00:07:29,749
Right click and then Select Prefab,
124

124

00:07:29,749  -->  00:07:33,095
it will show us in our assets
where that Prefab exists.
125

125

00:07:33,095  -->  00:07:39,505
Again, right click Rename and instead of
Game Status, we'll call this GameSession.
126

126

00:07:40,890  -->  00:07:45,429
Hit Enter, and then you can see over in
our hierarchy its updated game session and
127

127

00:07:45,429  -->  00:07:46,710
that's in level two.
128

128

00:07:46,710  -->  00:07:49,796
It will also be updated in Level One
as well because it's a prefab and
129

129

00:07:49,796  -->  00:07:50,618
they are linked.
130

130

00:07:50,618  -->  00:07:54,699
So now, everything is hooked up,
we've renamed our prefab
131

131

00:07:54,699  -->  00:07:59,430
which also in the process we renamed
our script and renamed our class.
132

132

00:07:59,430  -->  00:08:02,340
So that's how we do our renaming,
great stuff well done,
133

133

00:08:02,340  -->  00:08:03,520
I'll see you in the next lecture.
