[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,005  -->  00:00:06,150
So in this video we're gonna
have a look at our level flow.
3

3

00:00:06,150  -->  00:00:09,960
I'm gonna show you a way to lay this out
using tilemap so that you can see all of
4

4

00:00:09,960  -->  00:00:13,600
your levels together, your scenes together
and your scenes in the hierarchy.
5

5

00:00:13,600  -->  00:00:17,150
And we'll talk about, well, what is it
that we wanna show in the very first scene
6

6

00:00:17,150  -->  00:00:19,750
and then the very second scene and
third scene, and so on.
7

7

00:00:19,750  -->  00:00:22,990
So we're talking about level flow,
and talking about level layout.
8

8

00:00:22,990  -->  00:00:23,782
Okay, let's do this.
9

9

00:00:23,782  -->  00:00:27,110
I'm gonna start by creating
a new folder over in my assets,
10

10

00:00:27,110  -->  00:00:30,280
over here that I shall call levels.
11

11

00:00:30,280  -->  00:00:32,510
Seems like a good thing
to call our levels.
12

12

00:00:32,510  -->  00:00:33,760
Make a little bit more room over here.
13

13

00:00:33,760  -->  00:00:35,230
Drop our sandbox.
14

14

00:00:35,230  -->  00:00:40,497
You know what,
I'm gonna rename sandbox to Level 1.
15

15

00:00:40,497  -->  00:00:42,561
Level 1, as we have it here.
16

16

00:00:42,561  -->  00:00:46,310
And we're gonna have a little bit of
a conversation about naming convention.
17

17

00:00:46,310  -->  00:00:50,960
Ben is a big fan of naming things
as the functionality of the level.
18

18

00:00:50,960  -->  00:00:52,300
I like that I think that's not too bad.
19

19

00:00:52,300  -->  00:00:55,330
For example,
we could call this single ladder level.
20

20

00:00:55,330  -->  00:00:58,840
Or we could call it two spikes or
we could call it learn to jump.
21

21

00:00:58,840  -->  00:01:01,210
I think that is an okay way to do it.
22

22

00:01:01,210  -->  00:01:04,260
I love a little bit old school in
terms of climb thing level one.
23

23

00:01:04,260  -->  00:01:09,044
Cuz then I know that level 3 needs to
have a certain thing to introduce it
24

24

00:01:09,044  -->  00:01:11,457
before the player gets to level 4.
25

25

00:01:11,457  -->  00:01:15,629
So, if you name it level 1, 2, 3, 4 and
you say, actually we need to have
26

26

00:01:15,629  -->  00:01:20,004
something in between level 2 and 3, that
could cause a whole bunch of annoyance
27

27

00:01:20,004  -->  00:01:23,575
when you have to go back and
rename the subsequent ones later one.
28

28

00:01:23,575  -->  00:01:27,449
I think there's a way around that
where you can have level 2A and
29

29

00:01:27,449  -->  00:01:28,697
level 3B and so on.
30

30

00:01:28,697  -->  00:01:32,795
I'm gonna show you something that
we'll do in the flow of this video.
31

31

00:01:32,795  -->  00:01:35,170
That means you can use either
of the naming systems and
32

32

00:01:35,170  -->  00:01:37,290
it's gonna work out pretty well, I reckon.
33

33

00:01:37,290  -->  00:01:39,890
I've got a pretty cool trick for
us to have a look at.
34

34

00:01:39,890  -->  00:01:43,560
But, first of all, we need to duplicate
a couple of extra levels for ourselves.
35

35

00:01:43,560  -->  00:01:47,600
So I'll do this after I've dropped
that into my Levels folder.
36

36

00:01:47,600  -->  00:01:48,580
In the Levels folder here.
37

37

00:01:48,580  -->  00:01:51,912
Level 1 I'm gonna duplicate, probably
call it level 2, which is done fantastic.
38

38

00:01:51,912  -->  00:01:58,721
And duplicate again level 3,
I'm going to rename to Main Menu.
39

39

00:01:58,721  -->  00:02:01,593
Here we go, we got a Main Menu,
a level 1 and a Level 2.
40

40

00:02:01,593  -->  00:02:05,417
Now there's a really neat trick,
that we can do here that I didn't discover
41

41

00:02:05,417  -->  00:02:09,690
until I've been using Unity for a while,
probably cuz I didn't have a need for it.
42

42

00:02:09,690  -->  00:02:12,240
But we can load multiple levels or
43

43

00:02:12,240  -->  00:02:15,980
multiple scenes at the same time
by dragging them into a hierarchy.
44

44

00:02:15,980  -->  00:02:19,560
So if I drag Main Menu over here,
you can see it's loaded it up.
45

45

00:02:19,560  -->  00:02:22,233
Now, they are exactly the same, so
we don't notice any difference.
46

46

00:02:22,233  -->  00:02:26,854
But what I am gonna do is highlight
all of the Elements underneath my
47

47

00:02:26,854  -->  00:02:29,670
Main M Menu scene, you can see in there.
48

48

00:02:29,670  -->  00:02:31,730
If I click on main menu itself,
this doesn't work,
49

49

00:02:31,730  -->  00:02:34,770
I have to click on everything
underneath it on the hierarchy.
50

50

00:02:34,770  -->  00:02:38,170
Click on my move tool and
then move it over to the left and
51

51

00:02:38,170  -->  00:02:44,410
I can visualize this scene,
this level next to this other level here.
52

52

00:02:44,410  -->  00:02:45,680
I probably messed this up a little bit,
53

53

00:02:45,680  -->  00:02:50,470
cuz I want to have my main menu being
at the center point, being at my 0,0.
54

54

00:02:50,470  -->  00:02:52,940
That's where I'm starting from,
so I'm gonna undo that move.
55

55

00:02:52,940  -->  00:02:56,560
Click on my level 1,
grab all of the timemap everything,
56

56

00:02:56,560  -->  00:03:00,040
big caveat to this strategy,
you can easily leave things behind.
57

57

00:03:00,040  -->  00:03:01,760
So this is not for the faint of heart.
58

58

00:03:01,760  -->  00:03:06,610
This is a technique that comes with a few
issues, but I think it helps me anyway.
59

59

00:03:06,610  -->  00:03:10,430
This is one of those things if you leave
it on the edge a little bit it can
60

60

00:03:10,430  -->  00:03:11,110
work pretty well.
61

61

00:03:11,110  -->  00:03:14,390
But just note you've got to be super
careful when you move things cuz you might
62

62

00:03:14,390  -->  00:03:17,610
accidentally leave your camera's behind
if you don't click on that properly.
63

63

00:03:17,610  -->  00:03:20,710
But now I can see,
here's my Main Menu on the left here and
64

64

00:03:20,710  -->  00:03:22,930
here's my level 1 on the right.
65

65

00:03:22,930  -->  00:03:28,010
And if we do the same thing for Level 2,
drag that over here into our hierarchy,
66

66

00:03:28,010  -->  00:03:31,430
I can highlight all of my content in
there and move it over to the right.
67

67

00:03:31,430  -->  00:03:35,750
And now I can visualize
the progression from the first level
68

68

00:03:35,750  -->  00:03:37,440
to the second level to the third level.
69

69

00:03:37,440  -->  00:03:39,850
Or in this case main and then 1 and 2.
70

70

00:03:39,850  -->  00:03:44,460
Which as a level designer,
as a game designer, this can be brilliant.
71

71

00:03:44,460  -->  00:03:47,880
Now you could just have using
tilemaps amazing abilities here,
72

72

00:03:47,880  -->  00:03:50,480
you could just have one gigantic level
73

73

00:03:50,480  -->  00:03:54,710
that has little areas that you kind of
go into and you can't get back from.
74

74

00:03:54,710  -->  00:03:56,240
The classic gating technique,
75

75

00:03:56,240  -->  00:03:59,398
let me just show you,
would be if we had a cliff down here.
76

76

00:03:59,398  -->  00:04:02,860
But now there's a nice big drop all
the way down to here, no way for
77

77

00:04:02,860  -->  00:04:04,870
the player to get back up there.
78

78

00:04:04,870  -->  00:04:07,045
That's what is called a gating mechanism.
79

79

00:04:07,045  -->  00:04:09,980
So I'm gonna show you this so
there's no confusion on this.
80

80

00:04:09,980  -->  00:04:12,940
What you need to do,
if I click Play Now, it creates havoc.
81

81

00:04:12,940  -->  00:04:16,510
If you've got all three of these levels
loaded, which one are we looking at?
82

82

00:04:16,510  -->  00:04:18,120
We're not exactly sure.
83

83

00:04:18,120  -->  00:04:21,624
But what I am sure about if
I go into the Scene View,
84

84

00:04:21,624  -->  00:04:26,145
I've got my other scenes where I
can see my other players there.
85

85

00:04:26,145  -->  00:04:28,944
They've all died at the same spot in
the same scene, but you can basically
86

86

00:04:28,944  -->  00:04:32,260
be moving around in all the scenes and the
camera doesn't quite know what it's doing.
87

87

00:04:32,260  -->  00:04:36,910
So be sure to unload the other two when
it comes time to actually looking at what
88

88

00:04:36,910  -->  00:04:37,480
you wanna look at.
89

89

00:04:37,480  -->  00:04:41,310
So I'm going to show you
this principle in level 1,
90

90

00:04:41,310  -->  00:04:44,070
which means I'll click
on main menu in level 2.
91

91

00:04:44,070  -->  00:04:48,250
Just clicking I'll roll these up
a little bit so I can see here.
92

92

00:04:48,250  -->  00:04:49,440
Roll these up.
93

93

00:04:49,440  -->  00:04:54,960
Okay, all right, Shift click on there,
right click and say, Unload Scene.
94

94

00:04:54,960  -->  00:04:57,977
And, yeah, we'll save that cuz we
moved them all around, which is cool.
95

95

00:04:57,977  -->  00:05:01,180
And then we size it, and
when we do that, we only see Level 1.
96

96

00:05:01,180  -->  00:05:03,090
We can only interact with Level 1.
97

97

00:05:03,090  -->  00:05:05,210
These two I can't do anything with.
98

98

00:05:05,210  -->  00:05:05,980
If I moved things around.
99

99

00:05:05,980  -->  00:05:09,100
If I hit Play then it's only
looking at level 1 in here.
100

100

00:05:09,100  -->  00:05:12,260
So I can have these just sitting
here all the time if I wanted to.
101

101

00:05:12,260  -->  00:05:14,140
I tend not to, I tend to clean then up and
102

102

00:05:14,140  -->  00:05:17,720
pop then back down in there
by saying Remove Scene.
103

103

00:05:17,720  -->  00:05:20,560
It doesn't delete it,
it just removes it from the hierarchy so
104

104

00:05:20,560  -->  00:05:21,620
we're not looking at it.
105

105

00:05:21,620  -->  00:05:25,550
So this is a flow I really like to
go through in this mechanism here.
106

106

00:05:25,550  -->  00:05:29,014
So I was talking about just briefly just a
little bit of level designing conversation
107

107

00:05:29,014  -->  00:05:29,761
is very briefly.
108

108

00:05:29,761  -->  00:05:33,699
Is the gating technique of if you wanted
to have one gigantic level in here,
109

109

00:05:33,699  -->  00:05:37,076
not worry about loading,
not worrying about any of that stuff,
110

110

00:05:37,076  -->  00:05:38,909
the player starts way down there.
111

111

00:05:38,909  -->  00:05:42,210
They have to make their way all the way
up to here and that's where we end it.
112

112

00:05:42,210  -->  00:05:45,970
You can totally do that using Tilemap,
that's one of the beauties of this tool,
113

113

00:05:45,970  -->  00:05:48,140
it's very lightweight in
terms of how it works.
114

114

00:05:48,140  -->  00:05:51,570
I could just get there and
say if I'm on the right layer here,
115

115

00:05:51,570  -->  00:05:54,030
if i'm on the foreground layer,
I could just go and
116

116

00:05:54,030  -->  00:05:58,640
make a nice big deep hole in here, since
the player runs along there they jump.
117

117

00:05:58,640  -->  00:06:00,230
And there's no way for
118

118

00:06:00,230  -->  00:06:03,600
the player to get back up into
here cuz that's too high a jump.
119

119

00:06:03,600  -->  00:06:08,590
So this is called a gating mechanism or
gating mechanic.
120

120

00:06:08,590  -->  00:06:10,890
Because essentially it
puts a gate on the player.
121

121

00:06:10,890  -->  00:06:13,010
They say you can't go
back through the gate.
122

122

00:06:13,010  -->  00:06:15,540
I gonna put back, I'm gonna undo all this.
123

123

00:06:15,540  -->  00:06:17,690
So We can get back up there.
124

124

00:06:17,690  -->  00:06:20,210
That would be a gating technique if
you wanted to have everything in
125

125

00:06:20,210  -->  00:06:21,160
one big huge level.
126

126

00:06:21,160  -->  00:06:23,910
But we're gonna do multiple levels so
we can flex our muscles and
127

127

00:06:23,910  -->  00:06:27,640
learn a few new techniques in terms of
loading from one level to the next, and
128

128

00:06:27,640  -->  00:06:30,480
having the player persist and
all those kinds of good things.
129

129

00:06:30,480  -->  00:06:33,170
So we've got our three levels in here.
130

130

00:06:33,170  -->  00:06:37,360
And what I want to do in this video and
this lecture,
131

131

00:06:37,360  -->  00:06:41,986
let me just load this again so
I can see them, load load.
132

132

00:06:41,986  -->  00:06:45,300
You wanna have a little bit
of a flow going from here.
133

133

00:06:45,300  -->  00:06:50,410
This Main Menu, in the future we're gonna
put just like a start button over the top
134

134

00:06:50,410  -->  00:06:52,170
of what's going on in here.
135

135

00:06:52,170  -->  00:06:55,960
But I want the player to have a chance
just to be able to move the controls left
136

136

00:06:55,960  -->  00:06:58,680
and right while the main menu is in there.
137

137

00:06:58,680  -->  00:07:02,120
But I want to have,
if I click on the Play in Main Menu.
138

138

00:07:02,120  -->  00:07:07,060
Should be able to see the camera
if I click on the Player, Cameras.
139

139

00:07:07,060  -->  00:07:07,660
Not so good.
140

140

00:07:07,660  -->  00:07:10,990
Sometimes these things aren't as easy to
visualize if the others are loaded so
141

141

00:07:10,990  -->  00:07:14,855
let me unload those,
unload that and unload level 1.
142

142

00:07:14,855  -->  00:07:16,575
Okay, now I can save all that.
143

143

00:07:16,575  -->  00:07:17,985
Now I can see the camera in here.
144

144

00:07:17,985  -->  00:07:20,695
I don't really want the play to be
running down here if it's a main menu.
145

145

00:07:20,695  -->  00:07:25,255
I want main menu just to be one
screens width and height so
146

146

00:07:25,255  -->  00:07:28,685
I can have a stop button on there and
the play can run left or right.
147

147

00:07:28,685  -->  00:07:33,420
In my first scene, so
my actual level 1, load scene here.
148

148

00:07:33,420  -->  00:07:36,180
I want the player just
to do something simple.
149

149

00:07:36,180  -->  00:07:39,540
Maybe we run up a ladder.
150

150

00:07:39,540  -->  00:07:40,630
Yeah, maybe just run up a ladder.
151

151

00:07:40,630  -->  00:07:42,090
Jump a couple of times.
152

152

00:07:42,090  -->  00:07:45,585
Jump over one single spike down here and
then get to a level exit,
153

153

00:07:45,585  -->  00:07:49,755
which we'll do in the next video,
that then takes them into the next scene.
154

154

00:07:49,755  -->  00:07:53,240
We'll load that scene, which would be
maybe a little bit more difficult.
155

155

00:07:53,240  -->  00:07:55,410
I'm gonna put the enemy in this one for
the first time.
156

156

00:07:55,410  -->  00:08:01,620
So the general kinda progression
of the game is we're introducing
157

157

00:08:01,620  -->  00:08:06,460
jumping over hazards in the first one and
then avoiding enemies in the second one.
158

158

00:08:06,460  -->  00:08:09,640
And then we can get more complex in
the third, in the fourth and so on.
159

159

00:08:09,640  -->  00:08:13,070
And as we build more features
we can build that into our game,
160

160

00:08:13,070  -->  00:08:14,930
we can add more things like pickups.
161

161

00:08:14,930  -->  00:08:19,120
And maybe if we were to do power boosts or
any of that kind of stuff or
162

162

00:08:19,120  -->  00:08:21,820
a rising water level,
we could do that in future scenes.
163

163

00:08:21,820  -->  00:08:27,410
So the challenge I've got for you in this
video is to construct your three levels.
164

164

00:08:27,410  -->  00:08:29,840
Put a bit more time into
it if you fancy yourself
165

165

00:08:29,840  -->  00:08:32,890
as practicing some of your
level design and flow.
166

166

00:08:32,890  -->  00:08:36,010
Less time in it if you just want
the mechanics and the functionality of it.
167

167

00:08:36,010  -->  00:08:38,570
Make sure they're short simple levels,
168

168

00:08:38,570  -->  00:08:42,140
we don't want huge things because we will
be adding more levels in the future, or
169

169

00:08:42,140  -->  00:08:46,310
you will be adding more levels and
more features and functionality.
170

170

00:08:46,310  -->  00:08:49,740
So don't make them too huge,
you don't wanna bore the player by having
171

171

00:08:49,740  -->  00:08:53,180
seven minutes of here's how you jump,
is what I'm saying.
172

172

00:08:53,180  -->  00:08:57,150
And if you find that you want to make
your middle, say level one here,
173

173

00:08:57,150  -->  00:09:01,510
wanna make it bigger and progress it
outside of the area that we've got.
174

174

00:09:01,510  -->  00:09:04,317
Then you can easily just pickup level 2,
and
175

175

00:09:04,317  -->  00:09:06,650
say, let's move level 2
down there a little bit.
176

176

00:09:06,650  -->  00:09:10,808
So management of these things become very
easy to move your entire levels around
177

177

00:09:10,808  -->  00:09:13,450
when you grab the first one and
the second one.
178

178

00:09:13,450  -->  00:09:16,541
Or we just grab the level 1 and
move that over to here,
179

179

00:09:16,541  -->  00:09:18,960
giving ourselves more space, and so on.
180

180

00:09:18,960  -->  00:09:20,605
So that's pretty easy to
move those around and
181

181

00:09:20,605  -->  00:09:22,680
is a great way to manage our level flow.
182

182

00:09:22,680  -->  00:09:25,050
So recapping the challenge here,
make some progression,
183

183

00:09:25,050  -->  00:09:30,020
create a main menu scene, level 1 scene,
and level 2 scene, as we've done here.
184

184

00:09:30,020  -->  00:09:33,990
Add logical progression using
our limited feature set.
185

185

00:09:33,990  -->  00:09:35,760
Acknowledge that we don't
have a lot at the moment so
186

186

00:09:35,760  -->  00:09:38,150
don't try to do too much with the levels.
187

187

00:09:38,150  -->  00:09:40,620
Just making interesting
with what we've got.
188

188

00:09:40,620  -->  00:09:43,100
And map out where the end
point will be in each.
189

189

00:09:43,100  -->  00:09:45,560
So, we know the next video where
we're gonna put out level loads.
190

190

00:09:45,560  -->  00:09:47,484
So, take some time,
pause the video now and
191

191

00:09:47,484  -->  00:09:50,361
make yourself a couple of levels
that the player can run through.
192

192

00:09:52,254  -->  00:09:53,410
Okay, welcome back.
193

193

00:09:53,410  -->  00:09:55,830
I'll briefly show you what I've
done with my three level here.
194

194

00:09:55,830  -->  00:09:58,660
This is the Main Menu,
Level 1 and Level 2.
195

195

00:09:58,660  -->  00:10:00,490
I'll unload level 1 and 2 just for
196

196

00:10:00,490  -->  00:10:03,500
the presence so
I can focus on my Main Menu screen.
197

197

00:10:03,500  -->  00:10:08,420
My goal here is so that as the big stop
button is on the screen, the start and
198

198

00:10:08,420  -->  00:10:12,210
the quick button and maybe an options,
if we get to that point in the future.
199

199

00:10:12,210  -->  00:10:15,790
Can be on the screen but at the same
time the player has some control for
200

200

00:10:15,790  -->  00:10:16,350
running around.
201

201

00:10:16,350  -->  00:10:18,850
So we'll do those menu
things in upcoming videos.
202

202

00:10:18,850  -->  00:10:21,150
But for now I just wanna make sure
that the camera doesn't move.
203

203

00:10:21,150  -->  00:10:25,800
Through that I've just gone and
disabled the state-driven camera.
204

204

00:10:25,800  -->  00:10:28,650
Just turn the whole thing off so
that all we're using here and
205

205

00:10:28,650  -->  00:10:31,040
the CineMachine Brain
is the important part.
206

206

00:10:31,040  -->  00:10:34,970
You can probably leave the state-driven
camera on actually and
207

207

00:10:34,970  -->  00:10:36,300
I'll turn it off now.
208

208

00:10:36,300  -->  00:10:39,030
But so long as you turn off
the CineMachine Brain we're back to our
209

209

00:10:39,030  -->  00:10:41,110
regular old orthographic camera.
210

210

00:10:41,110  -->  00:10:42,770
I've set the size to seven.
211

211

00:10:42,770  -->  00:10:45,130
I can move it around a little
bit to get my framing right.
212

212

00:10:45,130  -->  00:10:48,425
Then when I hit Play it's just
a regular camera that's not gonna move,
213

213

00:10:48,425  -->  00:10:52,650
gives the player an opportunity on
this first level just to move and
214

214

00:10:52,650  -->  00:10:55,020
jump so they can say,
that's what the controls are.
215

215

00:10:55,020  -->  00:10:55,910
You could even have this,
216

216

00:10:55,910  -->  00:10:59,800
the tutorial screen, we just have
a little keyboard layout there.
217

217

00:10:59,800  -->  00:11:03,810
The hit left to go left, hit right to
go right and hit space to jump, so
218

218

00:11:03,810  -->  00:11:06,480
you have that printed onto
the background if you wanted to.
219

219

00:11:06,480  -->  00:11:12,780
So that's our main menu screen and
then we would flow onto level 1.
220

220

00:11:12,780  -->  00:11:17,480
So load level 1 scene and
I will save and unload main menu.
221

221

00:11:18,480  -->  00:11:19,975
Just so it's not getting in the way,
222

222

00:11:19,975  -->  00:11:21,915
here pretty much the same
as what we had before.
223

223

00:11:21,915  -->  00:11:25,065
My goal here is to introduce
the player to hazards, and
224

224

00:11:25,065  -->  00:11:28,155
to show them they can jump over hazards.
225

225

00:11:28,155  -->  00:11:32,695
And to see very clearly that this is
a long pit with spikes down the bottom so
226

226

00:11:32,695  -->  00:11:36,395
straight away they can see ha,
spikes are a bad thing I should avoid, and
227

227

00:11:36,395  -->  00:11:38,575
a little bit of the curiosity to the left.
228

228

00:11:38,575  -->  00:11:40,215
My goal here is to introduce
the player to hazards, and
229

229

00:11:40,215  -->  00:11:41,435
to show them they can jump over hazards.
230

230

00:11:41,435  -->  00:11:43,508
My goal here is to introduce
the player to hazards, and
231

231

00:11:43,508  -->  00:11:45,440
to show them they can jump over hazards.
232

232

00:11:45,440  -->  00:11:46,960
Ever again and we've got a ladder here.
233

233

00:11:46,960  -->  00:11:49,312
My goal here is to introduce
the player to hazards, and
234

234

00:11:49,312  -->  00:11:51,350
to show them they can jump over hazards.
235

235

00:11:51,350  -->  00:11:55,320
And then for level 2,
I will unload level 1.
236

236

00:11:55,320  -->  00:12:00,930
Level 2 over here I started off with
the player with a fairly high drop.
237

237

00:12:00,930  -->  00:12:03,050
I wanted to be out of the camera view so
238

238

00:12:03,050  -->  00:12:05,840
it can teach the player it's
okay to drop as far as you want.
239

239

00:12:05,840  -->  00:12:07,390
So there's a little bit of the,
what do I do here?
240

240

00:12:07,390  -->  00:12:08,850
Can I reach that jump?
241

241

00:12:08,850  -->  00:12:11,640
And if we've got our camera stuff
on to show the player as well,
242

242

00:12:11,640  -->  00:12:14,800
if you do a little bit of a jiggle
then you get a bit more of a view
243

243

00:12:14,800  -->  00:12:17,480
when you're idling, then the camera
comes in if you want to show that.
244

244

00:12:17,480  -->  00:12:20,360
I can do a jump, bounce on the roof
up there and land here and
245

245

00:12:20,360  -->  00:12:21,950
see that, that's okay.
246

246

00:12:21,950  -->  00:12:24,030
The other thing is to
introduce enemies and
247

247

00:12:24,030  -->  00:12:26,640
to show them that the enemy
will run down that way.
248

248

00:12:26,640  -->  00:12:30,150
That's an opportunity to run up
the ladder, a nice simple kind of little
249

249

00:12:30,150  -->  00:12:33,940
puzzle down there, little super, super
simple puzzle, how to avoid the enemy.
250

250

00:12:33,940  -->  00:12:36,170
And then we've got a ladder up here.
251

251

00:12:36,170  -->  00:12:37,450
And run, run, run, run.
252

252

00:12:37,450  -->  00:12:40,280
The last thing I want to show
them is this mechanism of,
253

253

00:12:40,280  -->  00:12:41,810
this wall is too high to jump.
254

254

00:12:41,810  -->  00:12:45,010
So this gives the player an opportunity
within the first minute or
255

255

00:12:45,010  -->  00:12:47,305
two of the game to see exactly
how high they could jump.
256

256

00:12:47,305  -->  00:12:50,770
On this one is kind of three in height.
257

257

00:12:50,770  -->  00:12:53,380
They might not be counting out
the blocks the way you and I are doing.
258

258

00:12:53,380  -->  00:12:56,300
But they see roughly that height,
I can land on that.
259

259

00:12:56,300  -->  00:13:00,830
But I can't get back this way, so
that's the gate that I was clicking at.
260

260

00:13:00,830  -->  00:13:04,120
And we're teaching them that if
you get to a point where you land,
261

261

00:13:04,120  -->  00:13:05,770
you fall down on something.
262

262

00:13:05,770  -->  00:13:08,060
Then you might not be
able to get back again.
263

263

00:13:08,060  -->  00:13:10,550
And then just a big ladder ahead,
and the scene, and
264

264

00:13:10,550  -->  00:13:12,210
this would be where the exit would be.
265

265

00:13:12,210  -->  00:13:14,980
So that's some level flow and progression.
266

266

00:13:14,980  -->  00:13:19,150
Laying out our levels in a way that
we can see them all at the same time.
267

267

00:13:19,150  -->  00:13:21,920
So that we can make decisions about
the flow and the progression.
268

268

00:13:21,920  -->  00:13:25,970
And in the next video, we'll add
ourselves a level exit mechanism, so
269

269

00:13:25,970  -->  00:13:28,030
that we can actually go
from here to here to here.
270

270

00:13:28,030  -->  00:13:29,390
I'll see you in the next video.
