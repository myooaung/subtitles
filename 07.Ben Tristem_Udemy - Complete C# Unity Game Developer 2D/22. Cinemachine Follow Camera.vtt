2

00:00:04.160  -->  00:00:07.702
Hello again, I am super excited for
this video cuz we are setting up our
3

3

00:00:07.702  -->  00:00:11.199
Cinemachine Follow Camera so
that we can move our character around.
4

4

00:00:11.199  -->  00:00:14.568
We have a dead zone, we have a look ahead,
and we have a dampening so
5

5

00:00:14.568  -->  00:00:17.713
that the whole game feels really
professional and polished.
6

6

00:00:17.713  -->  00:00:20.840
So let's just im and
create our follow cam.
7

7

00:00:20.840  -->  00:00:22.693
For the sake of completeness,
8

8

00:00:22.693  -->  00:00:27.109
I wanna show you how we would go about
creating a follow camera if we would,
9

9

00:00:27.109  -->  00:00:30.476
using cinamachine,
I guess we'll call it the old way.
10

10

00:00:30.476  -->  00:00:32.669
I'll just very quickly show you this,
we're not gonna do it, but
11

11

00:00:32.669  -->  00:00:34.170
I just wanna show you so
you know how it works.
12

12

00:00:34.170  -->  00:00:37.480
We would have our player,
sorry our main camera, and
13

13

00:00:37.480  -->  00:00:39.850
on our main camera we would add a script.
14

14

00:00:39.850  -->  00:00:44.270
That script we would call something like,
FollowCam, and then we would start by
15

15

00:00:44.270  -->  00:00:48.820
finding ObjectOfTypePlayer, so that we
know that we're looking for the player.
16

16

00:00:48.820  -->  00:00:52.597
So, that is what we're gonna
tell the camera to look at, and
17

17

00:00:52.597  -->  00:00:56.969
then each frame we would create
a new Vector2, which is the player's
18

18

00:00:56.969  -->  00:01:01.213
transform position on x and
the player's transform position on y.
19

19

00:01:01.213  -->  00:01:04.950
So basically we're saying our new Vector2
is, where is the player on x and y?
20

20

00:01:04.950  -->  00:01:09.820
And then we would say the position
of the camera is a new Vector3,
21

21

00:01:09.820  -->  00:01:15.890
cuz cameras are in, let me switch to 3D
here, our camera is actually in 3D space.
22

22

00:01:15.890  -->  00:01:19.763
So we are saying our camera
has Vector3 of the new,
23

23

00:01:19.763  -->  00:01:24.086
that we just established at the top,
the new x position,
24

24

00:01:24.086  -->  00:01:27.983
the new y position and
then our current z position.
25

25

00:01:27.983  -->  00:01:31.274
So, that's the way we have
been doing follow cams for
26

26

00:01:31.274  -->  00:01:34.345
sometime, not too bad,
it works, it's okay but
27

27

00:01:34.345  -->  00:01:39.191
it doesn't have anyway near the power or
the awesomeness of the Cinemachine.
28

28

00:01:39.191  -->  00:01:43.741
And as we're gonna see in our Cinemachine
implementation It is super simple simple
29

29

00:01:43.741  -->  00:01:46.601
to do and we don't even need
to get into our script and
30

30

00:01:46.601  -->  00:01:49.530
do any coding to get some
really cool functionality.
31

31

00:01:49.530  -->  00:01:54.361
So first of all we're going to go and
grab Cinemachine, I'm gonna download and
32

32

00:01:54.361  -->  00:01:56.174
import from the Asset Store.
33

33

00:01:56.174  -->  00:02:00.395
In future versions of Unity we
will be importing Cinemachine from
34

34

00:02:00.395  -->  00:02:05.250
within standard assets or
from within the package management system.
35

35

00:02:05.250  -->  00:02:09.734
But for now in 2017.3 I'm going to
have to go to the Asset Store and
36

36

00:02:09.734  -->  00:02:13.496
click Import, and
import all the aspects of Cinemachine.
37

37

00:02:13.496  -->  00:02:16.174
That'll drop it into our
assets folder down here,
38

38

00:02:16.174  -->  00:02:19.746
which means we have the full
Cinemachine down here ready to rumble.
39

39

00:02:19.746  -->  00:02:24.080
I'd like to tidy things up by keeping
all of these standard asset, type
40

40

00:02:24.080  -->  00:02:27.290
things in my standard asset folder, so
I'm just going to drag it down in there.
41

41

00:02:27.290  -->  00:02:30.960
Jump back over into the scene view when it
finishes doing what it needs to do with
42

42

00:02:30.960  -->  00:02:36.270
its importing and scripts, cool,
back in our scene, okay now, we are ready.
43

43

00:02:36.270  -->  00:02:40.420
The main thing to know about
Cinemachine is that it
44

44

00:02:40.420  -->  00:02:43.720
isn't creating new cameras it's
creating new virtual camera.
45

45

00:02:43.720  -->  00:02:47.540
So we still keep our main cameras, so
I had showed you this moments ago,
46

46

00:02:47.540  -->  00:02:48.953
this is still our camera.
47

47

00:02:48.953  -->  00:02:53.678
And on our camera we put what is called
a Cinemachine brain, and in that brain,
48

48

00:02:53.678  -->  00:02:56.270
will drive any virtual cameras we create.
49

49

00:02:56.270  -->  00:03:00.480
So a Cinemachine is a way for us to
create, another virtual camera here and
50

50

00:03:00.480  -->  00:03:02.790
another virtual camera there and
virtual camera there or
51

51

00:03:02.790  -->  00:03:04.870
even virtual camera in the same spot.
52

52

00:03:04.870  -->  00:03:08.215
And then quickly switch between them and
give them different setups and
53

53

00:03:08.215  -->  00:03:11.237
different parameters, so
that we can create different shots.
54

54

00:03:11.237  -->  00:03:14.695
If itâ€™s a 3D world then we can use it for
a cut scene where we show a totally
55

55

00:03:14.695  -->  00:03:17.598
different scene that's going
on in a different spot.
56

56

00:03:17.598  -->  00:03:21.900
In our 2D game here we're just gonna use
it to give some different tuning and
57

57

00:03:21.900  -->  00:03:25.720
different flavor to what
we see within our world.
58

58

00:03:25.720  -->  00:03:30.620
So let's start at the start,
click on your Main Camera&gt; Add Component,
59

59

00:03:30.620  -->  00:03:31.970
and search for brain.
60

60

00:03:31.970  -->  00:03:36.140
This is the Cenemachine brain that I
was talking about just a moment ago,
61

61

00:03:36.140  -->  00:03:38.410
now that's all we need to do for
our main camera.
62

62

00:03:38.410  -->  00:03:41.046
The main camera we can just
leave that as main camera,
63

63

00:03:41.046  -->  00:03:45.031
it's still the camera that we see our game
through, and it's set up ready to go,
64

64

00:03:45.031  -->  00:03:48.162
the Cinemachine we don't need to go and
park around with that.
65

65

00:03:48.162  -->  00:03:51.601
It will be set up based upon
what we do without other rules,
66

66

00:03:51.601  -->  00:03:55.350
without other cameras, so
it's good thre for the moment.
67

67

00:03:55.350  -->  00:03:58.758
I wanna create a new empty Just
to organize my cameras, so
68

68

00:03:58.758  -->  00:04:02.876
I'll call this cameras,
we'll reset the transform, cuz we may add
69

69

00:04:02.876  -->  00:04:07.428
some other virtual cameras that we can
drive around as part of this process.
70

70

00:04:07.428  -->  00:04:12.120
I'll drag main camera down under cameras,
and there we have it.
71

71

00:04:12.120  -->  00:04:16.020
I just wanna show you while we're there
that the Unity documentation is a little
72

72

00:04:16.020  -->  00:04:19.180
bit hard to find on Cinemachine,
I've given you the resources.
73

73

00:04:19.180  -->  00:04:23.065
This is an excellent source, it's tons and
tons of stuff about Cinemachine.
74

74

00:04:23.065  -->  00:04:26.249
If there's anything we talk about that
you wanna cover in a bit more detail,
75

75

00:04:26.249  -->  00:04:27.554
jump into here and have a look.
76

76

00:04:27.554  -->  00:04:29.541
In particular, if you're going back and
77

77

00:04:29.541  -->  00:04:33.530
retrofitting Cinemachine into our 3D
games, which I totally recommend.
78

78

00:04:33.530  -->  00:04:36.700
And from our couple of videos, you'll
have the knowledge on how to do that.
79

79

00:04:36.700  -->  00:04:39.490
Go back and put it into Project Boost and
80

80

00:04:39.490  -->  00:04:43.710
see if you can work some magic back there
in our previous sections of the course.
81

81

00:04:43.710  -->  00:04:46.345
Okay, so now that we've got our
main camera, let's get in and
82

82

00:04:46.345  -->  00:04:49.502
do it in this game, come on, Rick,
let's get it, let's make it happen.
83

83

00:04:49.502  -->  00:04:55.214
Okay, so our main camera, let's create
our first Cinemachine&gt; 2Do Camera,
84

84

00:04:55.214  -->  00:04:59.370
so this is a virtual camera,
we've got a bunch in here.
85

85

00:04:59.370  -->  00:05:03.620
Some of them are 3D cameras which we're
just we're talking about all the graphics
86

86

00:05:03.620  -->  00:05:07.943
and perspective if you create a 3D camera,
then you'll see a field of view option.
87

87

00:05:07.943  -->  00:05:12.049
If you create a 2D camera then
you will see a down here the all
88

88

00:05:12.049  -->  00:05:14.030
the graphics size options.
89

89

00:05:14.030  -->  00:05:17.060
So that's mostly the difference
between the two but this is size,
90

90

00:05:17.060  -->  00:05:18.390
the other has field of view.
91

91

00:05:18.390  -->  00:05:22.409
I'm just going to parent that underneath
cameras I'll show that under the cameras.
92

92

00:05:22.409  -->  00:05:26.867
Okay, so we've got our first virtual
camera, and what we wanna look for
93

93

00:05:26.867  -->  00:05:29.440
in here is what does this camera point at?
94

94

00:05:29.440  -->  00:05:31.950
So pretty easy, we've got follow in here,
we've got none at the moment.
95

95

00:05:31.950  -->  00:05:35.860
Click the Selector and I'm going to
tell it to look at the player all right,
96

96

00:05:35.860  -->  00:05:38.290
we could just drag the player in there,
that's all we need to do.
97

97

00:05:38.290  -->  00:05:41.320
We don't need to do a look at because
we're not gonna be rotating the camera for
98

98

00:05:41.320  -->  00:05:45.550
now, this is good to go
with our camera here.
99

99

00:05:45.550  -->  00:05:48.661
The other thing, and you can see straight
away if you've got your game window,
100

100

00:05:48.661  -->  00:05:51.649
I've got the scene in game side by side,
so let's have a look at that there.
101

101

00:05:51.649  -->  00:05:54.468
You can see straight away
we've got all of these guides
102

102

00:05:54.468  -->  00:05:56.250
that are happening on our camera.
103

103

00:05:56.250  -->  00:05:58.858
If you click this check box here,
if you don't have that,
104

104

00:05:58.858  -->  00:06:02.437
then you can turn the guides on and off,
and that will show you what's going on.
105

105

00:06:02.437  -->  00:06:05.957
So at the moment our camera,
you can see is this blue area in here, and
106

106

00:06:05.957  -->  00:06:08.620
the red area is the part
that we wouldn't see.
107

107

00:06:08.620  -->  00:06:10.910
If we change the size of our camera,
108

108

00:06:10.910  -->  00:06:15.860
you can see that'll change where we see,
in terms of how much of the world see.
109

109

00:06:15.860  -->  00:06:19.750
I think the autographic size is seven,
is pretty good for what we're doing here.
110

110

00:06:19.750  -->  00:06:24.739
And now just run that simple
step of adding the player to
111

111

00:06:24.739  -->  00:06:26.917
the flow if we hit Play.
112

112

00:06:26.917  -->  00:06:31.545
When we move our character around in our
game we'll just make our game a little bit
113

113

00:06:31.545  -->  00:06:34.146
bigger here, we move our character around.
114

114

00:06:34.146  -->  00:06:39.000
The camera is following the character,
so simple to do that as a follow camera.
115

115

00:06:39.000  -->  00:06:41.910
Now you've probably already started to
think there is something interesting
116

116

00:06:41.910  -->  00:06:46.520
going here with these different colors and
different framing.
117

117

00:06:46.520  -->  00:06:50.563
Let's have a look at that and dig into it,
so these guides in here are showing us
118

118

00:06:50.563  -->  00:06:53.714
mostly it's showing us the dead spot here,
the dead space.
119

119

00:06:53.714  -->  00:06:55.130
Dead Space, that's a video game isn't it?
120

120

00:06:55.130  -->  00:06:57.970
Dead zone, there we go, so
let's have a look at the dead zone.
121

121

00:06:57.970  -->  00:07:00.780
First of all we've got the dead
zone width down here under body,
122

122

00:07:00.780  -->  00:07:03.920
you can see make sure
you're framing transposer.
123

123

00:07:03.920  -->  00:07:06.522
If you're not framing transposer,
you're just on transposer,
124

124

00:07:06.522  -->  00:07:07.831
you might not see all that stuff.
125

125

00:07:07.831  -->  00:07:09.971
So we need to make sure
we're framing transposer so
126

126

00:07:09.971  -->  00:07:11.670
we can see what's going on here.
127

127

00:07:11.670  -->  00:07:14.460
The yellow dot is where the camera is
128

128

00:07:14.460  -->  00:07:18.080
looking at the moment that's the middle
reference point of the camera.
129

129

00:07:18.080  -->  00:07:23.228
And the space around here is the dead
zone, if we increase the dead zone width,
130

130

00:07:23.228  -->  00:07:27.605
we can run within the dead zone and
the camera doesn't move at all.
131

131

00:07:27.605  -->  00:07:30.480
It's only when we get to the edge of
the dead zone, we have a bit of a follow.
132

132

00:07:30.480  -->  00:07:31.764
Now why do we wanna do that?
133

133

00:07:31.764  -->  00:07:35.463
Well, if we have zero dead zone in here,
if we put all the way down zero on,
134

134

00:07:35.463  -->  00:07:39.105
then the moment we move, well and
if we have to turn down damping as well,
135

135

00:07:39.105  -->  00:07:40.811
I'll get to damping in a moment.
136

136

00:07:40.811  -->  00:07:44.173
our camera is locked
directly on the player, and
137

137

00:07:44.173  -->  00:07:48.030
that's okay if that's the sort
of game we're making.
138

138

00:07:48.030  -->  00:07:51.930
But, it feels very jarring,
particularly when you jump, if I turn down
139

139

00:07:51.930  -->  00:07:57.630
the dampening which says how fast
the camera is gonna follow me up and down.
140

140

00:07:57.630  -->  00:07:59.876
When I jump it more literally jumps,
141

141

00:07:59.876  -->  00:08:04.158
it can be very jarring when
everything's moving directly like that.
142

142

00:08:04.158  -->  00:08:08.830
So, we have a little bit of dampening
to smooth the flow when the camera,
143

143

00:08:08.830  -->  00:08:12.440
how quickly the camera
follows this when we move.
144

144

00:08:12.440  -->  00:08:18.609
If we increase the dampening way up, then
you can see it takes a while to catch us.
145

145

00:08:18.609  -->  00:08:20.743
And then if we increase
the dead zone width,
146

146

00:08:20.743  -->  00:08:24.830
that's showing us when the camera says
okay now I've gotta go catch this guy.
147

147

00:08:24.830  -->  00:08:28.020
So as soon as we get out of the dead zone,
now it says I'll catch up, so
148

148

00:08:28.020  -->  00:08:30.610
dampening is way too slow.
149

149

00:08:30.610  -->  00:08:32.420
I think around about one is pretty good,
150

150

00:08:32.420  -->  00:08:36.003
the dead zone I think is reasonably good
as well, you can play around with this.
151

151

00:08:36.003  -->  00:08:37.050
It's gotta be the challenge for
152

152

00:08:37.050  -->  00:08:39.670
this video is to play around with your
settings to get it the way you feel.
153

153

00:08:39.670  -->  00:08:45.410
But that in essence is the fundamentals
of having a follow camera and
154

154

00:08:45.410  -->  00:08:48.960
getting that amount of play and
dampening and dead zone that you like.
155

155

00:08:48.960  -->  00:08:52.130
The other thing we'll look at
briefly is the look ahead time, so
156

156

00:08:52.130  -->  00:08:54.430
if you turn the look ahead time way up.
157

157

00:08:54.430  -->  00:08:59.198
Then you can see the camera tries to
look very quickly when I move left and
158

158

00:08:59.198  -->  00:09:02.709
right so the yellow is where
it's trying to look to.
159

159

00:09:02.709  -->  00:09:07.387
It's following the middle of the camera
controls as opposed to literally
160

160

00:09:07.387  -->  00:09:08.690
the character.
161

161

00:09:08.690  -->  00:09:11.381
So, if I turn this all the way
down then the yellow dot and
162

162

00:09:11.381  -->  00:09:12.756
the character are the same,
163

163

00:09:12.756  -->  00:09:16.444
and the character is determining exactly
what's going on with the camera.
164

164

00:09:16.444  -->  00:09:21.141
But if you turn out very high then there's
a lot more of the camera involved and
165

165

00:09:21.141  -->  00:09:24.474
the character tries to catch
up to where the camera is.
166

166

00:09:24.474  -->  00:09:26.681
And then you can put some
smoothing on that, so
167

167

00:09:26.681  -->  00:09:30.257
it's a bit of a smoother transition as
well, in terms of how that happens.
168

168

00:09:30.257  -->  00:09:34.964
Now it's more apparent than when we jump,
see when we jump the camera's is going way
169

169

00:09:34.964  -->  00:09:38.300
up and then way down based upon
what it thinks is happening.
170

170

00:09:38.300  -->  00:09:41.544
So, for our game I don't think we
need a lot of look ahead time or
171

171

00:09:41.544  -->  00:09:42.782
look ahead smoothing.
172

172

00:09:42.782  -->  00:09:45.988
I think it can be pretty close where
the character is actually pretty tight
173

173

00:09:45.988  -->  00:09:49.190
controls is what we're going for
in our particular game here.
174

174

00:09:49.190  -->  00:09:51.996
And the settings down below
those relates more to 3D so
175

175

00:09:51.996  -->  00:09:54.253
I'm not gonna dive in
to that at the moment.
176

176

00:09:54.253  -->  00:09:57.650
Just while we're here we were aiming at
a particular object than we have a whole
177

177

00:09:57.650  -->  00:10:01.010
bunch of aim controls, we're not doing
that we're just moving the camera.
178

178

00:10:01.010  -->  00:10:05.190
We're not moving how the camera
changes it's rotation to the point of
179

179

00:10:05.190  -->  00:10:08.470
the characters, that's why we're not
gonna do any changes to the aims.
180

180

00:10:08.470  -->  00:10:11.620
But if you've got a 3D game where you're
setting up your Cinemachine cameras
181

181

00:10:11.620  -->  00:10:14.110
then aim is certainly
something to play around with.
182

182

00:10:14.110  -->  00:10:17.028
Some of the other things we will
get to in the very next video, so
183

183

00:10:17.028  -->  00:10:20.331
to wrap up this lecture, I'd like for
you to set up your follow camera,
184

184

00:10:20.331  -->  00:10:22.887
tune your camera to give
the feel you want in your game.
185

185

00:10:22.887  -->  00:10:25.680
Pay attention to the overall camera size,
so
186

186

00:10:25.680  -->  00:10:28.480
I was showing you here
the autographic size.
187

187

00:10:28.480  -->  00:10:31.715
It's just gonna show you how little
our character is on the screen or
188

188

00:10:31.715  -->  00:10:34.550
how big our character is on the screen,
so if you wanna go for
189

189

00:10:34.550  -->  00:10:38.470
something really quite extreme like that,
and I'm all for extreme tuning.
190

190

00:10:38.470  -->  00:10:42.280
That's how you find weird, cool games that
you didn't even know could have existed,
191

191

00:10:42.280  -->  00:10:44.630
what sort of strange game play
can sort of come up with.
192

192

00:10:44.630  -->  00:10:48.022
If you have this massively zoomed in kinda
game, that could be a little bit of fun,
193

193

00:10:48.022  -->  00:10:50.740
or it could be frustrating but
you never know until you try.
194

194

00:10:50.740  -->  00:10:54.544
So the overall camera size, the dead zone
that we played around with the look ahead,
195

195

00:10:54.544  -->  00:10:56.863
I'd recommend keeping
a pretty much where to use.
196

196

00:10:56.863  -->  00:10:59.937
But you might find a cool different
tuning that really works for
197

197

00:10:59.937  -->  00:11:02.439
your particular game and
style you're going for.
198

198

00:11:02.439  -->  00:11:05.209
So jumping, tune your follow camera,
get a feel for it,
199

199

00:11:05.209  -->  00:11:09.330
get comfortable with Cinemachine and we'll
do more Cinemachine in the next video.
