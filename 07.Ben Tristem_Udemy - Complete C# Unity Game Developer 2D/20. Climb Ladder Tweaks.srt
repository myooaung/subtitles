00:00:04,170  -->  00:00:06,370
Okay, so
quick video to address a couple of tweaks,
2

2

00:00:06,370  -->  00:00:08,580
a couple of issues we have
with our ladder climbing.
3

3

00:00:08,580  -->  00:00:12,890
First of all, as our player climbs,
if you exit while your still moving up,
4

4

00:00:12,890  -->  00:00:17,630
then he stays in his running up the ladder
state and that's a bug we want to remove.
5

5

00:00:17,630  -->  00:00:20,480
The other is that the player
slowly drifts back down to Earth,
6

6

00:00:20,480  -->  00:00:23,400
which you might think that's cool,
that could be a good feature but...
7

7

00:00:23,400  -->  00:00:26,630
For those of us wanting
to not make it a dance to
8

8

00:00:26,630  -->  00:00:30,070
stay near the platform if
there's an enemy nearby.
9

9

00:00:30,070  -->  00:00:34,100
We'll implement something just to stop
the players sliding back down the ladder.
10

10

00:00:34,100  -->  00:00:36,760
Let's jump in and
have a look at how we're going to do that.
11

11

00:00:36,760  -->  00:00:38,480
Jump over to the- saying jump a lot.
12

12

00:00:38,480  -->  00:00:40,470
You know when you implement
a jump into your game,
13

13

00:00:40,470  -->  00:00:42,670
then you just say jump, jump, jump, jump.
14

14

00:00:42,670  -->  00:00:46,340
Okay, so let's hop over [LAUGH]
into our script, over here.
15

15

00:00:46,340  -->  00:00:48,160
I've just noticed one thing,
my climb ladder,
16

16

00:00:48,160  -->  00:00:52,600
you can see the order of my methods,
here, run, climb ladder, jump, and so on.
17

17

00:00:52,600  -->  00:00:55,640
They are different in my updates,
so for those of you who are OCD,
18

18

00:00:55,640  -->  00:00:58,410
you're probably yelling at the screen,
saying, that doesn't make sense.
19

19

00:00:58,410  -->  00:01:01,280
So we'll say run, then climb ladder,
jump, foot's right,
20

20

00:01:01,280  -->  00:01:05,990
doesn't make any difference whatsoever to
anything but the order of the universe has
21

21

00:01:05,990  -->  00:01:10,130
now been restored, climb ladder is
in its appropriate spot, fantastic.
22

22

00:01:10,130  -->  00:01:13,830
Let's have a look at climb ladder, we can
say, we see that if we are not touching
23

23

00:01:13,830  -->  00:01:18,390
the climbing layer then return
otherwise do the stuff down here.
24

24

00:01:18,390  -->  00:01:23,530
We've got our animation state has been
told to transition into climbing.
25

25

00:01:23,530  -->  00:01:27,530
And we're not elegantly transitioning
back away from climbing again,
26

26

00:01:27,530  -->  00:01:29,860
because we can get stuck
in that particular state.
27

27

00:01:29,860  -->  00:01:33,550
So right at the top here we're gonna
implement something that just if we're not
28

28

00:01:33,550  -->  00:01:40,410
touching, then we will say, we will
change the animation state to be false.
29

29

00:01:40,410  -->  00:01:43,970
So I'm going to copy my animator down
here, copy this, drop it in there.
30

30

00:01:43,970  -->  00:01:46,750
We could say that player
has vertical speed or
31

31

00:01:46,750  -->  00:01:49,480
we could just straight up say false.
32

32

00:01:49,480  -->  00:01:54,093
That way we know if we're not touching
a layer that is defined as climbing,
33

33

00:01:54,093  -->  00:01:57,988
then you should just not be climbing and
set yourself to false.
34

34

00:01:57,988  -->  00:02:00,870
We have a return in there Just so
it's nice and clear.
35

35

00:02:00,870  -->  00:02:04,370
And we'll hop back over into our scene and
36

36

00:02:04,370  -->  00:02:07,790
see if that resolves our challenge,
climb up the ladder holding up.
37

37

00:02:07,790  -->  00:02:09,450
So make sure everything else is fine.
38

38

00:02:09,450  -->  00:02:11,620
Jumping, okay, no weed stake going on.
39

39

00:02:11,620  -->  00:02:15,680
Climb up the ladder and
as we hop off, yeah,
40

40

00:02:15,680  -->  00:02:19,510
it returns to where it should be,
excellent.
41

41

00:02:19,510  -->  00:02:22,160
And the last part of this lecture is
we're gonna stop our player sliding
42

42

00:02:22,160  -->  00:02:22,680
down the ladder.
43

43

00:02:22,680  -->  00:02:26,430
And the way we're going to do that
is by setting the gravity to zero
44

44

00:02:26,430  -->  00:02:27,960
when the player is on the ladder.
45

45

00:02:27,960  -->  00:02:30,000
Now that's not really
the way ladders work.
46

46

00:02:30,000  -->  00:02:33,940
I don't know if you've climbed up to clean
the gutter, clean the leaves out of your
47

47

00:02:33,940  -->  00:02:36,479
gutter recently, but when you're on
the ladder you're not in zero gravity.
48

48

00:02:36,479  -->  00:02:38,570
[LAUGH] It doesn't quite work that way.
49

49

00:02:38,570  -->  00:02:42,720
But this is a video game and we're using
it as a way to simulate, we want to player
50

50

00:02:42,720  -->  00:02:45,850
not to move, after all, we're jumping
about five times our body height and
51

51

00:02:45,850  -->  00:02:48,000
we're not breaking our legs when
we slam back down to Earth.
52

52

00:02:48,000  -->  00:02:52,610
So we're suspending a little bit of
our physics normality and reality and
53

53

00:02:52,610  -->  00:02:54,450
we're taking a few poetic licenses here.
54

54

00:02:54,450  -->  00:02:57,980
So that's the technique we're gonna use
is just to set the gravity to zero.
55

55

00:02:57,980  -->  00:03:00,360
And this is where I'm
gonna set you a challenge.
56

56

00:03:00,360  -->  00:03:03,348
The challenge is to
Stop The Player Sliding down the ladder.
57

57

00:03:03,348  -->  00:03:07,278
I want you to Set the starting
gravity on the player's RigidBody
58

58

00:03:07,278  -->  00:03:09,690
to the RigidBody's current gravity.
59

59

00:03:09,690  -->  00:03:13,890
So when we first start we need
to know this is what the gravity
60

60

00:03:13,890  -->  00:03:16,480
is on the RigidBody on the player and
61

61

00:03:16,480  -->  00:03:20,930
then when the player is on
the ladder Set that gravity to zero.
62

62

00:03:20,930  -->  00:03:22,150
So here's a few clues for you.
63

63

00:03:22,150  -->  00:03:25,580
It's a little bit ambiguous, but
it's enough to get going to figure out
64

64

00:03:25,580  -->  00:03:29,310
that there is something to do with
gravity on the player's RigidBody and
65

65

00:03:29,310  -->  00:03:32,770
you need to set it at the start, so
that we know what it sets off at.
66

66

00:03:32,770  -->  00:03:34,800
And then we need to set it to zero and
67

67

00:03:34,800  -->  00:03:38,100
then return it back to
from whence it came.
68

68

00:03:38,100  -->  00:03:39,810
So to make sure that you
return the gravity back
69

69

00:03:39,810  -->  00:03:41,280
to normal when you're off the ladder.
70

70

00:03:41,280  -->  00:03:43,350
So jump in, give that challenge a shot and
71

71

00:03:43,350  -->  00:03:47,110
I will see you when you have
got some sort of result.
72

72

00:03:50,275  -->  00:03:55,840
Right, so let's start by giving ourselves
some sort of cached reference here.
73

73

00:03:55,840  -->  00:04:00,820
We will say float, we'll call this gravity
74

74

00:04:00,820  -->  00:04:06,690
scale at start because we will be using
gravity scale and then in our start
75

75

00:04:06,690  -->  00:04:12,050
method here we need a way of saying what
is our gravity at the start of the get go.
76

76

00:04:12,050  -->  00:04:18,840
So, we'll say gravity scale at start
equals my rigid body dot gravity scale.
77

77

00:04:20,954  -->  00:04:24,730
Okay, so we are establishing that
the gravity at start is myrigidbody.
78

78

00:04:24,730  -->  00:04:26,260
That's the rigid body on the player.
79

79

00:04:26,260  -->  00:04:28,214
And it will be set at the gravity scale,
80

80

00:04:28,214  -->  00:04:31,245
which is the current gravity
scale that affects the player.
81

81

00:04:31,245  -->  00:04:35,727
If you take a look at the player
you can see player rigid body 2D,
82

82

00:04:35,727  -->  00:04:38,910
we can see gravity scale just here is one.
83

83

00:04:38,910  -->  00:04:40,770
So we don't want to go manually
messing around with that.
84

84

00:04:40,770  -->  00:04:43,300
It's already field that we can access.
85

85

00:04:43,300  -->  00:04:45,040
It's been serialized as a field.
86

86

00:04:45,040  -->  00:04:49,660
So if it is one at the start,
then we have accessed it here as one, and
87

87

00:04:49,660  -->  00:04:54,550
then under our climb ladder method,
what do you wanna do here?
88

88

00:04:54,550  -->  00:04:59,850
We want to, within our starting point,
we need to make sure that we establish
89

89

00:04:59,850  -->  00:05:03,440
If you're not touching the layer,
the climbing layer,
90

90

00:05:03,440  -->  00:05:11,929
to have myrigidbody.gravityScale
= gravityScaleStart.
91

91

00:05:11,929  -->  00:05:14,460
So any time you're not on the ladder,
92

92

00:05:14,460  -->  00:05:17,720
then make sure your gravity scale
is whatever it was at the start.
93

93

00:05:17,720  -->  00:05:21,415
Any time you are on the ladder,
then let's set your gravity scale,
94

94

00:05:21,415  -->  00:05:27,000
myrigidbody,gravityScale =
just straight up 0
95

95

00:05:27,000  -->  00:05:32,040
there we go okay you could serialize
that and make it a smaller amount if
96

96

00:05:32,040  -->  00:05:35,570
you wanted to have a little bit of gentle
gentle kind of gliding down the ladder but
97

97

00:05:35,570  -->  00:05:41,270
we'll set it at 0 pop back over
into our scene click on play.
98

98

00:05:45,553  -->  00:05:51,880
Now, if we move around, our player snaps
to the ladder, stands there nice and tall.
99

99

00:05:51,880  -->  00:05:57,590
And I like the way that the state
transitions back to the idle state,
100

100

00:05:57,590  -->  00:05:58,320
I think that's good.
101

101

00:05:58,320  -->  00:06:00,270
That implies that I can get on and
off the ladder.
102

102

00:06:00,270  -->  00:06:03,550
Some games you get locked on the ladder
and you can only leave the ladder when
103

103

00:06:03,550  -->  00:06:05,750
you're right at the very top,
that's the only time you can leave.
104

104

00:06:05,750  -->  00:06:08,560
But I like the fact that this shows
the player no, you can actually
105

105

00:06:08,560  -->  00:06:12,820
just run off the ladder at any point
in time, jumping snaps the ladder.
106

106

00:06:12,820  -->  00:06:14,680
Okay, I think this is
all feeling pretty nice.
107

107

00:06:14,680  -->  00:06:16,010
I quite like this.
108

108

00:06:16,010  -->  00:06:17,270
Okay, mission accomplished,
109

109

00:06:17,270  -->  00:06:21,630
we've tweaked our ladder layer by
removing that animation bug that we had
110

110

00:06:21,630  -->  00:06:25,690
As well as implementing a zero gravity
when the play is on the ladder.
111

111

00:06:25,690  -->  00:06:26,250
Well done.
112

112

00:06:26,250  -->  00:06:27,450
I will see you on the next video.
