1

00:00:00,025  -->  00:00:05,371
[SOUND] In this video,
we're giving the player a score,
2

2

00:00:05,371  -->  00:00:08,221
and at the moment it's zero.
3

3

00:00:08,221  -->  00:00:11,018
And we're also creating
a Points Per Block Destroyed so
4

4

00:00:11,018  -->  00:00:12,565
that as we destroy the blocks,
5

5

00:00:12,565  -->  00:00:16,680
you can see over here our current score
goes up as those blocks get destroyed.
6

6

00:00:16,680  -->  00:00:18,550
Let's jump in and create some score.
7

7

00:00:18,550  -->  00:00:23,090
Let's start by talking about the logic of
how we're gonna lay out our score here,
8

8

00:00:23,090  -->  00:00:25,300
and I've got my pen to do some scribbling.
9

9

00:00:25,300  -->  00:00:30,210
First of all, I think we'll use our
GameStatus script to keep track
10

10

00:00:30,210  -->  00:00:34,380
of a couple of things, to keep track in
our script here, of the current score.
11

11

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:37,360
We need to know what is our
score right at the moment.
12

12

00:00:37,360  -->  00:00:39,610
We also need to know
how many points to add.
13

13

00:00:39,610  -->  00:00:40,750
We could just leave it at one, but
14

14

00:00:40,750  -->  00:00:42,250
I think we'll be a little
bit more creative than that.
15

15

00:00:42,250  -->  00:00:47,470
We'll say how many points to
add when a block is destroyed.
16

16

00:00:47,470  -->  00:00:51,230
And again, I think GameStatus is a good
place to keep those things together,
17

17

00:00:51,230  -->  00:00:55,260
to keep your current score and how much
the score could go up in that same place.
18

18

00:00:55,260  -->  00:00:59,080
And then we need a place to say,
well, when something happens,
19

19

00:00:59,080  -->  00:01:00,370
then we need the score to go up.
20

20

00:01:00,370  -->  00:01:03,969
And I think the logical place to put
that is when our blocks are broken or
21

21

00:01:03,969  -->  00:01:04,642
destroyed.
22

22

00:01:04,642  -->  00:01:07,600
And the blocks are destroyed, and
this would be on our block script down.
23

23

00:01:07,600  -->  00:01:09,774
So I used the fatter pen for this drawing.
24

24

00:01:09,774  -->  00:01:12,741
For some reason I'm kinda
drawing on an angle, but
25

25

00:01:12,741  -->  00:01:17,364
the block script that I'm hung on is going
the top of is where we'll keep track of
26

26

00:01:17,364  -->  00:01:21,310
the fact that it has now been destroy and
you should add more points.
27

27

00:01:21,310  -->  00:01:24,660
So it's saying, yeah, add the points
now is where this will be called.
28

28

00:01:24,660  -->  00:01:28,840
So to summarize, we need a place to
list out what's our current score,
29

29

00:01:28,840  -->  00:01:32,630
need a place to say how many points do
we get each time something is destroyed.
30

30

00:01:32,630  -->  00:01:34,390
And we need a place to say,
hey, I got destroyed,
31

31

00:01:34,390  -->  00:01:36,570
please add p0oints to the score.
32

32

00:01:36,570  -->  00:01:39,280
So let's jump in and get cracking on that.
33

33

00:01:39,280  -->  00:01:42,680
Let me just turn my pen off and
delete all this stuff off the screen.
34

34

00:01:42,680  -->  00:01:45,840
I'm gonna open up Visual Studio and
go over to game status.
35

35

00:01:45,840  -->  00:01:49,830
The two scripts that we're gonna
be working on in this lecture will
36

36

00:01:49,830  -->  00:01:51,693
be GameStatus and Block.cs.
37

37

00:01:51,693  -->  00:01:54,680
So first of all, in GameStatus we
want to do a couple of things.
38

38

00:01:54,680  -->  00:01:58,040
I'm just gonna put in the headers here
to make it clear where we're grouping
39

39

00:01:58,040  -->  00:01:59,110
our variables.
40

40

00:01:59,110  -->  00:02:02,410
This is our configuration
parameters at the top.
41

41

00:02:02,410  -->  00:02:07,570
And then we're also gonna have some
state variables that are keeping
42

42

00:02:07,570  -->  00:02:11,000
track of what's going on at this point
in time, what's our current state.
43

43

00:02:11,000  -->  00:02:14,586
So within our state, we need a way to say,
what's our score at the moment?
44

44

00:02:14,586  -->  00:02:17,528
I'm gonna serialize this so
that we can see it in the inspector,
45

45

00:02:17,528  -->  00:02:19,080
as we've done in the past.
46

46

00:02:19,080  -->  00:02:22,050
I don't really want to be
changing this as a designer,
47

47

00:02:22,050  -->  00:02:24,110
I just wanna be able
to see it very easily.
48

48

00:02:24,110  -->  00:02:28,630
Until we're printing it on the screen
as UI, for now we just wanna be able to
49

49

00:02:28,630  -->  00:02:31,460
see it in the console, so
SerializeField is gonna be an integer.
50

50

00:02:31,460  -->  00:02:34,520
We could just call it score,
that's a fairly standard convention.
51

51

00:02:34,520  -->  00:02:36,770
But I'm gonna be a little
bit pedantic with this and
52

52

00:02:36,770  -->  00:02:41,060
call it currentScore so I'm really,
really clear what it means.
53

53

00:02:41,060  -->  00:02:44,146
And we'll initialize it at 0,
just so we know for
54

54

00:02:44,146  -->  00:02:46,499
sure the player is starting off at 0.
55

55

00:02:46,499  -->  00:02:49,718
And if the game resets, so
if we restart the game,
56

56

00:02:49,718  -->  00:02:53,182
then we're again initializing
our score back to 0.
57

57

00:02:53,182  -->  00:02:57,770
Okay, and then we also need up in our
configuration parameters something that we
58

58

00:02:57,770  -->  00:03:00,620
can tune, which will be a Serializedfield.
59

59

00:03:00,620  -->  00:03:04,171
Again, this will be an integer,
and I'll call this,
60

60

00:03:04,171  -->  00:03:07,700
this is gonna be how many points
you get when you destroy a block.
61

61

00:03:07,700  -->  00:03:13,040
So again, I'm gonna be really detailed and
call this ScorePerBlockDestroyed.
62

62

00:03:13,040  -->  00:03:16,200
Now, that's long and
it may be a little bit more than you need.
63

63

00:03:16,200  -->  00:03:18,460
But I don't wanna be looking back
on this in a week's time and
64

64

00:03:18,460  -->  00:03:22,880
have something that says score points or
something and not know what that means.
65

65

00:03:22,880  -->  00:03:27,000
Actually, I'm gonna go one step further
and say points cuz it's not score to add,
66

66

00:03:27,000  -->  00:03:28,320
your score is your total.
67

67

00:03:28,320  -->  00:03:31,500
It's gonna be pointsPerBlockDestroyed.
68

68

00:03:31,500  -->  00:03:37,880
Okay, and we'll initialize that at, all
right, we'll say, we'll make it 83 points.
69

69

00:03:37,880  -->  00:03:42,150
Right, now we've got our score, we've got
our current score, the points per blocks.
70

70

00:03:42,150  -->  00:03:46,680
Now we need to create ourselves
a method that says to add up our score,
71

71

00:03:46,680  -->  00:03:47,710
to add something to the score.
72

72

00:03:47,710  -->  00:03:51,120
I'm just gonna get rid of my start method,
don't need that at the moment.
73

73

00:03:51,120  -->  00:03:55,840
And we will, underneath update,
it's good to have update first, so
74

74

00:03:55,840  -->  00:04:00,280
we can see what is going on every
frame down underneath update.
75

75

00:04:00,280  -->  00:04:02,188
I'm going to create a new method.
76

76

00:04:02,188  -->  00:04:06,042
It will be a public method cuz we want
to be able to call this from a different
77

77

00:04:06,042  -->  00:04:06,562
script.
78

78

00:04:06,562  -->  00:04:09,020
We wanna be able to call this
from our Block script, so
79

79

00:04:09,020  -->  00:04:10,460
therefore we need to make it public.
80

80

00:04:10,460  -->  00:04:14,260
Public void,
what are we gonna call this, my friends?
81

81

00:04:14,260  -->  00:04:17,680
Let us call this AddToScore.
82

82

00:04:17,680  -->  00:04:19,310
So we're gonna add something to the score.
83

83

00:04:19,310  -->  00:04:22,050
We're gonna add up the score
whenever we call this.
84

84

00:04:22,050  -->  00:04:26,170
And in here,
our code needs to be our current score.
85

85

00:04:26,170  -->  00:04:27,960
So what is our current score?
86

86

00:04:27,960  -->  00:04:30,105
And then I'll show you the long code and
87

87

00:04:30,105  -->  00:04:32,966
then I'll do a slight refract
to make it be shorter.
88

88

00:04:32,966  -->  00:04:36,530
Our currentScore =,
what do you think this is going to be?
89

89

00:04:36,530  -->  00:04:39,430
If you wanna do a little mini challenge,
pause the video.
90

90

00:04:39,430  -->  00:04:42,730
When we add our score,
it's gonna be currentScore = what?
91

91

00:04:44,190  -->  00:04:50,484
It's gonna be currentScore =
currentScore + pointsPerBlockDestroyed.
92

92

00:04:50,484  -->  00:04:55,432
Okay, so
another way that we can write this is
93

93

00:04:55,432  -->  00:05:01,180
currentScore += pointsPerBlockDestroyed.
94

94

00:05:01,180  -->  00:05:04,481
So that's a shorter way of writing just
the same thing that we were writing
95

95

00:05:04,481  -->  00:05:07,102
before, currentScore +=
pointsPerBlockDestroyed.
96

96

00:05:07,102  -->  00:05:11,838
Let's save that, and just to make sure
that we've got those variables that
97

97

00:05:11,838  -->  00:05:15,769
are now being serialized, so
just move my screen a little bit.
98

98

00:05:15,769  -->  00:05:21,065
Okay, so
points per block destroyed is 83, great.
99

99

00:05:21,065  -->  00:05:23,708
The name might be a little bit too long
cuz it's having trouble fitting in
100

100

00:05:23,708  -->  00:05:26,040
the Inspector, but
we'll keep it as is for the moment.
101

101

00:05:26,040  -->  00:05:29,580
And then the current score is zero, great.
102

102

00:05:29,580  -->  00:05:32,480
Now, what we need to do is
each time we destroy a block,
103

103

00:05:32,480  -->  00:05:33,800
we need to increase our score.
104

104

00:05:33,800  -->  00:05:36,440
That's gonna be your challenge.
105

105

00:05:36,440  -->  00:05:40,996
So add the score when block is destroyed,
in our Block.cs call AddToScore,
106

106

00:05:40,996  -->  00:05:42,479
it's as simple as that.
107

107

00:05:42,479  -->  00:05:47,630
So that's your challenge,
I'm gonna give you a hint in a moment.
108

108

00:05:47,630  -->  00:05:51,320
If you're ready to dive into that
challenge, then jump in now, take that on.
109

109

00:05:51,320  -->  00:05:54,720
This is a good one to think about, you've
got all the clues in previous lectures.
110

110

00:05:54,720  -->  00:05:58,040
So I'd really urge you to take
this on as a challenge now,
111

111

00:05:58,040  -->  00:06:00,690
particularly if you've just been
cruising on the challenges.
112

112

00:06:00,690  -->  00:06:03,980
If you give it a shot and you're not sure,
then you can come back and
113

113

00:06:03,980  -->  00:06:06,780
have a look at these hints, and
I'll give you those hints now.
114

114

00:06:06,780  -->  00:06:12,740
Hint number one is add the score when
the block is about to be destroyed.
115

115

00:06:12,740  -->  00:06:13,860
That's hint number one.
116

116

00:06:13,860  -->  00:06:18,800
And hint number two is use
FindObjectOfType somewhere
117

117

00:06:18,800  -->  00:06:23,980
when you are writing your
statement to call AddToScore.
118

118

00:06:23,980  -->  00:06:26,380
Okay, so there's your challenge,
there are the hints.
119

119

00:06:26,380  -->  00:06:28,246
Jump in and take that on now, and
I'll see you back in a moment.
120

120

00:06:31,698  -->  00:06:35,772
Okay, so we need to head on over to our
Block.cs, we'll have a look in here,
121

121

00:06:35,772  -->  00:06:37,732
where is the block being destroyed?
122

122

00:06:37,732  -->  00:06:40,129
Well, it's being destroyed
OnCollissionEnter,
123

123

00:06:40,129  -->  00:06:44,049
we've already got a method in here we're
calling that's doing all the destroying of
124

124

00:06:44,049  -->  00:06:45,770
block-related things.
125

125

00:06:45,770  -->  00:06:48,300
So I'm gonna add this into
our DestroyBlock method.
126

126

00:06:48,300  -->  00:06:51,440
It's getting a little bit full and it's
doing a few different things, but for now,
127

127

00:06:51,440  -->  00:06:55,610
I'm comfortable in our DestroyBlock
output in our adding to score.
128

128

00:06:55,610  -->  00:06:58,840
We'll do that right at the top,
even before we have any sound play,
129

129

00:06:58,840  -->  00:07:02,810
we'll say findObjectOfType.
130

130

00:07:02,810  -->  00:07:04,760
And then what's the object
we're looking for?
131

131

00:07:04,760  -->  00:07:08,130
Well, it's our class, or
our script, GameStatus.
132

132

00:07:08,130  -->  00:07:14,243
GameStatus, and then we put in our
parentheses cuz we're not feeding in,
133

133

00:07:14,243  -->  00:07:20,063
passing in anything, dot, and
you can see it's right at the top here,
134

134

00:07:20,063  -->  00:07:22,698
AddToScore, and then ();.
135

135

00:07:22,698  -->  00:07:26,496
So what that is doing when the block is
destroyed, when we're saying, hey, destroy
136

136

00:07:26,496  -->  00:07:30,450
the block now, we're also saying, go and
run this method, which is AddToScore.
137

137

00:07:30,450  -->  00:07:35,050
Hop over into Unity, I'm going to add
a few more blocks into my scene so
138

138

00:07:35,050  -->  00:07:38,840
that I can have a few more things
to hit to see what score got.
139

139

00:07:38,840  -->  00:07:42,690
So just duplicate and then hitting
the W key, moving it over to the left,
140

140

00:07:42,690  -->  00:07:43,340
duplicate.
141

141

00:07:44,540  -->  00:07:49,970
Duplicate and another couple of times
duplicate, and one more duplicate.
142

142

00:07:49,970  -->  00:07:51,020
Okay, there we go.
143

143

00:07:51,020  -->  00:07:55,600
Now, what I want you to look at, make sure
we clicked on GameStatus, click on Play.
144

144

00:07:55,600  -->  00:07:59,816
And then we're watching our Current Score
over here while also playing,
145

145

00:07:59,816  -->  00:08:01,110
which is no mean feat.
146

146

00:08:01,110  -->  00:08:03,810
It's going up 166, 249.
147

147

00:08:03,810  -->  00:08:07,212
Okay, do I like that weird,
random score amount?
148

148

00:08:07,212  -->  00:08:08,482
Yeah, it's fine for the moment.
149

149

00:08:08,482  -->  00:08:09,640
Okay, 333, great!
150

150

00:08:09,640  -->  00:08:13,210
So we've successfully implemented,
I'll click on Game Status,
151

151

00:08:13,210  -->  00:08:16,660
our current score going up by
points that we can change, so
152

152

00:08:16,660  -->  00:08:19,750
that we can give the player some sort
of feeling of progression and score.
153

153

00:08:19,750  -->  00:08:22,150
Great work, well done, and
I'll see you in the next video.
