2

00:00:04.382  -->  00:00:07.097
In this video we're gonna
hook up our functionality so
3

3

00:00:07.097  -->  00:00:10.401
that we have a game where we're
printing our guess to the screen and
4

4

00:00:10.401  -->  00:00:14.670
we can click higher and we can click
lower and the guess updates accordingly.
5

5

00:00:14.670  -->  00:00:17.940
We need to make a connection between the
text we're displaying on our screen here.
6

6

00:00:17.940  -->  00:00:19.550
At the moment, it's all question marks.
7

7

00:00:19.550  -->  00:00:24.320
But instead of all question marks, we want
to display whatever the current guess is,
8

8

00:00:24.320  -->  00:00:27.170
and the guess variable itself
9

9

00:00:27.170  -->  00:00:30.020
that we are recalculating
the value of within our script.
10

10

00:00:30.020  -->  00:00:33.455
So if the player pressed higher,
then we have a new value of guess.
11

11

00:00:33.455  -->  00:00:36.950
Want that new value of guess
to be displayed just here.
12

12

00:00:36.950  -->  00:00:41.250
So how do we do that, how do we tell our
code in here, how do we tell our script,
13

13

00:00:41.250  -->  00:00:46.005
that you should be making this, whatever
the value you currently understand for
14

14

00:00:46.005  -->  00:00:48.305
guess, you should be putting it just here?
15

15

00:00:48.305  -->  00:00:51.605
Well, the first thing we need
to do is to serialize a field,
16

16

00:00:51.605  -->  00:00:54.895
serialize a variable that allows
us to connect the two together.
17

17

00:00:54.895  -->  00:00:58.005
So let's give ourselves a little bit
space at the top of the script here.
18

18

00:00:58.005  -->  00:01:00.539
Gonna type in serialize field.
19

19

00:01:00.539  -->  00:01:04.870
And then, we need to create
a variable that's gonna be of type.
20

20

00:01:04.870  -->  00:01:06.070
Now, what type is it?
21

21

00:01:06.070  -->  00:01:08.824
It's type whatever this is just here.
22

22

00:01:08.824  -->  00:01:13.042
It's a Text Mesh Pro UGUI script.
23

23

00:01:13.042  -->  00:01:17.082
If we were just using regular text,
then it would just be a text field.
24

24

00:01:17.082  -->  00:01:21.350
But because this is our Text Mesh Pro,
it's a little bit different.
25

25

00:01:21.350  -->  00:01:28.820
To access this, we first need to use
the namespace using text to TMPro.
26

26

00:01:28.820  -->  00:01:31.010
So that stands for TextMesh Pro.
27

27

00:01:31.010  -->  00:01:33.750
If we were using just
a regular text field in there,
28

28

00:01:33.750  -->  00:01:37.490
then we would be using
the Unity engine .ui namespace.
29

29

00:01:37.490  -->  00:01:42.990
But we're using TextMesh Pro, so we need
to get access to all the classes and
30

30

00:01:42.990  -->  00:01:46.404
methods contained within this namespace,
we need to be using that namespace.
31

31

00:01:46.404  -->  00:01:50.160
So now, when we get to serialize field,
32

32

00:01:50.160  -->  00:01:55.250
we have the option of a type
which is Text Mesh Pro UGUI.
33

33

00:01:57.656  -->  00:02:01.260
And we will call this guessText.
34

34

00:02:01.260  -->  00:02:06.310
Okay, so whether it was text in here or
game object, whatever it is,
35

35

00:02:06.310  -->  00:02:11.800
the type that are trying to look for, this
now says only accept this particular type.
36

36

00:02:11.800  -->  00:02:13.580
We'll call it guessText.
37

37

00:02:13.580  -->  00:02:16.980
And what is it that we
wish to link to guessText?
38

38

00:02:16.980  -->  00:02:21.016
Well, let's jump over into Unity,
click on where our script is.
39

39

00:02:21.016  -->  00:02:21.901
Save first.
40

40

00:02:21.901  -->  00:02:22.890
Sorry, my bad.
41

41

00:02:22.890  -->  00:02:24.630
Save over i, your script.
42

42

00:02:24.630  -->  00:02:26.770
That way, it will compile,
and it will be looking for
43

43

00:02:26.770  -->  00:02:28.760
that field that we've serialized.
44

44

00:02:28.760  -->  00:02:32.541
It should take a second, and
then we can see guessText.
45

45

00:02:32.541  -->  00:02:37.040
It's looking for a Text Mesh Pro UGUI.
46

46

00:02:37.040  -->  00:02:38.330
Okay, so we have one of those.
47

47

00:02:38.330  -->  00:02:43.520
If we click on our guessText,
you can see that is what we are after.
48

48

00:02:43.520  -->  00:02:44.450
Okay, it's a little bit tricky.
49

49

00:02:44.450  -->  00:02:48.780
Click on game play, and
then drag guessText into that field there.
50

50

00:02:48.780  -->  00:02:50.980
Or of course,
you could have clicked the selector and
51

51

00:02:50.980  -->  00:02:54.210
found one of our
Text Mesh Pro text elements.
52

52

00:02:54.210  -->  00:02:59.150
Now that we've connected it, it now
understands in here, I know, guessText,
53

53

00:02:59.150  -->  00:03:03.030
whenever I'm using guessText
within this class or
54

54

00:03:03.030  -->  00:03:07.820
within this script, you are actually
referring to this particular text field.
55

55

00:03:07.820  -->  00:03:08.633
Which is really cool.
56

56

00:03:08.633  -->  00:03:13.420
That allows us now to update what
is shown in that text field.
57

57

00:03:13.420  -->  00:03:14.955
So what do we want to
show in that text field?
58

58

00:03:14.955  -->  00:03:19.260
Well, where's the very first
time we're displaying guess?
59

59

00:03:19.260  -->  00:03:22.410
Down here, in our start game,
we're saying what guess is.
60

60

00:03:22.410  -->  00:03:25.810
And we wish to display this
onto the screen at that point.
61

61

00:03:25.810  -->  00:03:28.890
So what we're gonna do is
use our two string method.
62

62

00:03:28.890  -->  00:03:32.640
First of all, we need to say guessText.
63

63

00:03:32.640  -->  00:03:34.590
That's our variable just up here.
64

64

00:03:34.590  -->  00:03:37.150
What aspect of guessText
are we looking for?
65

65

00:03:37.150  -->  00:03:39.730
Well, we're looking for the text element.
66

66

00:03:39.730  -->  00:03:43.906
And then, we are taking our value for
guess and
67

67

00:03:43.906  -->  00:03:49.164
we're using ToString() to
convert this into a string.
68

68

00:03:49.164  -->  00:03:52.944
Cuz in our text field, it's looking to
display a string, not an integer and
69

69

00:03:52.944  -->  00:03:55.970
not a float, and not anything else,
it just wants a string.
70

70

00:03:55.970  -->  00:03:59.400
So we need to say, well,
whatever you think guess is at the moment,
71

71

00:03:59.400  -->  00:04:04.570
whether it's 500 or 1,000,
I want you to convert that into a string.
72

72

00:04:04.570  -->  00:04:09.368
And then, this number that we've now
made into a string, say it was 1,000
73

73

00:04:09.368  -->  00:04:14.540
plus 1 divided by 2, 500,
we want that to be a string.
74

74

00:04:14.540  -->  00:04:20.100
And then, to display within
the guessText.txt field, display that 500.
75

75

00:04:20.100  -->  00:04:23.340
Let's save that, or
whatever number the number might be.
76

76

00:04:23.340  -->  00:04:24.224
We'll click Play.
77

77

00:04:25.852  -->  00:04:27.820
And you can see, my guess is 501.
78

78

00:04:27.820  -->  00:04:32.240
Which is really cool, cuz we're now
displaying our guess onto the screen.
79

79

00:04:32.240  -->  00:04:35.320
It's also not so cool, cuz we've
made a slight error in our logic.
80

80

00:04:35.320  -->  00:04:39.610
And I believe max = max + 1 should
be back to where we had it before,
81

81

00:04:39.610  -->  00:04:42.920
which is underneath this
initial calculation.
82

82

00:04:42.920  -->  00:04:43.820
Let's see how that goes.
83

83

00:04:43.820  -->  00:04:46.330
Save that back over into Unity.
84

84

00:04:46.330  -->  00:04:47.240
Click Play.
85

85

00:04:50.354  -->  00:04:52.893
And our first guess is 500,
which is exactly in the middle.
86

86

00:04:52.893  -->  00:04:55.158
It doesn't really matter,
the player's not gonna get upset.
87

87

00:04:55.158  -->  00:04:57.260
But we wanna keep it nice and neat.
88

88

00:04:57.260  -->  00:05:00.050
And in the next step, we need to be
able to click on a higher and lower and
89

89

00:05:00.050  -->  00:05:03.790
have that call the method that
we've created already, and
90

90

00:05:03.790  -->  00:05:06.810
to display the new guess onto the screen.
91

91

00:05:06.810  -->  00:05:09.680
And so, the challenge I've got for
you is to make it work.
92

92

00:05:09.680  -->  00:05:12.020
Okay, that's a nice ambiguous
heading there, isn't it?
93

93

00:05:12.020  -->  00:05:13.110
Make it work.
94

94

00:05:13.110  -->  00:05:14.390
Do what it's supposed to do.
95

95

00:05:14.390  -->  00:05:17.130
Okay, so connect your higher and
lower buttons.
96

96

00:05:17.130  -->  00:05:20.100
When you click on them,
they work as expected.
97

97

00:05:20.100  -->  00:05:23.830
Display the updated guess each time you
click the higher and lower buttons.
98

98

00:05:23.830  -->  00:05:25.360
Make sure it's the correct guess.
99

99

00:05:25.360  -->  00:05:26.440
And I'm gonna give you a couple of hints.
100

100

00:05:26.440  -->  00:05:29.650
If that's enough for you to go on,
then jump in, pause the video and
101

101

00:05:29.650  -->  00:05:30.620
take that on now.
102

102

00:05:30.620  -->  00:05:32.410
If you'd like the hints, here they are.
103

103

00:05:32.410  -->  00:05:33.830
Hint number one.
104

104

00:05:33.830  -->  00:05:37.650
Set the OnClick function to our
recently created public methods.
105

105

00:05:37.650  -->  00:05:41.160
That's in order to get the buttons
calling those methods and
106

106

00:05:41.160  -->  00:05:42.420
doing what they should do.
107

107

00:05:42.420  -->  00:05:46.540
And then, in terms of the guess,
we need to add something, add a line,
108

108

00:05:46.540  -->  00:05:49.850
add a statement to our NextGuess() method.
109

109

00:05:49.850  -->  00:05:51.530
So there are the hints for you.
110

110

00:05:51.530  -->  00:05:53.190
We've got everything we need.
111

111

00:05:53.190  -->  00:05:55.701
Jump in, take that on, and
I'll see you back here when you're done.
112

112

00:05:58.849  -->  00:05:59.650
Okay, I'm really excited.
113

113

00:05:59.650  -->  00:06:01.760
We're very close to having
functionality all hooked up.
114

114

00:06:01.760  -->  00:06:04.160
You might have yours hooked up already and
you've been playing around with it.
115

115

00:06:04.160  -->  00:06:05.210
Very excellent.
116

116

00:06:05.210  -->  00:06:06.330
So now, higher button.
117

117

00:06:06.330  -->  00:06:08.762
When we click that button, we need to,
118

118

00:06:08.762  -->  00:06:11.340
we're currently using
Scene Loader is dropped in here.
119

119

00:06:11.340  -->  00:06:15.160
We want to find,
what is it that we need to find?
120

120

00:06:15.160  -->  00:06:15.710
Gameplay.
121

121

00:06:15.710  -->  00:06:18.190
So game play as our game object.
122

122

00:06:18.190  -->  00:06:20.940
Or we could have dragged
Gameplay over in here.
123

123

00:06:20.940  -->  00:06:23.260
The function we're looking for,
Number Wizard.
124

124

00:06:23.260  -->  00:06:26.180
And then, we have onPressHigher.
125

125

00:06:26.180  -->  00:06:29.130
And for our lower button,
we are doing the same thing this time.
126

126

00:06:29.130  -->  00:06:32.140
I will drag GamePlay nice and
quick into there.
127

127

00:06:32.140  -->  00:06:33.420
No function, that's not correct.
128

128

00:06:33.420  -->  00:06:36.190
We want Number Wizard, OnPressLower.
129

129

00:06:36.190  -->  00:06:39.490
Ok, so we've got higher and lower working
for our buttons, or connected for
130

130

00:06:39.490  -->  00:06:40.260
our buttons.
131

131

00:06:40.260  -->  00:06:42.850
Let's go and
have a look at our logic in here.
132

132

00:06:42.850  -->  00:06:44.710
So OnPressHigher, OnPressLower.
133

133

00:06:44.710  -->  00:06:48.320
And then, when there's a next guess,
a next guess happens,
134

134

00:06:48.320  -->  00:06:53.115
whenever we are pressing those buttons,
so we're calling nextGuess here and
135

135

00:06:53.115  -->  00:06:54.495
calling nextGuess here.
136

136

00:06:54.495  -->  00:06:56.033
What do we need to do?
137

137

00:06:56.033  -->  00:06:59.883
So it says hey, do nextGuess,
cuz we're calling nextGuess.
138

138

00:06:59.883  -->  00:07:02.416
nextGuess says righty-o, I'll do that.
139

139

00:07:02.416  -->  00:07:04.546
The new value of guess is this.
140

140

00:07:04.546  -->  00:07:08.584
And we wanna update what
we display on the screen,
141

141

00:07:08.584  -->  00:07:12.837
which is our guessText.text
= guess.ToString.
142

142

00:07:12.837  -->  00:07:15.627
I'm gonna copy that,
paste it down in here.
143

143

00:07:15.627  -->  00:07:17.735
So I'm putting in the same information.
144

144

00:07:17.735  -->  00:07:22.560
We're taking our guess value and
we're converting into a string, and
145

145

00:07:22.560  -->  00:07:27.310
then presenting that in our guessText
field that we've hooked up.
146

146

00:07:27.310  -->  00:07:28.560
Save.
147

147

00:07:28.560  -->  00:07:29.450
Back into the game.
148

148

00:07:29.450  -->  00:07:30.580
Moment of truth.
149

149

00:07:30.580  -->  00:07:31.819
Click on Play.
150

150

00:07:34.459  -->  00:07:35.780
And then, starts at 500, click Higher.
151

151

00:07:35.780  -->  00:07:38.330
It goes up, up, up, down, down, down.
152

152

00:07:38.330  -->  00:07:39.120
Down, down, down,
153

153

00:07:39.120  -->  00:07:41.540
all the way until it reaches a point
where it can't go up or down.
154

154

00:07:41.540  -->  00:07:44.030
Wonderful, click Success,
takes us next screen.
155

155

00:07:44.030  -->  00:07:44.540
Play again?
156

156

00:07:44.540  -->  00:07:45.180
Yes, why not?
157

157

00:07:45.180  -->  00:07:46.230
Start.
158

158

00:07:46.230  -->  00:07:47.010
And let's choose a number.
159

159

00:07:47.010  -->  00:07:50.740
We'll say 620.
It's higher than that, lower, lower still,
160

160

00:07:50.740  -->  00:07:54.340
higher than that, higher.
161

161

00:07:54.340  -->  00:07:55.840
Higher than 617, 620, one lower, 619.
162

162

00:07:55.840  -->  00:07:57.483
My goodness, there we go, 620.
163

163

00:07:57.483  -->  00:07:59.407
Okay, so it works.
164

164

00:07:59.407  -->  00:08:01.034
Our full game flow works.
165

165

00:08:01.034  -->  00:08:02.498
Our Higher and Lower button works.
166

166

00:08:02.498  -->  00:08:04.660
Really very excellent.
167

167

00:08:04.660  -->  00:08:06.495
We've still got a little bit
of just tidying up to do on
168

168

00:08:06.495  -->  00:08:08.730
a couple of extra nifty
things that we'll put in.
169

169

00:08:08.730  -->  00:08:09.810
But this is our logic,
170

170

00:08:09.810  -->  00:08:14.930
this is displaying text from our
code onto our screen, onto our UI.
171

171

00:08:14.930  -->  00:08:18.490
This is something we do a lot,
we'd say score or lies or
172

172

00:08:18.490  -->  00:08:20.860
health or any sort of user interface.
173

173

00:08:20.860  -->  00:08:23.870
This mechanism we've set up here when
we're displaying text on the screen.
174

174

00:08:23.870  -->  00:08:26.530
So great stuff, and
I'll see you in the next lecture.
