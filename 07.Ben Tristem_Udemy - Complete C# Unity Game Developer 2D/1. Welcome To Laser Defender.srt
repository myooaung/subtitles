00:00:03,844  -->  00:00:07,692
Hello and welcome to the Laser Defender
section of this course.
3

3

00:00:07,692  -->  00:00:10,068
This is gonna be a really,
really fun section.
4

4

00:00:10,068  -->  00:00:12,857
We're gonna make ourselves a top
down shooter, it's a space shooter.
5

5

00:00:12,857  -->  00:00:16,526
And I've got my black background again
to recognize the fact that we're off
6

6

00:00:16,526  -->  00:00:17,310
in space.
7

7

00:00:17,310  -->  00:00:20,470
Let me just show you a little bit of
the prototyping I've been doing of late.
8

8

00:00:20,470  -->  00:00:23,970
Taking the build that we had previously
and adding a little bit to it.
9

9

00:00:23,970  -->  00:00:26,720
We've got a spaceship,
we move left and right, we shoot.
10

10

00:00:26,720  -->  00:00:29,700
We've got enemies that
are coming in on paths.
11

11

00:00:29,700  -->  00:00:31,090
And the enemies can shoot us.
12

12

00:00:31,090  -->  00:00:33,480
And if they shoot us a few times,
we have a health system.
13

13

00:00:33,480  -->  00:00:35,820
And if they shoot me enough times,
then I can die.
14

14

00:00:35,820  -->  00:00:40,245
And when I die, we go to the screen
where it is, PLAY AGAIN.
15

15

00:00:40,245  -->  00:00:43,120
Okay, so
lots of cool stuff that we're creating
16

16

00:00:43,120  -->  00:00:45,460
in this particular section of the course.
17

17

00:00:45,460  -->  00:00:49,570
And you know what, we're gonna take a step
up in terms of the depth of programming
18

18

00:00:49,570  -->  00:00:50,280
we're going to be doing.
19

19

00:00:50,280  -->  00:00:53,451
We'll be building upon a lot of the
systems that we've gone through before.
20

20

00:00:53,451  -->  00:00:57,550
One good example of that
is scriptable objects.
21

21

00:00:57,550  -->  00:01:01,170
You see I've got my scriptable
objects assets here and in that,
22

22

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:04,390
we can put a whole bunch of
information about the wave itself.
23

23

00:01:04,390  -->  00:01:07,540
What we want the wave to do,
what do we want the wave to spawn,
24

24

00:01:07,540  -->  00:01:11,710
and how often do we want it to spawn,
and what are the waypoints.
25

25

00:01:11,710  -->  00:01:15,140
And the waypoint system that we're gonna
have in this section of the course
26

26

00:01:15,140  -->  00:01:17,090
is not gonna be super comple.
27

27

00:01:17,090  -->  00:01:19,819
It's gonna be very simple, it should just
go from here to here to here to here, and
28

28

00:01:19,819  -->  00:01:20,345
you're done.
29

29

00:01:20,345  -->  00:01:25,199
If you've gone through our Unity 3D
course, that's the other big beginner
30

30

00:01:25,199  -->  00:01:30,138
course that we offer, then you may have
gone through our Gun Assault section.
31

31

00:01:30,138  -->  00:01:33,150
Where we have some waypoint
system that we use and
32

32

00:01:33,150  -->  00:01:37,710
then we go into a timeline system, so
we do a lot of that in that course.
33

33

00:01:37,710  -->  00:01:38,790
Because it's in a 3D environment,
34

34

00:01:38,790  -->  00:01:42,400
and because we need that very specific
things that we're looking for
35

35

00:01:42,400  -->  00:01:47,150
in that 3D world, there's a lot of depth
in that and we go into a lot more detail.
36

36

00:01:47,150  -->  00:01:49,710
This section's gonna be
a lot simpler in waypoints,
37

37

00:01:49,710  -->  00:01:51,500
it's just about as simple as you can get.
38

38

00:01:51,500  -->  00:01:53,010
Just go from here, to here, to here.
39

39

00:01:53,010  -->  00:01:55,170
So it's a very powerful tool for
you to have.
40

40

00:01:55,170  -->  00:01:57,385
You'll be able to see in your projects,
in the future.
41

41

00:01:57,385  -->  00:01:59,920
Hmm, what would I like to have
just to go from there to there?
42

42

00:01:59,920  -->  00:02:02,610
Maybe there to there and
return on a circuit.
43

43

00:02:02,610  -->  00:02:06,510
If I have an NPC in a game, I want them to
walk there and then walk over there and
44

44

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:07,580
then walk back here.
45

45

00:02:07,580  -->  00:02:09,746
Then this is the same
fundamental logic for that,
46

46

00:02:09,746  -->  00:02:11,303
that we're going to be working on.
47

47

00:02:11,303  -->  00:02:15,961
And because we do have this notion of
spawning particular things on a timer, so
48

48

00:02:15,961  -->  00:02:19,996
we spawn enemies, spawn an enemy,
wait, spawn, spawn, spawn.
49

49

00:02:19,996  -->  00:02:25,930
We have to find a way for
us to create a timed mechanism.
50

50

00:02:25,930  -->  00:02:28,390
So we could just get there and
say spawn a thing and
51

51

00:02:28,390  -->  00:02:31,900
then count how many seconds have gone
by and then spawn another thing.
52

52

00:02:31,900  -->  00:02:33,270
That's the simple way to do it.
53

53

00:02:33,270  -->  00:02:36,150
We're going to do it with a little bit
more depth and this is going to be a great
54

54

00:02:36,150  -->  00:02:38,920
chance for you to understand how
do you do things with a delay?
55

55

00:02:38,920  -->  00:02:40,110
How do you do things with a timer?
56

56

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:42,550
How do you do things so
that they repeat over and over.
57

57

00:02:42,550  -->  00:02:44,540
There will be a lot of
cool learning in there.
58

58

00:02:44,540  -->  00:02:47,510
So this section's all about,
let's build upon what we know already,
59

59

00:02:47,510  -->  00:02:49,790
let's really cement some of
those things that we've done.
60

60

00:02:49,790  -->  00:02:54,140
For example, writing public methods
in one class or one script, and
61

61

00:02:54,140  -->  00:02:57,510
then calling them from another class or
script so that we can execute something.
62

62

00:02:57,510  -->  00:02:59,150
Building upon our scriptable objects.
63

63

00:02:59,150  -->  00:03:00,480
Building upon the knowledge we have and
64

64

00:03:00,480  -->  00:03:03,400
how to trigger sound effects,
how to get some particles into our game.
65

65

00:03:03,400  -->  00:03:07,580
Building on that, but adding some new
depth and complexity and creating,
66

66

00:03:07,580  -->  00:03:12,010
I think, a really great landscape, a
really great canvas for you to get there.
67

67

00:03:12,010  -->  00:03:14,370
And put your own personality into it,
68

68

00:03:14,370  -->  00:03:17,450
put your own creativity into it
to make a cool top down shooter.
69

69

00:03:17,450  -->  00:03:21,050
So in the next video, we're gonna talk
a little bit more about the game design,
70

70

00:03:21,050  -->  00:03:22,720
just so we could've got our boxes to tick.
71

71

00:03:22,720  -->  00:03:25,400
We're gonna go through that very quickly,
so we know exactly what it is that we're
72

72

00:03:25,400  -->  00:03:29,470
creating, and then we'll be ready to start
this section and make our cool project.
73

73

00:03:29,470  -->  00:03:31,780
So I really look forward to
seeing what you come up with.
74

74

00:03:31,780  -->  00:03:32,840
Let's jump in and get started.
