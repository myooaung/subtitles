00:00:04.115  -->  00:00:07.559
Hello, I've come back in my
time machine to give you one
3

3

00:00:07.559  -->  00:00:10.560
piece of information about a bug we found.
4

4

00:00:10.560  -->  00:00:14.170
And this bug is perpetuated throughout the
entire course, but I've come back here to
5

5

00:00:14.170  -->  00:00:17.060
show you what it is, so
that you can not have that bug yourself.
6

6

00:00:17.060  -->  00:00:20.204
It's a very rare sort of bug,
it's not happening to a lot of people.
7

7

00:00:20.204  -->  00:00:23.066
It's not happened to us as instructors
as we've been prototyping and
8

8

00:00:23.066  -->  00:00:23.996
creating the course.
9

9

00:00:23.996  -->  00:00:26.276
But it's happening to enough
people that we want to come and
10

10

00:00:26.276  -->  00:00:27.800
make sure that you know about it.
11

11

00:00:27.800  -->  00:00:30.747
So with our Singleton patent, we've just
gone through this in the previous video.
12

12

00:00:30.747  -->  00:00:33.068
We're finding a particular
type of something,
13

13

00:00:33.068  -->  00:00:35.340
in this instance my class
is called Singleton.
14

14

00:00:35.340  -->  00:00:38.804
So we're saying if there's more than
one Singleton, then destroy yourself,
15

15

00:00:38.804  -->  00:00:40.770
otherwise don't destroy yourself.
16

16

00:00:40.770  -->  00:00:45.250
Now what we've finding through lots,
many many hours of digging into this bug,
17

17

00:00:45.250  -->  00:00:48.410
which is part of the game development fun,
as a side note.
18

18

00:00:48.410  -->  00:00:53.300
Is my teammate and
fellow instructor Sam has helped
19

19

00:00:53.300  -->  00:00:56.300
us work through the problem,
why this is happening.
20

20

00:00:56.300  -->  00:00:59.540
So this is the script
execution order in Unity.
21

21

00:00:59.540  -->  00:01:02.630
This is what happens first and
second and the whole process and
22

22

00:01:02.630  -->  00:01:05.980
what cycles, and
this is what's happening per frame.
23

23

00:01:05.980  -->  00:01:07.870
That you can see when we look for
24

24

00:01:07.870  -->  00:01:11.890
it, OnDestroy's happening at
the end of this first frame.
25

25

00:01:11.890  -->  00:01:16.040
So it's happening sometimes when other
things have gone and called that script.
26

26

00:01:16.040  -->  00:01:18.760
So this line,
we still need to destroy this game object,
27

27

00:01:18.760  -->  00:01:22.620
so this Singleton knows there
should only be one of me.
28

28

00:01:22.620  -->  00:01:23.380
So that's all cool.
29

29

00:01:23.380  -->  00:01:27.898
But sometimes, some other scripts that are
relying on there only being one Singleton,
30

30

00:01:27.898  -->  00:01:29.193
are having some issues.
31

31

00:01:29.193  -->  00:01:32.947
Because there, for a very split second,
a tiny tiny amount of time,
32

32

00:01:32.947  -->  00:01:35.400
there are two until it gets destroyed.
33

33

00:01:35.400  -->  00:01:39.177
So because this is being called
a little bit later than we thought,
34

34

00:01:39.177  -->  00:01:41.138
like a fraction of a moment later.
35

35

00:01:41.138  -->  00:01:46.133
We need to do something before that to
make sure that this very instant on Awake,
36

36

00:01:46.133  -->  00:01:48.605
this thing can't cause any mischief.
37

37

00:01:48.605  -->  00:01:51.860
And the way we do that is
we make this Inactive.
38

38

00:01:51.860  -->  00:01:55.150
So just an example, I've set up a little
example saying this is my camera.
39

39

00:01:55.150  -->  00:01:58.773
If I click the check mark, it's active,
but unclick the check mark, it's inactive.
40

40

00:01:58.773  -->  00:02:00.697
The moment I make it inactive,
41

41

00:02:00.697  -->  00:02:05.217
then most of the things on this
camera just won't work, won't happen.
42

42

00:02:05.217  -->  00:02:08.030
And that's what we want to and
wanna do when we're destroying it.
43

43

00:02:08.030  -->  00:02:09.595
We wanna have it not have an impact.
44

44

00:02:09.595  -->  00:02:16.264
So what we're saying here is,
gameObject.SetActive(false); and
45

45

00:02:16.264  -->  00:02:23.492
I want you to implement this now into
the Singleton that we have just worked on.
46

46

00:02:23.492  -->  00:02:26.451
So find Destroy, the line above Destroy,
47

47

00:02:26.451  -->  00:02:30.488
set the game object to not active,
so SetActive is false.
48

48

00:02:30.488  -->  00:02:34.906
And I want you to do this from now on
anytime we implement the Singleton patent
49

49

00:02:34.906  -->  00:02:39.269
and you see me type in okay, now let
us Destroy, then also put in this line.
50

50

00:02:39.269  -->  00:02:42.356
Hopefully you remember it, but
if you have any bugs, any issues,
51

51

00:02:42.356  -->  00:02:45.848
any null reference exceptions when
you're implementing the Singleton.
52

52

00:02:45.848  -->  00:02:48.426
Then I know you'll remember this and
will come back and
53

53

00:02:48.426  -->  00:02:51.560
find this one line if you don't
remember the one line itself.
54

54

00:02:51.560  -->  00:02:55.779
Unfortunately, I can't go and re-record
every single video that we've got this in.
55

55

00:02:55.779  -->  00:02:58.794
So you'll see from now on,
you'll only see Destroy.
56

56

00:02:58.794  -->  00:03:02.150
You won't see this one particular line
just cuz all the videos are re-recorded.
57

57

00:03:02.150  -->  00:03:05.880
But I wanted to come back in time to right
now to show you that this is the solution
58

58

00:03:05.880  -->  00:03:09.910
if you're having any issues with your
Singleton and the way that it's setup.
59

59

00:03:09.910  -->  00:03:12.110
Hopefully, this should solve them for you.
60

60

00:03:12.110  -->  00:03:13.120
Okay, great stuff.
61

61

00:03:13.120  -->  00:03:14.510
Back to regular programming.
62

62

00:03:14.510  -->  00:03:15.650
See you in the next video.
