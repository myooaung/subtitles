00:00:00,050  -->  00:00:04,505
[SOUND] In this video,
we're gonna discuss why our sound effect
2

2

00:00:04,505  -->  00:00:09,128
disappears when we destroy our object,
when we pick up our coin,
3

3

00:00:09,128  -->  00:00:14,424
it destroys, and how we can create
a mechanism, where we still trigger and
4

4

00:00:14,424  -->  00:00:19,500
play our sound effect even though
that game object is being destroyed.
5

5

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:22,852
So if you're following the Talvania
section through from the three day course,
6

6

00:00:22,852  -->  00:00:25,318
where it originally was over there and
now it's over here,
7

7

00:00:25,318  -->  00:00:28,940
then you'll be familiar with the technique
we're going to use in this video already.
8

8

00:00:28,940  -->  00:00:32,430
So it will be a good refresher for
you but not necessarily and
9

9

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:33,880
you I didn't know that moment.
10

10

00:00:33,880  -->  00:00:36,210
But otherwise, this is gonna
be a really cool technique for
11

11

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:38,860
those of you who are seeing this for
the first time.
12

12

00:00:38,860  -->  00:00:41,500
So what we're gonna do is make sure
these coins, when we jump on them,
13

13

00:00:41,500  -->  00:00:44,550
go diddling and don't get destroyed.
14

14

00:00:44,550  -->  00:00:46,166
If we look at our current script,
15

15

00:00:46,166  -->  00:00:49,573
if we'd have put something in here
that said something along the lines
16

16

00:00:49,573  -->  00:00:53,290
of play sound effect in here, so playSFX,
if we wrote out the code for that.
17

17

00:00:53,290  -->  00:00:58,279
Then what's gonna happen is, it will play
and then immediately this whole game
18

18

00:00:58,279  -->  00:01:03,640
object will be destroyed, including the
thing that would play, that sound effect,
19

19

00:01:03,640  -->  00:01:08,645
which would be on our coin would be some
sort of audio source, audio component.
20

20

00:01:08,645  -->  00:01:12,675
So let's actually go ahead and
create our audio source on here now.
21

21

00:01:12,675  -->  00:01:15,915
On our coin, we'll apply that
back to the prefab so that means,
22

22

00:01:15,915  -->  00:01:19,595
now that we've got an audio source,
we have a mechanism to play a sound, but
23

23

00:01:19,595  -->  00:01:21,875
we don't have a script that's
going to allow us to play it.
24

24

00:01:21,875  -->  00:01:24,485
Now there's two options
that we can do here,
25

25

00:01:24,485  -->  00:01:29,745
option number one is to create a separate
script, a separate class that's called
26

26

00:01:29,745  -->  00:01:35,230
SFX with a public method that we can
call when a player touches the coin.
27

27

00:01:35,230  -->  00:01:38,980
Now public method would look something
like public void PlayCoinSound,
28

28

00:01:38,980  -->  00:01:42,010
and then what would PlayCoinSound be,
it would look for
29

29

00:01:42,010  -->  00:01:46,900
myAudioSource that we would've
established up and now start method.
30

30

00:01:46,900  -->  00:01:51,060
And to define what our audio source is,
we would find out component.
31

31

00:01:51,060  -->  00:01:54,920
And then we would say
PlayOneShot (coinPickupSound).
32

32

00:01:54,920  -->  00:01:58,600
So basically, it's saying play
the sound as we've done before.
33

33

00:01:58,600  -->  00:02:00,050
However, if we do that,
34

34

00:02:00,050  -->  00:02:03,850
as I've pointed out, right in the middle
of our script here, then we'll destroy it.
35

35

00:02:03,850  -->  00:02:05,980
We could do a coroutine.
36

36

00:02:05,980  -->  00:02:08,250
That is something that I didn't
put in here as an option, but
37

37

00:02:08,250  -->  00:02:09,630
it's not a very good option.
38

38

00:02:09,630  -->  00:02:14,700
If we do a coroutine in here that says
play the sound, and then after that
39

39

00:02:14,700  -->  00:02:18,990
sound has played, now we come back, we
yield, and then we come back to destroy.
40

40

00:02:18,990  -->  00:02:22,971
The problem is that our coin will stick
around while the sound is playing.
41

41

00:02:22,971  -->  00:02:26,447
And it's nice when you jump on a coin,
you want it to disappear straight away,
42

42

00:02:26,447  -->  00:02:29,304
you don't want to have to wait [NOISE] and
then the coin goes away.
43

43

00:02:29,304  -->  00:02:30,873
That looks a bit sloppy.
44

44

00:02:30,873  -->  00:02:32,048
So we could use a coroutine but
45

45

00:02:32,048  -->  00:02:34,660
that doesn't work in this
particular instance, either.
46

46

00:02:34,660  -->  00:02:38,688
What we are going to do is
PlayClipAtPoint, and like I was saying
47

47

00:02:38,688  -->  00:02:43,163
before, we used this in our 3D course
in the Argonne Assault section,
48

48

00:02:43,163  -->  00:02:47,713
where we looked at the fact that it
creates an audio instance Independent
49

49

00:02:47,713  -->  00:02:51,620
of the game object which
spawned it the PlayClipAtPoint.
50

50

00:02:51,620  -->  00:02:54,160
There is one down side of this approach,
51

51

00:02:54,160  -->  00:02:58,450
in that it plays it at
the point that is spawned from.
52

52

00:02:58,450  -->  00:03:03,970
So it'll play the audio just here,
right on the coin, in 3D space.
53

53

00:03:03,970  -->  00:03:06,760
We have no choice,
it has to be used in 3D space.
54

54

00:03:06,760  -->  00:03:10,020
And I'll give you a link against
this lecture to the Unity Docs
55

55

00:03:10,020  -->  00:03:11,970
on PlayClipAtPoint.
56

56

00:03:11,970  -->  00:03:16,580
But given that it's in 3D space and
our camera is, where's our camera that's
57

57

00:03:16,580  -->  00:03:19,510
the end of it, it's up here,
that's the start of our camera.
58

58

00:03:19,510  -->  00:03:23,770
There's gonna be this distance
form the camera to the coin.
59

59

00:03:23,770  -->  00:03:28,740
So we need to make sure that we're
telling this method to play,
60

60

00:03:28,740  -->  00:03:32,160
telling the sound to play
exactly where the camera is.
61

61

00:03:32,160  -->  00:03:34,050
So let's hop in and
do that, it's pretty simple,
62

62

00:03:34,050  -->  00:03:39,730
it's just one line in terms of
the actual playing of the sound effect,
63

63

00:03:39,730  -->  00:03:41,510
but first, we'll get the sound
effect we're going to play.
64

64

00:03:41,510  -->  00:03:48,180
So we'll serialize field at the top here,
SerializeField AudioClip,
65

65

00:03:48,180  -->  00:03:52,566
and what should we call this,
coinPickUpSFX.
66

66

00:03:52,566  -->  00:03:56,787
Okay, and I've given you a sound effect
that I've created in Audacity like most of
67

67

00:03:56,787  -->  00:03:58,910
my sound effects that you can go and grab.
68

68

00:03:58,910  -->  00:04:03,100
Let me just find that for you, and
I've named it SFX Coin Pickup.
69

69

00:04:03,100  -->  00:04:06,290
We will drag that into,
we don't have an audio folder yet.
70

70

00:04:06,290  -->  00:04:09,060
I'll just drag it into assets,
and then it's a good time for
71

71

00:04:09,060  -->  00:04:11,090
us to create an audio folder in here.
72

72

00:04:11,090  -->  00:04:16,478
Give myself a little bit more space,
right click, create Folder, audio,
73

73

00:04:16,478  -->  00:04:21,080
and then we have our SFX Coin Pickup,
drag that into audio, great.
74

74

00:04:21,080  -->  00:04:24,000
So we now have one of those and
if we see on here,
75

75

00:04:24,000  -->  00:04:28,540
our coin pick up SFX, I'm gonna save that,
hop back into Unity here.
76

76

00:04:28,540  -->  00:04:34,210
Click on my coin, apply that,
and find where the script is and
77

77

00:04:34,210  -->  00:04:38,810
we have a coin pickup on SFX,
drag the coin pickup.
78

78

00:04:38,810  -->  00:04:41,010
Did I not put that, this is my script.
79

79

00:04:41,010  -->  00:04:44,890
My script is out of its spot,
there we go, put that into scripts.
80

80

00:04:44,890  -->  00:04:46,270
A little bit of a tidy up as we go.
81

81

00:04:47,285  -->  00:04:51,965
Okay, so click on the coin, drag the SFX
82

82

00:04:51,965  -->  00:04:56,793
over into where the script is down below.
83

83

00:04:56,793  -->  00:04:57,480
Okay, there's our script.
84

84

00:04:57,480  -->  00:04:59,752
We'll drag it over in there.
85

85

00:04:59,752  -->  00:05:05,840
Okay, so now we have defined that the SFX
Coin Pickup is this sound effect here.
86

86

00:05:05,840  -->  00:05:07,550
Again, apply that back to the prefab.
87

87

00:05:07,550  -->  00:05:10,411
Okay, now that we've got that set up
we do actually have a sound effect
88

88

00:05:10,411  -->  00:05:11,360
that we can play.
89

89

00:05:11,360  -->  00:05:15,950
The line we're going to use
in here is AudioSource,
90

90

00:05:15,950  -->  00:05:19,570
with a capital A,
cuz this is the audio source of the scene.
91

91

00:05:19,570  -->  00:05:21,540
And then we wanna use PlayClipAtPoint.
92

92

00:05:22,540  -->  00:05:25,390
And then what we need to do in here, we
need to pass in and you can see here it's
93

93

00:05:25,390  -->  00:05:29,250
looking for the audio clip we need to play
and we've got this up here, coinPickUp.
94

94

00:05:29,250  -->  00:05:34,715
And then a vector 3 position, so
we'll say coin coinPickUpSFX,.
95

95

00:05:34,715  -->  00:05:37,645
Now if we put in the position
of where this game object is,
96

96

00:05:37,645  -->  00:05:41,857
just by saying transformed of position,
then it's gonna play it along while away
97

97

00:05:41,857  -->  00:05:46,060
as I showed in the scene here, that the
camera is distant to where the coin is.
98

98

00:05:46,060  -->  00:05:50,760
So we need to say play at
the point of the main camera.
99

99

00:05:50,760  -->  00:05:52,410
And so this is a micro challenge for you.
100

100

00:05:52,410  -->  00:05:55,360
I don't have a challenge slide in this
video but just a micro challenge for
101

101

00:05:55,360  -->  00:06:00,010
you to figure out how to play this
at the position of the main camera.
102

102

00:06:00,010  -->  00:06:04,000
So pause the video now and
just write in the main camera's position.
103

103

00:06:06,180  -->  00:06:09,430
Okay, that was a micro challenge just
a quick challenge for this video so
104

104

00:06:09,430  -->  00:06:17,080
this will be
camera.main.transform.position.
105

105

00:06:17,080  -->  00:06:21,030
Okay, so we call in, and
then, after we do that,
106

106

00:06:21,030  -->  00:06:26,450
after this PlayClipAtPoint has been
created, then we destroy this game object.
107

107

00:06:26,450  -->  00:06:28,850
Let's go and see how well that worked.
108

108

00:06:28,850  -->  00:06:32,750
Our coin should be all good in there,
it's all applied to the prefab.
109

109

00:06:32,750  -->  00:06:35,830
And fire up the player, drop in the coin.
110

110

00:06:35,830  -->  00:06:40,260
Don't know if you can hear the feedback
coming through from my speakers there, but
111

111

00:06:40,260  -->  00:06:43,110
I am getting a sound effect
triggering when that happens.
112

112

00:06:43,110  -->  00:06:47,079
So that's success, that is us having
the coin sound effect triggered, and
113

113

00:06:47,079  -->  00:06:51,123
I'm gonna do it one more time, just so
you can see what's created over here.
114

114

00:06:51,123  -->  00:06:55,281
It's good to get into the habit of
seeing what's created when these things
115

115

00:06:55,281  -->  00:06:56,010
take place.
116

116

00:06:56,010  -->  00:07:04,820
So I'll pause, and then you can see
under Coin, I wasn't quick enough.
117

117

00:07:04,820  -->  00:07:05,910
Okay, this time I'll be quicker.
118

118

00:07:08,110  -->  00:07:11,560
There we go, we've got this one shot
audio that's been created in there and
119

119

00:07:11,560  -->  00:07:13,770
then when we unpause, it just disappears.
120

120

00:07:13,770  -->  00:07:16,474
So it just does its thing goes away,
bump, there we go.
121

121

00:07:16,474  -->  00:07:19,442
And that's the same principle
we can apply when a player dies,
