00:00:00,025  -->  00:00:05,431
[SOUND] Okay,
something a little bit different.
2

2

00:00:05,431  -->  00:00:10,480
I've found a bug in my game and I'm gonna
see if you can figure out how to fix it.
3

3

00:00:10,480  -->  00:00:14,730
Bug fixing is a very very
important part of making games.
4

4

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:17,850
So here is the bug that I found
after I finished my last video.
5

5

00:00:17,850  -->  00:00:20,170
I think it's probably been in for
the last three or four lectures.
6

6

00:00:20,170  -->  00:00:24,000
So my apologies if you've found this and
you've been struggling with it.
7

7

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:25,200
One guy's made it through.
8

8

00:00:25,200  -->  00:00:27,100
We've still got one life left.
9

9

00:00:27,100  -->  00:00:30,060
Our timer runs out,
our remaining guys come in.
10

10

00:00:30,060  -->  00:00:36,470
We shoot our axes and whatnot, and then
we're sitting there and it doesn't finish.
11

11

00:00:36,470  -->  00:00:39,020
So our game does not finish
when it's supposed to finish.
12

12

00:00:39,020  -->  00:00:42,920
So that's my challenge to you,
is if you've already fixed it,
13

13

00:00:42,920  -->  00:00:43,970
you'll know the answer.
14

14

00:00:43,970  -->  00:00:47,550
If you haven't fixed it,
it's probably a bug in your code.
15

15

00:00:47,550  -->  00:00:49,780
And you can look through your code and
see if you can fix it.
16

16

00:00:49,780  -->  00:00:52,870
Otherwise you can sit there and
just ponder what you think it is.
17

17

00:00:52,870  -->  00:00:55,823
But see if you can figure out what's
going on and see if you can fix that bug.
18

18

00:00:58,324  -->  00:01:01,650
Okay, hopefully you did give
it a good old try to fix.
19

19

00:01:01,650  -->  00:01:05,010
So the process I went through, the first
thing I thought was, well, there might be
20

20

00:01:05,010  -->  00:01:09,040
something to do with the fact that
the timer isn't getting to the end.
21

21

00:01:09,040  -->  00:01:13,680
Or I've accidentally changed the code that
says, when the timer is done and there's
22

22

00:01:13,680  -->  00:01:17,540
no more enemies remaining, that could
be a problem and I went down that path.
23

23

00:01:17,540  -->  00:01:18,163
I couldn't find it.
24

24

00:01:18,163  -->  00:01:22,372
I was looking through the code and
then I thought to myself, hang on minute.
25

25

00:01:22,372  -->  00:01:23,868
What's really going on here?
26

26

00:01:23,868  -->  00:01:29,049
What's going on is the fact that the game
doesn't think that there are zero
27

27

00:01:29,049  -->  00:01:33,820
Attackers cuz that's our condition for
the game being finished.
28

28

00:01:33,820  -->  00:01:37,800
So I went to the place where I know
my numberOfAttackers variable is and
29

29

00:01:37,800  -->  00:01:40,830
scroll down, I saw that we've
got this HandleLoseCondition.
30

30

00:01:40,830  -->  00:01:44,260
I look to see HandleLoseCondition
wasn't being called
31

31

00:01:44,260  -->  00:01:49,070
because our condition of numberOfAttackers
use less than or equal to zero,
32

32

00:01:49,070  -->  00:01:52,070
and time of finished
wasn't coming into play.
33

33

00:01:52,070  -->  00:01:54,390
I printed out the numberOfAttackers, and
34

34

00:01:54,390  -->  00:01:56,730
I could see that I still had
one Attacker in my game.
35

35

00:01:56,730  -->  00:01:58,610
So went back in,
36

36

00:01:58,610  -->  00:02:03,830
clicked on Play, and we had the fox that I
dropped in is saying run run run run run.
37

37

00:02:03,830  -->  00:02:05,980
Drop my nos into here, I'm like okay,
38

38

00:02:05,980  -->  00:02:09,750
so that guy would've been killed by the,
hang on a minute.
39

39

00:02:09,750  -->  00:02:15,030
He's not colliding with our
DamageCollider and he's not being killed.
40

40

00:02:15,030  -->  00:02:18,390
So there's an issue, very simple
issue with the DamageCollider there.
41

41

00:02:18,390  -->  00:02:22,929
So that's the process I went through and
to fix that, we find our DamageCollider.
42

42

00:02:22,929  -->  00:02:27,001
And at the moment all we're doing is
taking a life which is to do with
43

43

00:02:27,001  -->  00:02:28,520
updating our score.
44

44

00:02:28,520  -->  00:02:33,120
So we need to be gathering
the information on who has collided.
45

45

00:02:33,120  -->  00:02:36,958
So I'm gonna put back
in here Collider2D and
46

46

00:02:36,958  -->  00:02:42,040
otherCollider so that we have
a handle to the fact that this
47

47

00:02:42,040  -->  00:02:46,230
is the particular thing, the particular
game object that has the collider.
48

48

00:02:46,230  -->  00:02:49,643
And then after we take life, that'll
just make the counter go down by one.
49

49

00:02:49,643  -->  00:02:52,340
But we actually need to get rid
of this thing to destroy it.
50

50

00:02:52,340  -->  00:02:57,395
And the way we're going to do that is
Destroy and in parentheses we will say
51

51

00:02:57,395  -->  00:03:01,990
otherCollider.gameObject.
52

52

00:03:01,990  -->  00:03:03,550
Okay, save that up.
53

53

00:03:03,550  -->  00:03:05,630
Jump back over into the game.
54

54

00:03:05,630  -->  00:03:07,550
Let's click on Play.
55

55

00:03:07,550  -->  00:03:09,320
Okay, you can see click on Scene view.
56

56

00:03:09,320  -->  00:03:10,380
Run, run, run, run, run.
57

57

00:03:10,380  -->  00:03:12,630
Blink gets to the end and is destroyed.
58

58

00:03:12,630  -->  00:03:13,130
Cool.
59

59

00:03:13,130  -->  00:03:18,630
Then if I kill all my other remaining
attackers, we should get to the end.
60

60

00:03:18,630  -->  00:03:20,391
And after this last guy is shot- [SOUND]
61

61

00:03:20,391  -->  00:03:21,342
[MUSIC]
62

62

00:03:21,342  -->  00:03:22,705
Excellent.
Okay, so it fixed that bug.
63

63

00:03:22,705  -->  00:03:25,100
There'll probably be a few
more that we find but for
64

64

00:03:25,100  -->  00:03:26,730
now the game is looking pretty good.
65

65

00:03:26,730  -->  00:03:28,780
So great work and
I'll see you in the next video.
