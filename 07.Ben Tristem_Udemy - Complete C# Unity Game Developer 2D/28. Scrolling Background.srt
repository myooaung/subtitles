2

00:00:04,234  -->  00:00:07,764
In this video we're starting to invest
a little bit of time into making our game
3

3

00:00:07,764  -->  00:00:09,487
feel polished and feel interesting.
4

4

00:00:09,487  -->  00:00:12,003
And we're adding a scrolling background.
5

5

00:00:12,003  -->  00:00:15,326
So I've got it moving nice and
slow and gently, but
6

6

00:00:15,326  -->  00:00:19,750
you can see our space field is
scrolling as we fly through our games.
7

7

00:00:19,750  -->  00:00:22,450
Let's jump in and
make a scrolling background.
8

8

00:00:22,450  -->  00:00:25,040
Currently we have a background in
our scene, which is pretty cool,
9

9

00:00:25,040  -->  00:00:25,900
it's a Sprite.
10

10

00:00:25,900  -->  00:00:27,430
We're gonna do something
a little bit different.
11

11

00:00:27,430  -->  00:00:29,760
I'm going to start by creating a Quad.
12

12

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:34,020
So right click in your
Hierarchy &gt;3D Object, and Quad.
13

13

00:00:34,020  -->  00:00:37,190
Quad basically is a flat surface,
14

14

00:00:37,190  -->  00:00:42,070
a flat plain, that is the one side of
a cube, you can think of it that way.
15

15

00:00:42,070  -->  00:00:45,925
So you can see we've got our orange
handles in our world here just
16

16

00:00:45,925  -->  00:00:47,055
dragging it out.
17

17

00:00:47,055  -->  00:00:52,155
And very very similar to a Sprite,
but a Quad has a property that will
18

18

00:00:52,155  -->  00:00:56,475
allow us to do something cool with the
material, the texture that we apply to it.
19

19

00:00:56,475  -->  00:01:00,025
So where as a Sprite is pretty much just
an image that is sitting in our scene.
20

20

00:01:00,025  -->  00:01:07,170
This is a Quad, so a 3D object that then
has a material applied over the top of it.
21

21

00:01:07,170  -->  00:01:10,470
What I'll do is take my blue background
and just turn that off for a moment.
22

22

00:01:10,470  -->  00:01:14,062
So we can see I've got my big old white
Quad that's sitting in the scene.
23

23

00:01:14,062  -->  00:01:15,500
Now, a couple of things for the Quad.
24

24

00:01:15,500  -->  00:01:20,520
First of all, let's rename this
to be called Background, and
25

25

00:01:20,520  -->  00:01:22,880
I'm gonna go ahead and
just delete my other background so
26

26

00:01:22,880  -->  00:01:25,880
it's not gonna get in the way,
not to confuse me.
27

27

00:01:25,880  -->  00:01:27,180
So I've got background in here, and
28

28

00:01:27,180  -->  00:01:29,950
you can see because it's a Quad
it's brought in a couple of things,
29

29

00:01:29,950  -->  00:01:33,550
it's got a Mesh Filter, it's got a Mesh
Renderer and it's got a Mesh Collider.
30

30

00:01:33,550  -->  00:01:36,070
We're not gonna need the Mesh Collider,
so I'm gonna right click and
31

31

00:01:36,070  -->  00:01:39,010
Remove Component and
then we focus on the Mesh Renderer.
32

32

00:01:39,010  -->  00:01:42,919
Now, the material we've been using or
the Sprite we've been using for
33

33

00:01:42,919  -->  00:01:43,909
our background.
34

34

00:01:43,909  -->  00:01:48,174
This big blue, cool, spacey background
thing that I made, you can go ahead and
35

35

00:01:48,174  -->  00:01:51,994
find a different space background
if you want, that's totally cool,
36

36

00:01:51,994  -->  00:01:53,983
if you jump over to the Assets store.
37

37

00:01:53,983  -->  00:01:56,193
If you don't have the Assets store tab,
38

38

00:01:56,193  -->  00:01:59,830
then Window &gt; General &gt;and
Assets Store is how you find it.
39

39

00:01:59,830  -->  00:02:03,040
Within the Asset Store, if that loads for
me, it's taking a moment.
40

40

00:02:03,040  -->  00:02:06,440
We can search for
something say for example,
41

41

00:02:06,440  -->  00:02:10,600
scrolling space background, for example.
42

42

00:02:10,600  -->  00:02:13,090
And then, within there we've got
a bunch of different backgrounds,
43

43

00:02:13,090  -->  00:02:16,510
these dynamic space background which
looks pretty cool, and it's free.
44

44

00:02:16,510  -->  00:02:18,580
So you can jump in there and
grab your own background.
45

45

00:02:18,580  -->  00:02:21,390
I recommend you do that, find something
that's different to what I have so
46

46

00:02:21,390  -->  00:02:24,690
that your world, your scene,
your game is looking different to mine.
47

47

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:26,250
Even if it's only looking different but
48

48

00:02:26,250  -->  00:02:29,960
acting the same, that's a great start
to have it really feel like its yours.
49

49

00:02:29,960  -->  00:02:32,360
Okay, so I've got mine and
hopefully you've got yours.
50

50

00:02:32,360  -->  00:02:33,360
Feel free to use mine for
51

51

00:02:33,360  -->  00:02:36,079
now if you don't have a different one,
and our space background.
52

52

00:02:36,079  -->  00:02:37,427
Now at the moment it's a Sprite.
53

53

00:02:37,427  -->  00:02:41,615
I'm gonna leave it in the Sprite folder
despite the fact that we're gonna turn
54

54

00:02:41,615  -->  00:02:44,921
it from a Sprite into a texture
that we can apply onto our Quad.
55

55

00:02:44,921  -->  00:02:49,667
The way we do that is by clicking on
the space background we've got here.
56

56

00:02:49,667  -->  00:02:54,116
And then in the inspector you can
see texture type Sprite 2D and UI.
57

57

00:02:54,116  -->  00:02:58,480
I'm gonna change that to be default,
sorry, it's no longer a sprite.
58

58

00:02:58,480  -->  00:03:00,258
It's now a default texture.
59

59

00:03:00,258  -->  00:03:03,285
And the other thing I'm gonna do,
which is super important,
60

60

00:03:03,285  -->  00:03:06,590
under Wrap Mode I'm gonna change
this from Clamp to Repeat.
61

61

00:03:06,590  -->  00:03:09,189
That means that it can repeat,
it can loop over and over and over,
62

62

00:03:09,189  -->  00:03:10,530
which I'll show you in a minute.
63

63

00:03:10,530  -->  00:03:13,541
Click on Apply and
now it's as simple as dragging our
64

64

00:03:13,541  -->  00:03:18,071
space background over our Quad, and
boom, there we go, it's been applied.
65

65

00:03:18,071  -->  00:03:20,105
It doesn't quite look right though,
does it?
66

66

00:03:20,105  -->  00:03:23,565
So what I'm gonna do is jump
over into click on background,
67

67

00:03:23,565  -->  00:03:28,380
and then you can See here under space
background tiled we've got our Shader.
68

68

00:03:28,380  -->  00:03:31,022
So this is a material we're using,
the shader type is standard,
69

69

00:03:31,022  -->  00:03:34,470
I'm gonna change this from standard and
I expanded this.
70

70

00:03:34,470  -->  00:03:35,500
I didn't need to expand this,
71

71

00:03:35,500  -->  00:03:38,710
but I just expanded it cuz we're gonna
get down to some stuff in a moment.
72

72

00:03:38,710  -->  00:03:44,110
Now change this from Standard Shader,
scroll down to Unlit, and Texture.
73

73

00:03:44,110  -->  00:03:46,540
And now it looks as I'm
expecting it to look.
74

74

00:03:46,540  -->  00:03:50,040
That's just taking the exact
same image that I had before and
75

75

00:03:50,040  -->  00:03:52,640
just drop it into saying not
worrying about lighting.
76

76

00:03:52,640  -->  00:03:56,158
Now underneath here you can see
that we've got Tiling and off-set.
77

77

00:03:56,158  -->  00:04:00,577
And the cool thing about off-set, if you
hover over on the y-axis here, you can see
78

78

00:04:00,577  -->  00:04:04,324
you get your little scroll wheel thingy,
with the arrows side by side.
79

79

00:04:04,324  -->  00:04:08,046
If you move it to the right or
move it to the left then, it scrolls,
80

80

00:04:08,046  -->  00:04:09,355
which is really cool.
81

81

00:04:09,355  -->  00:04:13,042
And because I've created this texture so
that it doesn't have a scene,
82

82

00:04:13,042  -->  00:04:14,559
although it's not perfect.
83

83

00:04:14,559  -->  00:04:18,271
But it doesn't have a seam,
meaning that when I scroll in,
84

84

00:04:18,271  -->  00:04:22,740
you can see down here is gonna
connect nice and neatly to up there.
85

85

00:04:22,740  -->  00:04:24,900
Then it looks like it's seamless and
it's looping.
86

86

00:04:24,900  -->  00:04:28,540
And this offset is just where do we
wanna have it positioned on our quad.
87

87

00:04:28,540  -->  00:04:30,280
So this is the reason
we're using a quad and
88

88

00:04:30,280  -->  00:04:33,730
applying a texture is cuz it
allows us to do this off-set.
89

89

00:04:33,730  -->  00:04:37,290
And imagine what we could do if
we're moving this every frame,
90

90

00:04:37,290  -->  00:04:42,240
then we can move our background, make it
look like it's scrolling, super cool.
91

91

00:04:42,240  -->  00:04:43,710
Okay, so I've got background,
while I'm here,
92

92

00:04:43,710  -->  00:04:45,620
I'm just gonna drag that into Prefabs.
93

93

00:04:45,620  -->  00:04:48,840
It's always good to Prefab these things,
Prefab my background, and
94

94

00:04:48,840  -->  00:04:52,790
I'll Prefab my Shredder that I've had
from before just in case we need it.
95

95

00:04:52,790  -->  00:04:55,160
And I'll Prefab my Enemy Spawner.
96

96

00:04:55,160  -->  00:04:57,730
It's good to Prefab all of these things.
97

97

00:04:57,730  -->  00:04:59,450
Now, clicking on Background,
98

98

00:04:59,450  -->  00:05:02,340
we need to have a script actually,
actually Igo to my Scripts folder.
99

99

00:05:02,340  -->  00:05:03,710
I think this is a cleaner way to do it.
100

100

00:05:03,710  -->  00:05:10,970
Right click, Create C# Script,
we'll call this Background Scroller.
101

101

00:05:10,970  -->  00:05:13,320
Background Scroller if
you're in North America,
102

102

00:05:13,320  -->  00:05:16,770
Background Scrollar if
you're in Australia.
103

103

00:05:16,770  -->  00:05:18,055
Double click on that and open it up.
104

104

00:05:18,055  -->  00:05:23,125
[SOUND] Now first of all I'm gonna need
some way of saying how fast it goes.
105

105

00:05:23,125  -->  00:05:27,440
So I'm gonna SerializeField so
it's available in the inspector.
106

106

00:05:27,440  -->  00:05:32,980
Create a float which we will call
backgroundScrollSpeed, nice and clear.
107

107

00:05:32,980  -->  00:05:37,196
And we will initialize that at 0.5f.
108

108

00:05:37,196  -->  00:05:41,695
I'm really not sure how fast we're gonna
go, and then I need to create another
109

109

00:05:41,695  -->  00:05:45,800
couple of variables in here,
I need a way to connect with the material.
110

110

00:05:45,800  -->  00:05:50,830
So when we go back onto Background we can
see that we have this material in here.
111

111

00:05:50,830  -->  00:05:54,482
It's under Materials, Element 0,
Space-Background-Tiled, and
112

112

00:05:54,482  -->  00:05:58,200
the Space-Background-Tiled when I open
it up has this concept of offset.
113

113

00:05:58,200  -->  00:06:01,384
So we need a way to connect
our code with that, and
114

114

00:06:01,384  -->  00:06:03,954
I'm gonna make myself a new variable.
115

115

00:06:03,954  -->  00:06:08,853
I'll do it right underneath the other
one which will be of type material and
116

116

00:06:08,853  -->  00:06:11,071
we'll just call it myMaterial.
117

117

00:06:11,071  -->  00:06:15,330
Semi colon, and
then also we need a way of saying,
118

118

00:06:15,330  -->  00:06:20,280
what the speed is or what the offset
is that we want to be applying.
119

119

00:06:20,280  -->  00:06:23,670
So this is the offset down here,
just gonna reset this back to zero.
120

120

00:06:23,670  -->  00:06:26,620
It doesn't really matter,
but I'll start it with zero.
121

121

00:06:26,620  -->  00:06:30,640
So we're gonna create a vector too,
which I'll call offset.
122

122

00:06:34,065  -->  00:06:35,800
Okay, so I have those three variables now.
123

123

00:06:35,800  -->  00:06:41,480
Now, within Start, we need to kick
this off by saying, myMaterial equals,
124

124

00:06:41,480  -->  00:06:44,320
we need to get the component
that is the material.
125

125

00:06:44,320  -->  00:06:49,840
So, GetComponent, and
the component is the Renderer, Renderer.
126

126

00:06:51,260  -->  00:06:53,520
Having closed parenthesis .material.
127

127

00:06:53,520  -->  00:06:57,760
So this is how we are getting the material
that is sitting on our background
128

128

00:06:57,760  -->  00:06:59,880
that is part of our mesh renderer.
129

129

00:06:59,880  -->  00:07:04,960
And next we need to give offset some sort
of value on when we start this script.
130

130

00:07:04,960  -->  00:07:09,162
So we'll say, I offset = new Vector2 and
131

131

00:07:09,162  -->  00:07:12,680
then what is the Vector2 gonna be?
132

132

00:07:12,680  -->  00:07:14,850
It's looking for an x and
it's looking for n y.
133

133

00:07:14,850  -->  00:07:18,330
So here's a little mini challenge for
you, if you can figure this out.
134

134

00:07:18,330  -->  00:07:21,440
What is our Vector2 going to be?
135

135

00:07:21,440  -->  00:07:25,970
What do we need to be putting in there for
our x coordinate and our y coordinate?
136

136

00:07:27,150  -->  00:07:29,240
Okay, so our x coordinate is gonna be 0.
137

137

00:07:29,240  -->  00:07:31,540
We don't need to do anything with that,
0f.
138

138

00:07:31,540  -->  00:07:36,290
And our y coordinate is going
to be our backgroundScrollSpeed.
139

139

00:07:36,290  -->  00:07:37,630
Why is it the y coordinate?
140

140

00:07:37,630  -->  00:07:42,770
Well, we wanna be moving our background
up and down or down I guess is the case.
141

141

00:07:42,770  -->  00:07:44,470
So the y's the one that's moving.
142

142

00:07:44,470  -->  00:07:48,660
If we would offset or change our x offset
then we'd be moving left to right which is
143

143

00:07:48,660  -->  00:07:51,330
totally valid if you've got
a side-scrolling shooter.
144

144

00:07:51,330  -->  00:07:55,830
That we have a top-down
flying upwards shooter.
145

145

00:07:55,830  -->  00:07:59,860
And then finally, within our Update,
we need to be saying myMaterial.,
146

146

00:07:59,860  -->  00:08:02,700
now this is the tricky part
that you might not know.
147

147

00:08:02,700  -->  00:08:09,010
But it's gonna be mainTextureOffset, and
148

148

00:08:09,010  -->  00:08:13,680
that's how we get access to this
mainTextureOffset down here.
149

149

00:08:13,680  -->  00:08:18,983
So our mainTextureOffset += offset,
that's the offset that we
150

150

00:08:18,983  -->  00:08:24,094
already created just above, *,
what do you think we times this
151

151

00:08:24,094  -->  00:08:29,416
by to make it frame rate independent,
what we would times this by?
152

152

00:08:29,416  -->  00:08:33,871
I hear you yelling at the screen,
Time.deltaTime.
153

153

00:08:33,871  -->  00:08:37,479
Excellent, so we'll save this,
jump back over into Unity.
154

154

00:08:38,830  -->  00:08:41,930
Make sure that we've added this
component to our background, so
155

155

00:08:41,930  -->  00:08:43,220
click on Add Component.
156

156

00:08:43,220  -->  00:08:48,850
It's called Background Scroller, there it
is right there, click and add, excellent.
157

157

00:08:48,850  -->  00:08:52,750
We can see that in our, I'm just gonna
close this up, we have a speed of 0.5.
158

158

00:08:52,750  -->  00:08:57,380
When we click on play, it should look
like we're flying, it does indeed.
159

159

00:08:57,380  -->  00:08:58,740
Look at that, pew, pew.
160

160

00:08:58,740  -->  00:09:03,100
Now, it's probably going a little bit too
fast for all of the galaxies behind us.
161

161

00:09:03,100  -->  00:09:05,899
But this is something cool,
a little bit of extreme tuning.
162

162

00:09:05,899  -->  00:09:07,762
What would happen if we put it to say 5.
163

163

00:09:07,762  -->  00:09:12,865
Would it look like we're going through
some sort of jump speed, warp speeds.
164

164

00:09:12,865  -->  00:09:15,275
My goodness, okay,
that's a little bit nauseating.
165

165

00:09:15,275  -->  00:09:18,775
I'm not sure if my frame rate on my video
capture is picking that up for you but
166

166

00:09:18,775  -->  00:09:19,824
that's way too fast.
167

167

00:09:19,824  -->  00:09:22,115
So we'll say 0.02, see how that feels.
168

168

00:09:22,115  -->  00:09:24,955
I'm just looking for a bit of
gentle scrolling in the background
169

169

00:09:24,955  -->  00:09:27,835
just to give our world a little bit
of movement, a little bit of life.
170

170

00:09:27,835  -->  00:09:31,180
That feels pretty good,
it feels like there is some movement.
171

171

00:09:31,180  -->  00:09:33,700
And in the next video we're
gonna add a bit more depth.
172

172

00:09:33,700  -->  00:09:39,040
We're gonna add some parallel x by putting
some particles that are closer and
173

173

00:09:39,040  -->  00:09:40,760
moving quicker for the player.
174

174

00:09:40,760  -->  00:09:42,420
So great work in this video.
175

175

00:09:42,420  -->  00:09:45,140
It's super good fun I think
adding a little bit of polish and
176

176

00:09:45,140  -->  00:09:46,550
I'll see you in the next lecture.
