[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,009  -->  00:00:07,422
Hey, in this video we're gonna wrap up
the block breakers section of the course.
3

3

00:00:07,422  -->  00:00:09,960
We're gonna create a couple
of extra levels and
4

4

00:00:09,960  -->  00:00:12,253
then share our game to ShareMyGame.com.
5

5

00:00:12,253  -->  00:00:15,589
And the process of creating extra levels,
we can just duplicate them,
6

6

00:00:15,589  -->  00:00:16,708
that's usually okay.
7

7

00:00:16,708  -->  00:00:19,712
We need to make sure that
everything is okay once we do that.
8

8

00:00:19,712  -->  00:00:23,900
But first of all, I'm going to rename, cuz
my Level 1 at the moment is a little bit
9

9

00:00:23,900  -->  00:00:26,665
too sophisticated, ie,
there's too many blocks.
10

10

00:00:26,665  -->  00:00:29,263
It's not, I'm not saying that
the fact that it's a Rick level,
11

11

00:00:29,263  -->  00:00:30,504
that's the sophistication.
12

12

00:00:30,504  -->  00:00:33,918
That's not it at all, it's got too many
blocks in it, I think for Level 1.
13

13

00:00:33,918  -->  00:00:38,297
You wanna think about progression, start
off easy and then allow people to ramp up.
14

14

00:00:38,297  -->  00:00:43,180
Don't start off too easy, but
start off less complicated.
15

15

00:00:43,180  -->  00:00:48,670
So Level 1, I'm gonna rename that to
Level 3, change it in my build order,
16

16

00:00:48,670  -->  00:00:53,315
so Build Settings, that's off screen,
a moment, there we go,
17

17

00:00:53,315  -->  00:00:57,810
change it to below Level 2,
great, jump back over into here.
18

18

00:00:57,810  -->  00:01:01,311
Level 2, I'll duplicate that,
it's called Level 4,
19

19

00:01:01,311  -->  00:01:06,391
I'll rename this to Level 1, and then my
Level 2, I'll duplicate one more time.
20

20

00:01:06,391  -->  00:01:08,563
I tell a lie, I'll duplicate
two more times, there we go.
21

21

00:01:08,563  -->  00:01:09,925
So I've got a Level 4 and a 5.
22

22

00:01:09,925  -->  00:01:12,548
So, they should look exactly like
my level two, which they do.
23

23

00:01:12,548  -->  00:01:16,142
Level 1 I'm gonna go in and
just, yes, I'm on level 1, and
24

24

00:01:16,142  -->  00:01:18,023
yes make it a little bit easier.
25

25

00:01:18,023  -->  00:01:19,306
Maybe one huge block and
26

26

00:01:19,306  -->  00:01:23,734
have these invisible blocks in here we'll
train the player they can work their way
27

27

00:01:23,734  -->  00:01:26,956
up to these invisible blocks delete those,
delete these.
28

28

00:01:26,956  -->  00:01:30,899
Oops, I accidentally deleted my camera
make sure you don't do that that is not
29

29

00:01:30,899  -->  00:01:32,883
the way to go about doing these things.
30

30

00:01:32,883  -->  00:01:36,147
So I'll delete those blocks,
okay, so you get the picture.
31

31

00:01:36,147  -->  00:01:40,114
I'm gonna go through and
make a very simple first level,
32

32

00:01:40,114  -->  00:01:45,665
slowly ramping up in difficulty or in
the amount of content that's in the game.
33

33

00:01:45,665  -->  00:01:49,892
So this one just starts off this one
big block and says, come and get some.
34

34

00:01:49,892  -->  00:01:52,807
Might make it a three size, okay.
35

35

00:01:52,807  -->  00:01:54,805
It's three size, we play that, we win.
36

36

00:01:54,805  -->  00:01:56,181
This is Level 1, yes it is.
37

37

00:01:56,181  -->  00:01:59,630
Let me going into my build settings,
File, Build Settings, and
38

38

00:01:59,630  -->  00:02:02,149
just check that we've
added all of our scenes.
39

39

00:02:02,149  -->  00:02:04,299
So drag in Level 1, up to the top.
40

40

00:02:04,299  -->  00:02:10,367
Drag in level 4 underneath Level 3, and
Level 5 should go underneath Level 4.
41

41

00:02:10,367  -->  00:02:13,201
There we go, okay, so
we'll create the levels.
42

42

00:02:13,201  -->  00:02:14,214
We'll have some progression.
43

43

00:02:14,214  -->  00:02:17,674
Make sure that Level 1 loads
into Level 2 and so on.
44

44

00:02:17,674  -->  00:02:21,538
I'll just play that to test it when we
duplicate there's nothing crazy going on,
45

45

00:02:21,538  -->  00:02:22,667
that it all works fine.
46

46

00:02:22,667  -->  00:02:27,524
I've got Auto Play is turned on by
default, I'll make sure we turn
47

47

00:02:27,524  -->  00:02:32,149
that off and then click on my
Game window and then 1, 2 and 3.
48

48

00:02:32,149  -->  00:02:34,030
That's a good intro level, I think.
49

49

00:02:34,030  -->  00:02:35,084
That's not too bad.
50

50

00:02:35,084  -->  00:02:38,724
So my thought process is to start
off simple, add the complexity,
51

51

00:02:38,724  -->  00:02:42,504
add the invincible blocks later on,
maybe add some rotated blocks.
52

52

00:02:42,504  -->  00:02:45,545
A quick interruption, I've decided to
jump ahead in time, make my levels, and
53

53

00:02:45,545  -->  00:02:47,481
then come back and
show you what I've come up with.
54

54

00:02:47,481  -->  00:02:49,914
This is my Level 1,
just one big block, easy to kill.
55

55

00:02:49,914  -->  00:02:51,499
Level 2, it's me saying hi.
56

56

00:02:51,499  -->  00:02:54,054
A couple of indestructibles
to train the player this.
57

57

00:02:54,054  -->  00:02:56,968
And indestructibles, unbreakables,
that they'll come up against.
58

58

00:02:56,968  -->  00:02:59,632
And then this is just a colorful pretty
one where hopefully the ball gets in there
59

59

00:02:59,632  -->  00:03:01,881
and does a little bit of boing,
boing, boing, bouncing around.
60

60

00:03:01,881  -->  00:03:04,712
Level 4, it's the one we're all
familiar with, that's the Rick level.
61

61

00:03:04,712  -->  00:03:05,938
And then Level 5.
62

62

00:03:05,938  -->  00:03:10,115
I made just a little guy here and I bet I
know the first place you launch the ball,
63

63

00:03:10,115  -->  00:03:13,997
cuz it's the first place I launched
the ball and I'm playing this game.
64

64

00:03:13,997  -->  00:03:15,956
So they are the five levels that I got.
65

65

00:03:15,956  -->  00:03:17,501
Just wanted to show those to you.
66

66

00:03:17,501  -->  00:03:19,545
Once you've created at least five levels,
67

67

00:03:19,545  -->  00:03:21,646
five levels that you
think are interesting,
68

68

00:03:21,646  -->  00:03:25,589
slightly different backgrounds on your
levels, slightly different challenges.
69

69

00:03:25,589  -->  00:03:28,426
Then what I'd like you to do,
save it all up,
70

70

00:03:28,426  -->  00:03:31,962
make sure it works before
hand play test it, of course.
71

71

00:03:31,962  -->  00:03:36,215
Go to Build Settings, within the platforms
here, scroll down, find WebGL.
72

72

00:03:36,215  -->  00:03:38,857
If like me it says no WebGL module loaded,
73

73

00:03:38,857  -->  00:03:43,462
then you can go through this manual
process, open the download page, or
74

74

00:03:43,462  -->  00:03:46,872
open up Unity Hub and
then find your current install.
75

75

00:03:46,872  -->  00:03:51,275
For me it's currently 28.18.2, click on
the little hamburgery thing to the right,
76

76

00:03:51,275  -->  00:03:55,410
actually that's not the hamburger, that's
the three pancakes, over to the right.
77

77

00:03:55,410  -->  00:03:59,505
Pancakes maybe, I guess I'm hungry,
click on Add Component and
78

78

00:03:59,505  -->  00:04:03,912
from Add Component, scroll down
until you find WebGL Build Support.
79

79

00:04:03,912  -->  00:04:10,130
And click on that, install WebGL, once
you've installed WebGL comeback into here.
80

80

00:04:10,130  -->  00:04:14,639
And it should be all call,
you can create a build for WebGL.
81

81

00:04:14,639  -->  00:04:17,689
And then once you've done that,
zip that up and
82

82

00:04:17,689  -->  00:04:21,592
jump over to ShareMyGame.com,
follow the instructions.
83

83

00:04:21,592  -->  00:04:23,551
First of all, make a WebGL build.
84

84

00:04:23,551  -->  00:04:26,405
Then zip it, and then upload your game.
85

85

00:04:26,405  -->  00:04:27,783
And if you forget how to do that,
86

86

00:04:27,783  -->  00:04:30,908
I go through that in a lot greater
detail in a previous section of course.
87

87

00:04:30,908  -->  00:04:33,187
So you can jump back there and
go through it Step by step.
88

88

00:04:33,187  -->  00:04:34,101
But it's pretty easy.
89

89

00:04:34,101  -->  00:04:36,523
Make a build, zip it up,
and then upload your game.
90

90

00:04:36,523  -->  00:04:40,018
And remember, when you very first
upload it to pay attention to the link
91

91

00:04:40,018  -->  00:04:44,108
that it gives you because that's the link
you'll need to share with other people.
92

92

00:04:44,108  -->  00:04:45,043
So that's it.
93

93

00:04:45,043  -->  00:04:49,333
Well done, great work,
super duper amazingly fantastic work.
94

94

00:04:49,333  -->  00:04:53,784
I've been looking at what everyone has
been coming up with and I love that you're
95

95

00:04:53,784  -->  00:04:57,724
being creative and really putting
your own impression into the games.
96

96

00:04:57,724  -->  00:05:01,859
So to recap, finalize and upload,
create at least five levels for your game,
97

97

00:05:01,859  -->  00:05:03,501
upload to sharemygame.com.
98

98

00:05:03,501  -->  00:05:04,385
Share with the community.
99

99

00:05:04,385  -->  00:05:05,630
We would love to see it.
100

100

00:05:05,630  -->  00:05:09,007
And just a little hint for you,
if you can share a screenshot or a video,
101

101

00:05:09,007  -->  00:05:12,720
as well as the link to your game, then it
helps people see a little bit more about
102

102

00:05:12,720  -->  00:05:16,122
what your game's about and have a bit
more confidence to go click on it.
103

103

00:05:16,122  -->  00:05:19,788
If you just say hey here's my link then
your less likely to get people to click
104

104

00:05:19,788  -->  00:05:23,473
on it, so share a little bit of a screen
shot or a video that helps a Bump site.
105

105

00:05:23,473  -->  00:05:26,821
This is a good time if you wanted
to try out any other things for
106

106

00:05:26,821  -->  00:05:30,378
your game adding some extra features,
playing around with it.
107

107

00:05:30,378  -->  00:05:31,683
This is the time to do it.
108

108

00:05:31,683  -->  00:05:36,059
And also one more thing I'll remind you
of that as you go through the rest of
109

109

00:05:36,059  -->  00:05:41,017
the course you'll learn new strategies,
you'll learn new Approaches new code.
110

110

00:05:41,017  -->  00:05:44,343
And you can come back to this
point in your project and
111

111

00:05:44,343  -->  00:05:47,228
add those new nifty core
things to this game.
112

112

00:05:47,228  -->  00:05:52,060
So awesome, great work, fantastic, and
I will see you in the next lecture.
