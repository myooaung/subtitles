1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,088
[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,088  -->  00:00:08,070
I'm sure you've heard the famous saying,
tidy hierarchy, tidy mind.
3

3

00:00:08,070  -->  00:00:12,464
Well, if we look at our hierarchy when
we start to place down defenders,
4

4

00:00:12,464  -->  00:00:14,783
it becomes very untidy, very messy.
5

5

00:00:14,783  -->  00:00:17,936
You can see all these gnomes and
axes, all sorts of stuff going on,
6

6

00:00:17,936  -->  00:00:21,597
which makes it difficult if we need to
go and figure something out mid-game,
7

7

00:00:21,597  -->  00:00:23,550
pause it and find what's going on.
8

8

00:00:23,550  -->  00:00:25,120
Just much better to have it tidy,
9

9

00:00:25,120  -->  00:00:28,880
particularly when you start making
massive projects, which I know you will.
10

10

00:00:28,880  -->  00:00:33,640
So I'm going to jump over into
my defender spawner script.
11

11

00:00:33,640  -->  00:00:38,550
And up at the very top,
gonna create a game object, gameObject,
12

12

00:00:38,550  -->  00:00:43,060
that will be called defenderParent.
13

13

00:00:45,700  -->  00:00:48,060
Now I need to put back in my start method.
14

14

00:00:48,060  -->  00:00:48,760
So start.
15

15

00:00:48,760  -->  00:00:50,200
What do I wanna have happen on start?
16

16

00:00:50,200  -->  00:00:52,870
Well, I wanna call a method that
17

17

00:00:52,870  -->  00:00:57,100
will take care of creating the defender
child parent relationship.
18

18

00:00:57,100  -->  00:01:01,630
So I'll call this CreateDefenderParent.
19

19

00:01:01,630  -->  00:01:03,705
And parentheses, semicolon.
20

20

00:01:03,705  -->  00:01:09,150
Right-click, quick actions and refactors,
to create that as a method just below it.
21

21

00:01:09,150  -->  00:01:10,770
And what will be in here?
22

22

00:01:10,770  -->  00:01:19,340
Well, first step, I'm going to define my
defenderParent object as GameObject.find.
23

23

00:01:19,340  -->  00:01:20,697
So I want to find something.
24

24

00:01:20,697  -->  00:01:21,504
What am I finding?
25

25

00:01:21,504  -->  00:01:25,130
Well, I'm finding defenders.
26

26

00:01:25,130  -->  00:01:27,020
Now, string references we don't like.
27

27

00:01:27,020  -->  00:01:28,860
They're messy, they're dangerous.
28

28

00:01:28,860  -->  00:01:30,290
Did I even spell it correctly?
29

29

00:01:30,290  -->  00:01:32,480
I did on this occasion, yay for me.
30

30

00:01:32,480  -->  00:01:33,560
What's a better way to do this?
31

31

00:01:33,560  -->  00:01:35,390
Well, we've just been
learning about constant.
32

32

00:01:35,390  -->  00:01:41,630
So at the top of our script let's add
ourselves a const, which will be a string.
33

33

00:01:41,630  -->  00:01:45,155
And we'll use capitals to
show that it's a const,
34

34

00:01:45,155  -->  00:01:48,740
DEFENDER_PARENT_NAME, and
that will equal what?
35

35

00:01:48,740  -->  00:01:51,022
It will equal Defenders.
36

36

00:01:51,022  -->  00:01:54,150
So then we've added our string
reference just once, and
37

37

00:01:54,150  -->  00:01:58,582
then in the future we will have this nice
little hook that we can access when we're
38

38

00:01:58,582  -->  00:02:00,223
typing in our autocomplete.
39

39

00:02:00,223  -->  00:02:02,170
So down here, what are we looking for?
40

40

00:02:02,170  -->  00:02:05,750
Find, in parenthesis,
I'm finding Defender,
41

41

00:02:05,750  -->  00:02:11,340
and you can see it's got
DEFENDER_PARENT_NAME.
42

42

00:02:11,340  -->  00:02:14,420
So it's exactly the same, I could put
my string reference down in there, or
43

43

00:02:14,420  -->  00:02:16,240
I could just do it once and define it.
44

44

00:02:16,240  -->  00:02:22,230
Now what if Defender, so this Defenders
game object, what if it doesn't exist?
45

45

00:02:22,230  -->  00:02:25,290
What if there's no such thing in here or
what if it's called something different?
46

46

00:02:25,290  -->  00:02:27,954
Then we don't wanna be having all
sorts of errors and exceptions.
47

47

00:02:27,954  -->  00:02:31,467
So let's say, so if (!defenderParent), so
48

48

00:02:31,467  -->  00:02:37,480
if the defenderParent doesn't exist, if
there is none, then what do we wanna do?
49

49

00:02:39,570  -->  00:02:45,626
We want to have defenderParent be defined
as, so defenderParent equals new,
50

50

00:02:45,626  -->  00:02:50,874
creating a new, GameObject,
and then DEFENDER_PARENT_NAME.
51

51

00:02:53,074  -->  00:02:55,660
See how nice that was
to have auto completed?
52

52

00:02:55,660  -->  00:02:58,690
Okay, let's save that up,
and, down the bottom,
53

53

00:02:58,690  -->  00:03:00,850
we actually need to use
this one we instantiated.
54

54

00:03:00,850  -->  00:03:03,670
So down the very bottom,
I've got SpawnDefender.
55

55

00:03:03,670  -->  00:03:07,861
And we're creating a new defender, so
56

56

00:03:07,861  -->  00:03:16,090
I will write newDefender.transform.parent
is going to be equal to what?
57

57

00:03:16,090  -->  00:03:20,650
It's going to be equal to
58

58

00:03:20,650  -->  00:03:26,957
defenderParent.transform;.
59

59

00:03:26,957  -->  00:03:33,400
So that means that it's instantiated
as a child to our defenderParent.
60

60

00:03:33,400  -->  00:03:36,360
Save that up, make sure it works,
click on Play.
61

61

00:03:36,360  -->  00:03:41,415
When I drop down my gnomes, get down
some gnomes, [SOUND] You can see that
62

62

00:03:41,415  -->  00:03:47,582
they are created within our, now pause,
cuz we've still got out projectiles there.
63

63

00:03:47,582  -->  00:03:50,536
In our Defenders,
you can see all of my gnomes, and
64

64

00:03:50,536  -->  00:03:53,580
within our defender
gameObjects which is awesome.
65

65

00:03:53,580  -->  00:03:55,866
Okay, and because we do have
all those messy projectiles,
66

66

00:03:55,866  -->  00:03:58,715
we need to take care of those and
that's going to be the challenge for you.
67

67

00:03:58,715  -->  00:04:00,787
So do the same with projectiles,
68

68

00:04:00,787  -->  00:04:04,590
have our projectiles parented
to a projectile game object.
69

69

00:04:04,590  -->  00:04:06,243
Take that on, and
I'll see you back on when you're done.
70

70

00:04:08,872  -->  00:04:10,790
Okay, where do we find this?
71

71

00:04:10,790  -->  00:04:12,460
What's the script we're looking in?
72

72

00:04:12,460  -->  00:04:14,410
Well, I'm going to jump in here.
73

73

00:04:14,410  -->  00:04:17,270
It's gonna be one of two, it's either
gonna be Projectile or Shooter.
74

74

00:04:17,270  -->  00:04:21,040
I'm gonna have a little bit of quick
glance at it, which of these, okay,
75

75

00:04:21,040  -->  00:04:23,980
I'm instantiating on fire,
so I know that it's shooter.
76

76

00:04:23,980  -->  00:04:28,666
Open that up, same process,
up at the top I'm gonna create
77

77

00:04:28,666  -->  00:04:33,280
myself a game object which I
will call projectileParent.
78

78

00:04:35,150  -->  00:04:39,072
Within start we're gonna call
the method weren't created yet
79

79

00:04:39,072  -->  00:04:41,669
which will be CreateProjectileParent.
80

80

00:04:41,669  -->  00:04:48,590
Right-click, Quick actions and Refactors,
generate that method just down below here.
81

81

00:04:48,590  -->  00:04:49,767
What do we need to do?
82

82

00:04:49,767  -->  00:04:55,750
Well, projectileParent is going
to be equal GameObject.Find.
83

83

00:04:55,750  -->  00:04:57,070
What are we finding?
84

84

00:04:57,070  -->  00:04:58,870
Well, we haven't created
our const just yet.
85

85

00:04:58,870  -->  00:05:00,310
So, let's do that at the top.
86

86

00:05:00,310  -->  00:05:06,182
Const string, and
this will be PROJECTILE PARENT,
87

87

00:05:06,182  -->  00:05:09,330
oops, _NAME.
88

88

00:05:09,330  -->  00:05:16,780
That's gonna be equal to or
assigned as Projectiles.
89

89

00:05:17,950  -->  00:05:19,930
Semicolon, okay, so
now what are we finding?
90

90

00:05:19,930  -->  00:05:25,510
We're finding PROJECTILE_PARENT_NAME,
excellent.
91

91

00:05:25,510  -->  00:05:30,280
Same as before, if there is none,
so if parentheses
92

92

00:05:31,310  -->  00:05:36,670
exclamation mark, there's no projectile
parent, then what do we wanna do?
93

93

00:05:36,670  -->  00:05:38,640
Well, we better go ahead and create one.
94

94

00:05:38,640  -->  00:05:45,474
ProjectileParent = new GameObject,
95

95

00:05:45,474  -->  00:05:52,940
in parentheses PROJECT_PARENT_NAME.
96

96

00:05:52,940  -->  00:05:54,270
And you know what?
97

97

00:05:54,270  -->  00:05:55,960
I didn't do this deliberately,
but I've gone and
98

98

00:05:55,960  -->  00:05:58,590
made a mistake that I'll show
you how awesome this is.
99

99

00:05:58,590  -->  00:06:02,240
I've named it PROJECT_PARENT_NAME,
that makes absolutely no sense,
100

100

00:06:02,240  -->  00:06:02,960
what was I thinking?
101

101

00:06:02,960  -->  00:06:04,650
So double-click on that.
102

102

00:06:04,650  -->  00:06:08,713
Control RR, I can see there's three
instances and I can go in here and
103

103

00:06:08,713  -->  00:06:10,780
say PROJECTILE_PARENT_NAME.
104

104

00:06:10,780  -->  00:06:14,540
Apply, there we go, and
we've easily renamed that.
105

105

00:06:14,540  -->  00:06:17,910
Thank you for
having that as a const worked out nicely.
106

106

00:06:17,910  -->  00:06:20,931
And the of course we scroll all
the way down to the bottom and
107

107

00:06:20,931  -->  00:06:24,703
we find where we are instantiating and
we need to add an extra bit in here.
108

108

00:06:24,703  -->  00:06:28,420
Well, first of all, we're only
instantiating this as an object.
109

109

00:06:28,420  -->  00:06:30,740
We need to instantiate as a game object.
110

110

00:06:30,740  -->  00:06:34,950
So what I mean by that, in front
of instantiate we type GameObject,
111

111

00:06:36,480  -->  00:06:38,230
and then we give it a new name.
112

112

00:06:38,230  -->  00:06:45,545
So newProjectile = it's going to be a big
line, but we'll put it on multiple lines,
113

113

00:06:45,545  -->  00:06:50,828
=, gonna give this a new line,
Instantiate(projectile,
114

114

00:06:50,828  -->  00:06:55,970
and the position and
the rotation, and as GameObject.
115

115

00:06:55,970  -->  00:06:56,670
Why do we do that?
116

116

00:06:56,670  -->  00:06:59,120
Well, that's we're casting it,
that's what this is called,
117

117

00:06:59,120  -->  00:07:02,430
and we say as game object we
need this as a game object so
118

118

00:07:02,430  -->  00:07:05,650
that we can place it within our
hierarchy and we can manipulate it.
119

119

00:07:05,650  -->  00:07:10,427
When we instantiate not as a GameObject,
it's instantiated just as an object.
120

120

00:07:10,427  -->  00:07:13,699
And you can see here,
UnityEngine.Object.Instantiate, and
121

121

00:07:13,699  -->  00:07:15,670
we don't have as much control over it.
122

122

00:07:15,670  -->  00:07:20,070
A GameObject allows us to do things that
if it's just an object, we can't do.
123

123

00:07:20,070  -->  00:07:24,613
Okay, it's a very simple explanation but
basically,
124

124

00:07:24,613  -->  00:07:30,701
we're casting it as a GameObject, so
that we can now do more stuff with it,
125

125

00:07:30,701  -->  00:07:33,812
which is going to say newProjectile.
126

126

00:07:33,812  -->  00:07:38,835
NewProjectile, if I can spell
it correctly .transform.parent
127

127

00:07:38,835  -->  00:07:42,619
is going to be =
projectileParent.transform.
128

128

00:07:42,619  -->  00:07:44,712
Save that, let's see how we go.
129

129

00:07:44,712  -->  00:07:47,130
Back over into Unity, click on Play.
130

130

00:07:48,240  -->  00:07:51,591
Drop down some cacti to make sure it's
not just the gnomes that it works with.
131

131

00:07:51,591  -->  00:07:55,074
[SOUND] Okay,
they're shooting a bunch of stuff.
132

132

00:07:55,074  -->  00:07:56,860
We're gonna have explosions that come and
133

133

00:07:56,860  -->  00:08:00,010
go cuz they're being destroyed when
they have done their business.
134

134

00:08:00,010  -->  00:08:02,700
And if we look,
there's a Projectiles game object and
135

135

00:08:02,700  -->  00:08:04,900
we've got some projectiles
that are within that.
136

136

00:08:04,900  -->  00:08:06,620
Excellent so that's mission accomplished.
137

137

00:08:06,620  -->  00:08:07,600
Tidied up the hierarchy.
138

138

00:08:07,600  -->  00:08:09,330
It might seem like a small minor thing but
139

139

00:08:09,330  -->  00:08:11,640
it's really important to
get into these habits.
140

140

00:08:11,640  -->  00:08:14,390
So that you can impress your colleagues
when you're out there working in
141

141

00:08:14,390  -->  00:08:17,230
the game industry with,
look how neat and tidy my hierarchy is.
142

142

00:08:17,230  -->  00:08:18,750
That's one reason of many.
143

143

00:08:18,750  -->  00:08:21,270
So great work, and
I'll see you in the next lecture.
