[MUSIC]
2

2

00:00:04,113  -->  00:00:08,180
In this video, we're gonna set up a system
where we can change the speed of the game.
3

3

00:00:08,180  -->  00:00:10,850
So if I want the game to be really slow,
then I can.
4

4

00:00:10,850  -->  00:00:12,710
If I want the game to be really fast, bop,
5

5

00:00:12,710  -->  00:00:16,930
hey that was super fast, then I can change
that as well with this simple slider.
6

6

00:00:16,930  -->  00:00:18,830
I can change it from 0.1 up to 10.
7

7

00:00:18,830  -->  00:00:22,720
Okay, so let's jump in and
change the speed of our game.
8

8

00:00:22,720  -->  00:00:25,080
First thing we'll do here is
jump over to the unity docks and
9

9

00:00:25,080  -->  00:00:28,390
have a look at what it has to
say about Time.time scale.
10

10

00:00:28,390  -->  00:00:29,260
Couple of clues in here.
11

11

00:00:29,260  -->  00:00:34,910
One is that when Time.time scale is 1.0,
then time is passing as fast as real time.
12

12

00:00:34,910  -->  00:00:38,560
And when time is 0.5,
then things are going half the speed or
13

13

00:00:38,560  -->  00:00:41,200
two times slower if you wanna
word it the other way around.
14

14

00:00:41,200  -->  00:00:45,020
If you want things to go faster,
then you increase the value.
15

15

00:00:45,020  -->  00:00:46,710
Okay, so
now that we've got that established.
16

16

00:00:46,710  -->  00:00:47,510
It's pretty simple to write.
17

17

00:00:47,510  -->  00:00:51,860
It's just Time.timescale =
whatever we want our scale to be.
18

18

00:00:51,860  -->  00:00:56,500
So first of all, we need to create a way
to keep track of the status of our game or
19

19

00:00:56,500  -->  00:00:57,850
the state of our game.
20

20

00:00:57,850  -->  00:00:59,875
So I'm gonna create a new
game object over here.
21

21

00:00:59,875  -->  00:01:01,330
Right-click Create Empty.
22

22

00:01:01,330  -->  00:01:04,490
I will call this Game State.
23

23

00:01:04,490  -->  00:01:08,250
Cuz it's going to hold the current
state of where we are,
24

24

00:01:08,250  -->  00:01:11,930
or Game Status might be a better
way of doing this, Game Status.
25

25

00:01:11,930  -->  00:01:15,440
And Game Status will have score in it,
it will have speed in it,
26

26

00:01:15,440  -->  00:01:19,110
any of those things that we wanna know,
what's the status right at the moment?
27

27

00:01:19,110  -->  00:01:21,530
Technically, it's state, but
technically it's not state, so
28

28

00:01:21,530  -->  00:01:22,960
we'll call it Game Status.
29

29

00:01:22,960  -->  00:01:27,193
Okay, and then we wanna create
a script of the same name, so
30

30

00:01:27,193  -->  00:01:32,374
I'll call Game Status as our script and
then create and add that script.
31

31

00:01:34,313  -->  00:01:37,450
Okay, find where it is
in our assets folder.
32

32

00:01:37,450  -->  00:01:39,170
On assets, if it's gonna let me here.
33

33

00:01:39,170  -->  00:01:40,670
Taking a little bit of
time thinking about it.
34

34

00:01:40,670  -->  00:01:44,605
Grab Game Status and drop it into scripts.
35

35

00:01:44,605  -->  00:01:46,804
Double-click on scripts and
open up GameStatus.
36

36

00:01:49,848  -->  00:01:51,777
Loading, loading, loading,
37

37

00:01:51,777  -->  00:01:56,430
now the speed of the game is something
that we need to know every single frame.
38

38

00:01:56,430  -->  00:02:00,150
Therefore, we'll be putting it
into the update method here and
39

39

00:02:00,150  -->  00:02:01,500
it'll be pretty straightforward.
40

40

00:02:01,500  -->  00:02:06,202
We will say Time.timeScale =, and
41

41

00:02:06,202  -->  00:02:10,607
we can start this by saying, 1f.
42

42

00:02:10,607  -->  00:02:15,280
That will say our time is started
off at just regular time.
43

43

00:02:15,280  -->  00:02:18,410
Now as you know, it's bad for
us to bury magic numbers,
44

44

00:02:18,410  -->  00:02:19,980
1's not a magic number at the moment.
45

45

00:02:19,980  -->  00:02:23,510
But if we were to change this to a bit
faster, 1.5, it becomes a magic number.
46

46

00:02:23,510  -->  00:02:24,880
So it's bad for us to bury that there, so
47

47

00:02:24,880  -->  00:02:30,200
let's create a variable at the top
of our class, so that we can change,
48

48

00:02:30,200  -->  00:02:35,790
we can serialize our time speed and
game speed in the inspector.
49

49

00:02:35,790  -->  00:02:38,510
So pause the video now,
just a mini challenge for you.
50

50

00:02:38,510  -->  00:02:43,468
Create a variable that we can serialize
instead of having this number 1f
51

51

00:02:43,468  -->  00:02:44,450
just in here.
52

52

00:02:44,450  -->  00:02:49,886
Okay, so the way that we do this
is to say, let's (SerializeField).
53

53

00:02:49,886  -->  00:02:53,174
(SerializeField), we
need this to be a float,
54

54

00:02:53,174  -->  00:02:57,760
cuz we'll have decimal places and
we call [INAUDIBLE] gameSpeed.
55

55

00:02:57,760  -->  00:02:59,440
I could call it timeScale but
56

56

00:02:59,440  -->  00:03:02,220
I wanna be really clear in
the inspector when I look at it.
57

57

00:03:02,220  -->  00:03:06,820
It's like that's gameSpeed, that's how
fast my overall game is going to go.
58

58

00:03:06,820  -->  00:03:11,330
And then chuck a semicolon on
the end there down into timeScale
59

59

00:03:11,330  -->  00:03:16,310
we will say = gameSpeed and you know
what I do need to do or I should do is
60

60

00:03:16,310  -->  00:03:21,580
initialize the game speed so it starts
at something I'll start this at 1f.
61

61

00:03:21,580  -->  00:03:24,460
So it's good to initialize it, that
means that we've got a starting value,
62

62

00:03:24,460  -->  00:03:28,610
and we're pretty sure that starting value
is gonna be what we want it to roughly be.
63

63

00:03:28,610  -->  00:03:31,820
So let's go and have a look and
check that on GameStatus.
64

64

00:03:31,820  -->  00:03:37,120
We have, I'll click on Game Status, game
speed of 1, great, as a starting point.
65

65

00:03:37,120  -->  00:03:40,524
Now I'm gonna add one more
little bit of flair in here,
66

66

00:03:40,524  -->  00:03:45,796
cuz we don't wanna accidentally get there
and say, well it can be -58 or 154.
67

67

00:03:45,796  -->  00:03:49,019
I mean, we trust ourselves, but let's
put something in there just to make it
68

68

00:03:49,019  -->  00:03:51,399
really easy for
if we're working with someone else, and
69

69

00:03:51,399  -->  00:03:53,750
they don't exactly know what
our range of the speed is.
70

70

00:03:53,750  -->  00:03:56,480
We'll go back into our script, and
I'll show you something new in here.
71

71

00:03:56,480  -->  00:04:01,505
And the new thing is, how we say what
the range will be in the inspector.
72

72

00:04:01,505  -->  00:04:07,145
So we type in our square brackets and
we say range, we don't say it we type it.
73

73

00:04:07,145  -->  00:04:10,298
We can't say it at the same time as we
type it if you're one of those sort of
74

74

00:04:10,298  -->  00:04:12,648
folks who speaks out
loud as you're typing.
75

75

00:04:12,648  -->  00:04:16,322
And within [Range ()],
mouse over range here, is looking for,
76

76

00:04:16,322  -->  00:04:21,262
you can see now a little description
there, float min, float max.
77

77

00:04:21,262  -->  00:04:25,132
So what's the minimum speed
we're ever going all the way
78

78

00:04:25,132  -->  00:04:26,962
out to what's the maximum speed?
79

79

00:04:26,962  -->  00:04:33,640
For now we'll say, 0.1f is the minimum and
10f is the maximum.
80

80

00:04:33,640  -->  00:04:36,670
And then if I save this,
jump back over into Unity,
81

81

00:04:36,670  -->  00:04:40,802
you'll see in a moment that game speed,
once it compiles.
82

82

00:04:40,802  -->  00:04:44,949
Game speed now has a slider and
the slider goes from 0.1 up to 10.
83

83

00:04:44,949  -->  00:04:46,264
This certainly is pretty handy.
84

84

00:04:46,264  -->  00:04:49,459
You can have it as a slider,
particularly if you've got someone else
85

85

00:04:49,459  -->  00:04:51,805
who is using this,
as I mentioned a moment ago.
86

86

00:04:51,805  -->  00:04:52,695
Okay, so let's test it out.
87

87

00:04:52,695  -->  00:04:57,885
If I put this all the way down to 0.1,
and when we click play, then with a value
88

88

00:04:57,885  -->  00:05:04,040
if 0.1 when I click go, very slow, you can
see that the whole game has slowed down.
89

89

00:05:04,040  -->  00:05:08,086
[SOUND] Kills that the sound effects
still continue at the same speed,
90

90

00:05:08,086  -->  00:05:09,419
which is good to know.
91

91

00:05:09,419  -->  00:05:11,210
Particle effects will be slower.
92

92

00:05:11,210  -->  00:05:14,390
Most of the things will be slower but
it's always good to test it out to make
93

93

00:05:14,390  -->  00:05:16,460
sure the things you think will be slow,
will be slow.
94

94

00:05:16,460  -->  00:05:18,977
If we went the other way,
if we set it all the way up to ten,
95

95

00:05:18,977  -->  00:05:21,255
I'm kind of curious how
nasty this is going to be.
96

96

00:05:21,255  -->  00:05:23,005
Ready, set, go.
97

97

00:05:23,005  -->  00:05:25,874
[SOUND] [LAUGH] Do you know
what was awesome there,
98

98

00:05:25,874  -->  00:05:29,826
that somehow it hit both of my blocks and
took me to the next level.
99

99

00:05:29,826  -->  00:05:33,210
No idea how, but
that was kind of fun but stupid fast, so
100

100

00:05:33,210  -->  00:05:36,245
let's click on game status,
put this back down.
101

101

00:05:36,245  -->  00:05:40,290
I'm going to leave mine for at 1 for
now, because I was pretty happy with it.
102

102

00:05:40,290  -->  00:05:42,730
But as we go,
as we put more content into our levels,
103

103

00:05:42,730  -->  00:05:44,690
we'll probably change it around.
104

104

00:05:44,690  -->  00:05:46,360
You can have it different per level.
105

105

00:05:46,360  -->  00:05:49,880
You can have moments in your game where,
say you hit a particular block and
106

106

00:05:49,880  -->  00:05:52,540
everything slows down for a moment,
or speeds up for a moment.
107

107

00:05:52,540  -->  00:05:54,400
So there's lots of things
you can do with this.
108

108

00:05:54,400  -->  00:05:57,100
Now that you know how to change
the overall speed of the game,
109

109

00:05:57,100  -->  00:05:59,190
this allows you to change
the speed of the ball and
110

110

00:05:59,190  -->  00:06:03,089
the speed of anything else you have
going on in your level, in your scene,
111

111

00:06:03,089  -->  00:06:06,540
by just changing this one number,
this one element.
112

112

00:06:06,540  -->  00:06:10,830
Okay, we need to pre-fab our game status
so that we can put it in our levels.
113

113

00:06:10,830  -->  00:06:14,120
So I will grab game status and
drag it down and now is a good time for
114

114

00:06:14,120  -->  00:06:17,360
us to check out this null reference
exception to see what's going on.
115

115

00:06:17,360  -->  00:06:20,640
Object reference not set to
an instance of an object.
116

116

00:06:20,640  -->  00:06:22,830
We've had this a couple of times, so
it's time for us to figure it out.
117

117

00:06:22,830  -->  00:06:24,460
It's not blocking our progress, but
118

118

00:06:24,460  -->  00:06:28,900
it is clearly upset about something and
it looks to do with our blocks.
119

119

00:06:28,900  -->  00:06:32,395
So we'll double click on the error and
see what's going on here.
120

120

00:06:32,395  -->  00:06:35,565
At level.CountBreakableBlocks();.
121

121

00:06:35,565  -->  00:06:39,225
Often it points you to something that's
not necessarily the thing that's broken
122

122

00:06:39,225  -->  00:06:41,955
but this is the first time that
it's getting upset about it.
123

123

00:06:41,955  -->  00:06:44,135
So CountBreakableBlocks(); is coming for
level.
124

124

00:06:44,135  -->  00:06:47,328
So let's go look at what's happening
with CountBreakableBlocks();.
125

125

00:06:47,328  -->  00:06:50,375
breakableBlocks ++ that looks okay.
126

126

00:06:51,765  -->  00:06:53,675
Have I not done something?
127

127

00:06:53,675  -->  00:06:58,220
So not set to an instance of an object.
128

128

00:06:58,220  -->  00:06:59,440
Let's have a look at our blocks.
129

129

00:06:59,440  -->  00:07:03,880
In here,
we have block that is set to an instance.
130

130

00:07:06,020  -->  00:07:09,360
Block in here,
maybe we need to look at our prefab.
131

131

00:07:09,360  -->  00:07:12,530
So this is a process we go through
when we're finding bugs and issues.
132

132

00:07:12,530  -->  00:07:14,820
It's often a little bit of a rabbit hole,
but this is good for
133

133

00:07:14,820  -->  00:07:15,740
us to go through it together.
134

134

00:07:16,830  -->  00:07:19,650
If you've already found it,
you're yelling at the screen saying, Rick,
135

135

00:07:19,650  -->  00:07:20,930
it's this particular thing.
136

136

00:07:20,930  -->  00:07:23,670
And I'm looking at it saying, I'm not
quite sure what's broken at the moment.
137

137

00:07:23,670  -->  00:07:24,760
So let's have a look on block.
138

138

00:07:26,000  -->  00:07:26,890
Okay, we've got our script.
139

139

00:07:26,890  -->  00:07:30,150
We've got our sound effect bounce,
which should be valid.
140

140

00:07:31,450  -->  00:07:34,950
Everything looks pretty good,
when I click on Play, what happens here?
141

141

00:07:36,610  -->  00:07:37,590
Gone console.
142

142

00:07:37,590  -->  00:07:38,830
It goes away.
143

143

00:07:38,830  -->  00:07:41,856
Okay, so there's something
happening after we play the game,
144

144

00:07:41,856  -->  00:07:43,207
after we [SOUND] get started.
145

145

00:07:43,207  -->  00:07:45,210
Nothing happened then.
146

146

00:07:45,210  -->  00:07:46,910
Back into our scene.
147

147

00:07:46,910  -->  00:07:49,760
It could be when I change
some things around.
148

148

00:07:49,760  -->  00:07:52,530
So this might be one of these
bugs that we keep our eye on.
149

149

00:07:52,530  -->  00:07:55,745
And we find later on,
[SOUND] you what it was?
150

150

00:07:55,745  -->  00:07:57,940
Actually, you know what it is,
it happened this last time.
151

151

00:07:57,940  -->  00:08:00,060
When we got to the next level,
152

152

00:08:00,060  -->  00:08:02,580
there's something going on with our
next level that we haven't tidied.
153

153

00:08:02,580  -->  00:08:03,660
Okay, here it is now.
154

154

00:08:03,660  -->  00:08:06,710
So something about previous
level needs tidying up.
155

155

00:08:06,710  -->  00:08:09,205
Thanks for
bearing with me as we worked through that.
156

156

00:08:09,205  -->  00:08:12,650
That's a good little example
of how to look for bugs.
157

157

00:08:12,650  -->  00:08:16,530
We need to update our other level,
and that actually, coincidentally,
158

158

00:08:16,530  -->  00:08:17,990
is part of your challenge.
159

159

00:08:17,990  -->  00:08:21,640
So the challenge is to trim your
game speed, and first of all,
160

160

00:08:21,640  -->  00:08:26,010
to update all of the levels that you
currently have with all of your prefabs.
161

161

00:08:26,010  -->  00:08:29,540
And make sure your prefabs are up to date,
cuz we've made some changes.
162

162

00:08:29,540  -->  00:08:32,040
And then to play it with the game
speed until you're happy with it.
163

163

00:08:32,040  -->  00:08:33,590
So there's your challenge.
164

164

00:08:33,590  -->  00:08:37,870
If you also have that bug,
see if you can get rid of it.
165

165

00:08:37,870  -->  00:08:40,906
When you come back,
we will work through that together.
166

166

00:08:43,821  -->  00:08:46,420
Right, so I'm pretty happy with my speed,
as I said.
167

167

00:08:46,420  -->  00:08:49,680
I think I've got all of my
things prefabbed in here,
168

168

00:08:49,680  -->  00:08:50,740
my game objects prefabbed.
169

169

00:08:50,740  -->  00:08:53,450
I'm gonna save this level,
open up my other level,
170

170

00:08:53,450  -->  00:08:56,400
my other scene as the wording might be.
171

171

00:08:56,400  -->  00:08:57,700
Now, let's have a look in here.
172

172

00:08:57,700  -->  00:08:58,970
We've got blocks.
173

173

00:08:58,970  -->  00:09:03,190
We don't have yet, from our prefab list,
we don't yet have level, I believe, so
174

174

00:09:03,190  -->  00:09:05,110
we'll drag level in here.
175

175

00:09:05,110  -->  00:09:07,380
We don't also have Scene.
176

176

00:09:07,380  -->  00:09:09,620
Yes, we have our Scene Loader, good.
177

177

00:09:09,620  -->  00:09:12,210
And on level, we needed both of those,
Scene Loader and Level.
178

178

00:09:12,210  -->  00:09:14,430
Why do we have Scene Loader over on here?
179

179

00:09:14,430  -->  00:09:14,960
You know what?
180

180

00:09:14,960  -->  00:09:16,380
I made a bit of an error, didn't I?
181

181

00:09:16,380  -->  00:09:20,440
I had a game object called
Scene Loader in our previous videos,
182

182

00:09:20,440  -->  00:09:21,220
and I forgot about that.
183

183

00:09:21,220  -->  00:09:21,990
That's my bad.
184

184

00:09:21,990  -->  00:09:23,600
My big apologies for that.
185

185

00:09:23,600  -->  00:09:26,890
If you remember, when we're working
through scene two, I went and
186

186

00:09:26,890  -->  00:09:30,770
dragged the scene loader
187

187

00:09:30,770  -->  00:09:35,670
script onto our level instead of
having a scene loader game object.
188

188

00:09:35,670  -->  00:09:40,240
We can do it both ways, for
now I am going to remove scene loader.
189

189

00:09:40,240  -->  00:09:43,770
Cuz it's working just fine when
we have our script on level.
190

190

00:09:43,770  -->  00:09:47,860
Okay, look at all these things we discover
when we go and tidy up our previous level.
191

191

00:09:47,860  -->  00:09:48,790
What else do we need in here?
192

192

00:09:48,790  -->  00:09:54,200
We've got Ball, Block, Event System,
Game Camera, yes, Game Canvas, yes.
193

193

00:09:54,200  -->  00:09:58,500
Game Status, we don't have that
in there yet, so drop that in.
194

194

00:09:58,500  -->  00:10:00,660
Great, we have Level.
195

195

00:10:00,660  -->  00:10:03,540
We just dropped in Paddle,
Play Space and Scene Load.
196

196

00:10:03,540  -->  00:10:04,720
All those things should be in there.
197

197

00:10:04,720  -->  00:10:06,010
If we click Play,
198

198

00:10:06,010  -->  00:10:08,930
we'll probably still be getting our
error cuz we haven't really done.
199

199

00:10:08,930  -->  00:10:09,470
There it goes.
200

200

00:10:09,470  -->  00:10:10,047
Goes away.
So
201

201

00:10:10,047  -->  00:10:12,050
that could've been [SOUND] us fixing it.
202

202

00:10:12,050  -->  00:10:13,280
Everything seems to work.
203

203

00:10:13,280  -->  00:10:14,120
Click Game Over.
204

204

00:10:14,120  -->  00:10:17,220
I'm not sure if it loads to the next
scene, but pretty sure it does.
205

205

00:10:18,530  -->  00:10:20,320
We will test that at some point but
not just now.
206

206

00:10:20,320  -->  00:10:21,330
So that's all fine.
207

207

00:10:21,330  -->  00:10:24,750
The speed looks a little bit fast when
the blocks are closer to my paddles, so
208

208

00:10:24,750  -->  00:10:31,240
if I go into game status,
drop this down to let's say 0.7.
209

209

00:10:31,240  -->  00:10:35,220
Interestingly, if I don't
apply this back to the prefab,
210

210

00:10:35,220  -->  00:10:40,330
then the speed now for
level one will be slower than level two.
211

211

00:10:40,330  -->  00:10:43,970
So that's the way for us to change,
every time change the speed.
212

212

00:10:43,970  -->  00:10:47,060
But just be careful if you are doing that,
having different speeds for different
213

213

00:10:47,060  -->  00:10:51,080
levels, be careful when you are changing
something with the prefab, to make sure
214

214

00:10:51,080  -->  00:10:55,570
that you're not going and altering
the other prefabs that are being changed.
215

215

00:10:55,570  -->  00:11:00,580
So now that I've changed this,
if I click apply, anything that
216

216

00:11:00,580  -->  00:11:06,070
is the same as the prefab at the moment,
ie 1, will be changed to 0.71.
217

217

00:11:06,070  -->  00:11:12,103
But if I go and change in the other level,
and I change that from 1 to say 1.2,
218

218

00:11:12,103  -->  00:11:16,540
then this 0.71 won't be changed,
cuz it is different to the prefab.
219

219

00:11:16,540  -->  00:11:17,870
So, if that doesn't make sense,
220

220

00:11:17,870  -->  00:11:20,640
jump back to the prefab video where
we talked about that in great detail.
221

221

00:11:20,640  -->  00:11:22,860
But hopefully that is clear for you.
222

222

00:11:22,860  -->  00:11:25,870
Now if I click play,
is this game a little bit more pleasant
223

223

00:11:25,870  -->  00:11:29,910
given that the ball is close to the, what
wait [LAUGH] I'm still useless at it, but
224

224

00:11:29,910  -->  00:11:32,390
I think slower was a bit
better in this level.
225

225

00:11:32,390  -->  00:11:33,813
Okay, so that's pretty good for now.
226

226

00:11:33,813  -->  00:11:35,533
I think we've changed our game speed.
227

227

00:11:35,533  -->  00:11:36,571
We've updated our level.
228

228

00:11:36,571  -->  00:11:40,253
We've gotten rid of that pesky error
that's been around for a couple of videos.
229

229

00:11:40,253  -->  00:11:43,413
That was because we didn't quite have
things hooked up correctly in our original
230

230

00:11:43,413  -->  00:11:44,303
level here.
231

231

00:11:44,303  -->  00:11:45,693
Great work and
I'll see you in our next video.
