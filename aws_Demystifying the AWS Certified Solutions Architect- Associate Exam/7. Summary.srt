00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,570
[Autogenerated] So we started this module discussing the exam

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,440
blueprint and how did decipher its cryptic meaning.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,610
We then took the five objectives from the exam and broke

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,900
them down into services or concepts.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,350
As part of the discussion in each of the sections,

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,540
we went over some practice questions for each Objective-C.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,300
We concluded the module the brief discussion about the exam

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,730
itself and talked about some strategies and best practices to

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,740
maximize your score on the exam.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,530
If you did everything we talked about throughout this course,

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,170
you should be ready for the exam.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,940
When you get into the testing center, just relax.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,640
Take a deep breath.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,940
You did all the hard work.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,140
You are prepared and you're qualified to pass the exam.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,010
Your attitude going into the exam can impact your score

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,280
on whether you are successful or not.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,240
So have a positive attitude.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,870
And if you come to a question that you don't understand,

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,820
skip it and come back to it later.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,000
Now go crush the exam. Good luck
