00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.740
[Autogenerated] Now that we've created the account,

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.180
the next thing I want to show you how to do is to

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.140
actually use that quick labs account.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.260
So I'm gonna walk you through a demo of using quick Labs and show you a

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.560
couple of examples and then show you various options on how you can buy

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.340
credits versus buying a subscription.

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.990
Now that we've created our new quick labs account ID like to

8
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.300
briefly talk to you about the interface and show you some

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.160
various options that you have in here,

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.140
what you're gonna notice from this home page after your account is created,

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.020
it's gonna mention that your credentials work for Google

12
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.220
Cloud and for Amazon Web Services.

13
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.160
So quick Labs actually has labs for both Google and for AWS.

14
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.040
We're gonna focus on AWS for this video.

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.240
So what we need to do is we need to go over here to the catalog page,

16
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.250
a select catalog, and it's gonna bring me to a bunch of options.

17
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.550
You can see it shows me there's 429 items in the catalog and you

18
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.540
can see over on the right side of the page.

19
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.340
There's a filter option.

20
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.920
Well, right now, we're seeing mostly Google.

21
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.940
So let's go over to the filter option.

22
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.140
Change our cloud environment to Amazon Web Services.

23
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.560
So like that it'll refresh the page, and now it's going to show me AWS.

24
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.340
And now you can see there are 100 and 10 results,

25
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.440
so there's still quite a few activities for AWS.

26
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.340
You'll also see that there's various formats so that we have hands on labs,

27
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.810
which we will look at and there's quest,

28
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.220
Quest or like a combination of labs that you do.

29
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.460
You go through the process, and as you complete all of the labs,

30
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.780
you get like a badge for completing them all.

31
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.010
And Questar,

32
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.940
where you're ultimately gonna go when you prepare to do certification.

33
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.220
I'm gonna leave it on this for now.

34
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.030
I'll actually put it on quest.

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.280
Let me put it on Quest and you can see under quests.

36
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.170
This is going to show you.

37
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.840
There's 18 results for quests and I'll scroll through the list.

38
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.010
There's various options in here, but what I want to draw your attention to,

39
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.440
it's gonna be on the second page.

40
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.570
You can see that there are quests for exams.

41
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.740
You can see there's the sys op administrator associate exam,

42
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.740
but we're interested in the solutions Architect associate exam.

43
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.850
If I click on this quest, it's gonna tell me about the objectives for the quest,

44
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.340
and it's going to give me an option to enroll in the quest.

45
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.750
Also,

46
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.060
you can look at the outline and it's going to show you this

47
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.240
quest is going to consist of a series of labs.

48
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.040
There's gonna be a lab on I am.

49
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.540
There's gonna be a lab on elastic load balancer.

50
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.010
There will be a lab on elastic block store,

51
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:33.120
and a lab and C two on cloud front on VPC with CloudFormation

52
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.640
and then building your own VPC from scratch.

53
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.760
These are the exercises that you're gonna want to do to

54
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.410
build your learning model and make sure that you really

55
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.550
understand the key concepts in AWS.

56
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.200
So if I were prepared to do this, I could click and rolling Quest.

57
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.540
I'm not going to do this right now.

58
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.040
I'm gonna show you something else.

59
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.670
When you decide on a lab that you want to do,

60
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.180
let's say I want to do the VPC lab,

61
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:09.000
so I click on it and it's going to tell me these various options about the lab.

62
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.380
You can see right now it's down further at the bottom.

63
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.880
So let me click on the lab Overview Page takes me to the top,

64
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.060
gives me an overview of what the labs about,

65
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.350
and then you can see their tasks for each part of the lab.

66
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.480
Now,

67
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.100
the great thing about this lab overview page or this lab in general is

68
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.880
that you can read this before you actually start the lab.

69
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.910
Because the thing is, once you start the lab,

70
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.400
you can see there's a timer over there says 100 an hour,

71
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.540
I guess in 25 minutes.

72
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.440
So you're gonna have an hour and 25 minutes to

73
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.440
complete this lab once you started.

74
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.320
So it's better to read through the topics in the exam and the various tasks

75
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.450
so that you know exactly what you're supposed to be doing.

76
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.840
When you go through the lab,

77
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.420
it's gonna tell you what you will be doing in this lab.

78
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.940
And all the labs are very similar to this.

79
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.640
You go through when you're ready to start the lab.

80
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.840
After you reviewed everything and you feel comfortable with it.

81
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.590
You click the start lab button and then that will start the timer.

82
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.810
And then the lab will come online.

83
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.580
And you can also see these options over here to the

84
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.530
left under connection details.

85
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.440
Once the lab is running,

86
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.280
it's going to use CloudFormation to deploy some resource is that

87
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.220
you get to use and it'll give you an endpoint.

88
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.840
It will provide you with private key information,

89
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.670
public information, user accounts.

90
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.610
All of that will be provided by the lab itself.

91
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.670
You remember you are not using your own AWS account for this.

92
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.360
You are using quick labs is environment,

93
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.740
so you're not going to incur any costs for that?

94
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.880
So what about this eight credits?

95
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.740
Well, you can see this is not a free lab because it says it cost eight credits.

96
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.320
I'm gonna come back over here and I'm gonna go to my

97
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.940
account at the top click on this icon,

98
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.690
and I'm going to click on my account right now.

99
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.040
You can see I have zero credits in my account.

100
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.340
Thanks to me to my profile,

101
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.790
I can click on my credentials and or credits and subscriptions Come in here.

102
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.040
You can see right now I have zero credits.

103
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.980
There's an option here.

104
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.640
If you have credit, you can share them with your friends,

105
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.010
and then there's options to buy credits or subscriptions.

106
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.770
So if I click on by credits, it's gonna tell you.

107
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.840
Labs typically costs from 0 to 15 credits,

108
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.110
and you have to purchase a minimum of five credits.

109
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.760
The key thing you want to pay attention to here is

110
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.360
these credits expire after six months, so that would not be a good thing.

111
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.140
You know, you buy a bunch of credits and then you don't use them,

112
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.490
so keep that in mind.

113
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:02.340
So that particular lab that I showed you cost eight credits.

114
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.670
So basically a dollar a credit at that level.

115
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.740
Now, as you buy in bulk, the price goes down on the credits.

116
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.130
You say you start getting a discount is you buy more,

117
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.640
but obviously it gets very expensive.

118
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.940
Now, as I mentioned previously, I don't recommend buying credits.

119
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.870
It's expensive, and the problem with credits, they're they're gone.

120
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.640
Once you use them, say I would have done that VPC lab for eight credits.

121
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.330
I can't go back and redo that lab ID.

122
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:40.040
Have to pay $8 again to do that lab so that's not ideal.

123
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.340
The best option is this subscription option, and there's two options.

124
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.880
There's a monthly subscription at $55 a month,

125
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.950
and then there's an annual subscription for about $500 a month to get a little

126
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.930
bit of a discount for paying for an annual subscription,

127
00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.640
I again would not recommend buying an annual subscription.

128
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.440
This is not something you're gonna be using every day.

129
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.820
This is something you're gonna use when you want to test your mental model.

130
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.540
You've gone through all the Pluralsight training

131
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.460
you've read through the documentation.

132
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.630
You've built up your AWS knowledge.

133
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.670
Now you're ready to start looking at the test.

134
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:22.640
So go do that quest for certified solutions architect associate,

135
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.520
but subscribe for a month, maybe the you know,

136
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.340
two months before you're ready to take the exam,

137
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.360
go through, do the subscription for a month.

138
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.260
Go do that lab as many times as you want,

139
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.000
because that's the great thing about the subscription.

140
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.150
You're not on a credit system anymore.

141
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.670
You get unlimited credits for that month so I could do

142
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.840
that lab 50 times if I wanted to.

143
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.160
It's a great way to be able to go through the process after

144
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.540
looking at the VPC lab that I showed you after showing you how

145
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.630
you can buy credits and subscriptions,

146
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.660
I think you have an idea of how this works.

147
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.340
Also showing you the catalog and how you can browse the catalog.

148
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.400
Let's say I didn't wanna look at Quest.

149
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.040
I would just want to look for a specific lab.

150
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.940
So I click on catalog.

151
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.060
I'll go back over here.

152
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.980
I've got to change it back to AWS.

153
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.320
And unfortunately,

154
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.610
there's no setting that I can set for a favorite or something

155
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.640
here to to remember all of my filter settings.

156
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.000
I can click this to add to favorites.

157
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.930
So if there's a lab, a quest that I like or a lab that I like,

158
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.540
I can click the little heart and it'll add it to my favorites.

159
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.560
But let me instead of going to quest,

160
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.920
let's go to hands on labs and you can see there are 92

161
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.100
labs that are available for you to do so.

162
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.720
There's quite a bit of options here,

163
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.540
and you see those things from red shift to Dynamodb.

164
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.790
You see Blue green deployments with elastic beanstalk,

165
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.170
you know, doing these things in your own environment.

166
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.750
There's a lot of things you have to set up, and it can be complicated.

167
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.120
The great thing about quick labs is you have a lab God,

168
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.120
and you have a very detailed set of instructions that are
