00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.740
[Autogenerated] what is needed for a success.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
In your journey to AWS mastery,

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.240
I would like to present you with a model that I used to achieve A W s mastery.

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.520
First of all,

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.160
you need to focus on understanding AWS and the business

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.060
case is that it can address by this.

7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.540
I mean, you need to understand How does a W.

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.640
S to find the cloud?

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.840
What is meant by distributed systems?

10
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.150
What?

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.040
What is decoupled architectures?

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.710
And how did these concepts all fit together to create business cases?

13
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.770
And what kind of use cases can we create from this understanding?

14
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.210
These concepts will become your gateway to AWS mastery.

15
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.050
As you walk through the process,

16
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.500
you're gonna want to construct your own mental model of

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.070
these concepts is you build them.

18
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.150
I encourage you to take lots of notes, right?

19
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.040
Lots of things down Azure on your journey.

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.690
Once you develop an understanding of the fundamentals,

21
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.880
then you can start to focus on key terms,

22
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.840
names of services, functions of those services,

23
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.480
things very specific to AWS.

24
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.090
Comparisons between various services and limits associate ID with

25
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.450
various services because some services will have certain limits on

26
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.490
them and that can come up in the exam building your knowledge of

27
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.540
services will not only be challenging,

28
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.240
but it will also be very rewarding in the end.

29
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.040
Once you understand AWS and you understand the concepts,

30
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.090
now you're ready to demonstrate mastery.

31
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.160
So you're gonna want to put all of this together to demonstrate your

32
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.500
knowledge that you've gained and your experience with AWS.

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.170
So you want to create some of your own architectures and we'll talk

34
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.540
about this a little bit later in this module,

35
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.970
and then you're gonna want to understand various use cases and

36
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.440
scenarios and how they all fit together.

37
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.840
Finally, when you've done this, you will then be ready to tackle the exam.

38
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.240
You will not able to pass the exam just by memorizing a bunch of fax.

39
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.670
You're gonna have to understand how services work.

40
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.000
And now they all fit together because to pass the exam,

41
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.300
you have to be able to answer scenario based questions.

42
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.170
And it requires a deeper level of knowledge of AWS than most people

43
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.440
have and that most people gain if you come at it from a traditional

44
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.440
perspective of a certification exam, that approach will not work,

45
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.070
but for the rest of this module.

46
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.830
I would like to take a step back from the exam.

47
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.440
That is not our primary focus.

48
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.540
Our primary focus in this module is A W S mastery.

49
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.520
You're in goal.

50
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.000
It may likely be to earned a certification, but that should be secondary to AWS mastery.
