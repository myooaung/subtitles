00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,210
[Autogenerated] you may be surprised to discover that the initial pass

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,140
rate for AWS certification exams is less than 25%.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,540
Ouch!

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,140
When some of you here this statistic, it may discourage you.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,340
And for others, it will feel like a challenge.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,080
The primary reason that students fell the exam is because they try

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,140
to treat it like any other certification exam.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,440
If you approach the exam this way, you will likely fail as well.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,610
Hello and welcome everyone to demystifying the AWS

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,340
Certified Solutions Architect associate exam.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,500
My name is Dustin.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,170
Bring Berry.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,470
And in this course I'm gonna show you strategies that I used to

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,980
achieve A W s mastery and how I then prepared to pass the AWS

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,140
Certified Solutions Architect associate exam and the other AWS

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,540
certification exams as well.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,790
In this course,

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm gonna begin by talking to you about what it means to achieve A W s mastery.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,760
And I'll offer recommendations on what I did to become

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,780
an AWS master in the final module.

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,320
We will deep dive the exam itself and focus on the exam blueprint

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,240
and review strategies to help you pass the exam.

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,780
Now that we've over viewed the content for this course,

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,640
let's move into the details.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,370
AWS has designed their infrastructure around services,

26
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,990
and there are many categories of services within AWS.

27
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,590
As you can see from this diagram to the novice,

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,940
this can feel really overwhelming because there's so

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,840
many different components to AWS.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,640
Even within each of these categories where we see these service categories,

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,940
there are multiple services in many cases.

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,020
So it would be really nice if AWS told us what specific

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,970
services were covered on the exam.

34
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,440
But unfortunately they do not.

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,730
Looking at the exam blueprint,

36
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,460
you will discover their ARF knowledge areas that are

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,240
required to succeed on the example.

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,160
But again,

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,340
AWS does not provide us with a breakdown of what services are involved in this.

40
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,100
Instead,

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,840
they give us categories based off of the well architected framework model,

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,840
and questions will be scenario based on the exam using these categories.

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,230
If you're completely new to AWS,

44
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,640
these breakdown will not make a lot of sense to you.

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,940
So if we're trying to master AWS itself,

46
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,640
this category approach is not really going to help us.

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,100
We'll refer back to this diagram later in the course when we

48
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,640
actually get into discussion of the exam itself.

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,990
To help you dissect this information,

50
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,820
I would like to present you with a more refined A list of AWS services that

51
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,140
you can focus on to pass the exam with this new view.

52
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,440
Instead of looking at 18 categories, we're only going to need to focus on 10.

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,840
Initially, this still might seem like a lot,

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,000
but many of these services inter operate with each other as we're going to see is we go through this process.
