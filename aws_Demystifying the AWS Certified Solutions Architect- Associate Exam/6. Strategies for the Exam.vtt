00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.540
[Autogenerated] as we move into the last section,

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.000
you should be in the final stages preparing for your exams.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.840
Hopefully you've gone through all of these questions that

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.640
we've reviewed and you've got them.

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.940
All right,

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.590
so if you haven't go back and study that but you need to be

7
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.840
familiar with all of these knowledge areas for the exam

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.640
before we discuss the actual exam,

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.310
I want to quickly remind you of the four key areas of focus that

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.760
we've been talking about throughout this class and that they were

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060
using to build your mental model.

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.940
As you went through this process,

13
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.260
we want to get these four key areas and just quickly review what these

14
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.540
are so that you need to do any last minute prep.

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.160
You can go back and look at these things.

16
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.340
If you're not familiar with something, So the first of these areas is compute.

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.240
The compute portion of the exam will have questions around things like you see,

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.460
too even rds.

19
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.340
Even though rds is a database, remember,

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
it has a compute component to it, so you could get questions from that.

21
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.240
So make sure you understand those aspects.

22
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.970
AWS Lambda is another area that comes up making sure you're familiar with how

23
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.240
serverless computing works and how lambda functions work.

24
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.840
Also, e CSS and fargate.

25
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.740
You might get a couple of questions on the exam,

26
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.640
not the focus of the exam, but is far as containers go.

27
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.750
This is the way we do.

28
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.840
And if we're talking about several is containers,

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.840
we're gonna use a service like fargate.

30
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.030
In addition to compute, we also have our networking portion.

31
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.940
Even though all of the networks in AWS are software to find,

32
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.640
we still use sub nets within our virtual private clouds.

33
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.500
You can have multiple VP CSS that you can isolate or you can

34
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.200
even interconnect using something like VPC peering or

35
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.340
interface in points using private link.

36
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.490
You have security on your networks using something called nak ALS or

37
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.620
network access Control is which we've covered.

38
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.340
They act very similar to firewall rules.

39
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.540
We also have security groups that are at the end I level,

40
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.650
and these are going to act like firewall rules next to the

41
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.360
instance itself within the sub net again.

42
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.850
We've covered these subjects and you should have been studying

43
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.890
these when you're building your mental model,

44
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.240
so this should not be new.

45
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.890
We also talked about V VPNs briefly, and you need to be familiar with VPN.

46
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.470
You don't need to write a build one,

47
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.580
but you need to understand the components that go into creating a VPN a V G W,

48
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.950
which is a virtual private gateway, which is on the AWS side,

49
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.010
and the C G W, which is the customer gateway and is on the customer side.

50
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.510
These are both fundamentally important to understanding

51
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.640
the networking portion of the exam.

52
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.020
We also need to look at storage.

53
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.130
There are really, fundamentally two types of storage when they needed AWS.

54
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.430
If you really break it down,

55
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.900
there's what we call live storage and archive storage for our calves were

56
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.240
mostly going to be dealing with services like Amazon Glacier.

57
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.840
Then we also have our S3 buckets for our actual active data.

58
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:37.140
We have EBS volumes and instant store volumes, even four hour live data.

59
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.410
The other thing you should keep in mind on this area of focus is

60
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.800
that database storage can come up under storage.

61
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.150
Questions just like database could come under compute questions.

62
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.510
So being able to,

63
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.160
differentiate these and understand how database storage works is important

64
00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.040
and database storage would also be considered live storage.

65
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.780
The fourth area is database is themselves.

66
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.090
You need to understand there is gonna be some crossover.

67
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:14.430
Like I said, between compute and storage and this database focus,

68
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.240
even though there's gonna be lots of managed database is in AWS

69
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:25.640
services like red shift things like Neptune dynamodb.

70
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.100
Most of your questions on database is on.

71
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.710
The exam will be focused on Amazon RDS.

72
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.140
And when you're answering any of these exam questions

73
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:43.340
in these four areas as they come up, you always need to be asking yourself,

74
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.810
How can I do this in the most secure way possible?

75
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.940
Finally, before we move into our final exam review,

76
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.930
it is imperative that you have this down because 90% of your questions on

77
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.040
the exam will come from these four key areas of focus.

78
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.940
There may be some other things that come in from other ways,

79
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.830
but 90% of your exam will come from these areas of focus.

80
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.140
So if you have these down, you should be ready to pass your exam.

81
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.050
Let's now look a tsum exam techniques that can help you going into the exam.

82
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.540
Things need to be focused on when you're in the actual test

83
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.800
built your mental model you've prepared.

84
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.440
Now you're ready to walk into the testing center and take the exam.

85
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.000
I'm going to discuss a few techniques to help you

86
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.620
maximize your chances of passing the exam.

87
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.140
And then I'll briefly talk about the exam itself.

88
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.800
So is far as exam techniques.

89
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.640
Let's take a look.

90
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.570
There are five verbs I want to draw your attention to

91
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.010
understand being the first one so determined.

92
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.730
The key question being asked in the question.

93
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.940
Not all the details in the question or relevant or necessary.

94
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.110
Figure out what the question is asking.

95
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.890
Next eliminate.

96
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.440
Get rid of answers that have fake info or wrong info in them.

97
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.410
Eliminate other answers that conflict with the key

98
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.740
concept that you're focused on.

99
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.780
Third, evaluate.

100
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.880
Think through the trade offs of the responses that are left.

101
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.540
Once you've eliminated the other answers,

102
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.130
consider what is stated as well as implied in the question,

103
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.440
because it's not always clear.

104
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.930
Fourth choose, pick the right number of answer choices,

105
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.540
select the best options and eliminate the wrong ones.

106
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.530
Finally, validate.

107
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.980
Make sure the answer you choose answers.

108
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.430
The question verify that your answer choice does not

109
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.550
conflict with the details in the question.

110
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.890
The exam itself has 65 questions.

111
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.740
There is no penalty for guessing, and all questions have the same point value.

112
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.450
You have 130 minutes to complete these exam,

113
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.940
which should be more than enough time.

114
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.710
All the questions are scenario based, so if you get to a question,

115
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.720
you don't know how to answer it Market for review and then come back to

116
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.240
it later because they're all worth the same points.

117
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.110
So if you don't get to one question or can't get back to it,

118
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.710
that's okay, because you probably answered some easier questions.

119
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.870
But you should be able to get through all of the questions in 130 minutes

120
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.740
if you studied the way that you should for the exam.

121
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:55.160
Multiple choice with single answer, as well as to answer questions on this exam.

122
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.540
Some of the exams will have three answers that are true,

123
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.640
but for the Solutions Architect associate exam,

124
00:08:04.640 --> 00:09:35.000
there will be no questions will have more than two correct answers on them, so you'll either have one single answer or to answer questions
