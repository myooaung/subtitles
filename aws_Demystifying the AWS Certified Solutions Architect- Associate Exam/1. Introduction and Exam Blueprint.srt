00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,100
[Autogenerated] in this module,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,120
we're going to focus in on the key topics that you

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,140
need to understand to pass the exam.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,110
At this point,

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,940
hopefully you've been through the first module and

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,930
taking the time to prepare yourself,

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,410
build your mental model and get a better understanding of labs.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,240
This module will assume that you have your mental model in place.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,010
We will go through a fine tuning process to help you prepare for your exam.

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,240
The topics in this module will be very high level and exam focused.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,240
Let's get started.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,630
AWS consists of many types of services,

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,840
and new services are being added all the time.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,810
Since this is an associate level exam,

15
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:55,520
the focus is more of breadth of knowledge rather than depth.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,870
That being said,

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,440
the sheer number of services available in AWS can be overwhelming.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,720
This diagram is meant to summarize all the categories of

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,840
services available within a to be us.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,240
However, within each of these categories, there are many individual services.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,840
Fortunately, you don't have to know anything about many of these services,

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,020
so let's break this down a little bit further to

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,840
make it a little easier for you.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,040
I've taken the list of 19 categories of services and broken them down to 10.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,730
This is a much more manageable group of key services for the exam.

26
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,580
Even within this list,

27
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,620
there's still far too many services to master for this exam,

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:54,440
and the exam blueprint does not map 1 to 1 with many of these knowledge areas.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,050
But these are the topics that you must learn to fit into that

30
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,140
blueprint to be successful on the exam,

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,870
and my goal is to help take you through that process and

32
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,540
fit those services to the blueprint.

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,540
Let's go through the exam blueprint in the key knowledge areas and

34
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,910
start to break it into easier to understand objectives.

35
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,830
As you can see,

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,760
the exam is broken into multiple knowledge areas and built

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,610
around the well architected framework.

38
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,140
From this chart,

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,140
you can see that three of these objectives make up 82% of the exam questions,

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,820
even though it might be tempting just to focus on these areas,

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,540
I do not recommend this approach for two reasons.

42
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,740
First,

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,040
these three categories will have some of the most

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,740
difficult questions from the entire exam,

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,440
and secondly,

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,240
cost related questions are among some of the easiest questions on the exam,

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,130
so you want to give yourself the best chance to pass the

48
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,210
exam by studying all the exam objectives.

49
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,470
Let's review the exam blueprint and then break each

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,680
objective into more tangible parts.

51
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,840
The first exam objective is designed resilient architectures.

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,240
As you can see, it consists of four areas of focus.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,140
The second exam objective is designed high performing architectures,

54
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,440
and it also consists of four areas of focus.

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,740
Our goal will be to relate each of these objectives to specific AWS

56
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,470
services like elastic block Store or S3 or E C.

57
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,140
Two.

58
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,240
As examples.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:56,610
58% of your exam questions will come from these two objectives.

60
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:03,840
The third exam objective is designed secure applications and architectures,

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,940
and the final exam Objective-C is designed cost optimized architectures.

62
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:21,000
These two objectives each have three areas of focus, and we will also look at examples of specific AWS services for these
