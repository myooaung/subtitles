00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,860
Pick guys welcome back to the course so this lecture I want to talk about a really cool trick you can

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,920
use asana for in your development business.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,970
Now we covered how to get up and running in a sauna before we cover how it works how internal teams

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,700
use it to manage tasks and make sure that everyone's on the same page.

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,280
But what you need to understand is that everyone out there for the most part uses this in turn only

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,790
and that's how a sauna designs their systems.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,280
But what they don't realize especially for us in the case that we have clients and we are also internally

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,670
collaborating on a development project is that we can actually use a sauna and turn it inside out to

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,530
serve a lot of the purposes that we need.

10
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,070
With regards to client management they've heard me talk before in this course about client management

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:03,160
and how important it is to let your clients feel like they are in the loop whether or not they're in

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,760
the loop and actual wildy is not really the important part.

13
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,920
It's not they feel like they are on the same page and they know what's happening.

14
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,910
Now one of the reasons that clients can very easily become a pain in the ass is because they feel as

15
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,460
if they need to assert some type of control over you.

16
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,590
Now regardless of whether or not their input and their micromanagement regardless of whether or not

17
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:35,570
that actually helps you have a good outcome or make a good product they still do it.

18
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,600
They're not going to entirely blame clients out there.

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,480
They do this because it's simply not appropriate for them.

20
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:49,480
The purchaser of your software to just sit there for long periods of time and not hear anything from

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,450
you even if you're doing a weekly stand up calls.

22
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,080
So you're talking them on a Friday that might not be enough for them.

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,330
They might have a boss who wants to know more and asks more frequently than once a week.

24
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:08,170
So use the trick that we had Sprint kick here use for our client management we use this sauna the same

25
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:14,440
way we use it internally but we turn it inside out for clients just so that they can feel like they

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,490
are giving us their voice so they can see on a granular basis where we are and what is getting done

27
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,430
and also so that they can give a specific feedback on each individual thing that makes it a lot easier

28
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:34,450
to understand what they are referring to when they say they don't like the color of this or this section

29
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,050
doesn't work the way we're supposed to.

30
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:42,400
All right so let's jump into a sauna and I set up here a sample version so that you can see kind of

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,500
like the way that we generally will set it up.

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,370
We set it up in sprints.

33
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:53,650
In actuality to be a lot more complicated I did take and copy actual tasks from our actual asana through

34
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,940
them in here.

35
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,910
But this is typically what it's going to look like when you and your team are working on developing

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,060
your product you're going to list off your tasks in sequential order to list them off on when you start

37
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,330
on them when you should probably deliver them.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,860
But also notice here that a lot of these things here are kind of designed for internal consumption.

39
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,940
They're messy.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,770
We use things like this.

41
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:24,060
I put the hourly marker here that doesn't make sense to someone who's not on the team.

42
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,620
We have long tasks that actually include so much text that it wraps around.

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,350
Now a developer is fine.

44
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,530
They know exactly what that is.

45
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,080
They can click it and go through it but just keep in mind this is one of the internal Ossana panel looks

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,500
like.

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,230
Now if you wanted to take this and flip it inside out for your clients just go over here to whatever

48
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:51,250
project it is and you can click on these three little dots and you can use as a template copy your project.

49
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:57,420
Now I ask you what you want to do in your copy project and how much you want to put over to it.

50
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,800
So what you want to make sure you're not doing is don't trick assignee because that information is going

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,480
to be relevant.

52
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:09,900
In our second Ossana project you want subtasks you want attachments you want tags everything like that.

53
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,300
You do not want project members.

54
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,330
Explain that in just a second so make sure to uncheck that and create a new project.

55
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,950
Give it a second and it'll make a complete copy of what you just made.

56
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,350
OK.

57
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,830
There we go.

58
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,160
Now we can hop into an exact clone.

59
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,430
Now here what I'm going to do is I'm going to do the same thing I was doing before in the example project

60
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,520
but I will convert it for external purposes.

61
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm going to clean it up.

62
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm going to change some of the wording so it's easier to understand.

63
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:47,470
And also I am only going to link one other person in my team to this now and the other internal project.

64
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,780
If you go and look at it and this is just obviously an example.

65
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,150
Lots of people are sharing this.

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,680
OK.

67
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,160
And that's generally the case is there are lots of different people some of them only see certain sections.

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,300
Some of them are collaborating over here.

69
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,110
But when you do your external that is not relevant information you need every single person in on this

70
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:13,820
you just need one your client and to one of your developers that you designate as the best communicator.

71
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,340
Now if you have a project manager or a developer that's acting as a project manager then perfect that's

72
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,430
who you want to attach to this.

73
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,660
Now the reason why you do this is because you're going to copy these tasks over your clients can to

74
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,370
be able to see them.

75
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,630
Your clients are going to be able to comment on them.

76
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:38,330
It's up to you to then respond to them give them the information they need but you essentially be doing

77
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,780
a subcontracting strategy you won't be able to actually update these in any meaningful way or answer

78
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,130
technical questions.

79
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,350
That's why it's important that you have one developer or someone on your team that is communicative

80
00:05:51,350 --> 00:06:00,470
That is absolutely plugged into the loop to add the tasks when they are made to click through them when

81
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,790
they are done and to answer questions that are technical because these are things that you just can't

82
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,560
do yourself.

83
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,960
So I'll give it a cleaning and I'll see.

84
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,620
OK so I just clean this up a little bit.

85
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:16,060
I just removed information that would make any sense to your client because they probably are non-technical

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,860
and also simplified the wording and a lot of things took out the wordiness and then pushed any details

87
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:28,490
into the descriptions on the actual sub pages and I just did that because you want to make sure that

88
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,910
you are walking a balance between showing that you have technical prowess and that what you're doing

89
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,270
is complicated and they can't do it themselves.

90
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,550
But also being able to speak in a way that they can actually understand if they can't follow this then

91
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,090
it's not particularly helpful to them.

92
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,070
And if it sounds ridiculously simple and easy then you're going to have problems in your client because

93
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,340
they think that it's too simple why are they paying you.

94
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,650
So take a little bit of time.

95
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,330
Throw in some Polish maybe throw in some screenshots so that someone who doesn't know exactly what's

96
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,920
happening on a day to day basis can follow along.

97
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,750
Typically I suggest you change the name of your project doing the exact same thing as your internal

98
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,420
but then changing it just slightly so that you can tell the difference right here.

99
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,830
So instead of copy for example project the code example project and mean this is actually what we do

100
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,700
which puts Brint care at the end of that.

101
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,680
Knows that that means doesn't matter just helps us know that this is the external.

102
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,720
And this is the internal You can do it whatever way you want.

103
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,650
There you go.

104
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,950
Now you have an external sized version of your asana you share that with your clients.

105
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,210
They can log in and see exactly where you are.

106
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,440
They don't have to ask you.

107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,750
They don't have to call you and you just see yourself.

108
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:52,760
Seriously hundreds of hours of management just given this panel and they will get so happy as they see

109
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,060
these things get checked off because look it's like progress.

110
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,530
Their app is getting done.

111
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:08,000
All right guys see in the next lecture.
