1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:11,110
Let's talk about where you should go to find freelancers and freelancing firms.

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:17,270
For me there are the big three Elance oDesk and freelancer dot com.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,140
I'm sure you've used other Web sites people per hour.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,250
Seems to be a decent one.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,350
There are lots of freelancing sites that target certain niches.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,550
You'll notice things like like video pixies or freelancers for videos specifically Ines of course we're

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,530
talking more about building mobile applications or web applications so we're going to focus on software

8
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:46,480
freelancers the Big Three Elance oDesk and freelancer these are the ones I've used throughout my career

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,730
and this is the ones I've used for over 50 60 apps.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,670
Each one of these has their own pros and cons.

11
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:02,140
Elance is probably by far my favorite for finding high quality contractors when you bid on elance you

12
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,490
can get bids from pretty much all over the world.

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:13,540
When you typically post something I see a good mix between Western countries and typical outsource countries

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,540
and then people all in between you'll find a lot of freelancers who are simply location independent

15
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,700
like traveling programmers very very vibrant community of people.

16
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:31,360
Elance is where you would go if you were looking for a better established firms or essentially higher

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,530
quality freelancers freelancers that are in the mature stage of their freelancing career.

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,450
A lot of programmers who have full time jobs that work at reputable companies will go on elance and

19
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,180
bid on projects for their weekends and off hours.

20
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,630
The firms on elance typically have better portfolios they're usually better at articulating what they're

21
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,550
good at.

22
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,990
They are typically going to give you better more thoughtful responses to your project briefs.

23
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,790
Now like the other three it doesn't cost any money to post the differences here.

24
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,560
You'll notice that most people that bid have read your project and will actually respond with detail

25
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,060
and with thoughts on it that obviously comes with the downside.

26
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,860
You'll notice that in Elance the prices are usually a bit higher if you were to take the same application

27
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,780
with the same brief and post them across these three systems Elance you'll notice on average is going

28
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,840
to have the highest price and also the time line probably is going to be longer.

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,610
And obviously the reason is because the people who are bidding have more experience and they also probably

30
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,670
have more clientele themselves so they're not going to lie and say that they're going to rush the project

31
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,190
and they're also not going to be taking kind of a loss leader position meaning that they're not going

32
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,470
pricing so low that they're actually losing money just to get your business.

33
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,870
The second one is oDesk oDesk in Elance I believe are a merged company but these two different products

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,870
oDesk is a little bit different it's not like Elance in the sense that everybody who bids is going to

35
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:13,490
be a high quality oDesk differentiate themselves by what they use called the team view and they have

36
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,270
the thing called a team room how the team room works.

37
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,240
It's a web application with an ode ask that when you hire someone they get added to your team room and

38
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,420
then they use this screen capture software on the freelancer's Web site so that you can maintain how

39
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,620
much they've been working and what their productivity looks like and you can kind of notice if they're

40
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,850
not working.

41
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,300
And if they try to bill you you can look back at their time logs.

42
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,970
Also you can use that way to combine other freelancers into the same room so that they can communicate

43
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,840
to each other and coordinate.

44
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:53,060
It's good if you're trying to put together a team from multiple freelancers or multiple development

45
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,990
teams which is sometimes that is the case sometimes you need someone to do data entry.

46
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,260
You need one person to program and you need one person to do graphic design.

47
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,840
And that makes it quite convenient however because that is the focal point of their product and what

48
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,640
they're selling point.

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,550
It means that people typically go to oDesk if they're looking for per hour labor and it means that they're

50
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,680
skewed more towards things like virtual assistants.

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,970
Most of the projects you see on oDesk will skew towards.

52
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:27,710
I need someone to do this manual task and do it in perpetuity and do it for a set amount of time people

53
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,540
do obviously post web projects and mobile projects on there.

54
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,110
It's just better if you're looking for an individual who can just work towards your project and essentially

55
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,860
it until it's done and it's not a great place you're trying to find a fixed price because of them.

56
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,400
The team room benefit.

57
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,580
It doesn't really help you in any way.

58
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,280
ODesk is in terms of quality engineering it's a little bit below Elance but it's above freelancer.

59
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,620
Freelancer dot com is the last one.

60
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:02,510
Prancer used to be a big deal back in 2001 2002 came out of the Internet bubble but it stuck around.

61
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,630
It is probably the least polished of the three.

62
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,110
You go and you use it.

63
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,180
It is kind of confusing the way that they use a credit system you will for instance when you pay freelancers

64
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,760
you will upload money into your account and then you can pay them and freelancer automatically will

65
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,440
deduct certain amounts of money out of your account.

66
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,200
So it always keeps a certain baseline amount of money in your account and that can be kind of annoying

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,040
if you're trying to do small tasks but freelancer.

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,790
It's kind of the Wild West of the freelancing Web sites.

69
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,600
I use it all the time but that's because I'm skilled at managing outsourced teams and knowing what I

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,020
want and I can tell very easily if a freelancer is being unrealistic.

71
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,810
Freelancers the place you go if you want pretty much a heavy skew in terms of your bidding group from

72
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,010
outsourced countries.

73
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,040
When you post an freelancer you may get some people from western countries but the mule predominantly

74
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,800
get people from you know Eastern Europe India Indonesia Vietnam places like that.

75
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,350
Now freelancer's great if you're trying to get something done extremely cheaply.

76
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,420
The people who bid on their bid very very low.

77
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,780
And if you have the experience and you have the time to oversee what they're doing then you can have

78
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,350
some pretty huge cost savings.

79
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,240
But I always say kind of stay away unless you have experience doing this because you can get burned

80
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,400
very easily.

81
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,540
Often what happens on freelancer you will see that if you post say you want to make a web site and say

82
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,370
your web site is something similar to another Web site you very often will find people who will create

83
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,160
clones of Web sites for you.

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,000
Watch out for people who are going to build your web site using a script.

85
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,360
You don't know what the intellectual property rules are around that script are you don't know where

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,620
they got the script.

87
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,210
Who owns the licensing.

88
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,350
But that happens quite often in freelancer and that's another reason why your rates are so cheap.

89
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,930
I notice that a lot of freelancers start off on that Web site because it is kind of the Wild West.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,180
They can get some shady air projects to get reviews.

91
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,540
You also notice on freelance at dot.com they started listing the completion rate for each project for

92
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,260
each freelancer because that's a big concern on freelancer.

93
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,250
A lot of times people will bid and they'll were way too low.

94
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,100
Get into the project and then abandon it.

95
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,170
So I would say that freelancer is something you want to dive into if you have some experience.

96
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,550
It's where you get the best cost savings and it's a place you'd go if you are some really kind of sketchy

97
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:37,590
deed or task you need to get done.
