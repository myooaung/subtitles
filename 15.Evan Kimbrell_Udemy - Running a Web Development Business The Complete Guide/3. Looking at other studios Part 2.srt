1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,460
OK and you'll notice similar elements here we use more of a landing page design meaning that you hit

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,190
our PAGE ONE sentence and then we try to push towards a call of act called Action button which was our

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,630
kind of decision because this is something we've found works for us.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,700
It doesn't necessarily work for everyone but if you're noticed like over here we use a very similar

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,000
thing.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,220
So we're going to pitch you our value proposition very quickly it only took me two clicks to get over

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,120
to that

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,160
and this would be a value proposition type of thing where we talk more about again integrated we help

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,210
with other things we try to position ourselves more as a consulting firm because so many people we work

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:49,510
with come to us when the idea is just that an idea and we can't just make it based off what they tell

11
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,660
us.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,370
That's not going to be a successful project.

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,040
We really need to help them in all different directions.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,230
And so that's kind of what we're pitching over here.

15
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:02,290
OK so look at Octa and we can pretty much tease out their value proposition very quickly say like early

16
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,740
scroll down a couple inches and look OK leading global brands.

17
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,210
They're pitching you that other expensive people with lots of money like to pay them lots of money.

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,480
Emerging growth companies.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,530
OK so they're probably focused more on startups.

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,180
That's a very euphemized version of saying startups are emerging growth companies.

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,010
If someone wrote that for our Web site or copywriter wrote that I'd probably slap them because that

22
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,490
is just jibberish to discover new opportunities.

23
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,220
Define intelligent user experiences as opposed to dumb user experiences and then they focus on things

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,680
like innovative digital services and Cedric's that are a lot of this is just jargon and gibberish but

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,920
basically what they're trying to say is hey we work with elite brands and startups those are two kind

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,950
of groups we care a lot about user experience I mean right off the page they mentioned user experience

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,030
is not something you see all the time.

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,610
Design innovative digital services that's quite literally nonsense.

29
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,660
But what they're saying is when they say digital and if you guys remember in our vocabulary section

30
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:11,980
or we talked about suffixes digital means agency digital means hey we don't just make Web sites we also

31
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:19,250
make movies or we also make video content and other things like that.

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,340
And then again now they pitch a little bit about you being successful with us.

33
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,980
That's a very common thing you see with larger groups.

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,430
They really do focus on client success and later lecture we talk about why.

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,110
But the difference between a rich client and a successful client is and basically the moral of the story

36
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,980
there is that successful clients will bring you a lot more money.

37
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,890
Rich clients are always usually one off.

38
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,770
And then right here this seems to be important enough for them to just say right off the bat.

39
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,060
Engagement experts.

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:57,240
OK so they're going to focus more on engagement meaning like they're focusing again on being user centric.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,760
They focus more on people paying attention to your Web site so maybe they're caring more about Flash

42
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,670
and polish and things like that things that someone who's more of a technical web developer is going

43
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,670
to care less about and then right down here.

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,810
Honestly even though this might seem like they're not pitching you your value proposition.

45
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,490
They really are.

46
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,650
And they're saying not only do we make great Web sites we're also a company that is focusing on thought

47
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,370
leadership.

48
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,240
We do a lot of research on the side.

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,400
We build white papers and etc etc..

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
Ok so I think you guys get the point.

51
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,110
Typically you will find their value proposition very quickly.

52
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,190
So in the previous section where we helped you guys develop your value proposition make sure that all

53
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,170
of your main points are on here and don't try to clutter it up too much.

54
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,420
OK.

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,230
Moving on to the third thing you always will see and you should always include services.

56
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,160
Notice how it's a services right there and here we they call it products because I believe that they

57
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,630
they build their own products but they're trying to sound like a product company.

58
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,130
Over here we have services and services and these guys probably have it.

59
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,590
They are going to call it.

60
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,630
They might have it as a sub tab.

61
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,850
But the point here is that everybody always needs to outline what exactly they do.

62
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,230
It's something that as you'll notice over here these guys might have forgotten to do it.

63
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,160
Basically what you need to do is you need to make sure that whoever's at your page isn't going to spend

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,210
their entire time in their page and not sure what exactly you do because at the end of the day you are

65
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,040
a vendor.

66
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,960
So you need to know that whoever's coming to your Web site is looking for something specific.

67
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,550
So you need in some way show them Hey this is what we do as plain as day.

68
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,830
OK.

69
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,030
And so like on our Web site we've made this as simple as possible we call it design plus development.

70
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,540
So what you understand is we also include design in our development.

71
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,990
We use a lot of language to make people understand that we're development focused design after thought.

72
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,330
And the reason why we kind of do that is because typically the clients come to us are not ones that

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,590
are trying to create groundbreaking design.

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,790
They're more interested in making technologically advanced web sites and applications and that they

75
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:18,200
need good design but they're not trying to look like path or look like urban B or previous Air B and

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,340
B the old air being be the new Air B and B looks ridiculous.

77
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,950
So right here I just try to make it as simple as possible.

78
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,000
We just said wow look at all these things we work with we can quite literally work with anything that

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
we catch all over here.

80
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,930
Oh these are mobile platforms we work with and again we work with everything.

81
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,210
And you'll notice every hear a lot of people use the opportunity to pitch what they do specifically

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,920
as an opportunity to sell you a little bit more.

83
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,860
A lot of them see look they'll use it like a case study kind of thing.

84
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,510
But what you can essentially get out of here is what exactly they do and then in this case they treat

85
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,110
niter as you describe how they're more of an agency.

86
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,730
They do the entire you know study beforehand on your application.

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,660
They give you marketing advice they give you Development advice they are pretty much the whole package

88
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,790
and similar to here.

89
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
They're going to do that as well.

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,580
And so here they're a little bit more literal they'll say you know we can design and develop new products

91
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,700
we can improve existing products and we can discover new opportunities.

92
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,500
That's what they do and then they focus.

93
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
You know this is their focus.

94
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,080
And these are the things that they've done before and they're good at it.

95
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,050
So remember you're always a vendor there are always going to list their services on here.

96
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,350
That's helpful right.

97
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,800
So if you don't do mobile design make sure that you have a Web site that says I only do web design.

98
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,080
You don't need to say I don't do mobile design.

99
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,500
It's fine you don't need to say every single thing you don't do because trust me there's more things

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,930
you don't do than you do do.

101
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,800
But it's important to have a services page because a lot a lot a lot of people will be interested in

102
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,760
your style what you're saying but they're not going to contact you unless they know for a fact that

103
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,100
you make the BlackBerry and you're going to be able to make whatever specifically they're looking for.

104
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:03,320
OK so the number four thing that every single one is going to have and I'm not going to end up in trouble

105
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,390
saying this every single one lists their portfolio.

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,630
And we have an entire section on this course on portfolios follow that if you want advice on what to

107
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,550
pick how to build them where to display them etc. but you'll notice that every one is going to list

108
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,730
out their portfolio in some way.

109
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:27,230
Like here products is their portfolio look a case study on a Web site they made and sapient Lytro we

110
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,070
just go over to work and work is things that they have built.

111
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,890
They have an insane amount of things to show you are going to show you right here if we go to our work

112
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,370
and here they're going to you know give it to you kind of case study style.

113
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,830
And here are some of the ones that are really really proud of these guys even do it as well.

114
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,780
Well could it work.

115
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,110
Right.

116
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,330
And so a lot of people do it in this thumbnail design or just list out everything.

117
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,820
And if you guys follow our portfolio section I can tell you why this is not effective it's never affected

118
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,800
given this many items.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,110
It's always better to do a deeper dive on your top 5 to top 10.

120
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,100
But anyway.

121
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,930
So pretty much every single person does their own portfolio.

122
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:14,570
We are actually kind of an exception to the rule in that we use really is we ask people to request our

123
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,360
portfolio and then we send it to you.

124
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,240
Reason why we do this is just because we want to build an email list of people who are interested.

125
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,930
That helps a ton when it comes to bringing in new business and looking for other contractors and partners

126
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,660
for internal projects.

127
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,770
So don't forget to add a portfolio you'll notice all web companies are going to list a portfolio in

128
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,860
some way or at least make a reference to it.

129
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:42,800
OK the last 2 things are about us and contact us so about us is pretty simple.

130
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,120
Usually it's some form of information about who we are.

131
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,700
And a lot of ways it can be different it could just be a thing at the bottom that just says hey here's

132
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,540
where we are.

133
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,980
This is who we are.

134
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,110
This is what we look like.

135
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,480
A lot of times it's under a tab called like company.

136
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,580
A lot of times it's under a tab that's actually under contact us you to go to contact us to figure more

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,450
about them.

138
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,590
The reason why is because typically if you're doing large contracts and especially you're pitching to

139
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,570
people who don't know you they want to feel comfortable knowing who you are.

140
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:19,610
And it's really a good opportunity to help them understand who you are what's your culture like what

141
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,640
do you care about things like that it's just another opportunity for them to feel comfortable with you

142
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,780
and to get close to you were a little bit of an exception in that we describe ourselves throughout our

143
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:36,380
Web site but we don't actually have a company section mainly because we've found that it's harder to

144
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,040
build something like this when you have a distributed team.

145
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,790
So our team is primarily distributed about 80 percent of us are pretty much on Skype all over the world.

146
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,110
So it's a little bit harder when you can't have these like glorious shots of our hardwood floors and

147
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,020
our red brick room office space.

148
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,840
But what you'll notice is that if you do have some a group of people or in some way it's very helpful

149
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,710
to give some information about you if you have a distributed team.

150
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:09,830
What I do suggest is maybe you describe who you are specifically as the founder or just giving generic

151
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,080
information when we were started who we work with what we focus on things like that.

152
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,750
The last thing you'll notice is just contact us you need to have some way of being contacted.

153
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,330
So pretty much everyone on here has contact forms.

154
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:31,270
We do it up here and we also do it down here pretty much everybody has some way of sending them information.

155
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,430
And so like they'll call it connect or even contact.

156
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,300
So that's crucial.

157
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,840
Obviously a lot of people put that thing up and they forget that you need to put an e-mail address or

158
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,350
an e-mail form or something along those lines right.

159
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,870
Because this whole idea is to capture attention and then drive them towards you.

160
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:51,380
OK so hopefully you guys have a decent idea of how some of the more popular web development firms out

161
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,570
there designed their web presence.

162
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,200
These are more developed web sites.

163
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,120
A lot of them out there are very simple.

164
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,800
Don't be kind of put off by how fancy these guys are.

165
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,050
I'm just showing you these because they're kind of the top of the line.

166
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:10,700
And so a lot of the design conventions and standards follow these people so you should be aware there's

167
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,440
plenty of other ones out there that are much more simple much less graphically intense like this.

168
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,640
And obviously ones that have not been around as long so obviously don't get discouraged by how over-the-top

169
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,090
these are.

170
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,440
These are very well-established firms that I picked up so if you guys have any other questions this

171
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,610
post in the group discussion and we can kind of go over it.

172
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,880
But the main takeaways here is that everybody seems to have the same patterns of information.

173
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,980
So if you're making your site and you think you're leaving something out.

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,570
Just go and look at somebody else's.

175
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,750
And you'll notice there's a section pretty much all across the board that you're probably missing and

176
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,210
you should probably include.

177
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,000
All right see the next lecture.
