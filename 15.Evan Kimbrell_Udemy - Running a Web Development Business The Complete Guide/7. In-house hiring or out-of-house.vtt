00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.130
You guys will come back to the course so in this lecture talk about whether or not it's worth it to

2
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.670
hire people as employees and to work with them in person.

3
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.400
Now the vast majority of well known development studios out there they'll have employees.

4
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.870
That's not to say that they don't use contractors extensively but they all do have some form of in-house

5
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.800
staff.

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.620
Now that is what makes them resemble more closely a traditional company.

7
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.830
They don't just distribute all of their employees over the world.

8
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.820
Even at Sprint tech we have a little bit of both going on.

9
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.460
We have some full time employees and then we have the majority contractors.

10
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.870
Now that's something that took us a very long period of time to get to.

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.560
Mainly because you know at the very beginning we didn't have consistent enough project work to hire

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.490
someone for a yearly rate as opposed to just paying them a project rate.

13
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400
We transitioned into that.

14
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.060
So whether or not you make the decision to hire someone in person at the beginning well that's going

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.610
to depend on a couple of things and that's how we're going to cover in this lecture.

16
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.380
Now first off let's do this backwards let's talk about the disadvantages of bringing someone on as an

17
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.490
employee now.

18
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.580
And I'm talking about graphic designer developer for really anyone or anyone that has to do with the

19
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.220
service that you're offering through your development business.

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.670
Now having employees and having a set static group of employees that makes it a lot harder to take on

21
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.590
a wider variety of projects.

22
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.460
If you're running a contracted based development group you can be a lot more flexible as to who you

23
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.750
let go and who you hire so that you can take on a much wider variety of projects with employees.

24
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.610
You kind of are stuck to whatever skill set they have.

25
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.730
So if you hire a ruby developer and someone comes to you and says they want their project on in ph P

26
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.380
you're not going be able to take that project whereas if you do this contract easily you could actually

27
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.920
go and look for another subcontractor to do that.

28
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.570
Now obviously if you are an employee you could capture that lead as well by bringing on another contractor.

29
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.210
The difference is that if you do that your other employee the Ruby on Rails is still going to get paid

30
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.350
regardless of whether it only works on a project.

31
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.100
Another big disadvantage of hiring in-house employees is it's it's hard to do and it takes a long period

32
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.040
of time.

33
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060
It's hard because there's a lot of paperwork.

34
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.690
It's hard because there's a lot of hoops you have to go through.

35
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.580
And it's also hard because because it takes so long for these people to get integrated into your team

36
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.360
it means it's very difficult for you to ramp up on projects to do a big project come through the pipeline

37
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.980
you don't have the manpower.

38
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.620
Now you might not be able to service that with actual traditional employees.

39
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.940
Also if you have a project that grows in size you're doing really well or your clients doing really

40
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.880
well it's going to be very hard for you to ramp up to meet their new demand.

41
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.470
Another reason is that recruiting is incredibly difficult.

42
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.310
If you live in any of the tech hubs now it's really really hard to find people and to entice them to

43
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.400
work with you mainly because there's so much competition for them.

44
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.580
What ends up happening is you end up paying a much higher premium especially if you live on say like

45
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.060
the coast in the United States.

46
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.260
It's probably the same as well if you live in any large metropolitan area even in Europe or Asia.

47
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.610
More demand means higher prices means it's a lot harder to recruit.

48
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.630
Also when you bring someone in as a full time employee you're kind of married to them and kind of what

49
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.600
I mean by that is that it's really difficult to bring them on really difficult to get rid of them.

50
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.210
So you really have to take something monumental to get rid of them.

51
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.870
And a lot of times you just end up making an ideal decisions because the cost of changing the person

52
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.870
or getting someone else is just too high.

53
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.370
Another reason is that housing it's really expensive.

54
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.360
That was some that was the biggest reason why we opted to keep contractors on for Honestly the first

55
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.710
three years of the business in San Francisco.

56
00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.560
The stat I just heard was that per employee for office space per year is $40000 so you pay an employee

57
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.080
$80000 that's another $40000 in housing.

58
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.040
Now that's an extreme example.

59
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.830
But housing is just it's an overhead expense that you don't necessarily need.

60
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.380
And the last thing is that off hours are really expensive.

61
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.220
Now let me explain to you the concept of what off hours or off hours are is kind of the in-between time

62
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.150
between when a developers working on a project and when they're not.

63
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.170
Now there's a lot of time that happened so at the end of the day if they you know if they only have

64
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.460
an hour left and they don't have something that can take an hour that's lost time.

65
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.290
If they're in between projects or bringing in a project but it's not coming as fast as you thought it

66
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.740
could be they can end up sitting around for a week to two weeks.

67
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.190
That's expensive because you've to pay them regardless of what they output.

68
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.600
That's how basic employees work.

69
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.690
Now the advantages are a little bit more obvious.

70
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.570
This is why I left these to the second part.

71
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.680
Your project quality and your ability to meet deadlines are going to increase considerably.

72
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.130
The reason why not only do you have a closer feedback loop with your employees.

73
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.420
But because their employees are more willing to work overtime when needed and then to kind of balance

74
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.600
it out at other times because for them it doesn't really matter.

75
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.990
They just didn't get to create good products and to make their clients happy.

76
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.320
They don't really care how many hours they're billing.

77
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.900
Another reason is that your ability to communicate increases considerably so the ability to collaborate

78
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.550
to come up with solutions to problems to come up with new project ideas that increases considerably.

79
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.320
Mainly because your communication lag is just limited.

80
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.480
I mean even when you're talking on Skype there's still going to be some lag in between now if you cut

81
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.210
that lag in half you can communicate twice as fast.

82
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.830
Now the biggest reason I think that employees are a good idea if you're trying to build a development

83
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.240
business is because they have no incentive to cut corners.

84
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.050
That's the biggest drawback to contractors draw contractors.

85
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.040
They're always looking to cut costs because they're either working on a per hour or per project rate

86
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.630
and they're only concerned about whether or not they get paid.

87
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.440
So they're not always in it for the long term.

88
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.980
They don't necessarily care about the finished product.

89
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.910
They care more about billable hours and finishing the one section that they're assigned.

90
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.870
So employees they have a lot more on the line so they can step up when you need them.

91
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.560
Contractors will if they're a good contractor but they're much less likely to do so.

92
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.110
Either way you can do it you know like I said before the big web companies big web studios they all

93
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:30.530
pretty much do most of it in-house but that's because their angle is that they're going for quality

94
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.480
is paramount.

95
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.050
They only care about quality.

96
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.140
They want to make the best possible.

97
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.390
They primarily work with people who don't even think about budget.

98
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.950
If your product offering and your value proposition is going to be different than that then you might

99
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.350
want to consider contracting because that's going to be a lot easier for you now everybody wants great

100
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.040
product quality right.

101
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.250
And employees get the best product quality.

102
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.660
So you would think if you want the best product quality you'd take employees.

103
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.070
So just like I said before that only makes sense when you're going for always having the utmost quality.

104
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.720
In most cases you need to create some combination.

105
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.660
Contractors are much more flexible in that regard.

106
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.010
So take a moment to consider what you want yourself do you want flexibility or do you want ability in-house

107
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.330
teams are invariably going to have an advantage on product quality and contracting firms are invariably

108
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.650
going to have an advantage on flexibility if you don't have a project for your contractor to work on.

109
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.390
It's not a big deal.

110
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.050
They're in charge of their own product load.

111
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.410
If an employee you run out of a project or a project for them that actually is quite expensive.

112
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.180
So do you see yourself as running this full time or part time.

113
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.430
Is this something that you're more interested in cash or you're more interested in building a brand

114
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.340
and establishing your reputation if you care more about cash and you care more about the kind of the

115
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.030
ratio of how much work you put into this or what you get out of it.

116
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.210
I'd suggest working with contractors if you're trying to do this full time and you're trying to build

117
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:59.360
this into something really big and you're trying to focus on your reputation and getting a lot of publicity

118
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.310
for the things you've built.

119
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.270
Then you probably want to focus on ploys.

120
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.410
So just one more thing to consider.

121
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.830
Make sure that whatever strategy you use aligns with you yourself and your goals.

122
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.700
That's the most important thing if you build this and aligns to what you want out of it and what you're

123
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.050
capable of.

124
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.400
You're going to be the most successful.

125
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.700
All right.

126
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:24.790
So in the next lecture.
