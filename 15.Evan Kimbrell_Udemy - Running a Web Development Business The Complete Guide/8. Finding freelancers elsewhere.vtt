00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.050
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.720
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.600
In this lecture we're going to look over some alternate places you can find small contractors now now

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.630
you don't always have to use just those platforms that we covered.

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.790
There are some other ways to find people you just need to know where to look at a couple of basic techniques

6
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.720
for finding them.

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.030
So we're going to go over a couple of my favorites so I'll see in the screencast.

8
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.290
All right.

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.400
So another way of finding outsourced firms or freelancers blogging or not is just actually just using

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.070
Google.

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.120
Now Google is really really good at keying in on key.

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.440
And so when you're looking for a freelancer or a freelance firm through google you want to be as specific

13
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.230
as possible.

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.210
Now the previous lectures we talked about using Ilands oDesk and freelancer Those are great if you want

15
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.420
people to come towards you come out of the woods and pitch you on whatever you've given to the public.

16
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.880
Now if you had something very specific this is what I would use Google for now if I wanted to build

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.990
an application that use a very specific technology if I was very very specific about what framework

18
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.840
I wanted people to work with.

19
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.020
Maybe it has a technology that's more obscure then in that case what I would do is I would use Google

20
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.190
and in this case I would look for firms and then I would add the keyword of whatever the technology

21
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.940
is.

22
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.590
This is what Google is primarily useful for but you can use it for really anything.

23
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:47.380
Now if I were going to look for say a developer that can let's say use Twilio I could say Twilio developer

24
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.050
developers.

25
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.270
This one might see.

26
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.450
Now you can go to like Tullio developers network here you might be able to message people on LinkedIn.

27
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.890
Once you get past all of the news stories you should be able to find some people.

28
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.480
But typically what's easier to do is you say Tokyo developers and then freelancer or what you can say

29
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.320
is firm or web studio or something like that.

30
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.150
Now these aren't necessarily going to be out of the country and that's why it's helpful if you want

31
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.160
to say something like Twilio freelancer and then insert the country that you're interested in.

32
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.270
So you could say you know some people have specific areas that they have better expertise with or better

33
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.180
experiences with.

34
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.810
Maybe I'm going to Eastern Europe.

35
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.530
I could say something like Ukraine or maybe I wanted to say India.

36
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.170
We can say India.

37
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.750
And so right here it obviously brings us back to a park which is oDesk nowadays but you can see that

38
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.440
there's other Web sites that have access to developers.

39
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.160
Looks like you can find people and people per hour work in higher.

40
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.930
Here is an example of someone who has identified themselves as a Twilio developer.

41
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.480
Same thing here same thing.

42
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.370
You can go and gooroo dot com.

43
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.500
Here's another one.

44
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.740
Here's an actual company looks like they've made in an individual page saying that they work with Twilio.

45
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.100
Now this could work for really whatever maybe you're very specific about using react or no.

46
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.060
Yes there's something something very specific.

47
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.560
Now another way that you can look for outsourced firms to work with this is a Web site called the firm

48
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.050
list and what the firm list does is it's just a massive index of all web studio and web development

49
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.610
firms in the world.

50
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.910
They don't have every single one but this is this is what you would use if you cared most about where

51
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.320
they are located.

52
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.610
I would go here if that's really all I cared about.

53
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.780
If I was like I want to outsource sperm but I want them in Mexico or I want them in Costa Rica I want

54
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.110
them on my time zone.

55
00:03:51.190 --> 00:04:00.130
Or maybe I specifically want them in Slovakia or Latvia or India or whatever it is I would use this

56
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.620
Web site.

57
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.520
I can even drill down to the city.

58
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.050
Now some people have a preference they might say like I want an outsourced firm specifically in Hyderabad

59
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.430
India that's actually sprint.

60
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.000
We have the majority of our contractors.

61
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.840
Or maybe you have employees or colleagues that live in a specific city and you think that you're going

62
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.690
be able to use that as leverage to develop a better relationship with your outsourced firm.

63
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.830
What you could do is you could look specifically for those.

64
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.970
So what I could do is I could say Asia could go down to India and then within India you could pick the

65
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.550
city as you can see they just have list pretty much everywhere and right here it's going to give you

66
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.270
a list of 23.

67
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.920
These are the ones that they've selected that have the best presence.

68
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.840
And then you can honestly go through see who you like see who has the copywriting that speaks to you.

69
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.630
Start getting estimates to you.

70
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.190
This is a very useful tool if you want to go and rapidly get estimates from a lot of firms.

71
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.210
And it's also helpful.

72
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.470
You don't have to weed through Google results.

73
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.850
So make sure that you guys are using Google and using the firm list if those are some things that you

74
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.100
care about if you have specific criteria.

75
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.030
Use Google.

76
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.060
Honestly you have to kind of go through the woods a little bit but it's going to cut you through a lot

77
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.010
of the junk pretty quickly and then if you really really really care about the city there and or the

78
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.490
country there and try to use a firm list.

79
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.460
OK guys I'll see in the next lecture.
