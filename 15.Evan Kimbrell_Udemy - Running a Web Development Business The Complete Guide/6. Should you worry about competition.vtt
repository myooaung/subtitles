00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.680
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about a question I get all

2
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.340
the time which is should I worry about competition now any traditional business you would have a product

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.350
offering you would need to examine your competition.

4
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.260
You need to be concerned about how saturated your market is and you need to be confident that there

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.890
is a market opportunity that isn't going to be swooped up by some other company specifically to development

6
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.490
businesses.

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.190
When people ask me should I be worried about competition.

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.840
The answer is always unambiguously No.

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.210
Why is that.

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:48.650
Well because there are an immense amount of development businesses out there and there's almost an infinite

11
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.630
amount of development work out there that needs to be done that's being developed on a day to day basis.

12
00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.430
It is there is a mind boggling amount of development firms and a mind boggling amount of work that's

13
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.180
out there that's constantly being produced and needed.

14
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:15.700
Now why do clients pick development firms they pick them typically because they can match their expertise.

15
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.470
They have a good reputation they have a good portfolio and they can build a relationship to them.

16
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.200
Now one of the biggest problems the market when it comes to development firms is that highly fragmented

17
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:34.650
it is virtually impossible for one company to compare another on an apples to apples ratio.

18
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.840
If one company says no this is our proposal this is our time line.

19
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.500
Now how is it possible that the person that client could even know about whether or not there's a better

20
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.140
proposal out there from a better company even on the other side of the world the market in general just

21
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.590
lacks transparency and that's because every single development firm is just different and every single

22
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.120
client.

23
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.450
And what they need is also very very different.

24
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.680
There's always an infinite number of configurations in terms of what you can offer as a devolvement

25
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.560
firm an infinite number of configurations that a client ends up needing at the end of the day clients

26
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.770
care about referrals and they care about their relationship with their contractor.

27
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.810
There is no company out there that can dominate the entire market and steal all of that from everyone.

28
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.900
Because again the number one thing they care about is something that's established on an individual

29
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.100
basis.

30
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.700
We have so many different technologies out there so many different projects being created that there's

31
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.630
almost infinite numbers of opportunities to create a development business and create a offering and

32
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.180
then to go out and find those projects and connect yourself with them.

33
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.320
So no don't worry about competition.

34
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.640
If you had to worry about competition your head would explode.

35
00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.770
You couldn't possibly take into consideration every single move every single decision every single change

36
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.530
of every single competitor because no one even knows how many development businesses there are.

37
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.400
There aren't too many.

38
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.080
And honestly if you're not the right fit for a client it's kind of like they say client work in this

39
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.810
situation it's like a boss.

40
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.000
If you missed your first boss there's always another one coming.

41
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.930
So don't forget you can always find the right combination with the right client.

42
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.060
There is an abounding amount of work out there.

43
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.180
It's so much so that it's not even worth really worrying about competition.

44
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.390
Now the only reason why you should even keep an eye on what people you perceive as competitors are people

45
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.110
who are in a similar space is merely because it gives you a great opportunity to emulate what they're

46
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.650
doing.

47
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.530
I could give you ideas for how to improve your service can give you ideas for areas to move into techniques

48
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:56.170
best practices use those competitors or perceived competitors as a way to improve yourself.

49
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.200
But that's literally it.

50
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.720
Don't fret about it.

51
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:07.130
Your market potential is built off your ability to find clients keep good relationships and keep really

52
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.610
good business fundamentals.

53
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.190
If you focus on that you're going to grow you're going to find more clients and it's virtually impossible

54
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.820
to ever run into a situation where competitors stealing all your business or a market is too saturated.

55
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.850
It just doesn't happen in the development world.

56
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.410
All right guys see in the next lecture.
