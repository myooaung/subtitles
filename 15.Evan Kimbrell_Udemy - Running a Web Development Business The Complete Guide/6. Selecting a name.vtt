00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.820
You guys go back to the course so in this lecture Let's talk about taking the name of your business.

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.700
Now how much does a name really matter.

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.210
Well it depends I say I think in a lot of cases a really good name can really help you and you get a

4
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.040
lot of cases over the bad days.

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.760
It could really seriously hurt you.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.430
In most cases I would say your name probably falls in the middle where it doesn't really help you.

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.500
It doesn't really hurt you.

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.100
But there's some specific guidelines that you should follow to make it easier and to make sure that

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.530
you pick something that is a negative asset like a liability you know a great name it can do a lot of

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.660
things for you.

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.400
It can make you sound established it can make you sound trendy or with it if you make you sound like

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.020
your high growth.

13
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.740
There's a lot of subconscious associations on names.

14
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.910
Now you have to understand a lot of people that the first thing they hear is going to be your name.

15
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.790
So how do you want them to feel now a bad name it can actually make you sound honest stablished it can

16
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.520
make you sound unprofessional it can make even sound immature done incorrectly and it can make it sound

17
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.810
like like something that's not interesting.

18
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.180
Now let me tell you Don't worry about it in the sense that if you pick a name you're worried about being

19
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.040
like a miner.

20
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.590
Grenades can blow up very very hard to pick a name it's really going to create a lot of problems for.

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.220
And in most cases a name that's bad might only be bad for one specific group of people and then it obviously

22
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.190
depends on whether or not you're targeting that specific group of people.

23
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.620
So this is something that a lot of people are starting their development business they worry about all

24
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.080
the time.

25
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.150
So let's walk through it try to make it as easy as possible.

26
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.150
So the first technique you can use is by using a literal name.

27
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.520
Now literally I mean is that you will literally describe something about your business in your name.

28
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.900
You can use adjectives you can use just statements.

29
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.260
Let's say give an example.

30
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.360
You're located in California and that location is very important to you.

31
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310
You could say California death.

32
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.370
Maybe if you're in a specific city you could use the same name in your name.

33
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.370
That really helps you when you're targeting people that are in your area.

34
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.800
Now if you want to specialize in something that's covered previously in the course.

35
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.930
Pick something that is specific to what you're specializing in if you're specializing in a vertical

36
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.650
like say medicine you might be called something along the lines of medical web.

37
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.900
Try to combine some work that's associated with your Birchall.

38
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.090
Now if you're specializing in technology then you probably want to use some portion of the name of the

39
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.030
technology in your name if you use code igniter maybe you'll call yourself igniter labs.

40
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.100
Sure that's taken.

41
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.500
Now another strategy that you can go after is building your name based off of its potential as if you're

42
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.090
not aware.

43
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.870
Search Engine Optimization this case we're just talking about Google now trying to think of who your

44
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.410
customer base is going to be.

45
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.350
And a lot of cases you have no idea but a lot of you out there have a very good idea about who your

46
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.110
customer base is potentially going to be specially if you are specializing now trying to think of something

47
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.200
they're going to be searching a lot terms they use or something that they probably are interested in

48
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.890
or want.

49
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.830
Now trying to use the words from that and try to incorporate those in your title if you want to go after

50
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.180
people who want cheap WordPress development.

51
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.180
Maybe you want a clue.

52
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.010
A couple of those three words in your title maybe you just go with cheap WordPress development.

53
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.320
If you want to specialize in just converting design into HDMI you'll remember we talked about that being

54
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.440
part of the part of the development layers that maybe you want to call it something similar to what

55
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.710
someone would search for looking for it maybe you call yourself BSD till web.

56
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.720
Maybe you call yourself design to web something like that.

57
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.800
Now if done correctly and you have narrowed down your market really well and give you a huge boost Google

58
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.530
afterall is going to obviously give a lot of weight to someone who has the their domain name is similar

59
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.270
to the keyword.

60
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.910
That means that that Kokanee or that Web site is probably very serious.

61
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.900
But even the person who search for those keywords.

62
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.540
Another strategy is to use adjectives or feelings.

63
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.140
Pick a word that conveys the type of feeling you want your customer to feel when they hear your name.

64
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.610
Now this is something that you see constantly in like real estate.

65
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.760
People always add an adjective to whatever they want you to feel about the listing.

66
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.880
Now this also works for company names.

67
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.690
You can use a pair of adjectives if you want to know if you want the person to feel like this is just

68
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.020
right.

69
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.040
Call it just right development.

70
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.900
If you want them to feel like this could be perfect perfect development there's a lot of ways you can

71
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.960
do this you can even experiment with nontraditional words like cozy cozy might imply boutique it might

72
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.490
imply trustworthiness.

73
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.010
You can pick a lot of different adjectives and just try it out with a point and you're going for how

74
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.610
that word makes you feel even if it's not necessarily relevant.

75
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.150
A technology company.

76
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.910
Now the last concept I'll cover that can help you along this road is what's called a Brandel.

77
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:14.070
Now I Brandel is a word that has absolutely no meaning it's usually jibberish and it has absolutely

78
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.400
no connotation associated with it.

79
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.630
A brand is something that you can kind of white label it's a blank slate.

80
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.840
If I heard it nothing would register in my head maybe whatever language sounds like that's about it.

81
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:37.920
So Mock's or zero with an X or there's a e-mail attachment company called X I a you know in Csound and

82
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.800
dines outgunning those are Randles.

83
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.890
Now the reason why you pick a Brandel is if you plan to expand to do a lot of different things and so

84
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.310
you don't want to be pigeonholed in one area.

85
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:56.370
If you pick a specific name or a specialization specific name you're kind of stuck with that name and

86
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.220
you have to changing it if you expand into other things.

87
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.280
You also use a brand that if you wanted to imply that this was like a start up or a all around technology

88
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.260
company and you didn't want to just limit yourself to thinking it's a development company that typically

89
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.380
works against you people when they work with the development company and know that that's your specialization

90
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.060
right.

91
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.810
But if it's a sport do you do decide that you do other things and perhaps a brand dibbles a better idea.

92
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.220
Now obviously the downsides are pretty obvious because you're missing the opportunity to use some type

93
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.250
of word to get some feeling or thought across but also getting brand recognition can be quite difficult

94
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.770
especially if you have a general strategy.

95
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.070
So you have a group of people and a couple of you can use your service.

96
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.750
How many times do they have to hear that word before it has meaning to someone who isn't one of your

97
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.590
customers.

98
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.580
It's very hard to do that.

99
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.350
And if you do pick a brain of all.

100
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.740
You know honestly as I said Gosset can you please make something that's somewhat pronounceable if you

101
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.020
can't turnout's it is a horrible horrible idea.

102
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.590
Now it's somewhat enjoyable to watch your clients cringe and like trying to get the word out correctly

103
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.710
that you don't ever have to correct them.

104
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.840
But that's actually kind of a problem because people who have a problem describing the name or pronouncing

105
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.640
the name are less likely to share it or less likely to communicate it to other people which is something

106
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.750
that you're going to highly.

107
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.440
You're always going to want to rely on.

108
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.800
Now let's talk a little bit about suffixes and what have you with suffix.

109
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:29.550
I mean that descriptor that's usually attached at the end of a company name and also prefixes are things

110
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.690
that can be attached to the beginning but there are usually these little things that are called modifiers.

111
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.740
On top of your name.

112
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.400
So a lot of times people pick say one of the things we just went over.

113
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:46.080
Maybe they pick an adjective and say that they take perfect and then they pick a suffix like agency

114
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.230
or labs or company or firm or anything like that.

115
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.480
So now let me cover just a little bit about what each one of those means.

116
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.390
You know you can't go wrong by picking any one of these but you might unintentionally imply things that

117
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.330
you didn't mean to you.

118
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:09.200
So now studio calling yourself a web or mobile studio Studio implies that you're small like a studio

119
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:09.830
right.

120
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:15.810
It also implies that your boutique and everything you do is done in-house that's typically the association

121
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.720
people get with studio a thousand person company cannot be a studio Studio.

122
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:25.110
Typically a core group of people that work together really long time and haven't had a very specific

123
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.280
way that they work and build things.

124
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.790
Now you could use the word labs as a suffix but Louds what that implies is that you're building complex

125
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.710
technology means that you're building things in a little bit more in the forefront.

126
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.180
It's not like you're just building copycats of Facebook it's more like you're building out algorithms

127
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.290
that haven't been made before and a lot of experimental things.

128
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.100
Now if you want to pitch your uniqueness that's great and if you have other projects you're pursuing

129
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.940
that could be a good name choice.

130
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.910
Now the downside of using the word labs that people are going to assume that you have other projects

131
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:02.310
so we're going to see maybe you don't specialize in development maybe you do a lot of different things

132
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.000
and this development just one of them.

133
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.580
Another word is Agency and agency implies that you do a lot of other things and development is just

134
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.430
one of them.

135
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.790
Typically an agency is a big company.

136
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.060
Typically the agency's been around for a while.

137
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.630
And typically the agency will cover a lot of different things.

138
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.270
They'll cover public relations or cover marketing.

139
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.120
They'll cover development design.

140
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.260
They can do a lot of different things now to cover one prefix really quickly.

141
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.530
And this is just something that I see a lot of people get confused.

142
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:39.990
Digital Digital is something that people call themselves ok so like a digital agency digital would imply

143
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.380
that you do anything on media.

144
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.930
Now when I say the media people then are going to think probably that you also do your work you potentially

145
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.460
do animation work.

146
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:58.800
It really is just a much broader term and it's something I don't typically use unless you also are working

147
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.600
in different of media.

148
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:00.910
OK.

149
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.490
So if you are stuck you can't think of anything to help you through.

150
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.190
Honestly I understand when I did this too it took me forever to come up with a name.

151
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.880
In fact I used a name that was like a stopgap name we call it 47 squares.

152
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.420
And the reason why we call it 47 squares was we were.

153
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:27.300
I think we were making fun of 37 Signals right because 37 Signals has thirty seven that's a really arbitrary

154
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.210
number.

155
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.060
So clearly 47 is better than 37 right.

156
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.890
What's a signal a square is better.

157
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.620
That was just a joke and so we use that as a stopgap pretty much to cover all of our projects until

158
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.660
we came up with a name that actually make more sense.

159
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.160
Now one thing you need to keep in mind though when you are looking at picking a name will be your domain

160
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.050
availability.

161
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.890
That's one of the biggest things.

162
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.870
And I think that should be 90 percent of what goes into this if you pick a name and you'll love it.

163
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.950
I'd say nine times out of 10 you're not going to have the domain available.

164
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.150
So you really need to focus on things that are available.

165
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.370
This leads me into some tools that you can use that can really help you come up with a name much faster

166
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.390
and because they're tools in their own line it can help you with that domain availability issue.

167
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.850
So one example is called name mesh dot com.

168
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.990
It's actually a new Web site that I got suggested to from a student at one of my other courses so you're

169
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.280
out there.

170
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.590
Good job.

171
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.840
It's actually a really cool Web site.

172
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.540
What it does is that you just plug in adjectives and it will output all whole different combination

173
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:34.470
of different possible names and not even do with your contortions to your name and there's a fun section.

174
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.800
So try that one out.

175
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.090
If you're just setting here and you can think of four or five things that you want to associate with

176
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.550
your business try out every single one.

177
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.950
Also his domain validated so I can suggest something if the domain is not.

178
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.290
Another one you can use is domain her and I'll put it up on the screen here Mainer is another one.

179
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:56.430
And the reason why I use this on is because it's got to a point where domains are so incredibly saturated

180
00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:01.040
that it's really hard to sing of a name that isn't already purchased.

181
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:07.230
And so a domain or does it allows you to use non-conventional kind of endings for your domain name so

182
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:14.100
not just dot com and look into all sorts of weird things like dot our DOT I O dot SEO.

183
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.730
And it's kind of a trend nowadays that more and more companies are using that.

184
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:24.040
Nevermind what those crazy like Indigo's mean they need something totally weird iOS Indian Ocean.

185
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.450
Your thing is you're a Tria doesn't really matter.

186
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.210
It's becoming more and more the norm.

187
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:34.620
So now if you've done all of this and you also just cannot come up with anything you can do it.

188
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:40.230
We did it actually from our second name and if you go to crowd spring dot com you actually can run a

189
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:46.380
contest on naming your business what you do is you basically describe how you want it to make you feel

190
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.640
what it's going to do.

191
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.120
What's special about you.

192
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:55.200
Anything you want to take into consideration into your name and you can get hundreds and hundreds of

193
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.310
name suggestions.

194
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.450
We spent $180 and got 450 suggestions.

195
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.490
That's how we came up with Sprint kick actually.

196
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.160
And in that one you can obviously say like the domain has to be available.

197
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.360
So you don't waste any time with ones aren't available.

198
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:15.330
Sprinkle it was really easy for us actually because we use an agile development methodology and it's

199
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.430
called scrub and scrub.

200
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.640
You use what's called a sprint.

201
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:24.870
And so every chunk of work we do is called us rent and we cover this later in the course whether or

202
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.900
not you should use agile and if you do want to use you know how to implement that in your development.

203
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.070
But it makes sense because Sprint implies moving forward quickly.

204
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.690
And Sprint will like a play on words because we deliver in spreads.

205
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.870
Ok guys I'm not great at coming up with names I'll be honest but if you do need help just post in a

206
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.060
group discussion we can all try to collaborate.

207
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.640
Help us help each other out just a little bit.

208
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:53.130
Don't get stuck on this for too long and honestly if you get really stuck and you don't spend money.

209
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.520
Try using a stopgap name just something silly that you can work with until you have some inspiration

210
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.050
down the road.

211
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:03.590
All right see the next lecture.
