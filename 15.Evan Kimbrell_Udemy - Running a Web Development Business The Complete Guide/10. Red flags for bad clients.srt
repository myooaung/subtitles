00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,210
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,730
We're going to talk about red flags for bad clients.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,790
How can you tell beforehand whether or not a client is going to be a nightmare down the road and whether

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,350
or not this is something you should steer completely clear of.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,770
Now your quality of life as a project manager as a developer as the business owner is really going to

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,000
depend on the clients that you end up working with.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,120
Some clients are fantastic.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,130
They just get it you will learn a lot from them they're easy to work with they always have the right

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,620
budget.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,490
They always respond on time.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,490
They're very forgiving when anything happens and they understand that some things are outside of your

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,210
control.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,440
Those people are great.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,370
They make this so much sweeter because you're getting paid to work with people that are great now on

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,140
the flip side you will run into some difficult clients clients that are a nightmare.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,970
Clients that have a lot of expectation issues clients that have a lot of authority issues you run into

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,560
ones that are mature ones that are completely unprofessional.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,450
You'll run into ones that have trust issues and ones that just take forever to get anything done.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:21,030
So to help you recognize some of the telltale signs of a bad client Let's go over some common scenarios

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,690
are some common things you might look for or start to notice.

21
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:30,990
So number one this is like I see all the time do they disagree with your estimates.

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,060
Now there's something that's very very strange in the development business.

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,880
You know if you're buying a shirt or buying something on the street someone might have the potential

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,820
to disagree with the price of something maybe they saw it the same price somewhere else.

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,620
But in development this is not a commodity.

26
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,350
We're not selling you a glass of orange juice or selling you something that's very very complicated

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,730
and very very technical something that's very very complicated and something that's almost always very

28
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,360
much customized to your individual case.

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,930
It's also the case that in development projects unless you're the one doing the estimate there's no

30
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,370
way you could possibly know exactly what it's going to take to build something.

31
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,600
So if our client is disagreeing with your estimate saying it's wrong saying one section is too large

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,200
that is a generally a big red flag and this is why I put this is number one.

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,010
A lot of times you'll have this happen you'll have a client who's not even technical trying to say oh

34
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,500
that didn't take as much time.

35
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,480
We have this problem a lot with graphic design and UI design because UI design sometimes it just takes

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,570
a lot of time up front until you get a general design theme or a lay out and then they use that to build

37
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,110
the other pages faster.

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
But that first batch will work.

39
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,230
We always get people saying no way that took X amount of hours.

40
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,200
The fact that your client even thought that they could make a judgment on how long that took and they

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,870
could go so far as to say that it's wrong.

42
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,790
Huge red flag.

43
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,560
Steer clear.

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,770
Number two does their project idea make no sense.

45
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,310
Now here's one thing I want to say is that when you're in the development business and I say this frequently

46
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,220
you're not in the business of picking winners.

47
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,520
If that were the case you'd be in venture capital.

48
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:26,160
You'd be an angel investor who'd be somebody who hops from startup to startup you're not in a position

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,330
to make a decision about whether or not their market opportunity is good enough whether or not their

50
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,390
execution capacity is good or the team is a fantastic setup.

51
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,490
That's not what you're doing.

52
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,850
You're here to build whatever it is they want.

53
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,690
And do the best job possible.

54
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,450
But since you are getting a lot of time thinking about it estimating it you should have a decent idea

55
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:52,020
of whether or not this idea is terrible or if it's OK if it is the case that they're giving you something

56
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,480
that just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

57
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,960
You couldn't possibly imagine why anyone would use it or it's something that's completely derivative

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,720
of something else.

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,500
Usually that's a red flag.

60
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,090
Now it doesn't matter if they're copying something else that happens all the time but if they're trying

61
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,280
to make something that just flat out makes no sense they're talking about users using it in a way that

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,320
can't work or any general kind of disconnect in that sense.

63
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,470
This might be a project or client you might want to steer clear.

64
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,330
The reason why is because a best case scenario this is a one off project.

65
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,830
They build something it goes out there it completely fails because a person is unrealistic or an insightful.

66
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,740
What they're doing.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,640
The worst case scenario is that this bad project idea is indicative of a bigger problem it's probably

68
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,710
a bigger problem has to do with the client themselves.

69
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,110
They probably just have a whole lot of bad ideas and you're going to have to deal with a lot of bad

70
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,900
ideas later down the road.

71
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,550
There's no reason to think that they might have some bright ideas to fire you in the middle of the project

72
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,030
or to bring up issues that don't even exist.

73
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,190
Number three are they trying to haggle with your rates.

74
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,320
Now there's a big difference between haggling and just saying I can't afford something.

75
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,590
No make that a distinction.

76
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,830
If they're coming up to you and they're saying you know I need twenty five dollars an hour or $50 an

77
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,140
hour to do this and they're saying well I'll pay you 15 or trying to do a lowball pitch.

78
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,210
They're haggling with you.

79
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,860
If someone comes up to you and says oh I only pay for 22 an hour and I really want to work with you

80
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,660
that's the case and they just don't have the budget.

81
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,510
Those are two entirely different things.

82
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,090
You have someone coming up and saying no that's not worth it.

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,120
I'd rather pay you this.

84
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,430
And they're giving you a low ball.

85
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,440
That's haggling.

86
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,930
That's a big red flag.

87
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,480
If that has ever happened to you remind them that they're paying for wages they're not paying for an

88
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:46,320
object they're not paying for something that you can mark down at will if they pay you last that means

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,080
you pay your people less which means they wouldn't want to work on the job so why would you take it.

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,600
In general I'm not very accepting of haggling at all.

91
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,880
It's awful.

92
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,060
Some people out there do and I personally think that diminishes their brand considerably.

93
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,380
So if a person comes up to you and they're haggling over the price of your project take that as a red

94
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,430
flag it generally means that they're unrealistic about the project.

95
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,800
They've never done this before.

96
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,640
They're not being particularly professional and their priorities are probably out of whack.

97
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,850
They probably only care about the price nothing else.

98
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,730
Why would you ever haggle with a long term partner someone who is going to take charge of a very important

99
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,700
project that has a large impact on your life.

100
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,040
It makes no sense to underpay that person.

101
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,720
It's also indicative of someone who doesn't have a budget.

102
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,540
A lot of times people don't have a budget or just trying to see how low they can get the price.

103
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,330
So if they're honestly worried about the hourly rate they shouldn't be talking to you.

104
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,180
Generally that means you're just about to waste a lot of time with someone who doesn't have money for

105
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,160
the project.

106
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,710
Number four are they giving you multiple proposals at once.

107
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,480
Are they asking you to give you an estimate for this application and this application and a whole about

108
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,790
two other applications.

109
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:04,790
If that's the case then you might have a scatterbrained client who's probably not committed to whatever

110
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:10,010
project they pick to make a project successful you need to spend a lot of time and effort thinking about

111
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:15,210
the project developing it and making the concept as bullet proof as possible.

112
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,330
If you're all over the board with multiple proposals it means that they're just scribbling things down

113
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,300
on a napkin.

114
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,290
And even if they decide to go with one of them who knows how.

115
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,830
Honestly how committed they are because they certainly are not focused.

116
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,560
That just spells red flag for me.

117
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,700
That can be an issue down the road if they get distracted on something else so they decide to divert

118
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,130
the resources over here.

119
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,290
You want to work with someone who's at least serious about what they're doing.

120
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,300
Number five do they argue over trivial items.

121
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,180
I've had clients argue with me over for sizing.

122
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:55,040
I've had them argue over taxed in their contract that doesn't actually mean anything there are conditional

123
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,050
clauses in their contract.

124
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,490
I've had people argue over what we call projects internally and how we spell them.

125
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,930
These are all trivial things and basically what that means is you have someone that isn't able to prioritize

126
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,570
isn't able to figure out what's important and they're more concerned with getting their way or proving

127
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,250
themselves in some way.

128
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,200
Typically that's just a sign that you're working with a client who's insecure and immature probably

129
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,360
don't have a large track record of success.

130
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:28,940
People are successful in development projects are not the type of people who nitpick things that just

131
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,380
simply don't matter.

132
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,910
Also to be completely honest that person is going to drive you crazy so do you really want to work with

133
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,510
them.

134
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,130
Number six are they being unprofessional.

135
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,670
Now this one's pretty plain and obvious you should know exactly what I mean.

136
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,390
Are they this certain person that has a tendency to throw tantrums.

137
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:57,090
The person who has a tendency to say things they shouldn't or do they often lie about things blatantly.

138
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,150
There's a lot of different things that wouldn't be very unprofessional do they constantly miss phone

139
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,200
calls that you've scheduled very basic things.

140
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,570
That's another pretty big red flag.

141
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,190
It means that they can't possibly have been successful in anything else they've done.

142
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,350
Who knows how they got the money for their project whatever they're going to put their name on and put

143
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,850
their effort towards probably is going to be dead in the water.

144
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,810
You shouldn't subject yourself to that.

145
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,880
It's just not worth it.

146
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,250
OK so those are the biggest red flags I've seen with clients.

147
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,360
There are some other ones obviously that you could easily think of.

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,300
These are the ones that I think kind of fly under the radar and are more important least in my experience

149

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,890
Do you guys have any questions or anything you want to comment on.

151
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,080
Any ideas for other red flags you've run into or you want me to say whether or not something is a red

152
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,810
flag post in the group discussion.

153
00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:02,960
Otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
