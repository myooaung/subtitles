00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,990
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,780
So in this lecture we're going to talk about a best practice that revolves around looking for the right

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,520
clients.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,310
And I call this one look for clients that have depth.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,300
What do I mean by that.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,500
No I don't mean look for clients that have really rich personalities and deep wells of knowledge.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,610
Your clients can be as shallow as you want them to be.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,820
That's not what I'm talking about.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,790
I'm talking about their projects look for clients that have projects that are not only ambitious but

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,550
actually have development depth to them.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,980
Now you might think to yourself but it's so easy to find someone who wants a custom WordPress theme

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,890
installed.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,130
Yes that's great.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,190
Yes that's money.

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,260
And I'm not going to discourage you from doing that.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,780
You have to understand that has a place when you're starting your business and you go after any client

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:02,470
you can alert someone who's doing a very basic one off project like doing a WordPress theme install.

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,410
That's fantastic.

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,380
Only at the beginning.

20
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,120
Now that type of client that I'm describing is what I call a web presence client.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,720
Someone has a web presence client is someone who is not necessarily in the business of making their

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,980
own application.

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,580
They're just in the business of getting a web site or a mobile presence application.

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,480
Those are typically people who literally just want a web site to display information about who they

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,290
are what their company does or to announce an upcoming product or something along those lines.

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,190
There's a very large portion of development projects out there that fall under this category people

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,630
who just want to say hello internet.

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,920
This is something to represent whatever I'm doing who I am and it's up online now there's multiple problems

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,330
with web presence clients being your main crop of clients.

30
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,510
First of all remember when I said that in any given development project design is always smaller and

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,140
the development and development is always the largest by far portion of the money spent now with Web

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,130
presence clients.

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,430
You're really kind of testing me on that rule because in a lot of cases the design is actually more

34
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,260
expensive than the development that is the biggest exception to this rule.

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,040
These projects typically from a development standpoint are not very deep.

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:27,030
There's something that is very easily put onto a platform very easily catered to from a Web site like

37
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,080
Squarespace or Wick's or Shopify or WordPress.

38
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,240
Very easy to go after.

39
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,100
These are clients that typically aren't looking for adding complexity they don't have any new ideas

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:45,090
that need to be made they don't have any custom specifications for any algorithms or new features or

41
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,010
really anything out of the ordinary.

42
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,310
They're just looking for flat pages that do very very basic common functionalities.

43
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,070
So one reason why they're bad clients is that there's a lot of competition for what they're trying to

44
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,430
do.

45
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,500
It's very hard for you to compete with another company that's out there that is spending millions and

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,140
millions of dollars to create a platform that can do everything for them.

47
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,420
The second thing is that they are often people with very very small budgets.

48
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,140
It is almost always the case.

49
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,700
Ninety percent of the time that after you do a web presence.

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,270
Work they have nothing else for you to do.

51
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,240
That's generally not something that you want.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,770
Remember we're trying to escape the cycle of constantly looking for new clients because that sucks up

53
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,410
a lot of time and that's time you don't get paid for.

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,640
You want to focus on finding clients that stick around for a long time because that's where they really

55
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,700
get profitable.

56
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,170
That's where you really get kind of the juice out of this relationship.

57
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,640
So were present clients even if they stick with you for a very long period of time you don't actually

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,180
get the benefits of retaining a client even if they do have work it's typically very small and it's

59
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,430
often just a distraction.

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,220
It's like you have to take a developer who's working on a larger project and say hey this client needs

61
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,670
four hours of work done that is just hard to get into.

62
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,190
That's hard to make money off of.

63
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,040
And often it's a bigger detriment to another project.

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,490
So in general try to focus on projects that are trying to expand try to focus on projects that have

65
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,940
some sort of novelty the very beginning you're perfectly fine bringing on web presence clients.

66
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,840
They were great for your portfolio but when your portfolio is full or past a point where you can display

67
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,000
them anymore you need to start looking further down field looking for people who are trying to build

68
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,070
applications trying people trying to build things that actually have some uniqueness to them and more

69
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,500
importantly they're going to be people that bring back significant chunks of work over the long term

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,300
and not just bring in trickles of money in trickles of billable hours.

71
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,590
That's a strategy that's just not sustainable.

72
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,040
Even if you are a solo freelancer you can fill your plate off of these web presence clients but you're

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,780
never going to grow this into something that's ideal or better than the situation you're in if you stick

74
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:01,920
with this client type questions comments concerns complaints anything you disagree with me post in the

75
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,710
group discussion.

76
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:11,800
Otherwise see in the next lecture.
