00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.510
All right let's spend a little bit of time checking out e Lance Lance was the web site I mentioned previously.

2
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.400
It's by far my favorite Web site for finding freelancers.

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.730
The quality of freelancers are much higher.

4
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.650
They're a little bit different than the other two.

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.360
I'm going to show you the way that they work behind the scenes as they make their money off number one

6
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.980
featured postings.

7
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.910
And number two they charge a percentage to the freelancer of about eight point seventy five percent.

8
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.810
Now you might think that's a lot of money.

9
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.930
And it kind of is especially if you're paying and a large project or you're having an ongoing relationship

10
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.420
with a freelancer but compared to the other ones it's actually a much lower freelancer for instance

11
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.050
charges 15 percent.

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.450
Lance has about 2 million freelancers.

13
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.260
Sounds like a lot.

14
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.060
It's actually less than the other two.

15
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.930
But in my experience they're much higher quality.

16
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.840
They are.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.810
It's actually a big company surprisingly.

18
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.080
They make about a hundred million dollars a year.

19
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.710
There also we're a venture capital darling.

20
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.880
They have taken something like 78 million dollars in funding.

21
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.120
So we'll just log on and show you generally kind of what it looks like what buttons and what areas you're

22
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.030
going to navigate around when you go to post.

23
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.180
Post your first job.

24
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.120
So if you've played around with any of these three web sites before the Lance is by far the cleanest

25
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.670
in terms of the user interface they separate everything out into my Elance is where they have all of

26
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.750
your tasks and jobs that you've posted.

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.670
Hiring This is where you'd go if you wanted to post a job where you actually wanted to do the opposite

28
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.040
which is you find an individual freelancer first as opposed to posting a job and letting the freelancer

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.990
freind find you.

30
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.920
They have some other features on here that I'm not going to really cover but they do have quite a robust

31
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.320
product and has a lot of different things on here that a lot of you might have find to be pretty useful

32
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.790
that I don't particularly use when I use plants.

33
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.850
So the way that you post the job is you would just simply go to post to job this is the simplest by

34
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.710
far and it looks very simple similar to every other job posting site you've seen it says job but really

35
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.750
they mean project.

36
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.110
You can make it like a job because later you're going to be able to select per hour or per project and

37
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.720
later in the course we're going to talk in depth about whether or not you want to use per project or

38
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.060
per hour really depends on the project that you're doing and it depends on you specifically and how

39
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.250
much experience you have.

40
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.770
We're also going to cover how you should work on titles and descriptions.

41
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.710
I want to do that in a later time and really get into depth with it but we're just trying to get familiar

42
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.030
with how their web site looks.

43
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.040
So you put the title of your job description goes here.

44
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.820
There is a 4000 character limit the way that you get around that is you would write as much as you can

45
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.130
in the described section and then you would attach an attachment a Word document with the actual multi

46
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.990
page definition of what you're trying to build.

47
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.470
That's they do they do that because they don't want people to go and look at a posting and just see

48
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.880
an enormous amount of text.

49
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.930
They describe it as your overview.

50
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.610
You give the overview the key details kind of give some information around who you want specifically

51
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.370
what type of person you're looking for and who should not bed and then put the actual details in the

52
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.930
attachments so they can pre-qualify themselves they can read that verse description and then they can

53
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.930
move onto the attachment if they're interested.

54
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.770
Category of work you'll notice that they're all kind of the same and all of these Web sites and men

55
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.760
support is typically like virtual assistance.

56
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.900
People need to make phone calls Excel sheets things like that.

57
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.360
You can find graphic designers on here a graphic design firms worth specifically talking about web applications

58
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.300
mobile applications.

59
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.670
But if you have a physical hardware project and that is your startup you can go into engineering and

60
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.250
manufacturing too and there are some really talented people on here so early you can find in legal and

61
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.730
finance people who can give you for instance in legal legal advice regarding your startup regarding

62
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.110
what you're trying to do.

63
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.860
And also in finance You'd be surprised you can find some part time C-T era CFOs people who are quite

64
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.800
good at giving you financial advice.

65
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.190
Doing your books doing your cost projections.

66
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:48.140
People who can look over your pro forma your pro-forma financials performer means just in the future

67
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.360
that's typically a Excel calculation you'll make where you're predicting how much you think your startup

68
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.990
will make.

69
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.810
If you go the venture capital route and you're not taking this course because you want to make a lifestyle

70
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.560
business you will have to do something like that.

71
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.210
And it's a useful tool to do.

72
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.930
Anyway I digress.

73
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Your typically going to be looking under I.T. and programming.

74
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.480
You can also use people in marketing writing translation really a very broad group of people you can

75
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.470
hire through this Web site.

76
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.590
So you going to select a subcategory you technically don't even have to.

77
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.180
There's another way of doing this.

78
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.420
And a lot of times depending on your application there might be you know I have a very specific skill

79
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.350
set you're looking for or you're building is very specific in general if that's the case and I usually

80
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.590
just typically live out leave out select subcategory and I use the request specific skills or groups

81
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.880
and then I'll type in something very specific.

82
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.870
And you'll notice like you use the word.

83
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.650
So this would be an example.

84
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.990
Maybe you want to build an e-commerce platform you don't just want someone who's skilled and just regular

85
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.770
e-commerce you don't you know you have your specific about what you want to use you don't want to use

86
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:07.490
Shopify or you don't want to use a like Wick's or Magento you want to use and car you can do Zenn car

87
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.210
and I can add that as a skill.

88
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.920
Now anybody who's listed Zen Cart will get that message and they all essentially be hit up and they'll

89
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.540
be brought to your project and it will show you don't ask them to kind of bid.

90
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.490
So that's a great way of honing in.

91
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.220
Typically then what I would end up doing is I would select skills that are complimentary to that that

92
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.620
you would kind of assume.

93
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:37.900
So like ph P and then I would pick say ph Peak's that's the language that Zen card is made in cake ph

94
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.260
is a framework.

95
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.780
If that's something specifically you wanted to use I try to keep it broad because typically someone

96
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:54.490
who is skilled in say ph before ph 5 ph PBB which is a forum they're also going to get messages for

97
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.800
PH P some kind of wasting my time by saying four or five.

98
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.400
Or cake ph.

99
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.610
The only time I would say something specific like I'd select cake is if I've already built my application

100
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.520
I'm looking for another freelancer and I use cake.

101
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.520
So I got to make sure that they're good at that.

102
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:17.800
So just say ph see if you notice on a sidebar over here this is actually kind of cool you can just use

103
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.660
job templates so if you're posting a job a repeat job or you're posting a job that's fairly similar

104
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.760
to something you posted before you can actually just pull it up on the side and it automatically drop

105
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.760
in all of the details so you don't have to redo that over again.

106
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:38.360
See also they do this the popular job template.

107
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.620
This is actually quite helpful.

108
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:40.650
Is it first time you're doing it.

109
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.560
So you do want to get a logo design done.

110
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.300
You could pick logo design and it will drop in

111
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.630
you so it's going to give you a separate form to fill out.

112
00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.520
And it's been a point you kind of in the right direction like what type of Logo are you looking for.

113
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.610
And you can get see they've designed this for people who are making logos and it looks like they've

114
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.600
already selected your skill for you or your section.

115
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.930
The last thing is you know you'll notice there's a fixed price again hourly.

116
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.010
What I like about you and you won't notice the other two is when you say fix price.

117
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:23.890
You can actually say your own range and you could say decide later that's really helpful.

118
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:29.710
One of the biggest problems of the other two is that you have to determine your range beforehand.

119
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:36.850
And so what was happening is you'd say like this and you don't always know how much the application

120
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.780
cost.

121
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.970
So maybe someone will make it for $300.

122
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:45.170
What the system is going to do it's going to say no it's between 500 and 1000 You can't be below that.

123
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.430
L.A. does not have that problem.

124
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.860
So you can put a suggestion and then people will bid around that.

125
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.380
Here's the biggest thing I think you should pay attention to when you do.

126
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.120
If you do a fixed price or hourly.

127
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.550
I always do decide later.

128
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.260
Always again decide later.

129
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.230
And why do I do that.

130
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:15.280
Because freelancers are very much influenced by the price set.

131
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.240
It's an anchor point.

132
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.990
So if I'm building an application I think it's going to cost $4000.

133
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:27.250
And I say it's worth you know I say my budget is you know one to five thousand dollars or let's say

134
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.590
OK let's scratch and let's say I think my projects were $6000.

135
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.080
So I would say five to $10000 what will happen is you will have freelancers who would build this for

136
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.760
$4000 or three or $2000.

137
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:46.990
But they see that your budget is five to 10 and they're more likely going a bit higher.

138
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:53.260
That has happened pretty much every single time I've done this where I've set my own price so you are

139
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.330
going to influence their bids and a lot of them are just going to assume that you don't know the actual

140
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.290
price or they're going to assume that they're wrong.

141
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:07.150
The point is if you say decide later they're in the dark they need to come up with their own price and

142
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.950
that's what you want them to do any way you want them to think about it.

143
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:15.650
They want them to pitch their price to you based on the analysis they've done of what you've written.

144
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.870
Right.

145
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.440
You don't want them to be to look at other people's bids and base it off of that.

146
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.620
That's the lazy way.

147
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.480
That's the inaccurate way.

148
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.080
Location privacy and other options.

149
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:30.740
This is you can set it as public you can allow Google to index it.

150
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:36.370
That's definitely something you want to do unless you think you have some IP protection issues so if

151
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.550
you're pitching something and you don't want to get out there maybe you don't want to check that.

152
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.520
But you can also prefer people from a certain location.

153
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.090
This actually in my experience doesn't work particularly well because.

154
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.260
So like for instance it says select a region OK.

155
00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:04.300
Like I said North America that is really imprecise North America also mind you includes Central America

156
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.230
Mexico.

157
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.150
It includes the Caribbean.

158
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.410
So maybe that's not something I want.

159
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.440
But of course I could have selected North America because I like the time zones but realistically I

160
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.810
selected North America because I want an American or Canadian.

161
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:23.200
That's why I really hate the way they do this because even if I say you know there's a lot of these

162
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.270
kind of loopholes too it seems so like Australia.

163
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.280
OCEANA.

164
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.380
I mean I want Australia right.

165
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.430
But that also brings up things like Papa New Guinea.

166
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:41.440
I think that also I might actually bring in like Indonesian bidders and people from like small islands

167
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.780
like now roo and things like that.

168
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.730
It's really kind of bizarre.

169
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.460
So I very rarely use that.

170
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.880
This is a problem with the plants.

171
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.970
You can do country.

172
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:55.810
But again this drives me nuts too because I want to say multiple countries and the other ones you can

173
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.410
do that.

174
00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.000
Nice answer kind of just screwed.

175
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.920
I mean you have to pick one country so you'd pick the United States.

176
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.360
This is cool because you can actually go down and drill down to the city and state if the case is that

177
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.460
you feel more comfortable working with someone in your own city or within driving distance.

178
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.760
That's something you can do.

179
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.040
And so you can sit with them sometimes and actually have face to face later we're going to talk about

180
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.380
graphic designers and how that can be very advantageous to have someone who works in your city and someone

181
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.850
who you can meet for coffee to go over designs with developers.

182
00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.720
That's not that's really not particularly the case.

183
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.650
Developers are not going to get as much from meeting them face to face.

184
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.150
And that's something that they're going to find quite annoying and it's going be kind of distracting

185
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.360
for them so I don't think you're going to get much out of it.

186
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.070
Typically when you meet with them it's kind of the idea that maybe they can showcase what they so far

187
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.780
with development it's just a case that if you meet them halfway through the project they can't show

188
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.160
you half your Web site.

189
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.710
That's just not how programming works.

190
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.480
Propose start date.

191
00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.780
You can do it immediately.

192
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.620
It launches right after you launch it just gives them a quick review period and where you can set a

193
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.880
date in the future.

194
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.790
Later in the course as an extra What I want to do is we're going to go through a live demo and I'm going

195
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:21.990
to make up a web application show you had a wireframe that show you how to disk write the project description

196
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.100
the project specifications post it and then select someone.

197
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.580
But right now we're just getting you used to Elance.

198
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:34.290
And at this point in the course you should just be familiar with it and kind of.

199
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.850
No I want to encourage you to actually go and play with these web sites so that you get more comfortable

200
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.320
with them.

201
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:49.390
The other thing is I want to point out with Elance would be one when you search you have two options.

202
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.900
You can search for jobs or freelancers.

203
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.510
You can also search for a portfolio samples but that's never really seems to work out particularly well.

204
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.160
So one benefit is that you can say freelancers.

205
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.750
So let's say you wanted to build an application I can borrow something from a project I did before.

206
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:14.500
Twilley So let's say I wanted to look for freelancers that are skilled in Twilio because again maybe

207
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.740
I have a very specific idea of what I want to build.

208
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.240
I don't want to post a job I would rather go after individual freelancers and try to recruit them that

209
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.610
way.

210
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.180
So I can say Tullio

211
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.160
excuse my computer.

212
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.410
OK.

213
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:36.080
So you could see people here that advertise themselves with Twilio Tulio.

214
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.980
And if they're advertising themselves saying that they're good at Twilio chances are that's one of the

215
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.780
things this subtitle page right here.

216
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.800
It's limited by characters.

217
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.880
So you actually surf.

218
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.910
They're putting it up there that means there that's one of their big things that they do.

219
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.100
And again you can drill down.

220
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.590
We could say zip code.

221
00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.390
OK.

222
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:05.620
Like I was saying you could look based on distance.

223
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:13.710
And so when I put a 9 4 1 0 9 that is the zip code for San Francisco and now I can see people who are

224
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:21.430
good at Twilio in my area to see who's a Twilio developer he's an expert Tullio developer.

225
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.720
This is California so he's about forty nine dollars an hour.

226
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.170
Sixty six seventy nine dollars an hour.

227
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.400
So if that's what you wanted to do you could do that.

228
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.560
L.A. is the place to do that if you want to look for an individual local freelancer.

229
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.580
I think it's a it's a good way of doing it but there are options available for you if you're trying

230
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.970
to do something really specific that helps.

231
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:48.810
I also suggest that when you post your job posting and you go ahead and search for freelancers any way

232
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.940
look for people who have very specific skills to what you're trying to build and you can individually

233
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.430
recruit them.

234
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.340
And the way that you do that is you would just say like hire me it's a button.

235
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:05.070
And what I'll do is it will prompt you to send them a message and invite them to your job posting and

236
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:11.760
that will help considerably because you post your job posting and it's a generic you know a Ph based

237
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.380
forum Web site.

238
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.200
It's only going to attract so many people because so many people there are only so many people who are

239
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.390
actively browsing.

240
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:26.280
But if you actually yourself go out and look for some people you want you can dramatically kind of increase

241
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.770
the participation in your job by individually going after people and saying I want to you know I want

242
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.880
to intrude.

243
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:41.280
I would invite people to my project and if you invite them directly the odds of them bidding are significantly

244
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.640
higher.

245
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:48.450
Probably 60 70 percent will end up actually providing a bid and then alternatively you can search for

246
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:49.240
jobs.

247
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.350
I like this because so let's try this again.

248
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.410
Say Twilley.

249
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.670
The reason why I would do this is and why this is helpful is because I can go and look at other people's

250
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.380
jobs.

251
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.620
And sometimes when I'm writing descriptions or running specifications I kind of get stuck.

252
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:10.140
I've written everything I can think of and I can think that could be on it but I would be curious to

253
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.680
see what other people are saying and so what you can do is you can search for other jobs.

254
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:19.740
I can look at say a mobile application that might include this and I can kind of search their listing

255
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:25.560
to see if there's any information around Twilio that might be useful or something they included I can

256
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.390
think of and that's.

257
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.760
This is where I've gotten a lot of my kind of a lot of the things that put it into my specifications

258
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:39.890
from because over time I've kind of just made a compounding list of things I need to remember to mention.

259
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.080
So here's an interesting that they listed out the Twilio SDK.

260
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:51.000
I'm not sure why you would want to do that but that's something that they out.

261
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:58.770
So maybe there is someone who does Twilio but they are not familiar with the with putting it on an application

262
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.530
for Android or iOS So you put it there.

263
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.870
That could be helpful.

264
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:10.450
So anyway that's a way that I've put together a really good specification sheet like master template.

265
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.540
I've just gone through and looked at other projects that are similar to what I'm posting.

266
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:20.270
I noticed that people are really good at it and so I just kind of borrowed some of the things that they

267
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.810
they have done Lasi manage.

268
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.810
This is kind of the section where you do things like payments.

269
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:34.380
You can also deal with files and you know transactions in your team I mentioned earlier oDesk is the

270
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.680
thing called Team view.

271
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.480
Elance has emerged with oDesk So they've actually added that.

272
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.530
So you can go to your team and you can add people to it.

273
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:50.130
Right now it's just me but I could add a new team member and what it will do is it'll ask me of all

274
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:55.230
the people in my projects who have I hired will show a list of them I can select someone add them to

275
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.860
my team.

276
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:04.650
What that allows me to do is it allows me to keep everyone kind of in one space but also I can ask them

277
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.340
to do time tracking.

278
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:13.530
That's something I've never used with Elance but it's actually a possibility if you want to do that.

279
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.280
That again is something that you might want to do if you're doing per hour because you make sure that

280
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:24.960
they are working for how long that they're saying that they're working with.

281
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.250
Do.
