00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,130
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,980
Welcome back to the chorus in a structure we're going to talk about how does creating a development

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,680
firm work if you're a programmer and how does it work if you're not a programmer.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,020
Hopefully this isn't redundant but I wanted to elaborate a little bit more on this so that you can kind

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,190
of understand how you should tackle this given what your skillset already is.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:23,540
OK.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,440
So if you are a programmer you have experience with programming perhaps you can freelance in the past.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,670
It's a lot simpler.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,180
So the best way of handling this is actually similar to the way that a non-programmer would.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,200
You're still going to focus on subcontracting out your projects.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,810
But the bigger question is what is you're going to be your participation in the projects that you do

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,210
actually claim and the projects you actually need a building.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,300
So previously you might have worked on projects or built projects for your own clients.

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,980
Now if you're going to turn this into it's your own business or turn it into a development firm you're

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,160
going to be able to take much larger projects on and then it's a question of how exactly are you going

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,570
to get those projects made.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,740
You're going to have to decide whether or not you're going to have to act as the lead developer on each

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,560
of your projects or whether or not you need to have some kind of a hybrid solution where you say you

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,130
work part time on each individual projects and the other time you're spent looking for projects or managing

20
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,360
the projects you already have.

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,250
Now the third option obviously is that you could not develop at all you could actually use this as a

22
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,070
way to transition out of being a developer.

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,070
And so you can actually transition more into a role of a project manager and a client manager.

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,960
You're obviously at a huge advantage because you're going to be able to understand the technology at

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,790
a much more granular level.

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,670
When something bad happens you'll probably understand the project well enough to coach the contractor

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,280
or coach the person you've hired into fixing it or what direction to go.

28
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,160
That's something that a non-programmer is not going to be able to do very well.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,440
So for you really the whole thing kind of works the same way.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,950
I think at the very beginning it's easier for you because you can build the projects you bring in if

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,420
you're not ready to some subcontract it out.

32
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,820
But it's going to be up to you over time how you position yourself in this business.

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,130
Are you going to build it yourself or are you going to give it entirely to someone else and oversee

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,520
it.

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,000
Or are you going to be a little bit of both.

36
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,480
It really just depends on how you see this if you really love programming and being in the trenches.

37
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,520
Maybe you want to build it out yourself and then hire people around you so that you can take on larger

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,890
projects or maybe you're sick of programming and you'd rather transition to a point where you're actually

39
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,230
managing the programming and you're spending more time looking for clients and managing clients.

40
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:43,510
OK.

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,900
So let's say you are not a programmer if you're not a programmer you're going to follow this pretty

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,240
much the way we laid it out pretty much the way that I started sprint.

43
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,540
You're just going to look for subcontractors that are good you're going to work with them and you're

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,020
going to give them test projects and test accounts to see how they perform.

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,490
It's very much a trial and error process.

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,750
Once you find someone who's good who's reasonable in price who can deliver on time you're simply going

47
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,870
to keep that person and add that into your expertise that you can offer.

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,710
On the other side to your clients now are non-programmer really are going to be limited to being a project

49
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,060
manager or being a client manager at the very beginning you're going to have to be both.

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,400
You're really going to have to manage the client manage your expectations give them their updates talk

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,060
to them regularly and also be able to coordinate with your contractors who are building the app.

52
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,690
The application that you're being paid to built.

53
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,200
It's a little bit harder.

54
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,210
When I say a little it's like only a slightly bit harder as a non-programmer mainly because at the very

55
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:51,240
beginning you might feel like there's not enough people to do all of the work that's necessary you might

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,010
feel a little bit stretched as you're looking for clients and looking for subcontractors at the same

57
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,510
time.

58
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,250
A programmer can look for clients first build whatever it is that they actually land and then once the

59
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,620
demand exceeds what they can actually supply themselves then start hiring out and start multiplying

60
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,190
themselves.

61
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,770
So most of the lectures in this course are going to be relevant to both of you.

62
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,570
One of you has a bigger advantage in the other but the entire course covers both scenarios.

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,380
Programmers you're going to take the skill you already know and you're going to multiply it.

64
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,340
You're going to make it so you can take much bigger projects make a lot more money.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,050
And if you want to transition out of being a programmer now if you're not a programmer Well you're going

66
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,220
to focus more on being a project manager or client manager.

67
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,660
And as you get more clients and as you get more picky and as you raise your prices you're going to transition

68
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,060
into whatever role you prefer to be whether or not that's just the CEO the president or the project

69
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,620
manager or in a lot of cases sometimes people actually work all the way down and they learn to program

70
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,210
this way.

71
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,620
So it's really up to you.

72
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,310
Make sure that you follow pretty much all of the advice in the course that's going to make sure that

73
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,350
you don't run into the problems that we ran into when we started.

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,110
And also give you a lot of advice on how you can make sure that you're making money how you can make

75
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,980
sure that you're bringing in a steady stream of clients and make sure that you're running this entire

76
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,000
operation smoothly.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,270
All right.

78
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:19,140
See you in the next lecture.
