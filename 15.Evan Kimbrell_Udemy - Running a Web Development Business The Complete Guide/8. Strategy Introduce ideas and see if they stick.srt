1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:11,640
You a max of the course in this lecture we're going to cover another strategy that can consistently

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,510
increase your project sizes.

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,870
And so it can dramatically increase the customer lifetime value of each client that you get.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,940
Now obviously there's multiple ways of going about growing your business.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,980
One is to have the same client base but work on having more valuable projects with them.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,250
Another is to focus on creating an engine that creates more clients and obviously you know one other

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,910
strategy might be just focusing on retention so you don't need a lot of outreach.

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,010
But everyone you get you keep for a long period of time.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,430
Those are all legitimate ways of growing your development business.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,250
Now if you are interested in increasing the lifetime value of your clients or increasing the value of

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,680
each individual project and that's something you want to pursue a really good strategy is something

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,700
that works for us.

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,920
We call it constant estimation.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,550
Now what do I mean by that.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,830
Typically when you have a project you're only going to be doing estimation up at the very beginning

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,080
of the project right up front you give them you know the big estimate.

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,810
And if you listen to the other lecture about ballpark estimates maybe you give them two estimates.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,630
After that a lot of people just think oh we're done with estimations.

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,350
Well if you're a successful freelancer in any other type of business you probably know that you relied

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,420
a lot on selling your graphic designer designers upswell all the time will always offer you to design

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,110
something else at a discounted rate.

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,640
Always bundling things together to save you money.

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,570
It's very very common.

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,500
Now the most effective way of upselling that we've found in our experience is the technique that we

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,900
call constant estimation.

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,670
Well at Sprint we actually work and what's an agile development methodology what that kind of means

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,690
is that we deliver chunks of work at a time.

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,090
Some people deliver the whole thing all at once.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,900
Some people deliver bits and pieces and they all add up to the project total.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,510
So for us every time we send out an email with a large update of what we've published and what's now

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,350
Dymo Bill what we typically will do is just for every single sprint.

32
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,740
And if you're not familiar with the sprint as that is what a chunk of work is we would actually include

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,630
extra estimations now when we're building out an application.

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,730
Constantly we noticed that there are other features that the client has foregone or there's other possible

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:27,330
things that could be done or there's a lot of times where extra layers of security or technology could

36
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,910
be added but maybe they're a little bit frivolous.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,280
A lot of times when you have a client and they're trying to figure out what to put in their application

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,230
and what not to or their website they have to prioritize what's most important.

39
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:47,190
But the problem is is that when they prioritize they don't actually know how long each individual section

40
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,490
will take to get built.

41
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,610
And therefore they don't know the actual cost associated with it.

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,330
So they might be thinking that this feature is going to be huge and so therefore it's not worth it but

43
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,310
it might actually be the case that features are not particularly difficult.

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,040
So they should read prioritize.

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,520
So with constant estimation what we do is we constantly look at extra things they do and we shoot to

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,570
include estimations just as an afterthought.

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,880
At the end of every single sprint.

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,020
So the universe spreads will say you know this is what we've built.

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,600
This is what it does.

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,160
These are the things that are about to be done and hey by the way here are three extra things that we

51
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,460
think could help.

52
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,740
And how many hours they're going to take now.

53
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,410
We're not pushy about it.

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,860
Obviously you can build some sales techniques around this.

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,830
We just pump that out there to make them understand what are your options.

56
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,440
Right.

57
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,820
Because as a non-technical client they just have no idea what it's going to take to put in.

58
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,640
So if we give them the information they can do a much better job at planning their product roadmap.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,290
But also in a lot of cases they'll start adding in more and more features as they now know this.

60
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,390
This feature is actually quite small.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,000
Or they can find out this features you know maybe not even think about it it'll be next month.

62
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:10,260
So when you have clients get in the routine of building constant estimation CAUSLEY estimate additional

63
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,860
things try not to be annoying about it.

64
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,130
Obviously you try to listen to your client in that only pick things that they have mentioned that they

65
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,360
are curious about or things that you've seen be used in similar applications I've ever asked you could

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,740
just say you know these are things that we've seen that other people use.

67
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,090
And it really doesn't take us very long to estimate it out.

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,010
So we just kind of included it from a product management standpoint that's very much a good thing.

69
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,720
That's sort of a good product manager would do.

70
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,420
They'd constantly be aware of what else could be included in the product and how long and how expensive

71
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,480
it be and it would be up to them to make everybody else aware of it.

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,610
So if you get into that habit you can consistently grow your projects and you can consistently make

73
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,160
your clients more valuable.

74
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,570
OK guys if you have any questions about constant estimation Postum scutcheon any other questions you

75
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,850
just message me the x factor.
