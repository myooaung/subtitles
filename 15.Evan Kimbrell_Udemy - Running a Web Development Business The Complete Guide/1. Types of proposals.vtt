00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.440
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture and in the section we're going to talk about

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.800
proposals now proposals are crucial to any development business that you run.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.470
It's really just the process by which you give a proposal you propose a certain amount of work to a

4
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.760
potential client.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.810
They are going to view that and either approve or deny or try to get an adjustment on whatever you've

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.610
proposed to them.

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.250
Now typically the way that this works is that when you first meet a potential new client you're probably

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.740
going to go over their idea over whatever it is that you're trying to build and you're probably going

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.550
to start off very vague.

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.800
The problem to talk in broad strokes they'll probably describe what they're doing in very generic terms

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.220
and then over time after you've done some back and forth back and forth maybe met their partners or

12
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.680
met other people that are involved in the project and after you've gone over more and more details and

13
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.180
hammered out really exactly what it is that they're trying to build and when they're trying to get it

14
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.040
done you will give them some form of a proposal.

15
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.950
Now it's very rare that you'll ever get to a situation where you don't give them a proposal and I'm

16
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.770
going to show you here in a second that there are different types of proposals and even in the least

17
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.910
formal most casual type of situation you will most likely end up giving them some form of a proposal

18
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.980
and it's something that I strongly suggest you pay attention to and strongly suggest that it's something

19
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.800
that you do so that you have your bases covered should any problem arise in the future.

20
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.090
So how important are proposals.

21
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.470
Well they're quite important in a lot of situations.

22
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.320
You can make or break a project and a lot of situations will be working with clients who are shopping

23
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.450
around through lots of different vendors.

24
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.970
And so this is kind of your final opportunity to make an impression on them and show them that you understand

25
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.400
their project the best and you can show them that you are proposing the best possible solution.

26
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.190
Now keep in mind proposals are meant to be shared and they're formatted in a way that can easily be

27
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.710
shown to other decision makers that are related to the client or in the client's organization.

28
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.380
So with that in mind it is important that you spend a little bit of time working on your proposal and

29
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.330
making sure that you follow some basic tenets so in this lecture we're just going to talk about the

30
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.800
types of proposals I'm going to introduce you to the three main types.

31
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.900
Show you some examples and just kind of graze over it a little bit so you can kind of get an idea of

32
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.360
when you should use which which type and what is each type good for.

33
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.920
OK so the first type is called a casual proposal.

34
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.680
So a casual proposal is pretty much exactly what you think it is a casual is kind of an off the cuff

35
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.820
proposal.

36
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.220
It's something that probably doesn't bring in a lot of outside material or a lot of outside documentation.

37
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.870
It's probably something that you did in a very quick manner.

38
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.770
The estimate you give is probably not very detailed and it's probably something that you do with projects

39
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.410
that are very very small.

40
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.660
Now I'll show you an example.

41
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.070
Ok so I just pulled this up and as you can see this is on our old letterhead but this will be an example

42
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.870
of a casual proposal and honestly this proposal might even be more complex than your typical proposal.

43
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.310
But in this situation what ended up happening was we had someone who was a prospective client ask us

44
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.650
a question about a potential idea.

45
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.890
And in this situation we gave them really what's called a casual proposal and in a casual proposal it's

46
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.580
typically when you respond just in email you give them some form of estimation but it's probably going

47
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.530
to be in a range.

48
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.730
And then you give a modest amount of information.

49
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.540
Now the proposal could be anywhere from one paragraph to three or four paragraphs.

50
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.530
The main point here is that this is just something that you kind of do on the fly.

51
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.620
There's no real presentation value to it.

52
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.320
The only thing you're really going to do is separate out the lines that you can see over here so they

53
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.730
can read it more easily and maybe bolding or something of that sort.

54
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.860
But you're not putting this into a fancy PTF you're not putting this into a template with a cover page

55
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.680
you're not even going to upload this onto a proposal site and send that to him.

56
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.630
It's something very very casual very simple.

57
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.700
Typically you'll be answering their questions give them a very quick rundown of what exactly you think

58
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.380
you would take and then give them a general idea of what you think the estimate should be.

59
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:37.160
And as you can see here we gave this person an estimate in ours and we did it in three different ways.

60
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.700
So they had asked to build an application a specific language so we gave them that.

61
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.570
Then they asked to do it in a different language.

62
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.930
We gave them that and they asked us about additional hours and additional estimate to make it tablet

63
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.820
and mobile compatible so we added that down here.

64
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.540
This is very very casual.

65
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.770
This is not very formal at all.

66
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.940
I signed off very casually I didn't ask for a signature and asked for a phone call.

67
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.800
It's just something for the reference.

68
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.850
OK so why would you use this.

69
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.970
Well typically the reason why you would give a casual estimation is generally in the case that you have

70
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.080
a request for proposal and it is not of a large enough size that you want to spend a lot of time on

71
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.450
it.

72
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.720
So that's one important point.

73
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.730
Very small projects typically are going to need casual proposals.

74
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.720
Now a lot of people ask if someone gives me a small potential project especially at the beginning because

75
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.030
I might be starved for projects is it OK to give a formal estimate or something more complex.

76
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.160
Yes it is OK.

77
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.460
But you need to keep in mind that you might actually seem a little out of touch or a little out of tone.

78
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:50.750
If someone asked for a $200 application get belt and you responded with an eight page PTF.

79
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.820
That's something you need to keep in mind.

80
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.770
A lot of the people that you work with a know or have worked with contractors before.

81
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.870
So you need to make sure that your tone kind of matches what exactly it is that you're building.

82
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.010
Now another thing to keep in mind with all casual proposals can be strategic.

83
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.000
Now what do I mean by that.

84
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.520
A lot of times and you give a casual proposal what you're doing is you're kind of showing the client

85
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.030
that hey this is not a very big project.

86
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.210
It's not a big deal.

87
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.420
Let me show you how easy it is.

88
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.100
What you're trying to do is essentially remove friction between them and starting the project.

89
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.370
And the way you do that is by not good letting them perceive the project as huge not perceiving it as

90
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.260
something that requires a lot of paperwork or has to go through a lot of things before they start.

91
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.000
The more things your client has to do before they actually start development means that they're taking

92
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.990
it more seriously.

93
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.030
But it also gives them more and more opportunities to realize how much money they're about to spend

94
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.620
and realize that maybe they want to work with a different vendor or maybe they want to change it or

95
00:06:52.620 --> 00:07:00.180
maybe they want to show the project so you can use casual estimation as a way to kind of remove friction.

96
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:06.030
You can also use it as a way of introducing yourself to a client and saying you know this is the estimation

97
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.750
for your application if you want to go bigger or you want a really a more in-depth and complex estimation

98
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.220
you know show interest and we can re format it for you.

99
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.920
OK so keep in mind casual is what you're going to be doing a lot.

100
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.250
These are kind of off the cuff.

101
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.010
Typically they're going to be for people that you think their project is small or people that you're

102
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.760
trying to kind of ease into starting their project.

103
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.360
It also could be the case that you give a casual estimation to someone that you've worked with before.

104
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.870
So keep that in mind if you've worked with someone before.

105
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:47.300
It might not be worth it to give them a fancy complex flowery templated proposal that might be unnecessary.

106
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.600
They already know you that you like what you do and they probably don't need to be convinced of it already.

107
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:58.130
OK so the second one to get a cover is call a semi-formal and this is something that we use pretty much

108
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.970
all the time.

109
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.730
This is actually the farthest we go and I'll explain to you in a bit why we do that.

110
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.390
But the difference in semi-formal and casual is that when you give an estimation and you'll probably

111
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:14.390
give an estimation in their email but attached to that you give an in depth estimation.

112
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.460
Now the difference is is that in the e-mail you're simply changing the e-mail like your cover letter

113
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.600
and the e-mail you're going to answer any of their questions.

114
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.020
You're going to detail out what you think about their proposal.

115
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.590
You're going to detail out the things like the timeline the total hours and you're going to detail out

116
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.800
now attached to the e-mail then you can give an estimation where it actually goes into the technical

117
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.690
it actually goes into the granular detail of what exactly is going to be built.

118
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.740
How much is it going to cost and when is it going to get done.

119
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.970
So I'll give you an example.

120
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.540
OK so here are two back to back Typically as you can see in the semi-formal spend a little bit more

121
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:59.260
time with more information gave long explanations gave a lot more information about their project.

122
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:05.840
And a lot of times gave my personal remarks personal thoughts about the project now and a casual proposal

123
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.600
for someone I've never worked with before with a small project.

124
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.610
I'm not going spend a ton of time thinking about their project ways that it's going to be successful

125
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.820
or ways that it can be successful or my thoughts about how it's going to fare in the more general ecosystem.

126
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.800
All of that's kind of unnecessary and he spent too much time on casual proposals you can kind of get

127
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.390
turned into a swamp.

128
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:32.180
So in this situation yeah I just gave him more information here I asked for clarification on this estimate

129
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.750
and then the bulk of the estimate was actually explaining how we do our development explaining agile

130
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.130
and then explaining some of the other issues that arise things like graphic design things like what

131
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:49.520
it's going to take to put this in tablet or make it tablet compatible or make it wet or mobile compatible

132
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.190
then attached to it.

133
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:58.480
You can see that we just gave actual estimates that are in detail and so this is would be an estimate.

134
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.300
Now this estimate by itself is just talking about the work that's required.

135
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.410
It talks about the hours it talks.

136
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.920
It just gives Common's it's nothing way to fancy but it is very very specific.

137
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:16.640
So semi-formal as you can see very casual in a sense but it's formal in a sense and that's why I call

138
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:23.180
it semi-formal it's formal because you spent time thinking about their application and it's formal in

139
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:28.280
the sense that you actually spent time making a comprehensive estimate and sending that to them and

140
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.370
showing them on a granular level what cost what takes what time.

141
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.960
But the casual side of it is that it's all done through an e-mail right here sending it to them directly

142
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.730
to their e-mail.

143
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.120
It's not mailed to them.

144
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.280
It's not in a PowerPoint presentation.

145
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.570
OK.

146
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.470
So now I'm going to give you a quick introduction to the last one.

147
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:46.880
OK.

148
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.820
So the last type of proposal is a complex formal.

149
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.360
Now this is something that we don't actually do ourselves and we'll talk about this in a separate lecture

150
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.700
why we pick the type of proposals that we do.

151
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.220
Now you've probably when you think of proposals you probably think of these complex formal typically

152
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.130
what these are are these are for large projects.

153
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:13.010
These are more often for projects that require multiple people to buy into the project.

154
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.360
Now what do I mean by that if you're talking to your client that's one person typically when you give

155
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.950
a formal estimate you're going be assuming that they're not the only person who has say yes before you

156
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.140
start the project.

157
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.370
It could be them plus their partner.

158
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.930
It could be them plus their project team could be them plus their boss.

159
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.380
So if that's the case you might want to give them something that's fancy or something they can show

160
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.210
off and something that they can feel better about presenting to other people.

161
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.170
Now a formal estimate and the reason why I call it complex slash form is because it's it is formal in

162
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.290
that it's going to use a template.

163
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:49.670
It's a cover page but it's also complex and that it needs the most level of detail you possibly can.

164
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:54.530
Now the times you would use a formal complex again would be if you thought the project was large enough

165
00:11:54.530 --> 00:12:02.330
to warrant making such an end time investment writing a formal investment can take a serious chunk of

166
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:02.840
time.

167
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.830
I've done them before.

168
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.550
It took half a day to put together.

169
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.270
That's a lot of time that you could've been spending on something else so it's only usually used in

170
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:16.790
a situation where the projects either are very large or it's a project that's medium sized that you

171
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.970
are confident you can close.

172
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.180
Now I'll give you an example.

173
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:26.260
OK so here's a great example of a complex estimation.

174
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.240
Now in this example actually brought up one of the digital firms that we had previously gone over when

175
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.520
we talked about other studios and the web presences that they choose and the messaging that they choose

176
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.830
to represent themselves.

177
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.310
So this firm is called Octa and this is actually an old estimate that I have the privilege of sharing.

178
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.300
But what you can see here is it something that they spent a lot of time into.

179
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.740
You can also notice that it's going to be branded.

180
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.040
And you'll notice that it has lots and lots of pages to it.

181
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.340
And in this case we have 10 pages.

182
00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.790
So this is something that you'd expect with a complex formal multiple pages separated as a PDA probably

183
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:07.870
has graphic design involved probably has lots of supporting and lots of auxillary information attached

184
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:08.720
to it.

185
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:15.940
So as you can see here when we jump right in we even have pages that have absolutely nothing to do with

186
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:21.970
what the application was asking for has nothing to do with the scope of what we were getting a proposal

187
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:28.480
for what it is it's quite literally an introduction from the CEO and then an introduction to what the

188
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.480
firm does.

189
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:34.570
And then as we move down farther we get a little bit more specific as to what exactly it's going to

190
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.400
be doing and we start working with Timeline and more and more details and then we can talk about budgets

191
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:45.820
and then the very end we have attachments where we do things like reference's contact and core team.

192
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.850
Now keep in mind all complex formal proposals are different.

193
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:56.230
We're going to go over in one of the next elector's how exactly you can put together one of these proposals

194
00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.400
do it cheaply do it easily and without a ton of headaches but you can do it whatever way you want.

195
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.900
There's a lot of customization.

196
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.620
There's a lot of different ways you can do it.

197
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.070
There's a lot of unnecessary fluff involved in the process.

198
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.290
You're more than welcome to cut that out as you see fit.

199
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.870
OK guys so now you should be familiar with how proposals generally work.

200
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.010
There are some other exceptions out there but generally they're going to fall into these three buckets.

201
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.900
These are the three that I suggest you focus on.

202
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:30.490
I suggest you familiarize yourself just a little bit before you jump into the client relationship game

203
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.800
when you do start meeting with clients that will start asking for proposals so you need to be prepared

204
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.780
with what you're going to show them what information you're going to include and which of these three

205
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.910
do you think is appropriate and which of these three do you think fits what you're trying to sell the

206
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.370
best.

207
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:46.820
OK.

208
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:53.030
So in the next lecture we're going to just go over really quickly the type of estimation that we use.

209
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.850
I'm going to show you one of our other proposals and talk a little bit more in-depth about why we chose

210
00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:02.360
that style why it's important and why we think you should do the same.

211
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.430
All right in the next picture.
