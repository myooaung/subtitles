00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,190
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about planning for the grind.

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,360
Now what do I mean by the grind.

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,570
The grind is that when you first start out your business there's going to be this period of time where

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,780
you are not bringing in any business or not a lot of business and are going to be trying a lot of different

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,440
things that simply do not work.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,300
Unfortunately every business you ever start is going to have this problem.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,450
If you aren't coming from this with an already successful development business and you're looking to

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,080
expand this you're probably going be starting from scratch.

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,080
And if you're starting from scratch you're going to have to figure out what works and what does not

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,380
work.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,300
Now that applies to what you build.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,450
And it also applies to what clientele you're good with and what are good ways of finding new clients.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,590
So the very beginning you're really going to be working out a lot of different kinks and you're failing

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,110
more often than you succeed.

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,940
Now that sounds scary but anybody who has built a business before knows that this is just it's kind

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,020
of the way that it works.

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,280
Every business has trouble at first then you'll find things that work and then you take those things

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,690
that work and you do them a lot more you scale them up and that's how you grow.

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:23,730
Now in this course we cover all of the strategies that we use to grow in all of the tips and tricks

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,790
that we use to keep customers happy and to keep them coming back also had a very intense focus on your

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,370
fundamentals focus on the fundamental metrics that make you a good business and make you appealing to

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,320
new clients as well as clients that are thinking about bringing back work to you.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,300
But everything we teach you in this course it's not guaranteed to work if I teach you 10 strategies

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,360
for you specifically maybe six out of the 10 work the strategies are going to teach you applied for

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,600
us.

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,800
And for every you know five strategy I give you that worked for us.

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,290
We tried probably 10 other things that did not.

28
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,880
So it really depends on your Nishi depends what you're trying to build and it depends really who you're

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,080
trying to go after.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,510
So keep in mind it's just finding that right combination.

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,360
Finding out the best way of finding clients and then finding out the best way of finding the best clients

32
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,540
and then just figuring out how you can do that repeatedly until you have a very solid stream of business

33
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,200
coming in.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,780
The biggest set of advice that I can give to you to get through this period is well obviously one prepare

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,500
for it know that it's coming.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,870
No that this period is going to happen so that when you start this business you don't just get into

37
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,240
it and think what's happening nothing's working.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,660
You should know that this period is going to happen.

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,500
And the second thing I can give you advice on is do things that do not scale.

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,140
Now what do I mean by that.

41
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:48,090
This is actually a word of advice for startups from a very popular kind of luminary in Silicon Valley

42
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,380
named Paul Graham.

43
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:55,190
He suggests that for early start ups but it also applies to early development businesses as well.

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,580
So for you those of you who don't know what scale means scale just means grow and the reason why it

45
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:06,540
says scale is because what it's suggesting is that you scale exponentially so give you an example maybe

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,420
run an advertisement and I spend $100 and that hundred dollars gets me 200 dollars.

47
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,120
Well if I then decided to spend a thousand dollars I'm scaling.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,180
Notice how it went from $100 to a thousand dollars.

49
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,300
That applies to any business activity that applies any technique you use to find clients any production

50
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,160
technique you used to produce.

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,900
It's just that when you grow you are scaling so any time you take an effort and try to do more of it.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,370
That's called scaling.

53
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,600
So now what do I mean by things that do not scale.

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:43,920
That means that let's say in that case where I said $100 for this advertisement if you're using a Facebook

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,810
ad that does scale because all I have to do is type in 1000 as opposed to 100.

56
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,840
There is no incremental amount of work that I take on because I've now advertised more.

57
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,740
Now let's imagine that my advertisement time is actually a physical sign that I had to make because

58
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm only one person and I want to build a sign.

59
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,880
Now if I want to build two signs I have to put in twice the amount of effort they want to do 10 signs

60
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,040
I have to put in ten times as much effort.

61
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,110
And the reason why it doesn't scale is not only are there no time savings as you do more of it.

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:20,070
It also means that I'm only one person so I couldn't realistically say I'm going to build 10000 signs

63
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,920
that just simply does not scale.

64
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,400
It's not something that I can do repeatedly for ever even eventually you get to a point where you don't

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,540
even know where you can put that many signs.

66
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,330
So now that you know it's scaling means.

67
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,370
Now I can explain a little bit better what do things that don't scale means basically means when you

68
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,950
start trying to think of a couple strategies you want to use to find clients or find subcontractors

69
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,330
or improve the quality of your applications.

70
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,210
Think of a couple maybe two three four or five something like that.

71
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:56,470
Now when you do them try to do each individual one of them as cheaply as possible and you do it manually.

72
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,470
Now you're doing it manually allows you to monitor costs but also not spend any money in the case that

73
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,580
it doesn't work out.

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,230
So to give you an example let's say we go back to before we're saying let's create a Facebook.

75
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,250
Let's say one of our strategies was that we're going to run Facebook ads to look for a certain type

76
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,830
of client if we run a Facebook Ad.

77
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,270
Now you have two options.

78
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,350
You design the campaign you run it you monitor it or you hire someone to do that for you.

79
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,640
Now the best way of getting through the grind would be to not hire someone to do that for you.

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,860
That's going to spend an unnecessary amount of money and energy and the likelihood that that campaign

81
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,970
is going to work out is always pretty small.

82
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,120
Again it's going to take many tries before you find something that works.

83
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,420
And if you hired someone you didn't up having to fire that person and you just wasted a lot of money

84
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,350
and time.

85
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,470
But if you did it yourself you can do all of the initial work to figure out whether or not it works

86
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,860
and if it doesn't work out it's not a huge loss because you're the founder.

87
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,520
Your time is not nearly as expensive.

88
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,410
I'll give you an example here.

89
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:09,680
Sprint kick one of our strategies for finding new clients was to use a popular portfolio Web site online

90
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,120
and to use a growth hacking technique.

91
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,120
So there's a popular portfolio site online.

92
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,030
We'll talk about later in depth right now.

93
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,930
You're actually going to tell you the name of it was what they did is they created this free service

94
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,240
for graphic designers to display their portfolios.

95
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,400
Well one of our strategies was to go after graphic designers and offer our services to them because

96
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,770
they themselves have clients and they can make a lot of money by adding development services to their

97
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,970
product offerings.

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,450
OK so what we didn't end up doing was looking at the pages that were being offered and we found out

99
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:47,000
that every single page had the same snippet of code over and over and over again and each individual

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,550
page.

101
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,330
So at that point in time we had two options.

102
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:56,690
One option that didn't scale and one option that did scale the option that did not scale was me myself

103
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:04,430
looking through manually through Google using search terms and hard requirements in my search to find

104
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,940
a large group of people that threw that way and then to contact them.

105
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,250
Now the scale option would have been to build out a program that could run through Google rapidly collect

106
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,260
all the information and contact them.

107
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,450
Option one would have taken me two hours.

108
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:28,430
Option 2 would have cost us several thousands of dollars and probably you know 20 30 40 hours of time

109
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,890
management and development tweaking.

110
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:37,730
So now if I pick the second option I would have wasted a lot of money because that technique could have

111
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:43,100
ended up being a very poor choice but because I chose to just take a couple hours to test it out to

112
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,330
see if this actually works.

113
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:44,860
Period.

114
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,520
Even at a small rate I was able to figure out yes or no whether or not it's worth it.

115
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,400
Then you can focus on scaling five scaled first could have potentially wasted a ton of money.

116
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,670
So when you're doing activities that don't scale you're probably going to be thinking to yourself Man

117
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,230
if this blew up and all of a sudden I had thousands of these I'd be swamped.

118
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,300
I couldn't do this.

119
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,990
And that's completely rational because right now and during the grind we're going to focus on doing

120
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,310
things like that.

121
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,500
There's a concept in startups called a concierge service and essentially what that means is a lot of

122
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,610
applications when they first start off they're trying to validate whether or not they're ideas popular

123
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,370
and what people pay for it.

124
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,360
So a lot of times it ends up happening is they'll simulate what an application does but in reality the

125
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,050
founders are doing the work on the back end themselves manually.

126
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,180
That does not scale but it saves them an enormous amount of time effort and money upfront just to figure

127
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,140
out whether or not their technique is good and their product is going to be popular.

128
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,990
So keep that in mind up front to get through the grind.

129
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,620
Try not to burn a lot of money and time and try not to scale your efforts till you have something you

130
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,020
absolutely know is going to work.

131
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,860
The other thing is just have patience.

132
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,070
You're going to have to try multiple techniques before something works really well for you.

133
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:06,800
With us it probably was six seven different things were for one kind of worked and we used that to get

134
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,900
our first batch of clients and then we kept testing new ones until we got a couple more traction channels

135
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,620
that we used to then get more and more clients.

136
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,930
OK.

137
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,000
So plan for the grind.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,550
It always happens when you start a new business but especially with a client base business like this

139
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,250
it's very much like a snowball process you start off small and you slowly grow and eventually get to

140
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,210
a point where you have so much momentum that everything gets a lot better.

141
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,560
But at first it appears as if it's unnecessarily difficult.

142
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,320
So be aware of that.

143
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,940
And second of all try to minimize your cost and your time investments by doing things that do not scale.

144
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,770
Don't burn out very quickly just because you found something you think works.

145
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,620
Make sure you know that it works before you do that.

146
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,260
Another example of doing this would be like if someone gave you some business and I asked if you can

147
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,780
do an additional work task for them.

148
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,820
That task might be something that's not in your product or it might be a technology you don't coverage

149
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,890
or maybe a platform you don't like to use at the beginning.

150
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,500
You might want to say yes because again that does not scale.

151
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,490
You're saying yes just to take on new business taking on new business will get your portfolio.

152
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,100
It'll get you a better client relationship and it will help you understand whether or not this is something

153
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,540
you want to offer in the future.

154
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,850
So at the beginning you say yes later on you say no.

155
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,180
That's a very important distinction.

156
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,210
Be aware that this is typically the way that development firms work.

157
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,060
OK if you guys have any other questions posed in the group discussion we're going to keep moving on

158
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,960
with the getting started section or we kind of go over a more theory more planning more.

159
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,480
Getting your head around how all this works and the world that you're going to be operating in next

160
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,730
section though we're going to start getting into actually creating a presence showing you how you can

161
00:10:52,730 --> 00:11:05,560
create something that looks professional online or see the next lecture.
