00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,760
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,960
So in this lecture we're going to talk about what are the biggest factors in whether or not you have

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,200
positive client relationships and whether or not you can run into a problem in the middle of your project.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,170
Now one of the biggest things that I've experienced and I've figured out through the last four years

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,100
is that the way to you talk to your client is really important.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,150
Now that's kind of obvious right.

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,400
You don't want to be rude and you don't want to be you know flirtatious or anything like that.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,770
But one of the things I found out that is probably the most important is confidence.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,560
Now what do I mean by that.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,930
Well people who are your clients are typically one of two things.

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,060
Usually they're small business owners or entrepreneurs and on the other side they're probably account

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,470
managers or some type of a decision maker at a larger company.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,950
In all of those cases those people are taking on a lot of risk by hiring you to make their project.

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,270
An entrepreneur is probably risking a lot of their own money.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,690
So the same story goes for a small business owner now even an account manager at a company that could

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,730
be their job on the line.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,700
And they're kind of gambling with someone else's chips.

18
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,680
So the point is that they are kind of anxious about the relationship.

19
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,490
They have a lot on the line.

20
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,910
And for you you don't typically have a ton on the line.

21
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,820
I mean in the worst case scenario you might lose some wages.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,640
So the most important thing that they want is to feel as if they're in the right hands.

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,330
Now the best way of doing that is by being consistently confident whenever you originally speak to them.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,440
Be confident in the estimate you're giving them.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,530
Obviously I'm not saying don't hedge your bets and say this could change but you just say that this

26
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,700
is what our estimation will be.

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,920
This is where we expect variation.

28
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:00,930
And that is that don't ever try to insert unnecessary questions or question marks what you generally

29
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,720
want to try to avoid is appearing wishy washy and in any way they want to know that you are the authority

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,150
figure.

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,820
You know what you're doing.

32
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:16,020
And even if it's this is completely unrealistic they want you to always feel like you know everything

33
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,980
in a weird way it's almost kind of like a parent child relationship.

34
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,320
They just gave you a lot of money and you could potentially ruin their week.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,900
So it's really up to you to constantly keep them feeling assured.

36
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,360
Now what happens when a problem happens and this happens all the time.

37
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,990
A problem could be a miscommunication a problem could be a scheduling issue.

38
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:47,450
And most likely that a problem could be is a bug or something in your development time line gets delayed.

39
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,460
Now a normal way of responding to that outside of the development business would be to explain what's

40
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,490
happening.

41
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,850
Apologize and probably just tell them every single thing that's wrong and leave that open ended.

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,320
Now that's a reasonable way of explaining what's happening if you're just talking to someone and not

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,930
in a professional relationship.

44
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,870
The problem with that is the open ended this at the very end.

45
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,560
So how would you be confident in a situation like that if you have a problem.

46
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:19,320
You let them know it's a problem and then let them know how big you think of a problem it is and then

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,680
tell them this is how long it'll take before it's fixed.

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,580
Now if you don't necessarily know how long it's going to take to get fixed.

49
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,310
Give them a definitive answer as to when you will know it's going to get fixed right.

50
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
So it's like a timeline for a timeline.

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,970
The point is that there's a lot of ambiguity when it comes to projects something that could be wrong

52
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,140
when it's going to get fixed.

53
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:48,060
But you can always focus your communication and reword your communication in a way that is always definitive

54
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,650
even if you don't know if there's a scenario where you don't know something.

55
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,060
You're always something that you do know.

56
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,790
So focus on the thing that you do.

57
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,560
Never ever say in a project that here's a problem and it cannot be fixed.

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,230
There's too many times in my experience where we've run into problems that even after three days of

59
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,560
looking at it we have no idea if this can be fixed.

60
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,000
What would be poison is if we told them we don't know if it's going to be fixed.

61
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,570
That is the worst thing your client can possibly hear.

62
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,700
Remember they trusted you.

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,320
They gave you a lot of money and you could potentially take all of that and nullify it.

64
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,390
So never tell them that you don't know if it can be fixed.

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,910
Always say it can be and give them a timeline on when it can be fixed.

66
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,830
If you have no idea how long it's going to take you just tell them that it's a big time line before

67
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,590
you can even get back to them with a timeline and getting it fixed.

68
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,890
Now one thing that can help you if you do run into a really really big snag and you're kind of at a

69
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,940
loss for how you can reassure them.

70
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,180
One thing you can do is combat this with specificity.

71
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,620
So what I mean by that is you have an the issue tell them exactly to the T what the issue is.

72
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Show them why it's hard and eventually they'll empathize with you and they'll say yes this is actually

73
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,820
quite difficult.

74
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,770
Explain to them why it's a difficult technical problem explain to them how experienced the person is

75
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,190
looking at it and they've never seen this before.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,080
Explain to them that it's a problem with the platform you used or it's a problem with this certain technology.

77
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,520
Something that's almost so big that it can't possibly be your fault.

78
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,140
But most of all be confident when you say that it's a hard issue if they believe you can keep trust

79
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,190
with them and then they're going to believe you when you say it can be fixed.

80
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,440
That's the most important thing.

81
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,250
I always start I like to think of it like you know you are the North Star to your client.

82
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,780
You always have to know what you're doing and where you're going.

83
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,390
There always has to be a plan on the table even if you have no idea what you're going to do.

84
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:59,550
You'll find out very quickly that by using language correctly by always appearing confident they'll

85
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,980
trust you and you can essentially buy yourself enough time before you have enough information to correctly

86
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,940
answer their questions in development.

87
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
It's always just a matter of time.

88
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,340
No problem can't be solved in some way.

89
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,480
And if it is the case then you should have seen that way before.

90
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,990
Now how does apply to other interactions that your client would never call and ask you a question and

91
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,590
you just have no idea what the answer is instead of saying I just don't know.

92
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,140
Say hey I don't actually know but here's a timeline for how long it's going to take for me to figure

93
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,560
it out.

94
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,250
It's really easy.

95
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,300
You can just say I don't know this but I know that I can figure it out.

96
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,840
That's always better if they know it's something that you're not aware of.

97
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,740
But the difficulty of that question is not so ridiculous you could never answer it.

98
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,420
They'll usually just kind of let you have that one.

99
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,820
They always want to know that you could answer any question and at minimum give them a timeline or a

100
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,760
rough idea of when you can figure it out and give it to them.

101
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,900
Now this is something that helps with experience.

102
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,430
You'll figure out that some questions are a little bit harder than others.

103
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,560
Usually I just give a pretty wide or vague timeline.

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,490
I can usually just say give me a couple days or let me look into it when we're at this section.

105
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,870
Really there's a lot of ways you can kind of work it around.

106
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,000
OK so the big takeaways from this lecture is confidence is key.

107
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,090
You kind of have to feel like you're holding their hand throughout the process.

108
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,530
You need to understand that clients typically are very poorly equipped to handle problems and they're

109
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:38,070
very poorly equipped to tell the queen who knows the right path and who's completely wrong what they

110
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:43,360
can tell is they can tell your tone and they can tell your confidence an issue with no solution.

111
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,870
That's Bell's sinking ship to them.

112
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,360
But an issue with someone who's confident that they can figure it out even if that doesn't mean fix

113
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,280
the problem just figure out what it is that is always an infinitely better solution.

114
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,070
Try to be their North Star try to be confident and try to analyze your language a little bit.

115
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:07,920
Don't ever leave open ended answers that make it sound like I just don't know what this is or this is

116
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,600
an issue.

117
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,930
Always give some kind of a conclusion or some kind of summation.

118
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,810
This is a problem and it can be fixed this quickly or tomorrow we'll know how to fix it or something

119
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,570
along those lines.

120
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,590
OK guys like always any questions posed in the group discussion.

121
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,620
Otherwise you can always send me a message.

122
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:32,850
I'll see in the next lecture.
