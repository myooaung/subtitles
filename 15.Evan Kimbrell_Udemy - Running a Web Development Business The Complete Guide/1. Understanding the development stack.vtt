00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.710
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.650
We're going to go over some basics that are really going to help you understand how web projects work.

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.660
So this is part of the section of essentials.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.770
Really really basic things that are essential for you to understand in order to be successful in order

5
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.920
to understand how web development works.

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.730
Now if you have any programming experience please just go down to the bottom and click next lecture.

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.320
You don't need to hear any of this.

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.900
This lecture is for people who have no experience programming or they're very very vague on what they

9
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.610
understand and what they don't know.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.460
So this lecture is called Understanding the dev stack well dev just means development.

11
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.810
And when I say stack I'm talking about the stack of technologies that go into making a web site or any

12
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.080
type of application.

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.080
So what exactly is a stack with a stack is just the sandwich of technologies that are used to build

14
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.010
whatever it is that you're making or having made for you.

15
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.540
So those of you who have absolutely no familiarity with building web sites you probably didn't know

16
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.850
that there's actually multiple layers to your Web site.

17
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.900
If you do have superior experience you obviously already know this.

18
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.540
So to give you an example of a stack and then I can explain what exactly I mean by that.

19
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.890
Take the word or the acronym lamp.

20
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.790
OK lamp is one of the most common developments stacks out there and what it stands for is Linux Apache.

21
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.000
My sequel ph P There are probably something like jibberish if you are not a programmer but really all

22
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.640
I'm doing is I'm describing every single step of my technology.

23
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.230
And what is being used.

24
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.900
OK.

25
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.240
So the way that it actually works it would really kind of be written I think opposite so it should be

26
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.640
lamp at the very bottom at the very top the very top is ph P.

27
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.560
Now if you ever heard of this is a technology it's called a server side technology it's called the scripting

28
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.630
technology.

29
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.080
But what it is is it's used to carry information from a browser page to a server.

30
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.850
It's used to make calculations on any information that the front of a Web site receives.

31
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.940
It's also used to pull information from other sources or other web sites for use in your web site.

32
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.610
Now if he is popular it's probably the most prolific programming language out there.

33
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.000
Actually Facebook I'm sure use Facebook that was built in PH.

34
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.920
P A lot of very very popular Web sites were built in DHP.

35
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.140
WordPress was made HP then moving down you go to my sequel My sequel is actually just the name of the

36
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.410
database that a web site would use.

37
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.800
Now my school is by far the most popular and I'd say almost 85 percent of projects use my sequel alternatives

38
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.980
are like no sequel or Mongo D.B and there's a couple of other ones like Oracle Oracle databases so their

39
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.960
database is literally just the storage container that stores all the information that your Web site

40
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.910
receives.

41
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.150
I type in my user information I create an account that gets stored in a database.

42
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.220
Now my choice of what database to use is what determines the Im in the lamp acronym.

43
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.360
So then pass that you have Apache and Apache is a technology that runs on your server that essentially

44
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.470
just allows your server to handle information coming in.

45
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.810
It allows your sequel databases to communicate with each other and it basically is the foundation for

46
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.940
transferring information easily off of a server past that the last thing is just Linux and what Linux

47
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.000
basically is it is an operating system much like Microsoft Windows or OS 10.

48
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.080
If you're using a Mac and that just describes what operating system does your server use.

49
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.270
Now you really don't need to concern yourself with those last two letters but I wanted to explain to

50
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.270
you what that means if you ever run into lamp.

51
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.700
Now if I said wimp or may I'm busy all I'm saying is in Whampoa saying Windows as opposed to Linux or

52
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.710
map I'm saying it gets into a big mac os.

53
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.350
So that's part of the basics of what a stack is.

54
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.790
Now with Web sites something that often gets left off is that the very top layer so this would be actually

55
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.420
above the HP.

56
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.890
That is the graphic design layer.

57
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.380
Now the graphic design layer is usually handled by a combination of TMLC SS and Javascript.

58
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.220
Those are three different languages and they all kind of do roughly the same thing.

59
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.510
Javascript is more for running actions on your page.

60
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:40.740
Pop ups buttons things like that HDMI and CSSA are more for where the elements get put what aligns with

61
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.670
what.

62
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.620
What color should this be.

63
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.950
Now that's very much at the very top of it that handles whatever you're looking at.

64
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.860
Where does the design go what does it look like what happens when I click this page comes the next Those

65
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.620
are all occurring on the very top layer.

66
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.470
Now why is it important to understand that your technology comes in stacks like that.

67
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.230
Well one thing you need to understand is that there's multiple ways of making a web site.

68
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.990
So imagine how I mentioned ph P ph P is where the bulk of your web site or application is probably going

69
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.660
to be built in terms of code size because the most important part of any web site is what the Web site

70
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.810
can do with your information how it displays things like images how it can manipulate information or

71
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.730
send information around.

72
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.270
That's usually the value in a web site.

73
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.350
And so that layer is usually the most important.

74
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.380
There's other popular ways of getting that done.

75
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.630
Now if you probably ever heard of Ruby on Rails that's another example of a technology that can replace

76
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.670
ph.

77
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.700
Another one is like Python and Python is what Google uses.

78
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:53.100
So I am explaining this solely because when you build your development business you usually get a half

79
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.790
to decide what stack you're going to use.

80
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.310
So it's spread like we had to make a decision what stack are we going to use or are we going to offer

81
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.400
as a service multiple stacks.

82
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.630
Are we only going to stay with one stack.

83
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.570
Are we only going to staff people who can write in ph P or do we just staff people who also write in

84
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.200
teach Python and Ruby.

85
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.880
Now obviously if we're talking on a mobile application the stack is going to be different instead of

86
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:23.270
PH P We're probably talking about Java if it's on Android or talking about Objective-C or swift if it's

87
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.910
on iOS but past that it's still going to operate very similarly.

88
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.980
It's still going to use a sequel database most likely.

89
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.360
And then on the front end it actually will end up using a different kind of programming to handle the

90
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.000
front end.

91
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.710
But regardless you still have to make decisions about what you're going to use.

92
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.960
OK.

93
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.500
So the main takeaway from this lecture all technology is all web sites or mobile applications they have

94
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.140
multiple layers of technology going on.

95
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.180
When you start your development firm you're going to need to make a decision about what you're going

96
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.050
to use if you're a programmer and you're good at something already.

97
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.510
Stick with what you know.

98
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.200
There's also an opportunity for you to say I don't work on the entire stack.

99
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.790
I only work on one section.

100
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.400
You could say I only work on the top layer the javascript the aged him and the CSX.

101
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.060
Then what you're basically saying is I only do the front end.

102
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.910
I focus on what your website looks like how the page interacts with the user how the buttons work how

103
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:26.630
to transitions work how do I embed movies or images or anything that moves or any graphic animations.

104
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.520
You could also focus solely on what's past the top layer.

105
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.810
You could only do the actual programming side you could say we only take projects that have designed

106
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.850
and already have the HVM LCS SS javascript done.

107
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.030
All we do is then make a back end for your website or your application and plug it in.

108
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.280
So in the next lecture we're going to talk about how do you make a decision about what stack to use.

109
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.450
And in that lecture we're going to talk a little bit more about what are the most important things to

110
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.760
take into consideration when you do actually pick a stack.

111
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.450
It's a lot simpler than you think.

112
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.840
But the main takeaway from this lecture is that you need to understand that all websites and applications

113
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:09.080
are built in layers and each individual layer is typically done by a different person unless you have

114
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.850
someone who is an expert at all of them.

115
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.570
You're typically going to be hiring specialists so there's opportunities to make your needs in a specific

116
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.690
layer but you can also build on every single layer.

117
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:27.710
You just need to understand that it's kind of like a sandwich in every single Web site is going to need

118
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.370
something for every single layer like the lamp stack.

119
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.840
It's going to need to have an operating system and it's server.

120
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.460
It's going to need to have an Apache or any other type of server technology to run applications and

121
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:47.000
then it's going to need server side technology like APHC or Ruby on Rails or a python to handle information

122
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
transfer information manipulate information and then it's finally going to need some kind of graphic

123
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.020
interface and then programming to handle the images on the page.

124
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.230
I hope I didn't garble that up.

125
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.410
Hopefully that makes a little bit more sense so in the next lecture again we're going to talk about

126
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:14.020
how do you make a decision in the next lecture.
