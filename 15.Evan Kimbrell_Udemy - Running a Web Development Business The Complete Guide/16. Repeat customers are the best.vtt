00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.780
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.700
So in this lecture we're going to talk about repeat customers why they're so important and why they're

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.360
so awesome.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.800
So now if you were looking at this from an outside perspective you might think what's interesting a

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.450
new client and a repeat client.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.530
Right.

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.970
They probably pay you the same rates.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.290
They probably have the same projects.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.450
What could possibly be the difference now.

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.340
Actually there is quite a big difference.

11
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.780
Now the reason has to do with the economics of how you get clients and how you maintain clients.

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.060
Now it's a pretty simple concept when you're looking for new clients you spend a lot of time upfront

13
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.920
before they pay you a single dollar.

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.090
That time you spend is not going to be reimbursed.

15
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.180
This is time spent running your advertising campaigns reaching out to people talking to people answering

16
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.860
the questions estimating their projects negotiating contracts getting them to sign contracts following

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.770
up with them then finally starting a project.

18
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.850
Now if you signed a 100 hour project it's completely reasonable to think that you spent 10 hours upfront

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.010
getting that client.

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.000
Also you need to take into consideration is for that hundred hour project.

21
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.170
You probably also chased after four or five other projects that you didn't get.

22
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.710
So if you spent any similar amount of time on it you could have easily spent 50 hours looking for projects

23
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.280
landing one that gets you 100 hours.

24
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.240
So that's literally a third of your time wasted on something that doesn't make you money and doesn't

25
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.810
make you better at what you're doing.

26
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.280
Now review kind of the complete opposite of that.

27
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.380
If someone comes back to you they've already selected you.

28
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.350
You don't have to sell them on anything.

29
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.310
You sure do have to give them an estimate.

30
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.290
But you know the likelihood of getting that project is very very high.

31
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.590
You're essentially streamlining the process with them.

32
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.560
You cut out the fat out of the process and you focus on development which is what you make money off

33
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.760
of.

34
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.320
And what you're actually good at 3P clients are also a good indication that you're doing something well

35
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.330
because if they're coming back to you it means they're satisfied with your service.

36
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.230
Those are the people that are going to be the best for referrals a lot of prospective clients will give

37
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.940
you referrals but those don't have the same weight as a repeat client will repeat.

38
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.510
Clients can say my project that's up and it's alive.

39
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.310
This is the person that built it for me.

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.920
That's a very strong referral and that's a referral that's going to convert into a sale quite often.

41
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.800
So in general if you're trying to grow your business you need to focus on momentum.

42
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.180
One of the momentum killers in this business is constantly having to try and find new clients here at

43
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.700
Sprint.

44
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.950
We only work off referrals because we've put enough time and work into our network.

45
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.160
We don't have to go out and look for clients anymore.

46
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
This is the ideal range.

47
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.170
We waste barely any time on things that don't pay us.

48
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.980
That allows us to be more competitive on rates that allows us to be better at what we do.

49
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.790
And that allows us to have more of a margin to spend other places.

50
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.440
So focus on the things that give you the best our life for your time.

51
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.900
Focus on the things that are going to give you the best referrals but that's going to allow you to build

52
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.930
momentum.

53
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.810
That's going to allow you to grow your business.

54
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.040
And that's what we're going for.

55
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.160
Okay guys always try to focus on keeping your clients.

56
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.070
That's the sweetest deal possible.

57
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.930
It also is a good barometer of how well you're doing with the business in general.

58
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.300
Repeat clients means you're doing something right.

59
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.740
You guys have any questions posed in the group discussion.

60
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.900
Otherwise see in the next lecture.
