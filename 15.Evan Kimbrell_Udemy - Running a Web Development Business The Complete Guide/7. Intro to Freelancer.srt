1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,870
All right.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,900
Welcome back.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,700
When I go over freelancer dot com I'm going to try to keep this as brief as possible.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,740
I had mentioned before that freelancer is the least like the other two freelancer has the most the largest

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,870
user base of freelancers of about seven million there also.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,100
Strangely enough the least profitable of the three.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:40,380
Mainly because they make most of their money off of project upgrades and all of an assortment of fees

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,690
that they've kind of come up with.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,270
So we're just going to go through this pretty quickly as you can see it is just kind of a mess in terms

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,510
of a user interface during this demo if something breaks or something doesn't load.

11
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,320
I'm not entirely surprised freelancer is the place that I call it the Wild West.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,250
A great metaphor or A B comparison is it's kind of the Craigslist of freelancing services.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,200
There's not a lot of rules.

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,730
Pretty much anything goes.

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:18,020
And a lot of times you find some things that are really kind of what you'd call like black hat or a

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,200
very kind of scatch.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,350
So anyway speaking of scatch I use this as a burn away account.

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,880
I just have a fake name associated with it.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,770
But I was using freelancer for quite a long time mainly because they're the best if you have a small

20
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:42,010
task or you have something that's not you know it's harder to get done.

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:49,020
A lot of times like I might be thinking I'm I mean a an artist an illustrator I need someone who specializes

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,430
in video or audio or something that not I don't think necessarily lends itself well the answer I would

23
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,020
ask.

24
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,830
I go to a freelancer freelancer has people that do pretty much everything and as you can see over here

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,940
here's some progress that I've actually been using freelancer to help out with my you do me courses.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:13,130
So you'll notice here it kind of looks like the other two poster project here you find your freelancers

27
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,410
here you can browse other projects they give you a lot more controls over it.

28
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,520
You can look for all of the projects that I like ending soon ones that have no bids.

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,470
Ones that fit your skills if you're a freelancer post contests not to be confused with post project

30
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,410
freelancer also has a secondary function which is that they have a contest section of their web site.

31
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,880
If you click on this button right here you can see the other services they offer.

32
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,890
So freelancer's the main one freelancer contest is their answer to 99 designs freelancers services.

33
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,270
Is there a copycat of fiver or dot com.

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,470
I don't even know what these three are but chances are you probably will use them.

35
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,380
Freelancer is a little bit weird or you will upload money into your account and so like you'll deposit

36
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,890
funds and then you'll pay your freelancers freelancer.

37
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,100
Keep in mind that there's not a lot of support when it comes to people who disappear or don't do your

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,420
work.

39
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,930
Don't do it correctly.

40
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,940
They have tried to automate virtually everything and to the detriment of their community.

41
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,710
So we can check out what a project looks like.

42
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,640
Here as an example earlier in the course you've seen some hand drawings I actually use this as a way

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:45,110
of drumming up leads for looking for a graphic designer who could help me what they will do.

44
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:54,540
So what they do is they will show off at the very top of each project who they suggest.

45
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,440
Now this is something you won't notice with Lance Lance doesn't usually suggest a user oDesk won't suggest

46
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,130
a user freelancer well.

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:10,260
And also a lot of times you'll notice that they have sponsored listings meaning someone can pay to show

48
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,990
up at the top of your list.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,210
They also do this weird thing which is on purpose.

50
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,740
I can't hide bids.

51
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:24,800
Wow you can't even talking about freelancer and how much their user interface is kind of crap design.

52
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,060
You notice that constantly things are just cut off.

53
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,120
But what this is I think it says report meaning I can report it if it's spam but I can never seem to

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,280
get rid of any bid anyway.

55
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,220
Yes that is how they design the layouts.

56
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,500
Keep in mind people that can sponsor their bids can show up at the top.

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,580
I try to stay away from sponsored bids.

58
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,040
A lot of freelancers sponsored bids at the beginning so that they can reach so they can get a lot of

59
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,720
projects at first.

60
00:04:52,050 --> 00:05:00,560
They have built in a chat system so this is along with a frequently used contact list.

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,660
So NLC you little notice if someone is online you can see that they will pop up and will have a green

62
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,100
dot.

63
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,580
So they've integrated instant messaging into their system and then they've integrated all sorts of other

64
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,380
web sites into a kind of a hodgepodge it's really kind of a melting pot.

65
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,990
That's why I call it the Wild West.

66
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,970
You can get some of the greatest value possible out of here and at the same time you can get some of

67
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,160
the largest headaches.

68
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,320
Dot com.

69
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:37,140
It's typically a great option for instance if you want to get a clone of a Web site.

70
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,660
It's also great if you want someone to do some advertising for you.

71
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,180
So actually if you want to bend the rules a little bit and you're fine.

72
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,710
Kind of walking the line between spam and not spam.

73
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,560
This is kind of a place that you would look for people.

74
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,960
Let's see freelance.

75
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:02,970
I'm also a strange thing that they do is magnifica even find it they have tried to Gamefly their system

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,720
quite a bit.

77
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,230
Where is it where.

78
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,000
OK here it is.

79
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,630
Myra Woodwards I thought this was goofy.

80
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,650
If you are someone that does a lot of projects a lot of the time they have made a whole badge system

81
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,500
and a credit shop and in all sorts of just goofy things.

82
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:31,650
You know I'm level 12 journeyman and so I could use this to upgrade and to get free featuring and free.

83
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,410
I'm not even entirely sure.

84
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,840
But anyway it's kind of like a rewards program.

85
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,090
You know maybe some of you might find some use out of this.

86
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,880
Maybe you won't see.

87
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,330
All right.

88
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,810
So anyway I promised that I'd keep this one short.

89
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,260
We're not going to do a deep dive into this Web site there.

90
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,630
Honestly there are enough features on this website to make an entire course out of it seems like.

91
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:01,200
And for your purposes you really just want to focus with the basics which is posting a project and then

92
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:08,520
managing your freelancers and also just knowing kind of ahead of time what exactly the interest is about

93
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,380
this Web site here.

94
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,340
I mean this is the Czar you'd post a project.

95
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,660
It's virtually the same.

96
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,240
This is one thing that is worth posting or talking about very briefly.

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,510
They make most of their money off of upgrades.

98
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:30,780
So if you want to for instance increase the reach of your page you can do a free trade listing cost

99
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,420
$29 if you want to do.

100
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,270
Urgent urgent means that you just put some marker next or that says urgent.

101
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,890
And then more people know that you're trying to pick someone soon and so you get a lot of bids.

102
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,870
Recruiter is a service they offer that I don't believe the other to offer you pay $29 and they will

103
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,600
help you recruit someone.

104
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:55,230
In my experience it's not particularly helpful because the support they give you is very minimal.

105
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,010
But I believe what ends up happening when you're a recruiter is you get an automatic upgrade to being

106
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,580
featured.

107
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,520
And that's kind of how they justify paying for the service.

108
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,960
One of the goofy things that will happen is when you post a project it will ask you if you want to upgrade

109
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,070
and you can do to.

110
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,710
And if you don't upgrade it says you want to do a free version and it says the free version you have

111
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,040
to wait and someone has to manually review your posting.

112
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,930
That is not true.

113
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:26,510
So if you get the free version it loads it pretends that it's getting reviewed and then it just posted.

114
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,850
It's actually computer rhythm that checks it over.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,600
There's actually no delay so don't get tricked into paying extra money if you don't feel like it.

116
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,910
Freelancer another Web site.

117
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,320
I definitely think you should add to your toolkit if you have.

118
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,010
I think it's better for auxilary services and I think that it's great for finding people that are kind

119
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,370
of your odds and ends things people can fill in the gaps and.
