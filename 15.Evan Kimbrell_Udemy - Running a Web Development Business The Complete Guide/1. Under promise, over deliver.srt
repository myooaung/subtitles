1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,160
You guys come back to the course.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,680
So in this lecture talk about this kind of an adage that has been going around and freelancer circles

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,320
forever and it's under-promise over deliver.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,060
So for those of you who were never heard this before I'm going to give you a brief explanation of what

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,170
it means and why it's important.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,810
Then after that I'm going to give you my take on it and give you a little bit more of a nuanced approach

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,680
to it as it applies to development businesses.

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,740
Now under promise and over deliver what it means is that it's always better when you're talking with

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,150
a client to promise less than what you're capable of.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,310
And then when you actually deliver the project over deliver.

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,720
So as opposed to what ends up happening a lot of times is people promise the moon.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,140
They say I can do this and this and this and this can do this on a time and then they fail to meet those

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,040
expectations.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,770
The opposite of it is a more realistic approach to always keeping your clients happy and focusing on

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,110
customer retention.

16
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,310
So that's where that really just comes from.

17
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:14,340
We always want to be timid with how much you can propose or promise and then always just plan on either

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,150
meeting those expectations or blowing them out of the water.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,810
Never plan to at best make your expectations and most likely miss the mark.

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,540
Now why though kind of in general is this good advice.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,410
Well in general you want your project to be built on realistic expectations.

22
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:40,980
You want them to know how complicated it is how big it is how expensive it is because that's going to

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,360
keep them in tune in sync.

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,830
And that's going to give them the same priorities as you.

25
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,020
Now if a client thinks you're going to be delivering something that you aren't or thinks are going to

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,540
be delivering something that was never agreed on those are unrealistic expectations.

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:03,640
You want everybody on the same page because if that's the case then there's not a lot of miscommunication.

28
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,730
There's not a lot of puffery in the sense that you don't always have to try extra hard to impress that

29
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,380
person.

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,810
They know exactly what they're looking for and what they're going to get out of it.

31
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,390
It also makes it such that you don't feel inclined to lie or embellish if they know exactly how long

32
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,550
this is going to take and you are completely honest with them.

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,870
Then you don't have to feel like lying about oh where your development schedule is or how quickly it's

34
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,840
coming along or trying to hide the fact that you might have hit snags.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,050
Now if you fail to live up to your expectations of your client and you do that habitually and you've

36
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,060
kind of built a practice around promising everything and then delivering always short of what you've

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,760
said well you're basically dooming yourself to a situation where you spend a lot of your time looking

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,440
for projects and not all of your time working with repeat clients.

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,960
That is a very an ideal way of running a development business development businesses should focus on

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,790
what they're good at making apps.

41
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,920
They should not have to focus on constantly looking for a new fresh load of clients that have no familiarity

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,110
with your company.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:18,210
So in general under-promise over deliver is a very good kind of mindset to follow and kind of a rule

44
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,250
to follow with regards to your clients and your clients work.

45
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,600
But I think it's really important for you guys to understand that that does not cover all bases.

46
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,500
When you're starting your business under promise over deliver that will get you zero clients forever.

47
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,420
At the very beginning your portfolio is going to be very small.

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,430
It could be absolutely zero items.

49
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,680
Your Web site's not going to look as good as the final version of it.

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,210
You're not going to have as many contacts you're not going to have as many references.

51
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:54,240
So getting someone to sign on the dotted line on a contract that's really hard right and especially

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,550
hard if you're being really pessimistic about what you can do for them and you're under promising.

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,110
So I've seen a lot of people use that kind of adage before under-promise over deliver.

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,800
They go into a business and they try to do that at the very beginning and they just don't get traction.

55
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,620
That's why it's important to understand why it's different when you're starting your business now.

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,130
You need to understand that any development project there's three things that you have the opportunity

57
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,700
to exaggerate on or kind of under-invest.

58
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,070
Number one is cost.

59
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,180
Number two is time line and number three is expertise or ability.

60
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,130
So in any given project when we're thinking about whether or not we promise the moon it's really along

61
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,260
those three categories.

62
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,320
How much is this going to cost how long is it going to take us.

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,120
And can we do this specific thing.

64
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,540
So with regards to starting your business let's go through those three.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,610
Number one do not ever exaggerate on your timeline.

66
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,180
That's something that is true.

67
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:57,300
The first day you start this business and the day that you ring in the 10 year of being in business

68
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:04,030
lying about your time line or during your time line never works out in development the timeline is just

69
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,100
not something you can really fiddle with.

70
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,760
I mean unless you somehow have the magic ability you have people work 100 hours a week and think that

71
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,980
your product quality is not going to go down.

72
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,720
That's the only time I can think of where this would happen.

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,880
You know realistic circumstances you can't dictate how many hours a week they work.

74
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,890
And if you could.

75
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,510
It's always detrimental.

76
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,030
So don't focus on timeline.

77
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,080
The timeline is what it is.

78
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,960
If they're telling you that's not right.

79
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,070
That's ridiculous.

80
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,470
They don't know what the timeline is.

81
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,870
You won't actually be having a problem because another one is trying to overpromise their timeline.

82
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:48,050
Now the second thing was cost and cost is absolutely the thing you should manipulate to get more sales.

83
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,310
At the very beginning of your business you shouldn't be focused on how much money you're making per

84
00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:00,190
project you should be concerned about your portfolio items and bringing in good long term clients that

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,060
you can show off to other people.

86
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,770
So cost is kind of your edge at the very beginning it's something that you should be able to kind of

87
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,310
flip.

88
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,980
Whichever way you need if you have a project and they're looking at multiple vendors and this is very

89
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,210
early on you and you can tell that they are trying to decide between them.

90
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,010
It's very much a good idea to try and see whether or not you can manipulate your price downward to get

91
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:30,690
to the point where they accept you as their vendor because at the very beginning you just need clients

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,500
you just need something to show off someone that can give you repeat business.

93
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,760
Get the ship afloat later on down the line.

94
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,420
That doesn't really make sense.

95
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,090
You shouldn't be competitive necessarily on price unless for some reason this is a fantastic project

96
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,630
that's great for many other reasons.

97
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,300
So remember that at beginning just get some clients.

98
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,040
So don't worry about cost.

99
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,390
Absolutely mess with your costs.

100
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,550
You can always over promise on cost.

101
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,280
Just make sure that you're not over promising so much that you're losing a ton of money.

102
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,000
You can go into the red and you can plan to lose money on some of your projects.

103
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,650
That's up to you and that's up to whether or not you're OK with that risk.

104
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,890
That's a great way of getting clients but it's not for everybody.

105
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,210
Now the third thing is ability now ability just kind of refers to whether or not someone says hey I

106
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,750
want to have this feature and maybe you're not totally sure whether or not you can do it or if they

107
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,630
say you know I need something built in this technology and you're not totally sure that you can do it.

108
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,960
A lot of times someone will ask and it is built on this platform.

109
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,400
You don't need to build it for iPad but you also need to build it for you know some Android Nexus tablet

110
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:41,120
and you only do one or the other and that honestly does happen quite a bit.

111
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,810
And it's one of those things that you might consider that over promising by saying hey I can do this

112
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,860
one and the other one because remember you're not going to get that project unless you could do both

113
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,400
of them.

114
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,140
So in general that's considered over promising to the way that I typically suggest people handle it

115
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,750
is that you just you just kind of hedge your bets at the very beginning clients are really really really

116
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,340
important.

117
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,440
At least the first couple ones that you get so you might be more inclined to give them some kind of

118
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,140
flexibility or at least to make some kind of a promise of adding some new technology that you might

119
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,690
not have right this moment.

120
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,500
But the way that you do this correctly and the way that you do that is in a nuanced intelligent way

121
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,960
is you don't ever say I absolutely can do this.

122
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,110
Just say you know I can build it for this platform and I'm very confident I can build it for this platform

123
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,820
and then you just basically say but if for some reason I can't this is realistically what's going to

124
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,320
happen.

125
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,400
So in that second kind of contingency what you can do is you can try to soften the blow and say well

126
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,780
if that's the case that happens I can lower the price for you or you can just say if that's the case

127
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,890
that happens well it's only something that's going to take me another month to figure out.

128
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,170
A lot of times you'd be surprised people don't even care about that.

129
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,980
They can be really happy about your price being lowered but they also don't even really care it's going

130
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,690
to take an extra month.

131
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,710
They're more or less just concerned that one vendor deals with more of their project and they're not

132
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,530
going to have to work with multiple vendors for different technologies.

133
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,390
So don't ever say 100 percent absolutely I'm doing it.

134
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,430
It's done expect.

135
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,110
Don't say I'm confident I can do it.

136
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,900
But realistically that might mean it takes a longer.

137
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,960
And if for some reason I can't do it well then we'll lower the price of your project.

138
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,950
That's something that works really really effectively.

139
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,790
OK guys so in general we know when in doubt go with under-promise over deliver.

140
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,320
But in the very beginning of your business be realistic.

141
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:33,750
I mean only one of those three things that you can manipulate is not is unmoveable is something that

142
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,580
is just insane to move and that's timeline.

143
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,520
You could always manipulate your cost.

144
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,750
Feel free to do that.

145
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,280
In fact actually that's one of your strongest tools to get clients at the beginning and the other one

146
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,660
is just you know ability try to be realistic about it.
