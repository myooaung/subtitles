1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,420
It you guys will come back to the course.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,730
So in this lecture we're going to talk really really quickly about how much do you customize your proposals.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,640
So an issue probably run into if you've already started issuing proposals is that you kind of probably

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,740
wondering how much of the proposal needs to be custom tailored to the client and how much can a get

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,320
away with copying and pasting predefined content and information.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,360
Now this is something that a lot of people ask about and a lot of you guys who haven't made proposals

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,730
are probably wondering why you're copying and pasting any information to begin with.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,530
Well the reason why is because when you actually get to the point where you are actively taking in business

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,800
you will start to notice that if you customize every single proposal you're going be underwater pretty

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,340
quickly with how much time you would be spending on this.

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,670
Now there's a period of time with Sprint Qik where I was spending half my days sending out customized

12
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,690
proposals and that is just not an efficient use of time.

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,770
It did get a lot of conversions but it's not very efficient and you can definitely spend your time in

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,370
other places that will actually in the long run help you more.

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,080
So the question is how much do you customize and so I'm just going to be a little bit of thought for

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,900
myself on the subject.

17
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,980
So the first thing I think that you should consider is just how big is the project.

18
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,690
Right.

19
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,700
So larger projects typically.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,230
So the first thing I think that you should consider is just how big is the project.

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,780
Right.

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,300
So larger projects typically.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,080
So it's kind of a paradox.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,360
Larger projects you would think that maybe you should spend more time on them.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,830
Right.

26
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,050
And smaller projects maybe you should spend less time customizing them.

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,440
Well it's actually a little bit more complicated than that.

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,170
You might think that more customisation is better for big projects because that's the one that's going

29
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,310
to make the most money.

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,770
Well the problem with big projects is the sales cycles with those are longer takes longer for you to

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,220
close big projects and you probably see fewer and fewer of them.

32
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,030
Now on the flip side small projects they come and go quite rapidly and there's a lot more of them.

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,190
So it's really up to you to decide what you think is worth it for you.

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:21,060
Do you want to get a lot of small projects or do you want to focus in on three to four large projects

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,980
that can kind of carry you for the next period of time.

36
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,170
So really I think it's a judgment call.

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,680
If you customize a proposal for my small project.

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,050
You're very very likely to get the project.

39
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:41,280
Now the tricky part about this is that it's kind of reverse scale with a small project if you customize

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,750
a lot of your proposal you're in a better position to win that project than on a big project.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,110
Now why is that.

42
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,910
The reason why is the convention is that bigger projects typically will have more customization.

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,340
People typically spend more time on big projects big projects typically have a lot of competition.

44
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,330
Now if you are a small project or even a mid-sized project and you customize a lot of it really impress

45
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:06,840
the client.

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,750
They might not even shop around for anyone else and you can close that the way that I suggest you go

47
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,990
about doing this is that you customize as much as you can efficiently and at the very beginning of your

48
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,380
process I generally suggest you customize more.

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,520
The reason why is because that's a good tool to stick out from the rest of the crowd.

50
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,030
But it's also something that can help you get traction early on which is really the biggest problem

51
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,870
when you are starting your development business after you get your first initial call.

52
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,860
It's really starts become a snowball effect once you start getting referrals and you start getting more

53
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,430
business.

54
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,190
So at the very beginning I suggest you customize more.

55
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,950
I also suggest that you focus on customizing for smaller projects and then recognize that bigger projects

56
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,330
are more competition.

57
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,360
So it might not be worth spending the time at that higher tier to compete.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
Now the other thing I want to point out is the 60:40 rule and that's just what we use to kind of decide

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,100
how much we customize and we just use it as a golden rule when in doubt do this if we have a good feeling

60
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,360
about a project we might customize mourn a bad feeling we might customize less but in general this is

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,390
what we shoot for.

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,080
We will shoot for 60 percent is either custom or tailored to the project.

63
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,100
And 40 percent is copy and paste.

64
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,840
Now help to help you understand what I mean by this.

65
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,190
Before when we talked about the sections in a proposal the components of a proposal you notice that

66
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:35,170
a lot of that stuff is not specific to the project or the client.

67
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,730
The proposal is getting delivered to.

68
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,860
So an about us section or how we work or even next step.

69
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,710
These are all templated things that you will include in all your proposals case studies as well typically

70
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,740
we shoot for 60 percent.

71
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,740
And the way that we do that is we try to make sure to balance not too much access information that has

72
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,270
nothing to do with the project.

73
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,640
Typically with a client their attention spans are very short and it's a mistake that you'll make if

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,470
you assume that you have a captive audience don't assume that the proposal you send to them they're

75
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,380
going to be automatically interested in it.

76
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,330
They're going to read every single page.

77
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,950
That's a false assumption.

78
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,400
You need to make sure that at least 60 percent is custom and tailor to them because that's going to

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,800
keep their attention span and keep them reading the pages 40 percent is OK to get away with.

80
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,500
And as you get more projects you get more experience with your messaging as you as you tinker and tailor

81
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,060
more with those sections about you and basic information about your firm.

82
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,090
Those will get better and better your success with proposals will get better.

83
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:43,320
But just in general shoot for 60 percent that's the best we've experienced with attention spans.

84
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,550
Try to put as much custom as you can.

85
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,110
Don't be that firm that sends 90 percent duplicate content.

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,440
As someone who has purchased software I can tell you that it's very obvious when you get a proposal

87
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,940
and almost all of it is nonspecific non tailored to you and it's something that's very very disconcerting.

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,830
Even though we looked at the OCT example previously there were actually only two pages out of the 12

89
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,000
that were specific to the project.

90
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,180
And in one of them it was an estimate and it was only one number.

91
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,250
The rest of it was just template information.

92
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,720
Your clients are not dumb and even if they are dumb they subconsciously will recognize the fact that

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,610
sections of it have nothing to do with their proposal.

94
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,240
They want to know that you're thinking about their proposal.

95
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,470
They want to know that you're thinking about their project what it needs.

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,200
And yet you are ready to address the problems that they have and the way you do that is by tailoring

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,940
the proposal to them and not just a generic pitch of your company.

98
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,260
Typically if you're in a conversation with them they've read your Web site they've probably heard something

99
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,110
of you.

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,890
They don't need 10 pages of information purely just pitching you as a generic provider.

101
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,160
OK guys go forth and customize the main takeaways from this lecture is just that you should try to customize

102
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,490
as much as you can but obviously be realistic about the efficiency of your time.

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,060
You can't customize everything.

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,050
So when in doubt try to customize at least 60 percent the way you do that you focus more on their project

105
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,990
and less on pitching you a lot of those templated pages are unnecessary and you really need to think

106
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,210
about whether or not that extra page that says more information about you or how you work whether or

107
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,400
not it's really absolutely necessary.

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,130
And the other thing is that just be aware of how big the project is that you're going after.

109
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,670
If it's a big project that means big reward but it also means big competition.

110
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,750
Also be aware that small projects typically have less competition.

111
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,610
You can win those much more easily if you just spend a little bit more time in them.

112
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,100
It's a little bit counterintuitive but it's something that I think will definitely help you down the

113
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,590
line.

114
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,000
All right guys see the next lecture.
