00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.190
You guys all come back to the course.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.650
So in this lecture I want to go over another strategy.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.590
This one is actually quite common.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.090
It's out there all the time.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.030
You've probably seen it but you probably didn't notice it.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.320
OK so this strategy is called Tag your work.

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.110
And why do I call it tagging.

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.540
Well actually I'm making a reference to graffiti.

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.890
Right.

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.710
Because what does a graffiti artist do.

11
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.110
There is right on a wall.

12
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.790
Tag.

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.300
But when they tag something they're not just sacred doodling they're writing their name it's always

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.730
something that has their name or their name in some weird contorted way.

15
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.280
So it's like tagging.

16
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.990
Now how does this apply to development.

17
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.780
Well you've probably seen this pretty much all over the place.

18
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.930
Anything that we make actually has at the bottom of it.

19
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.200
Powered by Sprint kick.

20
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.570
So we use that for a lot of different things our marketing access portal says powered by Sprint kick

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.360
anything we've ever built for free.

22
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.870
Put that the bottom.

23
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.260
So the way that most people use this when they're showing their freelance or their development business

24
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.730
is what they do is they'll either offer to reduce the price to a new client in order to tag their work

25
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.270
or offer free work and in exchange they get to plug themselves.

26
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.080
So the way to work is if you had a client that you had some reason to believe is going to have a decent

27
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.150
amount of traffic or the type of people that are going to see your clients work are going to be your

28
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.710
right customer base.

29
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.140
If that were the case then you might be incentivized to maybe offer them a deal lower your price a little

30
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.850
bit give them some cost savings or give them extra work in exchange for that you get to write your name

31
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.250
very subtly at the bottom.

32
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.560
It has two purposes one people get to see that you made it.

33
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.990
They associate that with you.

34
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.220
They can click through to your link and the other thing is actually SEO because when you do that it's

35
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.690
automatically a back link to your Web site.

36
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.280
You're not familiar at all of that SEO.

37
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.530
Well the largest part of SEO is how many links are pointing towards your Web site.

38
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.780
And so it's important that a lot of Web sites out there reference you and that's how Google tells that

39
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.080
your web site is probably important for a lot of people are referring to you by giving a link to you.

40
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.230
So in the case that you give out free work for tagging that might be the case that you don't have a

41
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.890
lot of clients you might have a limited portfolio and there might be some web site out there that is

42
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.260
just perfect for the group.

43
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.470
You want to go after you'd asked to tag that.

44
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.140
Now tagging is kind of a mixed barrel in some cases it can be very good and in some cases it does absolutely

45
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.040
nothing.

46
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.680
Typically when we do use tagging as an advertising strategy we have kind of a comprehensive strategy

47
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.070
around it.

48
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.080
We don't just say to one person we'll tag that one thing.

49
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.920
We try to say you know every three clients we do we'll pick one of them and tag it and just know that

50
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.780
maybe one out of five one of the three will create a significant amount of traffic backwards.

51
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.560
Now this is a strategy it's great at the very beginning and it's great if you want to do more like nonprofit

52
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.180
work where you want to reduce your price for something you care about and you need some justification

53
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.350
for lowering your price.

54
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.190
Once you have larger more well-established clients they're not going to want to be there you know at

55
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.090
first you can get away with saying hey can I put this banner out at the bottom Hey can I put this big

56
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.570
sentence at the bottom.

57
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.410
Eventually you're going to work with mid-tier clients who at most will be willing to let you have a

58
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.110
mention in their blog or mention yourself somewhere.

59
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.010
It's nonintrusive in text form and then eventually going to get to higher quality clients that it just

60
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.420
doesn't make sense to them to have you put your stuff on there.

61
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.350
It's confusing from a branding perspective and it also kind of looks cheap it looks like they owe you

62
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.180
a favor.

63
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.050
That's not really kind of the image that they want to project.

64
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.200
So be aware at the very beginning it's a great way of getting your foot in the door with a lot of people

65
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.130
you can use that in exchange for giving them a discount.

66
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.220
You can also offer it for free to get a discount.

67
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.910
Those are two pretty effective strategies.

68
00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.720
My advice for using this strategy is only use it when you know that there are the crowd that they receive

69
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.540
is very specific to the client base you're going after or if it's in a scenario where you're not putting

70
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.340
yourself at any financial risk.

71
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.320
It's a really small job.

72
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.010
Maybe it's something that you're only using lean development hours to do.

73
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.310
If that's the case then taggle way.

74
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.430
But if it's something where you know you only have a one or two clients and you're about to take on

75
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.740
a third client and that's in exchange for tagging your work you might want to consider how likely you

76
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.150
think it's going to be successful.

77
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.680
Also keep in mind some fail and some are very very good.

78
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.460
So it's more of a home run technique you might do five tags for do nothing and one gets you know several

79
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.040
hundred clicks a day.

80
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.820
And you know two to three leads a day even.

81
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.700
OK you guys now run free and go tag everything you possibly can.

82
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.080
If you have any other questions post in the group discussion.

83
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.900
I'll definitely get to it.

84
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:57.140
Otherwise see the next lecture.
