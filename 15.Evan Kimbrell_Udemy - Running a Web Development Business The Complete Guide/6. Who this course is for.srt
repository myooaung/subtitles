1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,050
Hey guys welcome back to the course so let's talk about who is this course for and who stands to benefit

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,140
the most from the skills and everything that's packed into this course.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,240
So to put it simply literally anyone can start a web and mobile development business.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,240
Do you need to know how to code.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,650
It helps but you absolutely do not take me for example.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,420
I started Sprint kick just myself.

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,960
I couldn't code to save my life.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:41,550
I literally took it from where it was four years ago it was just me and a laptop in the middle of nowhere

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,830
to where it is today which is 18 employees in six different countries.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,150
Do you need a ton of time to start a development business.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,370
Well no we don't actually really have to at all.

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,270
This is definitely something you can manage in a part time capacity.

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,180
Now if you want to do this as your main thing and you want it to grow very quickly and you want to focus

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,810
on high growth then I'd suggest that you spend a full time amount of commitment towards the business.

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:17,110
But if you're more interested in a modest amount of growth or something that adds an extra 50 60 K to

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,210
year salary every year it's definitely something you can do part time.

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,590
Unfortunately you can't really pick the hours because you don't know when a server is going to crash

18
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,960
or you don't know when a client wants to meet.

19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,750
But if you have a flexible job this could be something you could work out if you have a separate project

20
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,640
that you're working on or a separate job.

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,550
I personally started doing this full time and then I transitioned into doing it part time and it honestly

22
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,860
didn't make a difference.

23
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,960
I was perfectly satisfied with the growth trajectory that it was on.

24
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,030
So what skills do you need to have.

25
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,280
Well technically none.

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,370
The only thing that you need is an interest in web or mobile applications.

27
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,450
It helps if you have strong opinions on what works what doesn't work.

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,750
It helps if you pay attention to trends or pay attention to what are new techniques or things that catch

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,350
your interest.

30
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:14,040
But again if you don't have these you know prior established opinions it's something that you develop

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,870
very quickly throughout this process.

32
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,720
Naturally technology lovers are going to have an advantage it's going to come to you a lot quicker.

33
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,570
But it's still open for really anyone who wants to get into this.

34
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:30,570
So the way I see it there are three main groups of people who can start a web development business or

35
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,870
who can strongly benefit from a business like this.

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,890
So the first group are programmers.

37
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,430
You might in some capacity already know how to program.

38
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,430
You might have worked as a freelancer or are working as a freelancer and you might actually have your

39
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,440
own client set that you're managing most likely you're probably working with other contractors that

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,320
your client has hired or you're just working so low as yourself on individual projects.

41
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:02,460
So you start a web or a mobile development business and you can finally transition into bigger projects.

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,430
You can actually transition out of doing the day to day programming or if you prefer to actually stay

43
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,600
programming every day.

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,410
You can stay in the pits except now you can add bodies around you and you can multiply the amount of

45
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,700
money that you make per hour that you work.

46
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,290
So imagine it right now you work maybe you charge $20 an hour if you charge 50 maybe charge to 100.

47
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,890
But if you take on a larger project and you have people next to you who work underneath you you get

48
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,200
paid for every hour they work on top of how many hours that you work.

49
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,580
Now you can only do that by starting your own business and treating it like a business learning how

50
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,200
to go after clients learning how to manage them.

51
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:51,810
Learning the entire process from finding someone to getting the contract to working on it to delivering

52
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,170
it to keeping them happy in the future and bringing them back.

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,240
It's also likely that as a programmer you have a certain technology that you're really passionate about.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,700
You started development business you can build an entire business around that technology.

55
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:12,420
You can build your reputation build your skills and build a decent income around that technology.

56
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,390
You're passionate about.

57
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,160
So the second group that can easily start a development business and benefit immensely from it are non-technical

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,950
entrepreneurs entrepreneurs who want to start their own business but they're not necessarily technically

59
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,910
oriented.

60
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,570
Anybody who has a business background marketing background or even specific skill sets like a CEO or

61
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,480
PR or anything like that.

62
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,320
Anybody who doesn't who considers themselves to do everything other than the programming you can still

63
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,270
do this.

64
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,410
I am actually one of you and at first I always thought I couldn't do a development business as well.

65
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,710
And there's absolutely no reason why I couldn't.

66
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:57,930
So if you want to build future capacity for your next startup if you want to learn in-depth how technology

67
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:04,550
works what makes a great product and get yourself ready for the next thing this is an excellent business

68
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,130
to start.

69
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,230
If you want to learn how to program and you want to learn how to program on your own projects that you

70
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,600
yourself grab.

71
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,760
That's fantastic.

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,000
And oh let's not forget if you also want to make a ton of money it's also a fantastic business to start.

73
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,230
So you're in the world of Web and mobile applications and you want to grow your network grow your income

74
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,520
and learn some awesome skills that are going to benefit you regardless of whether or not you grow this

75
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,840
to 200 people or you move on to your next startup or you take a gig at another startup that's blowing

76
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,050
up.

77
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:42,620
And the third group is anyone who is a freelancer or anyone who does their own consulting work.

78
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,600
So you don't necessarily have to be a freelancer or maybe you have a business and something else in

79
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,690
marketing.

80
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:54,590
If you have a business in graphic design maybe of a business in identity and branding CEO any of those

81
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:03,200
auxillary services around web projects and mobile projects you're the third group now if you are a freelancer

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,740
or you run a freelance firm you probably have your own clientele.

83
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,110
So the way that this course or starting a web development business benefits you.

84
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:18,440
Is that now all of a sudden not only can you sell your clients your regular services you can learn how

85
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,820
to build out the capacity to offer them development services.

86
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,500
We cover another lecture y That's awesome.

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,550
One of the biggest reasons is the development side of every single web or mobile project is by far the

88
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,750
largest portion of the money that goes into the project.

89
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,850
So you have a client that wants you to design a web site offer to design the web site and build it for

90
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,110
them.

91
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,790
You have a client who wants you to run a marketing campaign offered to build them a Web site to assist

92
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,300
in that.

93
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,970
Do you have clients who do management or marketing consultation with if they have a business idea or

94
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,190
a separate feature or a separate product not only can you consult them on the best way of doing it but

95
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,680
you can also tell them that you can build it for them as well.

96
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,030
So wide range of people can benefit from this immensely.

97
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,070
You don't have to be technical.

98
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,080
You could be a designer or marketer or just a generic non-technical entrepreneur.

99
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,960
A lot of people can do this.

100
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,640
You can learn a lot of great skills and skill sets doing this and you can make a ton of money with a

101
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,360
great ratio of work to actual reward.

102
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:36,070
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
