00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.590
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about client budgets what

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.320
do they mean why are they important.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.550
Now a lot of you might think that why is a client budget important what should be important is whether

4
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.800
or not I can make a margin on it or that it's something that I can make very easily or do very well.

5
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.730
Now while that is important all those things are important.

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.850
Trust me those are things that you need to have a healthy business.

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.540
It's also important to work with clients that have good budgets.

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.810
This is one of the biggest differences you'll notice between established firms and new firms.

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.300
New businesses typically will work with clients that have budgets that are all over the place and oftentimes

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.170
will work with people that have budgets who don't fit their project needs prayer more established companies

11
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.600
often have the opportunity work with companies been around for a while used to paying what it should

12
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.310
be.

13
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.470
You know what they should be paying for a project and have had the longevity to stick around to see

14
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.870
successful projects work and so have been able to kind of reinvest and probably have some sort of a

15
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.220
war chest to draw from.

16
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.720
Now you obviously want to get to that second thing I just described you're working with the cream of

17
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.700
the crop kind of clients.

18
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.240
Now the reason why bigger budgets or healthier budgets are at least proportionate budgets are important

19
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.900
is because of the project's success.

20
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.850
General bigger budgets make better projects.

21
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.860
Say that 10 times fast.

22
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.220
It's very important.

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.510
A bigger budget can pay for better graphic design it can pay for you to research problems come up with

24
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.930
novel solutions.

25
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.220
It can pay for when things break it can pay for additional features it can pay for a complete pivot

26
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.760
away from the original concept of the idea into something they found out is more successful now a dead

27
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.690
project is only as valuable to you as the dollar amount that you pocketed from it.

28
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.180
Thats very important if you make money off a project and then it fails.

29
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.030
It is literally just the dollar amount you made out of it.

30
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.240
Thats it a successful project is a fantastic portfolio item.

31
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.090
Its something that can constantly give you leads.

32
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.500
Its something you can constantly show off and its the shining star in your portfolio.

33
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.520
A dead project is kind of hard.

34
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.280
Its hard to show it off.

35
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.100
Its hard to use them as references.

36
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.520
Its just in general a dead end.

37
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.680
In general you want to be building your business around momentum.

38
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.520
You want to do projects that not only help you now help you land your next project you want to focus

39
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.680
on this being kind of a snowball effort.

40
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.390
You want to start with projects that will help you get better projects in the future a project that

41
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.760
fails is going to be a project that doesnt help you improve in the future.

42
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.060
So focus on Budget.

43
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.070
Budget is typically the primary problem.

44
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.150
Obviously bad entrepreneurs will be hard to work with and they'll probably make the product quality

45
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.790
suffer.

46
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.590
But in general any bad project you make will probably be because you are hamstrung by the amount of

47
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.560
money and time you could spend on it too many times in our history we've had to build apps that are

48
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.650
just awful they fail and they could have been successful had the client had more budget for us to at

49
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.100
least push them through other iterations of their idea.

50
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.430
At the very beginning you can't always be picky but try to focus on the ones that can actually be realistic

51
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.980
about the money that they have and how to apply that towards making their project successful.

52
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.120
Try not to focus on clients that just have enough money to make it work because those ones are at a

53
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.540
high likelihood of failure and that is just a project that doesn't help you.

54
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.030
It doesn't help you moving forward.

55
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.170
Try to focus on things that push your momentum forward.

56
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.540
All right guys.

57
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.890
Any other questions post in the group discussion.

58
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.640
Budgets are very very important.

59
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.630
There's a lot of things we could say on budgets.

60
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.600
That's the biggest takeaway I think you need to know is that bigger budgets better projects better portfolio

61
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.860
better success rate all that successful projects are good.

62
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.270
That's a lot of people might think that that's not something that you should worry yourself about once

63
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.510
you push out the door.

64
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.790
It's no longer your child you know successful development firms are focused on client success and project

65
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.180
success beyond their actual scope of development.

66
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:36.770
All right guys see in the next lecture.
