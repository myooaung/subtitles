00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,040
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,380
So in this lecture we're going to talk about.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,620
Do you follow your instincts with what you think is good or do you follow what the client says is good.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,580
It's a dilemma that you're going to run into.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,990
Now there's going to come a time through your development business career.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,110
You're drawn into a situation where a client wants something but you know and you're pretty sure her

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,530
that will end in a poor outcome.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,830
It's something that you know will not end up looking good.

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,310
So as an anecdote to this I can tell you all of the story it's spread.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,420
We had an application that was a mobile app.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,050
It was a very large project and we are on multiple occasions had this dilemma.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,980
And I remember very specifically one time having our client Harris redo the app icon four to five times

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,850
and eventually he just sent us an app icon that he liked and said was amazing.

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,090
It was probably the worst app icon I've ever seen.

15
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,840
I described it as it kind of looked like if you had an app icon but it was processed by a Nintendo 64

16
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,260
it was pixilated.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,080
It had a really lame gradient across it that kind of reminds you of the early 2000s.

18
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,510
It just looked absolutely absurd.

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,000
I knew it didn't even match the design of the app and it would look horrible on your phone.

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,920
And that's not the only time that's ever happened.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,720
It happens a lot of times.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,990
I mean I've had multiple times clients read the thing that they know exactly what's hot and what they

23
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,310
show you are what they want.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,990
Is just ridiculous.

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,600
Now in order to fix this dilemma and to figure out a way going forward you need to evaluate your priorities

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,280
primarily.

27
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,610
Are you doing this for a portfolio.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,810
And if you are doing it for portfolio will adding this new design change or development change to the

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,810
project and then adding at project your portfolio is that going to ruin your portfolio.

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,820
Is it one of those cases where you're doing this for a small amount of money even no money but you're

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,400
just doing it to build out a portfolio or for some other reason you took on the contract.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,600
Now if that's the case I would say that you need to try as hard as you can to convince your client that

33
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:18,030
what they're doing is wrong and you need to be very specific about why you believe that that can be

34
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,620
very difficult to explain.

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,460
A lot of times this is very subjective you're just going to say that color doesn't look good.

36
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,750
How do you objectively explain that the color doesn't look good.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,010
It can be difficult but try your hardest and as long as you make sure that you give repeated efforts

38
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,780
to explain it it should be able to get the message that you're very adamant about this being a bad decision.

39
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,280
Past that if it is a portfolio project and not getting a ton of money from it you might want to consider

40
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,380
just walking away and trying to distance yourself from the project.

41
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,300
If you're in the middle of the project maybe it's something that you try to wrap up more quickly and

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,920
you don't try to continue wasting a lot of time and resources on it.

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,210
If you're at the very beginning stages of the project maybe you do really try to just walk away slowly

44
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,960
and try to kind of cut your losses.

45
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,380
Now if it's a big project or it's a repeat client or it's a project that's got a lot of money on the

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,030
line for you then I would suggest you try to suck it up as much as possible.

47
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,390
Obviously try to tell them why you think it's bad and try to explain that it is bad and tell them that

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,190
you do disagree but the end of the day try to keep the client happy at the same time.

49
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,430
You can definitely put as much effort as you can into minimizing the damage they do.

50
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,930
Maybe this new design thing they're putting in a new change.

51
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,030
It's only very minimal what you can do is you can try to offer them alternatives.

52
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,010
You can try to even suggest putting that section somewhere else.

53
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,760
You can also suggest other features that could potentially replace it or offer new design alternatives.

54
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,060
You can even go as far as to do some of that work for free for them because you know that if they do

55
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,280
it themselves even though you get paid for that additional work or that design it's actually going to

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,950
be a detriment to the project as a whole and that's what you don't want.

57
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,900
So guys this happens a lot I think as long as you're conscientious about the fact that it's going to

58
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,810
happen.

59
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,720
You can figure out a way through it if it's a very important project.

60
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:23,100
Then you need to suck it up but you need to try to at least divert your client towards trying something

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,820
else.

62
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,550
Try to give them alternatives try to get your designers or your friends to give them something as an

63
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,930
alternative that they could use instead.

64
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,110
But on the flip side if this is just a portfolio project or one you're not even crazy about this might

65
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,560
be the impetus for you to walk away if you work with clients that have very bad design and feature taste.

66
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,670
They're probably not going to be successful at their project and they're probably going to have this

67
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,830
problem multiple times along down the road if you end up with an ugly project.

68
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,830
It's very often the case that they blame it on you not realizing that a lot of it is their fault.

69
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,840
That's just a headache you want to avoid.

70
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:12,160
All right guys questions posed in a group discussion otherwise see in the next lecture.
