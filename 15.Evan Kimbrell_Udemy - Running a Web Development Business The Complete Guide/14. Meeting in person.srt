00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,970
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,080
So in this lecture we're going to talk about meeting your client in person.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,700
What should you plan for.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,100
How should you tackle this.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,310
Now if you are using a substantial amount of contractors in your development business you know that

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,610
you couldn't run your entire business without ever actually meeting your clients.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,880
And in my experience the vast majority of them never actually come into our office or meet any of us.

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,350
Why.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:38,910
Well really it's just because today people are more used to working with people through Skype or email

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,580
or using like a sauna.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,350
It's also the case that you might be working with a company on the east coast or on the West Coast.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,860
It's unrealistic that you're going to come visit them unless it's a multimillion dollar project and

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,610
for some reason they really wanted that.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,310
Even if I'm in San Francisco and a company is in San Jose it's pretty unrealistic to think I'm going

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,230
to take an hour and a half to go take the train down there to meet with them for whatever reason.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,810
But in general there are two reasons why you might meet with a client in person.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,510
One is that you need to meet them to close a potential sale.

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,560
Client wants to meet you because they want to see what you're like.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,240
They want to see how quick on your feet you are and they want to see you explain in person what you

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,750
did with your projects in the past and explain your portfolio or explain your approach to their project.

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:31,350
Now the other thing that could happen is you're working with a larger company and they just have a culture

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,960
around the meetings and meeting in person.

23
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,410
And so for them it's actually a considerable hassle to change everything to work only exclusively with

24
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,950
you through Skype or through email.

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,810
So occasionally they expect you to come in to help them deploy or explain something it's going wrong

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,300
or to do basic check ins.

27
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,510
Now in general if you have the opportunity to meet your client in person I do suggest doing it at least

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,950
once.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,990
It really does help establish a bond between you and them.

30
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,270
They know you on a personal level and it's not just an email address that will really help you retain

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,470
clients and have them feel more confident in you.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,800
They feel more confident in you.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,880
They give you a lot more leeway for everything you're going to do now.

34
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,790
Like really anything your success with the meeting in person is really going to come down to your preparedness

35
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,040
your composure and your confidence that you're prepared.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,380
That's really going to come down to how well you can anticipate what they want and what the context

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,400
of the meeting is.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,880
Your composure has more to do with your personality in general and your experience having meetings like

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,680
this and then confidence really just comes down to whether or not you feel confident you can answer

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,460
their questions.

41
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,150
How technical you are or how proud of your portfolio you feel like.

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,220
No I honestly can't help you improve your composure improve your confidence.

43
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,730
That's just something that's going to come with experience and that's going to something that comes

44
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,400
with you trying out different things and being willing to fail.

45
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,930
That's one of the things that I think really will help you de-stress before meetings.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,780
Just understanding that you know not every single client means the world to you.

47
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,880
And then it's really really hard to screw up an in-person meeting.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,000
So I wouldn't necessarily stress out about it.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,680
It's very hard to screw up.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,730
And if they do if you do end up doing that it's not the end of the world.

51
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,540
So now if you are meeting with someone for say it like a sales pitch the thing you need to focus on

52
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,580
is being able to present your past portfolio items.

53
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,810
Being able to explain what those apps do how long the project took you could even say how much it cost.

54
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,230
Being able to demo it in some way will help immensely as well.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,300
So whether or not that's you coming with a bunch of predefined links that you can just talk through.

56
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,400
Or if it's a PowerPoint that helps you talk through different things it's really up to you and it's

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,070
really up to your style.

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,720
I personally kind of just wing it.

59
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,130
I usually will bring all my portfolio items in because their portfolio items and I spend a lot of time

60
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,800
on I can just talk about them for days and I can show them everything and I can tell them funny anecdotes

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,890
about the project or tell them why the project successful or why it's interesting or yada yada yada

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,770
it should come naturally to you if you are actually part of the project.

63
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,420
But if your type of person needs something more scripted try to put some things down on a PowerPoint

64
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,520
slide just to help you walk through it.

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,440
Now the odds of you using that presentation that might actually be small but just knowing that you have

66
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,500
that prepared will help you immensely.

67
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,500
The other part of an in-person meeting for like a sales meeting is that they want to know on a personal

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,190
one to one level you understand what their project needs are.

69
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:42,120
So you need to focus more on being empathetic to what their user problems are connecting with them on

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,560
what problem they're trying to solve and help them understand that you get what they're trying to do.

71
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,740
In general this is not a time for you to dictate and tell them what they should do with their application.

72
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:59,710
You should absorb their vision their idea their project requirements and insert your insight and your

73
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,140
wisdom when you can.

74
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,910
It's OK to be quiet during these meetings because you are listening to them.

75
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,290
Don't try to set the tone by being away too pushy or authoritarian.

76
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,420
They're not here for a strategy consultant necessarily but they are looking for someone who is an expert

77
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,370
in making awesome products.

78
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,160
So they want someone who can at their appropriate times insert some information tell them that oh that's

79
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,020
not going to work or tell them hey this is an interesting idea you could try out.

80
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,910
Now if you're trying to meet with someone in person or company in person simply because it's a check

81
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,680
in.

82
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,210
You need to evaluate a couple things.

83
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,640
One is it worth the client contract if you have to meet them say twice a week.

84
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,740
That's a big contract as it promises that there's gonna be a lot of work in the future that maybe it's

85
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,760
something you should do.

86
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,500
Also if it's a company that just naturally does that they just naturally operate in meetings then you're

87
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,120
going to have to adapt to them and it's not them making you jump through hoops because they don't value

88
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,830
you.

89
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,370
But in general if it's a smaller contract you're not needed the portfolio item.

90
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,690
Maybe reconsider.

91
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,870
Try to factor that into your margins and try to calculate what's the loss in terms of your time and

92
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,790
how much time you could have spent on other things as opposed to traveling and then meeting in person

93
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,700
of these people.

94
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,010
Keep in mind a lot of these meetings are incredibly redundant just in general.

95
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,600
There's rarely a reason that you have to meet in person with someone.

96
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:31,400
There's nothing you can't fix through a phone call or an email or through project management tools.

97
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,370
But if you do have to end up meeting with them try to minimize how often you have to meet with them

98
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,320
try to make it as communion as possible.

99
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,700
Most importantly try to be positive about it.

100
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,300
So and in general regardless of what type of meeting it is always be prepared to talk about yourself.

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,350
But if it's never brought up don't focus on your client and your client's needs and only if they ask

102
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,330
you then be ready to brag about yourself and talk about all the great things you've done before and

103
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,980
what your team is capable of.

104
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,020
Now some of could also help you is that if you're not technical you're not a programmer.

105
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:10,560
Try to explain to people how your process works so that when you don't have say estimates on hand or

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,740
ability to answer deep technical issue questions they actually understand why that is.

107
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,510
Try to explain to them hey this is how we typically work idea what this portion this is.

108
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,040
This is why I think this is not working but if you give me this amount of time I can get back to you

109
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,690
very easily.

110
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,580
It might be a little frustrating but if you explain why it is they can't really be frustrated at you

111
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,770
know the last thing they think that's worth covering for in-person meetings is something goofy that

112
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,440
everyone always asks What do you wear.

113
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,750
Well the best advice I can give you is to be like a mirror.

114
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Try to mirror whatever the group is you're going to do and how they dress.

115
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,780
If you go into a fancy bank and financial district try to dress in a suit.

116
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,240
If you go to that meeting and you're underdressed it might not work.

117
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,760
The reason don't you want a mirror what other people do is that people just naturally again notice patterns.

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,950
But also they have a tendency to trust people that look like them.

119
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,470
So a banker who wears a pinstripe suit is probably going to trust a web developer or also dresses in

120
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,120
a suit with pinstripes.

121
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,760
If you walked into that meeting wearing flip flops in a hoodie.

122
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,550
Mark Zuckerberg style you might stick out so much that they're going to spend more time thinking about

123
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,210
why you don't fit in and less time thinking about whether or not your proposal is any good.

124
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,970
Now the opposite end of the spectrum is what if you go to like one of those startups those San Francisco

125
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:37,160
startups and where everyone is dressed in practically pajamas.

126
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,420
Now if that's the case what I always say is there's always going to be a bare minimum of professionalism

127
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,950
you should ever drop to and with regards to your dress code if you're going to one of these places it's

128
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,170
always worth dressing up a little bit more than them try to go with something more casual but you're

129
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,230
never going to get blamed for wearing something slightly nicer.

130
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,080
No one's going to kill you for wearing a button up with jeans.

131
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,700
And in fact you'll find that it probably doesn't even stick out at all.

132
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,980
But don't ever get so low that you look unprofessional.

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,010
A lot of companies are ultra casual because when they're working in the in their work environment they're

134
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,780
not trying to impress anyone.

135
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,970
You on the other hand pretty much are.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,790
And honestly the rule here pretty much is if as long as you're confident you can probably pull it off.

137
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,820
Try to match what they wear and if you don't know what they wear try to pick something and a happy medium

138
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,410
that's professional but slightly relaxed.

139
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,490
No one's ever going to fault you for that.

140
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,420
And you know going forward now you know OK guys if you have any other questions you want me to look

141
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,680
over your wardrobe and tell you if you look ridiculous posts in the group discussion.

142
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:49,230
Otherwise I'll see the next lecture.
