Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.480
So in this lecture we're going to talk about hedging your launch date which is a strategy you can use

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.510
with your clientele that can save you a lot of headaches and make your process go a lot more fluidly.

4
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.290
So I always like to think of a project timeline like a car trip you take from point A to Point B.

5
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.230
Except in this car trip a lot of places along the way from point A to Point B.

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.640
There's a bunch of hidden landmines Now there could be 100 landmines or there could be one or two or

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.110
maybe there's even zero.

8
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.920
You might hit all hundred and you might not hear a single one.

9
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.740
The point is even if you're fantastic calculating how fast your car drives and how far the distances

10
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.460
from point A to Point B.

11
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.210
And if you've driven this route before it all doesn't really matter because you can't really calculate

12
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.900
how many land mines are going to hit and each one of them could take up a day or two of your time.

13
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.920
People will get sick.

14
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.270
Services that you use for information their API will get taken down.

15
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.480
Other companies you use for information their services will go down people you rely on for assets like

16
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.180
a graphic designer for design assets or outside of your business.

17
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.240
They could be late all of the stuff.

18
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.410
It happens all the time.

19
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.070
Now the only way that I've found you can consistently avoid the fallout from missing a deadline because

20
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.370
of some other issue you couldn't possibly foresee is to hedge your launch date.

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.860
OK so let's take an example.

22
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.930
Say you have a project.

23
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.660
It's a month long project and it's launching on July 1st.

24
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.800
Now is your client launching their product on July 2nd.

25
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.230
Well probably not.

26
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.800
So why say I'll deliver the product on July 1st when you can easily just get away with saying I'll deliver

27
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.540
it the first week of July.

28
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.720
Now it sounds sloppy to say that but you'd be surprised how few people actually care whether or not

29
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.900
they have a single day that everything's going to be delivered.

30
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.690
Now remember the sticklers for timeline are typically the clients that are going to be unrealistic about

31
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.110
the project and are probably going to be headaches down the road.

32
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.590
So hedge your bets plan on heading and least a couple landmines.

33
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.200
And again landmines mean any issue that can blow up and take a couple days of your time that you couldn't

34
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.520
possibly have foreseen.

35
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.760
So if you have the option to say a specific date or a range of dates always pick the range of dates

36
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.240
even if you think you know exactly the day you're going to deliver it.

37
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.700
Your future self will thank you immensely.

38
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.770
How is this possible.

39
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.550
Well deadlines and development projects are very rarely set.

40
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.370
The only time anyone ever cares is if you're giving a timeline that takes a disproportionate amount

41
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.030
of time or it's unrealistically short.

42
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.370
That's the only time something is a huge problem.

43
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.430
The difference between launching on July 1st or launching anywhere from July 1st to July 7th is absolutely

44
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.290
minimal.

45
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:09.930
So hedge your launch date say the week of July say the weekend after July say July 1 to 2 or July 1

46
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.900
to 4.

47
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.380
But the point is though internally then plan to launch on July 1st.

48
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.700
You just gave yourself some significant breathing room that can save you in a pinch.

49
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.820
And remember if your client is specific about it being delivered on July 1st and not July 2nd your client

50
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.910
probably sucks.

51
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.840
Your client is probably a bad person.

52
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.490
So it's not someone that you really want to have a long term relationship anyway.

53
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.550
All right guys you just want as much as you can what a lot of people don't realize is that deadlines

54
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.950
are often kind of up in the air you can set the tone and a lot of people are perfectly fine with there

55
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.220
being a wide range even if they ask you why you could say well potentially some issues should could

56
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.240
arise.

57
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.010
So use that to your advantage.

58
00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:04.810
All right guys questions post in the groups scutcheon otherwise see the next lecture.
