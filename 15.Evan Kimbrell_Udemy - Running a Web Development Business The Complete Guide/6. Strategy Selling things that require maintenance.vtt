Hey guys welcome back to of course so in this lecture I want to talk about a strategy that can help

2
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.580
you close early contracts early on in your business.

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.030
There's another strategy that you can use effectively.

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.500
It really kind of just depends what you're trying to go for but it's a technique you should least be

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.070
aware of.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.110
Now I call this one cell things that require maintenance.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.100
Now there's a little bit more to that.

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.010
What I mean by that is if you are particularly going after clients or projects that you know have ongoing

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.650
work.

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.240
What that means to you is that you can rationalize giving them a heavier discount up front because over

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.140
time it's going to pay itself off.

12
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.040
Now it's a good strategy because you know that whatever you're doing is going to require updating maintenance

13
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.890
it's often going to get expanded but the client is not necessarily thinking about that.

14
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.110
So I'll give you an example.

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.400
Wordpress is a very popular platform I think it actually powers something like 20 percent of the Internet

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.870
right now.

17
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.600
One strategy that I've seen work very often is people will go after others who have blogs and will propose

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.640
to put it on wordpress.

19
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.630
It is a good thing to do.

20
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.960
The reason why that is helpful is because when you put it on wordpress the client can actually edit

21
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.600
minimally.

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.920
But what almost inevitably always happens is that they want more customization than WordPress can offer.

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.830
Now there are an infinite number of things you can do to WordPress and a lot of them are all small pieces

24
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.660
and chunks.

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.580
So there are things that are very easy to charge Additionally and theyre very easy to suggest up to

26
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.310
the client because the price is so low.

27
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.110
There are also certain applications just in general not just platforms that just typically are going

28
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.800
to require more maintenance if you are working with a startup that's launching an application and you

29
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.120
know that they're launching with an MVP.

30
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.840
You can obviously subsidize the price upfront.

31
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.750
Get yourself in the door establish that they trust you you can work with them and then you know that

32
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.760
you can benefit from the dividends along the road as they have to update it as they have to go to version

33
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.700
one as they have to update things like security and as they have to iterate once they get some user

34
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.430
feedback.

35
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.220
So be aware of the fact that a lot of projects require maintenance work or at least put you in a position

36
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.100
to up sell them very strongly.

37
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.160
So if that's the case make sure that you compensate on the front end and make sure that the upfront

38
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.540
cost is lower.

39
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.590
Getting in the door with a client is always the hardest part.

40
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.000
Once youve worked with them getting more work from them or having them choose you as their preferred

41
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.940
vendor its so much easier.

42
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.490
Okay so if you're working in platforms take a look around try to look at things that might lend itself

43
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.060
to a project that is kind of ongoing.

44
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.860
Look for those relationships subsidize them upfront to get more of them sooner and to get over kind

45
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:12.500
of that barrier of acceptance that a new client has seen the next lecture.
