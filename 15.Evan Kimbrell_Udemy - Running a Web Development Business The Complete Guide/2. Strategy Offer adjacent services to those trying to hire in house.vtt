00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.060
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to go for a strategy that worked

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.630
for us at Sprint track quite well.

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.940
It's offering adjacent services to potential clients.

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.100
Now it's a little bit different than say pitching your idea to someone who has already said they are

5
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.190
interested in getting development services done.

6
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.890
It's a little more nuanced than that.

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.460
I call it adjacent because you're going at people who might be interested in what you want but haven't

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.100
yet declared that they are interested.

9
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.540
We're going to go over a strategy that works for us and then I'm going to explain how you could adapt

10
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.010
this to your situation.

11
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.220
So let's go to the screencast Jason marketing is that typically if you're running a development firm

12
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.370
you're going to market directly to people who you think need development services.

13
00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.850
So typically are going to look for people who have posted projects online people who are startups or

14
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.960
entrepreneurs who typically look for contractors.

15
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:11.120
Now another way of going at this is actually to think about people who have adjacent needs to that.

16
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.150
So a lot of people out there are not necessarily looking for a contractor but they need Development

17
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.330
Services So probably they're looking for employees perhaps they're looking for development employees

18
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.530
developers.

19
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.400
Now if you're not aware that is one of the most competitive job fields in the United States and in the

20
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.760
world and it probably will be for a very long time.

21
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.470
That is why salaries for programmers are so through the roof one of many reasons because it's such a

22
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.760
there's such a large amount of competition for their attention.

23
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.020
There are a lot of firms hiring are looking for programmers who are in need of web developers but there

24
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.810
are not a lot of programmers relative to how many people are looking.

25
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.780
So what happens a lot of the time is that people look and look and look for developers and they get

26
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.560
frustrated.

27
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.160
So what you can do and what we call adjacent marketing is you go after people who need the same thing

28
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.630
but they want it a different way.

29
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.520
And so what you can do is you can get in front of them and find a way of pitching your services and

30
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.650
using that as an avenue for converting sales and getting client.

31
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.810
So where would you go to look for someone who needs programming help but is more interested in an employee.

32
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.720
Now you can see who I brought up San Francisco Bay Craigslist Craigslist is probably the most ubiquitous

33
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.490
of all job posting boards.

34
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.830
Thats why I brought it up as an example where we could use Montsoreau dot com we could even use more

35
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.490
expensive ones like the ladders.

36
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.680
We can really use anywhere where you'd see jobs being posted or companies who are reaching out for programmers

37
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.960
and developers.

38
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.720
So in this case Craigslist is a great way of showing you how this theoretically would could work.

39
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.860
You use this in a lot of different ways.

40
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.830
I'm going to show you how we actually did it.

41
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.550
So Craigslist is where a lot of people post for depending on the area.

42
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.520
Twenty five dollars is seventy five dollars looking for specific jobs.

43
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.190
If IRA just do literally go over to jobs I could go to web info design.

44
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.140
You can also look for software design software QAD B-A.

45
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.350
A lot of people post in both of these so make sure to look at both sections.

46
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.850
We'll just go to a web info design for now.

47
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.270
So really what you can do is look for people who need something that you can do.

48
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.890
So a lot of these people are looking for designers if you offer design services this might be the case

49
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.870
but if you're not then maybe you need to look for something else.

50
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.640
So what you could do is just look for something that matches what your what you actually offer.

51
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.820
So let's say theoretically we do work with Magento and we do do front end development.

52
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.830
So what I could do is I could just click this company to see whether or not there's something on here

53
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.450
that they need that we cannot do.

54
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.010
And chances are we can probably do all of it or learn how to do some of it and that's quite literally

55
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.240
it.

56
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.520
Right.

57
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.190
So I found someone who needs work done that I can do.

58
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.910
They want it done a different way but they'd care enough to essentially show off who they are.

59
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.800
And now I know exactly who they are so quite literally all you'd have to do is just take the name and

60
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.450
then find their web site.

61
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.730
So in this case we'd look for creative circle

62
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.150
OK.

63
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.620
And you know it's not always as easy.

64
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.650
But in this case it was very very easy so right there creative circle.

65
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.120
Now every single company whose list this is going to list who they are.

66
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.580
No one's going to apply for a job.

67
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.440
They don't know who they're applying to.

68
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.360
Especially in such a competitive area.

69
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.930
So we found creative circle and then almost always they're going to have some information where you

70
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.890
can contact them.

71
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:17.780
So one way of contacting them is quite literally to use their contact forms like this or use any generic

72
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.370
e-mail they offer up as a way to contact them while on.

73
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.480
Now you know you've identified a group of people that need something you can offer.

74
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.020
Obviously they want it slightly differently but because programmers and developers are really competitive

75
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.530
really hard to get a lot of these people end up empty handed and frustrated which means they could very

76
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.320
much be open to your services.

77
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.200
So what we can quite literally do is just contact them directly.

78
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:54.350
Now I'm not going to give you directions on how you would contact them but you just need to essentially

79
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.970
be able to connect with them make them understand that you do offer similar services.

80
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.440
Make them understand that it's cheap fast or whatever your value proposition is.

81
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.150
And that's really about it.

82
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.350
If you wanted to take this one step farther or you're getting a lot of Web sites that do not list ways

83
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.510
of contacting them.

84
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.070
What you can do is just look up the people who work in the company now.

85
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.200
The vast majority of the people who are going to be posting for developers under the job boards those

86
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.440
people are going to have about OSS pages and they're probably going to list out someone who works for

87
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.830
the company.

88
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.150
And if you can't find someone who works for the company immediately you can always just use some other

89
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.680
search techniques.

90
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:47.710
You can always search for their name plus SEO or CTO or something like along those lines and tell essentially

91
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.580
you can figure out someone who works at this company.

92
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.950
OK.

93
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.430
So what you could just do is just said creative circle SEO now.

94
00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.380
Be careful because there might be multiple people that have the same name and that's completely normal.

95
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:06.780
It looks like right here on LinkedIn LinkedIn has indexed for us who the CEO is.

96
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:15.290
OK so we can pull up his name we can go back and now here's a basic trick that you can use to try to

97
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.360
contact this person if you know their first name and their last name.

98
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:27.020
And you know the domain that their Web site is operating off of is a very good chance that you can contact

99
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.650
them.

100
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.130
So we know that it's creative circle dot com we know the guy's name is Bill.

101
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.550
I'm not going to try to pronounce his last name so what you can do as you can use what's called an email

102
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:46.170
per mutator Nomen include this in the resource section but this is just a standard marketing trick anybody

103
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.980
who's worked in marketing has probably use this technique.

104
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.160
We just tailor it specifically for our purposes.

105
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.540
And this is part of our campaign that we use to go after people who were looking for long term developers.

106
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.510
But in the meantime needed some stopgap development work.

107
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.880
So what I can do is just copy and paste their name

108
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:25.990
and it gave you the most common formats for names that you would be very much surprised but if I were

109
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:32.620
to e-mail every single one of these there's probably a 70 percent chance that I get the person's e-mail

110
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.710
address correctly.

111
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:40.350
Now that is because people are just they don't really think about their e-mail address they want to

112
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.990
think it's something that's really simple and they want to have authority so they're going to use their

113
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:49.450
top level domain which is whatever their web site is and then they're obviously going to use something

114
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.970
that's easy to remember or at least easy to recognize them and it almost always follows some one of

115
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.970
these 34 formats now.

116
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.570
No really.

117
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:05.020
All you have to do is just copy and paste and email all of them you pretty much immediately will have

118
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.570
33 of them bounce.

119
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.880
And one of them will be delivered and that one.

120
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.910
Like I said about 70 percent of the time will be delivered.

121
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:18.250
So that is one way that you can contact people who specifically have put themselves out there looking

122
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:25.030
for development services past that it is really up to your ability to put a lot of time and effort into

123
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.110
the strategy.

124
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.550
It's up to you to figure out a compelling message for them to get them to respond.

125
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.780
Keep in mind it's an unsolicited message.

126
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.600
So your response rates are often lower.

127
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.080
So it might be something that takes a little bit of effort but it's one of those things that with an

128
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:48.160
hour of time you can easily come away with four or five good leads that you're ready to process and

129
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.000
could potentially turn into clients that can make you lots of money.

130
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:57.100
It's something that you can do over and over and over again if you put a lot of time and effort into

131
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:04.620
crafting your message or finding exactly people who exactly fit the profile of what you offer.

132
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.820
Then you can really come away with a lot of long lasting clientele.

133
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.220
We have a lot of clientele who we've found through this matter and they love it because they were all

134
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.400
really struggling to fill their programmer roles.

135
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:26.680
And we kind of saved the day in terms of keeping their company from hitting a standstill and we pretty

136
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.380
much were able to just fit in right where they needed us.

137
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.230
Now if you also are a freelancer as an individual and you're trying to grow as a freelancer is also

138
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.790
a fantastic way of doing that you're saying hey I need someone needs this specific person but I can

139
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.750
do it on a contract basis for this long or in whatever way that you need it.

140
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:50.320
So this is a technique you can use it in the success really is going to depend on how well you understand

141
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.620
what you offer and how much time you put into it.

142
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.170
But think about adjacent marketing opportunities.

143
00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:01.330
You offer development services with a lot of people need web sites but they're not going to ask for

144
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.840
it in the same exact way.

145
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.950
And a lot of them just haven't thought about whether or not they want to do contracting per say so try

146
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:17.200
to get your face try to get your website into the attention of other people who roughly need the same

147
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:17.950
thing.

148
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:23.800
You'll find out very quickly that this has a very high response rate and it's something that can generate

149
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.220
a lot of leads.

150
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:30.010
All right guys any questions posed in the group session if you have anything else you want me to cover

151
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.610
always make sure that you're posting that as well in the group discussion.

152
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:45.550
And I'm more than willing to make additional lectures otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
