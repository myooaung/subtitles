1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,010
Hey guys we'll come back to the course.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,920
So in this lecture I thought it be helpful to go over some other web development firms just so you can

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,030
get an idea of what they look like how they structure their information in their web presence and what

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,790
do they choose as important information and what are the things that they kind of skip over.

5
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,700
So this entire section we're going to talk about how you can get up and create a web presence that looks

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,450
good and do that with a minimal amount of effort investment and money later on.

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,760
We're going to talk about how you can improve your web presence.

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,140
But if you listen to the 80:20 lecture we talked obviously about how you need to just start with what

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,810
you can and there's a lot of really cool kind of loopholes to getting up a web presence that looks quite

10
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,140
good and cost you kind of nothing.

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,440
So I thought again it would be helpful to show you guys what they look like so that going through the

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,650
next lectures you're not completely lost.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,210
So what I did is I pulled up three Web sites and so we can just kind of take a glance at these.

14
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,950
I pulled up my company which is Sprint kick shameless plug I thought brought up thought bought which

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,940
is a popular design and development firm out of Boston.

16
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,370
And then I brought up sapient Nitro sapient is a company that's been around for ever.

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:36,720
They've been they were a big agency even back in the dot com days in 99 2007 and they've grown pretty

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,030
much exponentially since then but they still kind of made their mark and they're still known for being

19
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,780
a web agency.

20
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,280
So we're going to use these three to kind of look them over and go over what are the kind of consistent

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,040
things you'll see across the board.

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,690
As you look at popular Web sites that bring up one other one which I think is worth looking at there

23
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,550
are a smaller group out of Chicago.

24
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,780
I think these guys are also worth looking at.

25
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,900
You'll realize very very quickly that there is a pattern across the board.

26
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,230
Now the first thing I want to point out it's actually more or less a trend.

27
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,940
It's something that's become popularized in the last four years.

28
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,030
Three years ish for a lot of good reasons but it's not necessarily something that you have to follow

29
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,530
it's something that you should be aware of and it's a very effective page design.

30
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,520
So now what I'm referring to is that all of these Web sites have what we call the long page design meaning

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,100
that when I hit this page right now do you see obviously what they want you to see they see a navigation

32
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,950
bar at the top but what happens is all I have to do is scroll down and it will show me the same information

33
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,900
that I would have seen if I clicked on these buttons.

34
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,260
Almost so you can see this across pretty much all of them.

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,050
So if I go down on thought bot see how it goes who we are then it goes well we made what we think it's

36
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,550
a long page design meaning that below the fold of the Web site.

37
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,140
There's a lot more content.

38
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,290
You can see this an octopus.

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,420
Well we can just keep scrolling down and we kind of receive their entire pitch and at the very bottom

40
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,600
we catch their information.

41
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:17,070
And honestly if we were to just pull up any random design firm you probably would see something very

42
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:23,830
similar or we could just say Florida web design or web development sorry

43
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,250
OK and so this is pretty much a random one that you've seen I've already seen this one before.

44
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:39,130
But again they use that long page design like we can just keep going all the way down and they'll hit

45
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,010
on the same types of information.

46
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,460
OK the exception obviously is our Web site.

47
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,500
We decided not to do that.

48
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,000
We thought it was just a little bit too cliche but if you want to fit in with the other web development

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,180
firms it's definitely something to think about.

50
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,980
Now there's something to be said about imitating other Web sites especially at the beginning of your

51
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,720
business.

52
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,510
People are pattern recognizing creatures meaning that they always look for patterns whether or not they're

53
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,490
doing it consciously or not.

54
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:16,180
So if the majority of web development firms out there like to use a long page design where the majority

55
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,960
of very well designed agency Web sites like this format then you can't really go wrong by emulating

56
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,650
it and using something similar because a lot of people will subconsciously associate this design with

57
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,390
quality.

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,980
And they might subconsciously associate it with web agencies or web development firms.

59
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,050
OK so let's try to dissect these Web sites just a little bit more so you can kind of understand that

60
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,900
they all pretty much have the same information.

61
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:50,320
The only thing that changes is really what they're saying and how they actually design their Web site

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,360
what colors they use what graphics they use.

63
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,350
And there's a little bit of variability but not a ton.

64
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,930
So first off what you'll notice is that every single web agency or web development firm as soon as you

65
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,160
hit their page you pretty much have whatever it is that they want you to first know about them.

66
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,150
Now I call this the hook.

67
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,580
Now what do I mean by a hook.

68
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,800
Typically what that just basically means is when you hit the front page they have one big sentence that

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,720
they want to get across to you.

70
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,800
It's usually a distilled message about their company.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,910
It's exactly what they want you to think about them in one sentence.

72
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,210
So we did that as well with the exception of this.

73
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,210
This was a new service that we launched about a year ago and started promoting it.

74
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,500
But previous to that it was like this.

75
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,340
This is what you would see.

76
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,200
You'd actually hit our front page.

77
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,140
What we said is we design and build beautiful scalable apps and Web sites every day.

78
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,110
So that was the first thing we want you to know and this is a picture of a Web site that we had created

79
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,230
about a year and a half ago.

80
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,050
Similarly you'll notice this and thought but let's design develop and grow your product.

81
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,330
OK.

82
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,950
That's a hook.

83
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,690
That's the first thing they want you to think.

84
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,510
Then they have a subtitle that kind of elaborates on that pretty much all of them use this technique.

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,260
If we hit Octa what they'll do is they'll probably show you their best portfolio item or they'll put

86
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,850
some kind of a line that intrigues you.

87
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,940
Really the first thing they see should be something that's a little bit glamorous something that is

88
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,110
interesting to a random passer by something that really gets their attention.

89
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,990
Now any of you guys out there that do content marketing or e-mail marketing know that the first element

90
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,810
in all of your email should be something that's Attention getting.

91
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,500
So I call it a hook.

92
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,310
And so a lot of that's because a lot of people will use some catchy settings or catchy distillation

93
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,070
of what they believe about their company as the first thing.

94
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,380
And some people take a different strategy towards it.

95
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,170
Like with sapient nature you can see the first thing I see is something really high resolution something

96
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:58,500
really pretty something that they've been working on that's really popular.

97
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:04,260
You'll notice also what something that's very common is this it'll be a hook that automatically scrolls.

98
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,920
And the reason why people do that is because they want you to think that there's a lot going on at their

99
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
firm.

100
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,400
They also don't want to lose your attention.

101
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,470
So if I hit this page and I'm not entirely sure if I want a higher speed nitro or I'm sure what they

102
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:23,800
do they want to make sure that while I'm processing that information staring at this image they're going

103
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,750
to be able to show me something else and to keep me staring at it.

104
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,480
And it's a basic kind of technique to keep me on the page longer.

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,710
OK.

106
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,060
So pretty much all of them will try to show off either a hook or something they're really really proud

107
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,990
of as the first thing you see.

108
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:46,960
OK so the second element that you'll notice is almost all of them with in you know at least either zero

109
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,390
or one click away from their front page.

110
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:55,720
They will try to explain to you in some way what their value proposition is and this is a little bit

111
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,090
harder to kind of tease out.

112
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,360
But previously we talked about how you're going to plan out your value strategy.

113
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,710
How are you going to figure out what you are.

114
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,970
Remember good cheap and fast.

115
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,730
You'll notice very quickly that these people want to very quickly give you a pitch at what they're good

116
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,860
at what they do.

117
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,460
And you know why do people trust them et cetera et cetera.

118
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,840
So like right over here.

119
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,040
So in the case of thought but we can see right here it's actually in their subtitle focusing on user

120
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,070
outcomes and simplicity we minimize risk and increase your product success with quality and called humans.

121
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:35,190
OK so what are they pushing they're pushing that they are user focused.

122
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,630
That's kind of a buzzer buzz word a little bit today.

123
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,740
That's opposed to client focused that's opposed to business focused they're more focused on the end

124
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,050
user experience or really what that means is that they're kind of pitching that hey we really put a

125
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,530
lot of thought into user experience.

126
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,510
A lot of development firms focus on technology first.

127
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,130
A lot of them are more graphic design kind of focused and in this case basically what they're saying

128
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:05,070
is we are user experience focused simplicity.

129
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,570
That's another one they're kind of pitching at you.

130
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,940
Some people like to pitch simplicity that means that they probably like minimalist design they like

131
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,450
things that are simple and good and they're obviously looking for people who find that interesting as

132
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,080
well.

133
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,030
And then right here we can see we minimize risk and increase your product success with quality code

134
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,320
and quality humans all focus on this section the sentence first we minimize the risk and increase your

135
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,960
product success.

136
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:37,390
What they're basically saying here kind of in between the lines is that they're trying to pitch themselves

137
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,970
as more of an integrated firm.

138
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,310
Now what do I mean by that they're saying when we work with you we're married to your bottom line.

139
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,780
We don't just build something handed off you launch it it's your problem what they're saying is we focus

140
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,850
on you as an organization and whatever we build is going to be in line with whatever we think is going

141
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,530
to make you successful.

142
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,940
That's really what they're going for.

143
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,680
We're saying you know we minimize your risk why would a web development agency CARE ABOUT YOUR risk

144
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,740
and increase your product success.

145
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,370
Again that's something you don't hear all the time in web development agencies are really focusing on

146
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,510
your success because at the end of the day if you're not successful they're saying that we're not happy.

147
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,480
I know they say is quality code quality code quality humans.

148
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,610
They're just kind of be trying to be witty by comparing code to humans and blood.

149
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,760
People say quality code.

150
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,040
So it's kind of funny to say quality humans.

151
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,560
Haha I think it's a play on them being thought bot like they're a robot.

152
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:37,150
Yeah I mean this is literally just kind of jibberish But what they're trying to say is we are a high

153
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:43,930
end firm high end firms focus on code quality and so whatever we build is beautiful and in a later lecture

154
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,920
we talk a little bit about what is code quality and why does it matter.

155
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,170
Because it really just at the end of the day doesn't really mean anything.

156
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,840
It's something that clients really kind of hang on to but they don't necessarily always know what it

157
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,740
means.

158
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,490
And then quality human is just talking about hey you're gonna have a great experience with us because

159
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,640
we're great people.

160
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,210
OK.

161
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,960
So really that's their value proposition.

162
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,950
And we would get little bits of it more as we read down the list.

163
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,940
You can see right here value proposition.

164
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,520
They're basically saying hey we're experts we do all three things iOS Android and the Web.

165
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,870
OK so that's their value prop.

166
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,480
They do multiple platforms multiple types and then right here we know that they're very experienced

167
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,430
as you notice 100 plus organizations.
