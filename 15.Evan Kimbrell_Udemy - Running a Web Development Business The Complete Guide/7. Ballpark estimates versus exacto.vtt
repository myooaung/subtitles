00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.180
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.360
So in this lecture we're going to talk about an estimation and a proposal strategy that can make it

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.340
a lot easier to close sales.

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.070
So one strategy here at Sprint cook we found that has dramatically increased our conversion rate in

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.720
terms of how many people we have come to us ask us about a project and then we convert them into a paying

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.260
client is our ability to give two types of estimates.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.780
Now we're to cover in this course in depth how you can build out proposals and proposals that were recovered

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.330
the main type of estimation where you give them one big grand estimate for the entirety of whatever

9
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.610
it is they're asking you to build.

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.630
But there's one other skill that is very very worth defining and very much worth developing and that's

11
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.520
a skill to give what we call a ballpark estimate.

12
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.890
So this is the ballpark estimate strategy.

13
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.530
So if someone came to you and said I need this application built it does this in us in this it looks

14
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.190
like this.

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.090
And it has these features you would probably give them a full size estimate and you'd probably list

16
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.860
out every single item every single task and you give them a lot of detail.

17
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.010
But there's a lag period in between the time they ask for that and by and then between when you deliver

18
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.910
it to them.

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.700
So it could be two days three days it could be we could even be a month if it's a big project and you

20
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.210
are sacked with other work during that time.

21
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.920
There are probably going to be looking at other vendors and other development businesses and they're

22
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.370
obviously going to be biased towards whoever gets back to them first.

23
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.290
So what are the strategies we use.

24
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.390
And this really helped us especially at the very beginning was giving ballpark estimates.

25
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.810
So what we decided to do was when someone describes an idea to us we try to get as much information

26
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.800
as we can if they're missing anything that's OK then what we do is we just come up with a range and

27
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.710
that range could be very wide.

28
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.840
Typically the first number is half of the second number.

29
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.030
That's how big the range is.

30
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.430
But ballpark estimates are helpful for a couple reasons.

31
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.760
1.

32
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.600
A ballpark estimate tells the client whether or not you guys are even communicating in the same space.

33
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.560
Clients thinking this is a thousand dollar project and you're thinking it's a ten thousand dollar project.

34
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.820
A ballpark estimate will answer that for them very quickly.

35
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.800
A lot of times you waste your time building out estimates.

36
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.240
You send it to the person they never respond probably because they didn't think that that was what the

37
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.710
price was going to be they're probably thinking it had one fewer digit.

38
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.860
So to save yourself last time and lost leads you should develop a skill to basically estimate out just

39
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.960
a range that you know it's going to fall.

40
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.010
And another reason why a ballpark estimates is useful is because not a lot of other people do this.

41
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.250
And if you give that to them that basically means that you know while there might be waiting on for

42
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.940
other companies to come back with full estimates they already have information from you.

43
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.860
So they're obviously going to interact with you and you can kind of whittle it down you can give them

44
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.940
explanations for why it's that range.

45
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.950
You can even frame the conversation.

46
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.260
You basically give them an anchor point how to frame this entire discussion.

47
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.930
And you're the one who delivered the information the quickest.

48
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.030
So it's a time saving technique because you can find out very quickly whether or not you're about to

49
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.550
waste a lot of time and a real estimate.

50
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.460
And it really helps because you get ahead of all your competition because you can give them something

51
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.930
very quickly now.

52
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.930
Never come up with a ballpark on the spot.

53
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.710
Always have your contractor or if you're a programmer always you yourself sit down and actually try

54
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.970
to run some theoretical numbers the way you protect yourself is by saying a range that's quite wide.

55
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.950
Now remember you know if I said it's 200 hours to 400 hours you might think that's really really imprecise

56
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.130
but to someone who's looking for any idea of how big their project is that's actually very helpful because

57
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.720
they usually do not know whether or not it's 200 hours or two thousand hours.

58
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.440
They just don't know they have no experience in this industry.

59
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.140
So protect yourself by hedging make sure that you have a wide range and make sure that they understand

60
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.960
that if anything changes from what they describe to you right this second that will affect the range.

61
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.240
That's crucial.

62
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.800
They need to understand that they come back to you later and they've added features added a mobile application

63
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.870
or like a mobile display that they didn't talk about before that they should know that that's going

64
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.760
to increase the price if you don't tell them that they're going to think that you gave them a bad estimate

65
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.860
or that you're being shady in some way.

66
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.010
Now this is something that really kind of has some trial and error.

67
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.870
It takes a while to get used to it and it takes awhile to get good at giving ballpark estimates.

68
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.160
And we've been doing this for four years and we get them wrong still all the time.

69
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.410
But what we found is that if you follow some basic advice big ranges and letting them know that any

70
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.680
changes will affect then we're accurate almost 90 percent of the time.

71
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.490
Remember you don't have to be precise if I said a 200 hour range it just has to fall somewhere in that.

72
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.020
Then when you follow up with a real estimate you know that person has accepted the ballpark range.

73
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.740
They probably have the budget for it and they already have more of a rapport with you than with their

74
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.860
with your competitors.

75
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.090
OK.

76
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.350
Like I said this worked out really really well for us.

77
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.220
That was a big technique that made a big jump in.

78
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.370
We used to be you know we have four leads convert.

79
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.350
One we started doing this and we're starting to convert three out of four leads.

80
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.160
Try it out.

81
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.890
Be aware it's difficult at first it's something that you're going to have to master but once you do

82
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.170
get this done it's very very powerful.

83
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.670
Any questions just post in the group discussion probably can't get into the technical details of making

84
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.060
a ballpark estimate.

85
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.110
That's probably going to fall on the shoulders of the team you put together or whether or not you're

86
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.510
a programmer yourself.

87
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.650
Every application is just completely different.

88
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.860
It also depends on your capabilities and your team's capabilities.

89
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.750
All right so in the next lecture.
