00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.470
Hey guys will come back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about whether or not you

2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.740
should direct your development efforts and your marketing efforts towards a specific Neech or whether

3
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.410
or not you should stand back and be more of a generalized development company.

4
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.870
So a lot of you guys who are coming from this from a graphic design perspective or have been freelancing

5
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:34.110
in the past probably know that one of the most effective ways of getting clients and establishing yourself

6
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.730
in the market is by picking a specialization or picking a niche and focusing pretty much all of your

7
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.700
efforts on that specific space.

8
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.910
So you know examples of knishes are lots of development firms will focus specifically on real estate

9
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.800
or specifically on medical technologies hospitals things like that or let's say government.

10
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510
Those are verticals.

11
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.570
That's one way of being a specialist or picking a niche.

12
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.520
But also you can specialize in things like technology.

13
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.760
You can specialize in a specific technology a specific platform a specific framework you can be a development

14
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.930
firm that specializes in security only works with companies that need the highest level of security.

15
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.800
You could specialize in only working with banks.

16
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.580
There are a lot of different ways of doing it.

17
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.510
And a lot of other freelancers or freelance firms they like to specifically pick one area.

18
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.640
So this lecture and talk a little bit about the pros and cons of doing that and to help you understand

19
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.570
that you don't have to necessarily pick a nice you can also take a very generalized approach.

20
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.020
So here at Sprint Qik we don't actually have a specific niche.

21
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.080
We do have a group of people that makes up the core of our customers and that's entrepreneurs.

22
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.230
We specifically work with people who are in startups who are typically after their first round of funding

23
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.050
but usually before their third or fourth.

24
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.680
Now that was a group of people that we didn't necessarily target it just so happened that that group

25
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.340
of people is who we first gain traction with.

26
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.980
And so we kind of created our referral network around that group after a couple of years though we really

27
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.250
started to branch out and we started working with a lot of corporate accounts as well as a lot of government

28
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.780
accounts.

29
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.260
So for all intents and purposes we're pretty much generalized redo mobile applications.

30
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.270
We do web applications.

31
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.400
We do specific technologies we do specific languages.

32
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.240
We don't really care what vertical you're.

33
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.190
And we just noticed that we have a consistent poll from certain groups.

34
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.220
So when considering whether or not you should pick a very specific needs to go after there's a couple

35
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.240
of things you should consider.

36
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.910
1 Do you have a strong network somewhere or do you have strong affiliation somewhere.

37
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.810
If you are an ex real estate agent you might want to go after real estate companies because it's a natural

38
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.780
transfer.

39
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.500
You could naturally talk to those clients understand what they want and understand what they expect.

40
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.030
So in that case that might give you a start.

41
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.000
Now if you don't have any natural affiliations like you don't can't think of a group of people that

42
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.150
you just naturally fit into at least a group of people that's very distinctive then there might be harder

43
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.130
for you to pick a niche since you don't have something that you have a personal connection to.

44
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.420
Now of course you don't necessarily need an affiliation to pick a niche.

45
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.540
You can just pick one arbitrarily something you think would be competitive.

46
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.920
So you think that would give you good margins something that you think that you could access easily

47
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.550
in terms of marketing and advertising.

48
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.380
But typically if you have some sort of connection to the group that's going to make it a lot easier.

49
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.010
Now another thing you should ask yourself is there specifically some kind of technology or some type

50
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.830
of group that you're passionate about working with.

51
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.510
Now previous to starting a development business you probably didn't think to yourself that the way that

52
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.780
you're going to work with this technology or this group of people was by giving them development services

53
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.540
but now that you are starting a development firm it seems like that might actually be a more natural

54
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.840
fit.

55
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.150
So let's take an example if you're someone who's really passionate about web security maybe it makes

56
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.460
sense for you to build something around web security.

57
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.340
Let's say you're passionate about Bitcoin.

58
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.020
Lots of things that are popping up in bitcoin.

59
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.390
If that's the case then it might be such that you should start building applications or building your

60
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.520
marketing efforts around things that have to do with bitcoin in general things that you're passionate

61
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.560
about are going to make this a lot easier.

62
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.800
Now later we're going to talk about advertising strategies that are helpful if you have some basic domain

63
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.330
experience things like white papers things like guest blogs things like that are much much easier if

64
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.890
you actually yourself are really interested in the space that you're going after.

65
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.610
The last thing I'd ask you is how familiar are you with web technologies if you're someone who is brand

66
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.330
new this you're not exactly really well acquainted with what's popular what's not popular What are people

67
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.440
use what's considered good X what's considered bad you X and this is not something you deal have dealt

68
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.500
with previously on a daily basis.

69
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.170
Then I almost would suggest you look into finding a niche.

70
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.820
Typically when you're operating in a niche it's much easier for you to get business within that group.

71
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.590
The barrier for someone giving you money and accepting a project proposal from you is just going to

72
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.310
be lower.

73
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.210
I'll take an example.

74
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.230
The real estate example if you only focused on real estate companies or brokers or whatever it is the

75
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.280
barrier for your web site your web presence your web proposals it's much much lower because people are

76
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.510
instinctively going to trust you because they assume are expert in that space.

77
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.930
That's why we use knishes in general.

78
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.140
I kind of hate to say it but if you want to go after a niche that's typically a good idea if you're

79
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.320
not particularly confident in your ability to make a SNAZZY well-polished professional application if

80
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.940
you don't own a ton of experience in picking a Nishi is typically a good idea.

81
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.300
Now reasons why you would not want to pick a niche are pretty much the opposite of what I just outlined.

82
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.310
If you don't have some really strong passionate pull towards some specific topic area or technology

83
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.640
try more generalized approach.

84
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.560
If you don't have really strong affiliations to one group of people that are your immediate network

85
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.630
they're going to reach out to the first stage of launching this.

86
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.830
Then I would suggest going for a generalized approach the pros to being generalized or that you it's

87
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.760
much easier for you to receive interest from other people if you made a website that only specifically

88
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.950
went after real estate or Bitcoin.

89
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.240
Anybody who comes to your Web site hears about you is interested in your services but has nothing to

90
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.720
do with that.

91
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.770
Nisha that specific area of expertise they're going to be strongly deterred from contacting you or working

92
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.440
with you.

93
00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.340
So if you take a generalized approach you're more likely to capture a wider range of interest.

94
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.600
And then after you've completed some projects on your own you've gone from found a client got the client

95
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.400
signed the proposal created the application deploy the application the clients happy.

96
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.380
After you've done a couple times you'll have a lot more information about whether or not you want to

97
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.260
specialize in an area or if you have a natural area that just works for you and that will help direct

98
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.520
your marketing efforts.

99
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:32.400
So nice or not it's really up to you if you have strong affiliation strong passions about a specific

100
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.150
area or if you have strong domain expertise in a specific area picking a niche might be for you if you

101
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:46.170
also are not particularly Web savvy or it's not really something you have a lot of expertise in.

102
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.780
And your confidence in your ability to create a really high quality polished product something that

103
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.870
you see on a startup's Web site or something you would see unlike like the Webby Awards then picking

104
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.680
an issue might be easier because the barrier to getting sales is much lower.

105
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.120
Now on the other hand if none of those things actually apply to you you might pick a generalized approach

106
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.490
because generalized approaches are much easier in the beginning because you're more likely to capture

107
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.480
interest for a wider variety of people.

108
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.240
Then after that you can figure out which direction you want to go in.

109
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.420
In my opinion either one works.

110
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:27.420
It depends on you making your efforts in this business aligned with you and who you are as a person

111
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.690
are going to make it all so much easier it's going to make you a lot more successful.

112
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.210
All right guys.

113
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.060
Any questions.

114
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.000
In the group scutcheon.

115
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.840
Otherwise shoot me a private message.

116
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:43.260
All right see the next lecture.
