00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.670
Hagar's Welcome back to the course in this lecture.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.990
Let's talk a little bit about how you decide on what design you should use and whether or not it's even

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.140
really an important decision that you have to make at all.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.780
OK so previously we talked about what is a design stack.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.790
And again it's that sandwich of technologies that's going to go into the website you're making in the

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.450
mobile application you're parading.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.750
Now since there are multiple ways of doing the same thing.

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
Occasionally people will have preferences about what language or design stack you use.

9
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.390
So right off the bat are you a programmer.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.400
If you're a programmer I typically suggest working with the technology you're used to.

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.310
There's typically no reason why you should learn a new language.

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.910
It just doesn't really make sense or going to waste a lot of time and you might as well pick the one

13
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.830
that you're good at.

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.800
In general you can use any technology to build really anything.

15
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.320
There's a lot of niche technologies that you're going to have to hire a specialist for anyway.

16
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.630
Or maybe it's a niche that you want to focus on.

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.880
We'll cover that later.

18
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.880
But in general you can make the same web site and ph be that you can make it Ruby on Rails or you can

19
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.660
make in Python.

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.210
It really doesn't actually matter.

21
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.100
So if you already know one of them you're good at one of them.

22
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.030
Stick with that.

23
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.610
And in the future should you need to expand or offer a separate service for a different technology.

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.510
You can do that.

25
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.180
Now keep in mind in my experience especially I've never really had someone be picky about what language

26
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.020
I picked.

27
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.390
Maybe that's because we're a custom application development firm.

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.120
But in general no one's really come up to us and said You have to use this.

29
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.970
The only time it's really mattered is if someone came to us and said hey we already have something we

30
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.360
need you to change it or build on top of it.

31
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.150
And if that's the case and we don't understand their design stack or we don't work with it then we just

32
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.640
simply can't take the project.

33
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.460
So if you're not a programmer then the logic is pretty much the same logic or the same advice that they

34
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.640
give to startups.

35
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.650
A lot of startups came to me when I worked in venture capital and they would say hey I'm really concerned

36
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.500
about what technology we pick to build our application.

37
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.620
And I always said the same thing.

38
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.940
The technology itself doesn't actually matter.

39
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.340
I mean the differences between the two are the benefits to one and the disadvantages you another are

40
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.870
very very marginal.

41
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.000
There are things that you really can get over.

42
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.710
You can build anything in anything.

43
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.500
So what I always said was the technology doesn't matter focus on the people.

44
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.960
So that's the same thing I'm going to tell you and the same thing that helped us become successful.

45
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.680
When you go out and you serve start working with contractors and first building your team putting together

46
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.490
the pieces finding someone who can build each layer of the stack.

47
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.140
Focus on the people that give you the best results the ones that you can communicate with the best and

48
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.700
ignore the technology.

49
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.140
Inevitably you're going to have problems or one person can't work with another because of the technology

50
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.180
but you're always just going to have to default to which person is the best.

51
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.030
And if we're just going to have to go with the technology that they're good with that's the only thing

52
00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.570
that really matters in the future you can expand and cast a wider net or you can take more projects

53
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.480
because all of a sudden you can offer more technologies but at the very beginning it just doesn't matter

54
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.800
you're still going to get 80 percent of the projects because even in the time people don't really care

55
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.030
what it's made in.

56
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.180
They just want it done well they want it done cheaply effectively and on time.

57
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.170
So focus on the people that are going to deliver that and the rest of it's just details.

58
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.050
It doesn't really matter.

59
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.600
OK guys.

60
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.800
Any other questions posed in the group discussion.

61
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.900
A private message.

62
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.720
Otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
