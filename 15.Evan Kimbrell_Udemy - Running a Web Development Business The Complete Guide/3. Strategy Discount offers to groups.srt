00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,380
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this strategy lecture I want to talk about a technique that

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,330
has worked pretty consistently through our history and works for a lot of different design and development

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,470
groups out there.

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,310
So the strategy is just called sponsoring groups.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,990
Now there's a lot of different ways that you can do it.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,400
It obviously helps if you know who exactly you want to go after.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,770
But there's definitely ways you can test this with different groups to see how it works.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,430
So really it's pretty quite simple.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,850
If you've followed the strategy that we talked about with the perpetual discount.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,250
This works especially well but the general idea behind it is that you really just want to go after groups

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:53,040
of people that might fit your potential client profile and then offer to sponsor the group or give discount

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,320
offers to the group.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,690
So either way works.

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,530
One is that you sponsor and it's a way of getting advertising.

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,500
So that's probably not something you want to do at the very beginning and it could be very expensive

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,190
to test.

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,370
But what's more effective is to offer discount development services to groups.

18
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,830
And so essentially you're co-opting their email group.

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,600
So what you typically would do is find a group that fits your category and then you'd really just end

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,370
up reaching out to them.

21
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,110
Now the most effective way of doing this I have found is actually through meetup dot com believe it

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,490
or not.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,100
So they have tons and tons of groups really all over the world for all sorts of things.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:38,280
They have millions of groups and really all you do is try to find an area that's local or try to find

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,460
some group really anywhere that has some sort of relevancy to what you're trying to do.

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,940
And then what you do is just so I just search for San Francisco.

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:58,800
You know if I was interested in startups so maybe we can just take a generic on a CTO school maybe for

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,370
some reason I wanted to run a campaign based off a CTO score or maybe I wanted to do something that's

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,450
nice Should I say real estate.

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,220
So here what I could very easily do is just pick a real estate group so let's you know just pick this

31
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,960
one this one's a group of 569 people.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,260
So right off the bat you can see on the left hand side.

33
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,660
These are all the stats about the group.

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,190
You can see what they're interested in and you can make sure their interests somehow align with what

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,750
you're offering.

36
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,390
And then really the easiest way of getting in contact to them is just get in contact and then you can

37
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,260
just email them and say hey I'm interested in what your group does I'm interested in offering a discount

38
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,440
services to your group and just really kind of take it from there if you are willing to offer a discount

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,610
to their group.

40
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,190
They are more often than not willing to promote that to their group because it's usually a value added

41
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,600
type of situation.

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,450
How much of a discount you want to offer is up to you.

43
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,910
It depends on your business model and it kind of just depends on how aggressive you want to be with

44
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,290
this strategy.

45
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,830
For a while here we were sponsors of you know almost 20 different groups and it always consistently

46
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,130
created a steady trickle of people.

47
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,790
So one other way that can help with your using meetup specifically is that use the word Pearch.

48
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,870
And the reason why is because meetup lets you use these things called perks.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,090
And so what that basically means is small businesses or any type of business interested in Meetup groups

50
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:43,300
can offer perks and perks can range from really anything anything that you offer as a service could

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,250
be a discount it could be a free something it could be free consultation or whatever it is.

52
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,620
That's typically what this would fall under.

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,890
Now meetup doesn't offer the perks feature any more but the vast majority of people still look for perks

54
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,320
and they just do it informally.

55
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,510
So if you contact them and say hey I'd like to add a perk to your group.

56
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,780
That's typically the way that you would start the conversation and you'd say you know I'm willing to

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,310
give it 30 percent discount or whatever it is.

58
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,670
You could even say things like willing to do free work for the group in return for some kind of sponsorship

59
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,640
or offer free services to the group.

60
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,620
That's another strategy you can use.

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,300
OK.

62
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:29,230
So another way of reaching out to groups would just be to actually look for conventions now conventions.

63
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,570
You would have to go.

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,460
You could either go again either pay for a sponsorship or pay for a reduced rate.

65
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,080
This one is really kind of up to your ability to find convention.

66
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:46,240
So you know again if I was interested in real estate I would want to say real estate conventions and

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,360
then you know it's up to you whether or not you would want to put a modifier past that I don't necessarily

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,820
need to say California but at the same time if I look for these and I just say real estate Convention

69
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,720
right here we have a one by real tired out or we have the r e convention these are all very big groups.

70
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:10,540
If you contact them you could very easily get put into contact with anybody who handles any of their

71
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,320
sponsorship.

72
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,600
So it's really going to be up to you to message them and figure out what exactly they would find valuable.

73
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,620
It's also up to you whether or not you want to get really really specific with it.

74
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,580
I had brought this one up because this was a group that we have been back and forth with.

75
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,620
They fit our customer profile quite well because these are non-technical entrepreneurs who are looking

76
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,920
to develop their skills as non-technical entrepreneurs so that fits our group quite well.

77
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,220
And so this has to be ideally something that we could target whether or not it's sponsor emails whether

78
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,920
or not it's paying for visibility whether or not it's just offering our discount to their group and

79
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,140
being listed somewhere doesn't really matter.

80
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,830
You could also do similar things like offering free services.

81
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,900
Another way of looking for groups in general that I've found successful is you can use.

82
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,580
Here's one.

83
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,670
This is actually just a web site so aggregators are quite helpful for organizations.

84
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,120
Meetup is an aggregator for organizations but they're also meet ups.

85
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,370
What I mean by that is a meetup is very different than just a normal organization they're usually created

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
on the meet up web site and they stay on the meetup website.

87
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,260
They're not organizations outside of this typically But if you go to this Web site and I'll put it in

88
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:34,810
the resources career one stop DRG here is a great resource for finding just lists and lists of different

89
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,250
groups by occupation.

90
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,790
So if I really really wanted to go after graphic designers I could type in that so it would be an occupation.

91
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,680
Here's an example what happens you search real estate.

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,860
There's 65 professional associations professional associations are typically easier to get into contact

93
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:57,020
with because they are not as used to being pitched.

94
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,700
They're less concerned about being pitch too if you went to a large convention.

95
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,110
It might take a lot of back and forth and you might have success with smaller conventions at first and

96
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,920
then your budget grows or your ability to kind of say you have a brand grows then you might go for larger

97
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,450
ones but with professional groups are always very hyper local and they're always very engaged.

98
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,270
And so it's it's a very easy way of offering kind of a win win situation.

99
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,250
Here's a graphic design just pulls up a hundred and three and these are all pretty much across America.

100
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,320
And what I'll do is literally link me to their Web site which is fantastic.

101
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,850
And then I can just go from there find someone who's in a role of communications and contact him that

102
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,320
way.

103
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,640
Another way you can do it is actually to just take the area that you're in.

104
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,910
So we're in San Francisco.

105
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,730
So what I could literally do is search for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.

106
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,260
Now whatever city you're in.

107
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,250
Search for that part of what's Chamber of Commerce is do.

108
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,590
Also economic development groups are usually related to it.

109
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,080
They list out business organizations and business groups and it's part of their responsibility to connect

110
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,240
you to them.

111
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,770
Typically you can't say typically because every single Web site is a little bit different but typically

112
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,150
you can hit their page and after some messing around you can usually find it.

113
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,760
San Francisco allows us to look through business profiles.

114
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,400
It also allows us to look through groups that are associated with the Chamber of Commerce and all of

115
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,920
these are here so literally you could just look for upcoming events look for who runs it contact them

116
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,140
and see if you could set up a basic kind of sponsorship sponsorships in general or just a very easy

117
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:45,400
kind of one off things that you can do that are very they bring in a small amount of leads but it lasts

118
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,190
a long period of time.

119
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,420
So the last way that if you are still kind of stuck searching for organizations or groups to sponsor

120
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,050
it honestly just go to Google and here's a great example of that.

121
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,810
So if I had a specific need so take my niece Plus Association or professional group google find a lot

122
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:09,310
of the ones that aren't picked up here and then you could very easily just finds group and contact them

123
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,510
about sponsoring their group.

124
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,930
Anything that has membership anything that has a group that meets regularly.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,660
Those are the type of people.

126
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,900
And those are the types of groups that are typically open to some sort of a sponsored discount or a

127
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:31,210
group discount and they're very easy to target because they have specific needs and they're very open

128
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:38,170
to the idea of offering discounted services to their group members and usually almost always that never

129
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,100
cost anything so.

130
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,910
OK so sponsoring groups is a technique that you should definitely look into.

131
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,180
It's one of those ones that if you offer a discount service upfront that doesn't actually cost you anything.

132
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:59,440
So it's really just free exposure at the very beginning of your development business when you're starting

133
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,610
it.

134
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,700
It's really important to focus on things that have little investment and potentially high are why this

135
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:13,150
is a great opportunity to essentially put nothing on the line in terms of cash because resources are

136
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:20,290
very precious at the very beginning and only focus on things that bring in leads and bring in potential

137
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:20,800
clients.

138
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,990
So this is one of those things that's really just a win win opportunity and it's a very easy to find

139
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,620
these groups and to contact them I typically suggest running a template e-mail and changing it depending

140
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:38,860
on whether or not you it to a meet up group or a professional association or whatever and use that and

141
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,560
just you know if you spend an hour you can very easily get into contact with four or five six different

142
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,820
groups that are probably interested and really just take it from there.

143
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,050
So like I said we ended up sponsoring several groups and we've been doing that for quite a while.

144
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,640
And that's actually been a pretty good steady stream of leads.

145
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,230
If you guys have any other questions just post in the group discussion.

146
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,720
Otherwise all seen the next lecture.
