00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,120
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,540
So in this lecture we're going to talk about an adage that you hear all across the business world which

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,560
is the customer is always right.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,910
You talk a little bit about does that apply to development businesses.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,050
And is that something that you should incorporate in how you do business.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,700
So in development businesses is the client always right.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,350
Well let's answer it literally literally no.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,450
Very frequently they are wrong.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,280
And typically the most common reason why they're wrong is they're trying to make judgments on something

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,690
that they're experts on.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,090
If they were experts in development then they wouldn't have a need to hire you.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,190
But that surely does not stop them from trying to pass judgment or make large project decisions that

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,510
they are not equipped to make.

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,600
Now the true kind of heart of the question is do you treat them as if they right all of the time.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,480
A lot of businesses out there in different sectors different expertise.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,980
They like to focus as if every time there's a complaint the customer is always right.

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,320
And that's one way that they make sure that the customer always stays happy.

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,400
That's something that works for a lot of other different industries.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,880
Now whether or not you want to treat your development business like that that's entirely up to you.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,510
I've seen plenty of development businesses use that kind of motto when it comes to customers and client

21
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,950
disputes.

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,780
So if a client isn't happy with something they were fundaments the client thinks that they cut corners

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,680
somewhere.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,440
They go out of their way to give them free hours and essentially free money to fix whatever the problem

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:37,910
is.

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,710
Now on the other end of the spectrum you definitely have businesses and business owners that are combative

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,510
when presented with a potential problem.

28
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,900
It's always not their fault it's always up to the client to lower their expectations.

29
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,690
Now obviously success lies somewhere in the middle of this spectrum.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,700
My advice for you is to find some kind of balance.

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,730
Now keep in mind this is a highly technical job and your clients are almost never going to be as highly

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,310
technical as the people building their project even if they do have a programming background.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,540
Even in that case they're not going to be so acquainted with the project that they're going to be able

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,810
to be in a position to make good project based decisions.

35
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,670
So in general when it comes to development businesses I say you do this on a case by case basis and

36
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,570
you do not have a strategy really across the board.

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,150
I think in our situation it's too hard to make a general rule about customers and how often they're

38
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,870
right.

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,990
Try to pick the individual details in each individual case and make a decision that way.

40
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,070
There are always going to be times where you made a mistake and unless you're a type of situation where

41
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,160
you don't think you're ever going to see that client again and you maybe you don't want to see them

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,890
ever again you're going to tried to remedy the situation regardless.

43
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,680
Now if you do have to admit fall and this is kind of a side note try not to be overly apologetic that's

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,560
something that really oh Roads Authority be rational.

45
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,430
Explain what went wrong and why the likelihood of this being wrong in the future is very very small

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,800
now.

47
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,250
There's other types of scenarios where the client themselves makes a colossal error.

48
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,010
Now it's either because they tried to make a judgment themselves or maybe they assumed they knew more

49
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,330
than they actually do.

50
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,870
These are really unavoidable and it's pretty much something that you're going to have happen guaranteed

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,960
throughout your business career.

52
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,750
Now I wouldn't fret because in the vast majority of dispute cases but if you've actually gone and detailed

53
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,870
out your process you made sure you had a contract you made sure that you listed out as much as you possibly

54
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,590
can about what you're covering in what timeframe for what.

55
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,630
It's very easy when something goes wrong and there's a misunderstanding to go back and actually look

56
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,380
at exactly what happened and where something went wrong.

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,550
Now of course there's always going to be situations where it's not nearly as cut and clear like that

58
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,840
it's not nearly just a definitional or a technical error or someone just misread something.

59
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,000
Sometimes both sides actually make assumptions unintentionally that they should not have made.

60
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,770
So try to do your best and figure out what exactly went wrong.

61
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,930
Did you simply build something wrong and you yourself forgot to check it.

62
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,200
Did you Bill for something that you didn't actually explain properly.

63
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,600
Is the timeline not sufficiently clear.

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,060
How is your client getting confused when things are going to be delivered.

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,910
If any of those things are the case that's something that you can easily figure out and that is something

66
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,410
that is your fault.

67
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,460
Now on the flip side obviously there are situations where clients are wrong and themselves.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,160
Now you know is your client accusing you of not telling them something when you clearly did tell them

69
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,460
something and you have documentation to show it is your client surprised by a bill that they received

70
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,960
and the reason why they're surprised is because they simply didn't pay attention when you gave them

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,520
the estimate before these are all very likely scenarios that can pop up.

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,040
Now if you have properly documented everything and you left a paper trail all your conversations it

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,100
shouldn't be an issue figuring out who's at fault.

74
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,930
If you're in a type of situation where it's absolutely not your fault then you should deal with that

75
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,030
accordingly.

76
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,320
And it was a situation where it clearly is your fault.

77
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,700
Then you need to recognize that you need to own up to it.

78
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,650
Obviously don't go over the top with how you lather on apologies but be obviously rational about it

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,460
but admit that something is actually your fault and move to remedy it.

80
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,930
Now there's one thing that's really important that I want you to come away with from this lecture if

81
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:43,260
there is a breakdown in communication regardless of whoever's fault it is the fact that it was allowed

82
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,850
to happen is your fault as the service provider.

83
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:53,400
It is up to you to provide everything in excruciating detail to make sure that your client is on the

84
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,690
same page to make sure they understand exactly what's happening when it's happening and what to expect.

85
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,360
There is never an excuse for not facilitating communication.

86
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,700
That is your job.

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,900
That is how you keep happy clients.

88
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,870
That is how you save yourself from potential issues down the road.

89
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,630
So if your clients are not on board you should not be leaving the port and setting sail to use a metaphor.

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,990
So I'll say it again.

91
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,860
Breakdowns in communication.

92
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,180
It's your fault that you let it happen.

93
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,940
It almost always comes down to you did something or you cut a corner.

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,460
You decided to not send an update.

95
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:36,090
You decided to not keep your client with something or you decided to skip a step.

96
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,520
So is the customer always right.

97
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,200
No they're not always right.

98
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,770
It's up to you to make your own policy decisions.

99
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,050
Personally the best way of doing it is just on a case by case basis.

100
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,230
You can easily figure out whose fault it is.

101
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,930
And there's easy ways to handle situations that are your fault.

102
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,450
And there's easy ways to handle situations that are the client's fault.

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,370
Use your documentation use rationality and try to be as simple as possible when you explain what exactly

104
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,810
happened and how to fix it.

105
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:10,050
But always be aware of the fact this dispute does exist because you probably did something wrong in

106
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,750
your process so use it as a feedback opportunity to improve your process so that it doesn't happen in

107
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,590
the future.

108
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,010
All right guys.

109
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,880
Any questions.

110
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,090
Post in the group discussion.

111
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:28,490
Otherwise see in the next lecture.
