00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.070
You guys will come back to the course so I'm going to go over a strategy that is one of your first go

2
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.280
to strategies or at least it should be.

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.560
This is something that I used at Sprint kick actually to get my first batch of clients.

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.470
So the idea here is that you need to use your affiliations what are you that affiliations can be really

5
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.160
anything.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.370
It could be your college your university it could be a loose based affiliation like a country a state

7
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.610
a city.

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.510
It can be work groups it can be professional groups it can be your actual company that you've worked

9
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.500
for now or previously.

10
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.720
It can be membership into anything anything that you are associated with that is a great starting point

11
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.120
for looking for clients.

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.230
Now just briefly why does that work so well.

13
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.320
If I came to you and I was a development what we call vendor you're going to judge me in a lot of different

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.210
things right judgment or a portfolio you're going to judge me on what exactly I say we're going to judge

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.940
me on what work I've done in the past.

16
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.360
So you know judge me on whether or not you think it's a good fit and you think you can communicate with

17
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.400
me one of the things that you will inevitably judge that person based off of is whether or not they

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.680
have some sort of an affiliation with you.

19
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.600
Let's say I received two pitches from two people one person I went to college with and the other person

20
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690
I have absolutely no association with.

21
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.520
I'm always going to give it to the person that I went to college with.

22
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.410
The way I see it is when you're pitching to people it's almost like a point system.

23
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.280
The more things you have working in your favor the more likely you are and to close that contract if

24
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.720
you have more and more and more points in your favor then you can eventually raise your price.

25
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.420
And that's how you start getting to the point where you get really picky about your clientele and picky

26
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.540
about how much you charge at the beginning.

27
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.280
You just don't have a lot of points.

28
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.510
So you want to look for people that have some easy affiliation with you because that gives you a leg

29
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.800
up on talking to them.

30
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.210
I got clients by looking at my college network and that's because people there have ideas and they're

31
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480
looking for any excuse to use a vendor.

32
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.160
Big problem right now is that vendors are very saturated.

33
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.920
Tons and tons of development firms out there.

34
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.050
That's why it's important that you do try to at least specialize or have a good idea of where you're

35
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.030
going to find customers.

36
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.610
If someone came through and had some strong affiliation to you specifically that allows you to trust

37
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.530
them more and it allows you to give them preferential treatment.

38
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.410
So the way that you take advantage of this is you would just use that as a qualifying criteria for your

39
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.730
potential clients.

40
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.200
Then you go about teaching them pretty much in the same way you would otherwise but you're going to

41
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.350
focus more on making sure they understand what your affiliation is going back to the example I previously

42
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.870
used.

43
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.830
I actually just sent out an email to every single person I knew that was at my college because I used

44
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.670
my college e-mail address.

45
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.530
That was enough to get open rates.

46
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.210
And that was enough for people to trust me enough to actually have a conversation with me.

47
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.510
Now obviously there are pretty much run a range of different affiliations and their strengths.

48
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.230
Right.

49
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.400
Me coming up to someone and saying I'm American and you're American.

50
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.500
That's not a great affiliation not that it's a negative thing it's just that that's not very strong.

51
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.210
But if I live in the same city that could have a strong enough affiliation we have things in common.

52
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.920
We live in the same community.

53
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.430
And subconsciously you assume that there's something that you could potentially do in case something

54
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.380
went wrong.

55
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.770
So think about all the affiliations you have if you have some group of networks.

56
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.900
Anything Meetup groups.

57
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.950
Like I said professional networks any type of NGO or organization that you've ever participated in in

58
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.810
any time of your life try to use that as a launching point to get sales.

59
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.960
It's much easier to close sales and to get interest and to get them to trust you if they have some concrete

60
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.690
association with you.

61
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.230
That feeling of community is very strong.

62
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:08.560
OK guys see in the next picture.
