00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.930
You guys will come back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about building out your

2
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.090
web presence and what you need to focus on what you need to wrap your head around before you start.

3
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.290
Now I cannot stress enough how important your web presence is when a client or a potential client looks

4
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.000
at your proposal.

5
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.680
They almost always judge it through the lens of your website.

6
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.450
If you have a polished professional Web site they're obviously going to assume that their product is

7
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.940
going to look similar to that or at least in caliber quality.

8
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.320
Now if your website or your design is lagging then they might think the exact opposite and you might

9
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.280
find that you get passed up for higher quality providers.

10
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.390
Now a lot of clients don't like to admit this but they do subconsciously judge you based on your website.

11
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.080
You'll notice that when you have a nicer web site or a nicer web presence your clients are more likely

12
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.050
to believe you when you tell them or price or when you give them a suggestion on how to improve something

13
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.100
or change something.

14
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.280
The thinking just kind of goes that you know if you can build a site that beautiful or that Paulist

15
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.150
or that whatever it is then surely your advice is valuable and surely you know exactly what the prices

16
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.400
should be and it's going to be but like any startup in any leans toward up you know that you're not

17
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.440
going to want to go all out at the very beginning spending all your resources and all your time on making

18
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.520
the best web presence.

19
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.110
Why.

20
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.910
Well because sites are very expensive and you're about to find that out.

21
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.580
One of the biggest reasons why you don't want to go crazy at the beginning with your web presence is

22
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.650
because your web presence or your online presence kind of follows the 80:20 rule.

23
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.420
If you're not familiar it's the Pareto principle and that basically means that you can get 80 percent

24
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.460
of the effect of having a good web site or whatever the effects come from having a nice web presence

25
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.810
with 20 percent of the effort and then to get the final 20 percent of the effect.

26
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.680
The Polish You need to spend almost 80 percent so four times as much effort building a web presence

27
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.590
for purposes of selling say client services or web services follows that rule pretty closely.

28
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.870
Now another big reasons why you don't want to do this up front is because at the very beginning you

29
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.530
don't know what your messaging is.

30
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.710
You don't know what words what concepts what ideas resonate with your target market.

31
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.780
You also don't even know what your portfolio is going to look like.

32
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.650
You don't know how to display it.

33
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.910
You don't even necessarily know what your specialization is going to be at the end of the day because

34
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.950
it might change.

35
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.750
So the most realistic option is to start simple and then improve over time.

36
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.450
In this section we're going to cover the best way by far to get a good web presence cheaply and easily

37
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.600
for upfront.

38
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.070
We're going to do that with templates.

39
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.470
Now why do we choose that.

40
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.110
Well because they look amazing and they barely cost anything.

41
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.630
Seriously I see templates every day that are absolutely incredible.

42
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.180
I see them.

43
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.960
I think that their custom design even obviously the drawback to that is that you do not have as much

44
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.990
control on the customization of the design but that's something that at first you really just need to

45
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.340
forget about you need to understand that because at the beginning the most important thing is to get

46
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.520
something out there later as you start reeling in clients as you focus on the fundamentals of your business.

47
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.120
You start bringing in money then you can start to invest in your web presence and start to improve it.

48
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.740
It's unrealistic to do it at the very beginning.

49
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.350
So in this section we're going to talk about ways that you can kind of hack that process ways you can

50
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.630
spend minimal resources and get the best possible web presence you can upfront these are kind of the

51
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.850
things that really helped me when I started sprint.

52
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.560
And there are things that are applicable to any type of development company.

53
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.910
So keep that in mind.

54
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.660
Your web presence is totally an 80 20 type of thing.

55
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.400
It's going to take a lot of money to get a design that is only slightly better than what you can do

56
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.350
with a template.

57
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.880
It's a disproportionate amount more money to improve your web presence every time.

58
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.870
So it makes more sense that when you have more resources then you focus on improving it.

59
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.630
Right now we're just going to cover ways to get to square one easily in general that's great advice

60
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.320
when you're starting.

61
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.960
Start off with easy solutions improve them over time as you get more feedback and you get more comfortable

62
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.700
with the business.

63
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:29.230
Right seeing the next lecture.
