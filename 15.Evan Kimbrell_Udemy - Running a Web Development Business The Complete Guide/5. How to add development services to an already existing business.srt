00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,090
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,440
Welcome back to the course so in this lecture I'm going to answer the question if you have your own

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,010
existing consulting business or freelance business how can you add development services to that.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,630
So it's actually very very easy and going to cover just a couple of my favorite ways that you could

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,080
integrate this into your existing business.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,470
So one way of doing this and it's usually very simple if you have your own freelance business or you

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,340
already have your own graphic design marketing SEO firm or small business or whatever it is you probably

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,420
have a Web site or somewhere where you list your presence and list out your services.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,000
So the obvious answer to that question is you can just list this somewhere else on your Web site.

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,810
Now if you're worried about this being conflicting with what your primary focus is you can very easily

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,040
just add a separate tab or even add an after note at the end.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,410
Now keep in mind most people are probably coming to you for what you specialize in so you don't want

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,440
to spend half of your web page or half your web presence talking about your ability to also build what

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,210
it is that you consult with them on.

15
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,120
You want to keep it obviously proportionate.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,700
It's usually an afterthought if you're adding subcontracting so you can add it in a foot or you can

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,820
just add it in separate sections.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,830
Again people are focusing on what your expertise is but it's an added perk or an added bonus that you

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,580
can also develop it for them.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,490
Another way that you can also remind people that hey I also do development work is pretty simple.

21
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,380
You actually just end up adding it very simply to your branding.

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,000
So I'll give you an example.

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,300
Sprint kick started out as a development firm primarily.

24
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,900
That's all we did.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,930
And when we actually started hiring designers all we did was change our tagline from development studio

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,040
to design plus development studio.

27
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,230
That's typically it.

28
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,180
If you have a logo and you already have a subtitle it's very easy to just add something in like that.

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,170
You can also just make short references to it in your head or you can make a reference to it in your

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,450
business cards.

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,700
There's a lot of really simple subtle ways of pointing out that hey I also do this.

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,860
You can also change the way that you phrase your company as opposed to saying you're an escrow specialist

33
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,010
you could say your SBO and web studio you can use something that's more broad.

34
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,590
You can even transition to saying digital agency digital studio digital is a very common catchall word

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,830
meaning we do this but we also specialize or can do all of the other things that are involved in creating

36
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,110
a digital product.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,610
So looking to some of the other words in other terms you can use I would suggest that hey I do more

38
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,250
than just what my specialty is.

39
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,310
So the third one is actually my favorite technique and it's because it's really subtle.

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,890
It doesn't come on very strong but at the same time it's very very convincing.

41
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:57,480
So you probably already have clientele and you probably are sending those people estimations and you're

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,270
probably also sending them bills.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,610
So what you can do and we cover this later in the course is very easily attach Development estimates

44
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,890
to already to your marketing or your SBO or your design estimates.

45
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,180
OK.

46
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,840
So let's take an example.

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,530
You design web sites.

48
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,070
Let's say that your client asks you to design for pages for the brand new website.

49
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:26,250
You say it's going to cost you this much and then attached to your estimate as an appendage or even

50
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,590
just a separate row as a side thought you can say Oh also here's the estimate for building it for you.

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,440
Now you can do this whatever way you want.

52
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,070
You always you don't want to come on too strong because you want them to focus on your design.

53
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,420
You can put it as an afterthought.

54
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,550
A lot of graphic designers will just show Rose saying this section cost me this much or this is just

55
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,780
my generic estimate for how many days it costs.

56
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,480
Or 17 days it's going to take and this is my day rate.

57
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,140
And then all you have to do is just attach to the end.

58
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,980
Also this is my rough estimation for building it.

59
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,920
You also follow later in the course when we talk about ballpark estimates.

60
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,350
So what you can do is just attach say also if you're interested I can you have it developed for this

61
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,830
much if they're not interested they'll ignore that.

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,510
If they are interested they'll definitely keep that in mind.

63
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,350
Same thing works for bills.

64
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,640
You can actually if you're billing someone for work you did.

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,160
You can also attach onto it estimates for other things.

66
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:24,480
People will always find this as a positive thing because for them it's not as if your coming on too

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,060
strong or being too pushy by giving them an estimate.

68
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,180
It's always helpful to know how much you think something's going to cost or how long it's going to take.

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,180
That's helpful because that's information information they didn't previously have.

70
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,610
In most cases when people are looking to design and then develop a Web site they probably are going

71
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,380
to shop around and look at prices the more prices they have the better position they're in to make a

72
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,160
good decision.

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,510
So you're giving them an estimate that's a positive thing that helps them.

74
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,890
That actually saves them a little bit of time.

75
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,640
OK so you can get creative.

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,440
It's very easy just to add it on.

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,130
A lot of you guys already add on other services or familiar with upselling for add ons but for web development

78
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
it's just as simple as anything else.

79
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,890
There's a lot of different ways you can go for it.

80
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,000
There's other ones I haven't even covered anything really think those are the three that I've seen work

81
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,170
really really well.

82
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,410
All right.

83
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:24,930
So in the next lecture.
