00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.040
You guys will come back to the course.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.020
So in this lecture we're going to talk about keeping your clients happy but also keeping yourself happy

3
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.760
at the same time.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.710
And we do that by keeping the right amount of distance between you and your client.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.800
Now this is just advice coming from me because I've been doing this for a longer period of time.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.590
Is something that you hear from people who have been in the development business for multiple years.

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.800
It's something that at the very beginning it's hard to conceptualize.

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.650
But over time I wish I had known this a lot sooner.

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.170
Now I know that a lot of you out there are probably thinking that your customer service your responsiveness

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.230
your personal touch that's going to be a big selling point and a big point of retention for your clients.

11
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.720
Now I don't want to discourage you from using that as a technique to keep your clients happy.

12
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.310
It is absolutely a good thing.

13
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.620
It's always good to be responsive.

14
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.360
They're helpful and it's always good to lean on your personal AFACT to make your project successful.

15
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.810
So that's all good and great but you need to be realistic about what that's going to entail.

16
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.490
What I see constantly happening is we have people who start their business and with their clients they

17
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.300
promise the moon in terms of their involvement.

18
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.430
They say that they're going to be there every week for stand up calls.

19
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.440
They say that they're going to you know send them weekly updates.

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.940
They're going to be there for every single conference call etc. etc..

21
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.890
By the way stand up call what that basically means is that it's a very quick update called called Stand

22
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.120
up because they're very short and you typically would do them like you're standing up because they're

23
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.770
so short.

24
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.710
Now the problem with that is that you're not planning for what's going to happen in the future right

25
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.050
now.

26
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.060
Maybe you have three clients and it's realistic that you're going to deliver that promise to them with

27
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.720
three clients you could be there for every single call you could make Friday stand up calls a regular

28
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.250
thing.

29
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
But what happens if your mark your fundamentals are good.

30
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.380
What are your marketing efforts efforts take off.

31
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.860
What happens if you grow too fast.

32
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.550
We see this time and time again.

33
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.440
People promise the moon.

34
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.680
They take on extra clients because they're doing well and then all of a sudden they either have to overburden

35
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.240
themselves or they have to essentially break the promise that they gave to the client and they have

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.010
to be there much less.

37
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.850
So the question is can you promise this to every single client and not based off of your client load

38
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.310
right now based off of what your client load could be during the duration of the project.

39
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.650
Now just a word of advice.

40
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.320
It is always better to under-promise your involvement and then surprise them if you under-promise and

41
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.610
it ends up being that you don't take on as many clients as you thought you were going to you have extra

42
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.030
time and then you'll really surprise them.

43
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.840
But if it does happen that you get hit with an avalanche of work and that's typically how work cycles

44
00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.510
work in development businesses then you can actually keep your promise you'll do exactly what you said

45
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.960
you do.

46
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.780
So practice what we call keeping the right distance.

47
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.700
Now it's kind of a Goldilocks situation where you don't want a ton of distance and you don't want an

48
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.460
enormous amount of intimacy.

49
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.620
You need to gauge with each client what they expect and what they're comfortable with.

50
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.560
Some clients will expect you to be there every single day.

51
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.340
They'll expect that when they text message you will respond within a certain time.

52
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.040
And some clients are the exact opposite.

53
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.840
We've had clients that we honestly thought they had forgot that we were building a project for them.

54
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.970
Those ones are pretty much office space.

55
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.970
They say here it is come back to me.

56
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.800
It's perfect.

57
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.470
Now obviously there's pros and cons to both of those.

58
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.440
You just need to be aware where your client falls on that spectrum of how much they need.

59
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.730
And it's very easy to tease this out when you're talking to them.

60
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.130
It's very easy to quickly understand whether or not they get agitated when you don't respond within

61
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.200
a certain time.

62
00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.180
It's easy to understand if they have a certain framework of check ins that they want to enforce.

63
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.970
So now there's two ways that you can make sure that you're maintaining the right amount of distance.

64
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.010
One is again be aware of where on that spectrum that your client falls.

65
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.910
Are they really needy or are they not so needy at all.

66
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.030
Try to figure that out before the project starts.

67
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.060
And that will make it a lot easier for you.

68
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.250
The second thing is set the tone yourself what are the things that a lot of people who are new to this

69
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.910
business need a project management always kind of failed to do as they feel or recognize a project manager.

70
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.730
You can say when the updates are going to be you can set the tone for how much information they're going

71
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.990
to get and how often you update them.

72
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.580
Now 95 percent of the cases a client is going to default to your judgment because you are there on the

73
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.070
ground you know how often you're going to have new information to present to them and you're going to

74
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.420
know how often you need feedback in order for this project to be successful.

75
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.800
Clients do use really understand that being excessive with communication could be a negative thing.

76
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.400
They know roughly that there could be a detriment to their project but in general they're not tiredly

77
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.420
worried about that they're more concerned with feeling as if they're in the loop.

78
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.130
So try to make them feel like they're in the loop.

79
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.680
That's a very important concept here now feeling in the loop again relates our first point first point

80
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.920
being where on the spectrum do they fall if they're a needy client.

81
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.020
Being in the loop means that they're really in the loop and if they're a distant kind of space cadet

82
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.240
client that probably means that every month they hear something vaguely from you.

83
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.660
So try to figure out exactly what in the loop means and then make a judgment call about that to then

84
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.740
enforce your own schedule of check ins and distance.

85
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.450
Again like saying before there are always going to default to you because you're intimate with the project.

86
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.340
So if you say to them you know I'm going to update you on this date.

87
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:05.220
This is what I'm going to deploy new code and this is when we're actually going to talk on the phone.

88
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.650
They'll follow that schedule.

89
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.410
Now if you have a client who just doesn't need a lot of information then you might want to be more relaxed

90
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.270
with that schedule if you need someone who's a little bit more needy.

91
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.140
Then you can make it a little bit more intensive but because you're leading the decision here you can

92
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.210
push it towards whatever is a reasonable amount for your workload and your project load.

93
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.420
So it's very important when you have a new client that you tell them up front.

94
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.790
This is typically how we work and you can even customize it depending on the project itself as well

95
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.170
and say for your project we're going to check in this often and this is what I'm going to give you this

96
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.990
information.

97
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.890
Tell them that upfront before you even signed the deal so that they know exactly what to expect if they

98
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.710
protest then honestly be considerate.

99
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.610
Think about it.

100
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.310
But if they're asking for something that's entirely too excessive.

101
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.210
Just try to explain to them the two best ways of explaining to them that this is too excessive is one.

102
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.140
You explain to them how much time it takes to give these updates and how it could be a detriment to

103
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.160
the project.

104
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.760
No client ever wants to hear that and to be honest with them tell them that if I update you every single

105
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.940
day I'm going have nothing to say.

106
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.560
We used to do the Friday Night Stand up call so what that basically meant was like every Friday night

107
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.580
we do a standup call our client to say where we're at.

108
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.150
Ended up happening was you know this was the phone call you know hello client.

109
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.460
We have nothing to update you on because there's just nothing to say.

110
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.990
Hey the developer who was working on that feature last week well he's still working on that feature.

111
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.150
What do you want me to say unless that person you're talking to is really technical.

112
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.740
Nothing I'm going to tell them is going to make any sense to them.

113
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.350
I said oh he's you know on this line of code or he's running into this problem.

114
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.700
It means nothing to them.

115
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.650
So try to be smart about how you can gauge how much information they need.

116
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.990
Use that to Judge roughly how much distance they need.

117
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.620
Focus on enforcing the framework yourself.

118
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.530
Be considerate.

119
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:10.500
If they have their own opinions but also be firm and explain to them why you came up with this communication

120
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.160
schedule.

121
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.050
Seriously if you don't manage your communication schedule upfront you're going to go crazy and you're

122
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.410
going to spread yourself way too thin across projects.

123
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:25.350
Trust me clients will believe you when you say this is the schedule we need and we don't need any more

124
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.700
intercommunication.

125
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:37.370
OK guys see you next lecture.
