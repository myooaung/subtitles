00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.080
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.990
Welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to go over template Web sites.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.440
We're going go over the two biggest ones template monster and theme forest.

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.220
These are the two that I like the most because the ratio of what they cost to what you get is probably

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.440
the best I've seen online.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.640
Now there's a lot of ones out there but I think these are really all that you need.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.800
I'm going to show you how you can use these platforms to quickly whittle down what exactly are looking

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.940
for so that you're not looking at tens and thousands of templates.

9
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.630
I want to talk you through a little bit about how you know what you're paying for and what you should

10
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.210
choose to actually end up purchasing.

11
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.940
Now we're going to kind of connect this to the principles that we established previously when we looked

12
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.310
at development studios bring that all together to pick something that's going to give you a fantastic

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.920
web presence so see in the screencast.

14
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.570
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

15
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:05.540
In this lecture we're going to go over where you can find templates that works specifically for your

16
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.870
development business.

17
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.460
Now I talked about a little bit before why templates are a great idea a great idea because they are

18
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.720
extremely cheap when compared to getting something designed yourself.

19
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.940
And also I think it's worth noting that templates nowadays have gotten considerably better.

20
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:31.430
When I first started messing around with templates around 2000 five and six they were not nearly as

21
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.750
good as they are today and there's a considerable amount more of templates out there you know template

22
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.980
monster as an example that we're going to cover here just in a segment of a company that came out in

23
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.120
2002 and when they first came out for the first four years of so I saw they only had even a couple hundred

24
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.600
templates and now they have something like 45000.

25
00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.140
So anyway templates are pretty much your go to if you want to start a development business and you want

26
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.270
to get a presence off the ground immediately.

27
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.040
Like I had talked previously talked about when Sprint kick started we were actually called 47 squares.

28
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:16.790
We had to use just a plain landing page template change the text change the icons and swapped out some

29
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.320
of the header images and that quite literally was what we operated with for almost a year and a half.

30
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.460
So if you are pretty much getting into this and you're trying to expand your business this is by far

31
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.270
the best way of going.

32
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.240
So the first website I want to kind of show you a little bit about is template monster template monster

33
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.520
does a ton of different things.

34
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.540
Obviously they focus primarily on templates but they also do things like PowerPoint designs.

35
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.100
They do a lot of different like Flash animation designs pretty much anything that applies to web technology

36
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.520
that can be mass produced and made into a template.

37
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.680
That's really what they're going to have.

38
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.640
You'd be surprised from messing around here on their Web site what else they have.

39
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.690
But primarily what they are is just a large warehouse for templates that fit pretty much any type of

40
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.940
thing you can think of template Montsoreau is not my favorite place and we'll talk a little bit more

41
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.310
about why.

42
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.190
I mean it mainly has to do with upselling.

43
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.840
But we're going to cover two different places in this lecture.

44
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.960
So if I were interested in producing my own development Web site and I were at Temple at Monster there's

45
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.660
two different ways of doing it right off the bat.

46
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.760
I could either pick a platform so I could pick something like Wordpress Jumah Magento or I don't even

47
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.490
Moto see amasses another one and I would do that if it were the case that I already had a WordPress

48
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.210
blog set up or a WordPress installation setup or a Jumah installation set up if I was already familiar

49
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.010
with their content management services and I really liked using them then what I would do is I would

50
00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.870
just go through Wordpress and I go directly through that point and only look for things that had WordPress.

51
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.130
Now if you're not using a platform and that's entirely up to you if you want to use it what you can

52
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.940
do is just more of a generic search.

53
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.020
So on here all you really want to do is just go to categories.

54
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.390
And for us specifically it's actually just under business and services this is one way that you can

55
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.440
find acceptable designs.

56
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.140
So pretty much right off the bat there.

57
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.540
They show us a pretty wide variety of different things.

58
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.690
Now previously we had talked about studio designs and development studio designs and how they kind of

59
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.570
look almost any template design you find in here is going to match that format that we had previously

60
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.200
noticed in those popular Web sites.

61
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.300
Almost all of them are going to use a big header with a hook followed by individual sections and a long

62
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.350
page design.

63
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.480
But specifically Now if you decided to go through this way and you just wanted to look for business

64
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.240
and corporate Web sites then on the left hand side you can refine your search considerably.

65
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.150
So we could pick something specific to what we're doing over here.

66
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.700
It's not particularly helpful because they're just picking verticals they're picking areas of work or

67
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.850
areas of the economy and not particularly helpful for us because there is never going to be a section

68
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.120
just for development firms so they can go so as far as is doing like cattle poultry and sheep.

69
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.130
They have eight different templates for cattle farms anyway.

70
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.970
So what you would want to do if you wanted to refine it down here is now that you've decided that we're

71
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.300
in a business services section then you would go and pick your platform if you wanted to use a platform

72
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.870
if you didn't want to then you could pick something else down here we can set our popular features.

73
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.270
This is relatively easy.

74
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.790
It's helpful if you have responsive design.

75
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.950
It's getting to a point today where if you do not have responsively designed web sites that's a pretty

76
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.120
big negative if anyone's been following the big update and Google search results.

77
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.730
You're actually is damaged if you do not have a mobile friendly version.

78
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.350
So it's very helpful if you add in something that's already responsive.

79
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.910
Keep in mind typically templates that are responsive are going to be a little bit more expensive but

80
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.610
again it's a fantastic investment because if you had someone designed this from scratch and make it

81
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.090
responsive you'd be very very expensive.

82
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.740
Another one that I think is always worth checking is portfolio because remember we're going to be putting

83
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.490
a portfolio you might find that the portfolio templates on this site that are specifically tagged portfolio

84
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.340
might be too heavy on the portfolio.

85
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.290
And what I mean by that is sometimes when you click portfolio it gives you these templates that are

86
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.320
for creative designers and a lot of creative designers say like an artist is going to have their portfolio

87
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.760
as the only thing that the user should be focusing on.

88
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.860
And that's not usually the case if you're trying to create a development business.

89
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.490
But now that I've added in a couple we can see over here that there is a lot of different high quality

90
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.230
designs.

91
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.150
It's just a matter of picking something and then deciding whether or not you can retool it for your

92
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.370
website.

93
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.630
So here's just a random one that I picked.

94
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:15.830
I even picked a bank just to show you that almost virtually any theme can be retrofit towards what you're

95
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.400
trying to do.

96
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.520
So what you need to decide your template purchase based off of is the color scheme whether or not you

97
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.560
think the color scheme fits what you're going for what image you're trying to convey and then whether

98
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:34.040
or not you just identify individual sections that are going to be easy to modify and you can mentally

99
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.990
in your head kind of visualize what I'm going to put in the section so right here it's called a bank

100
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.580
template.

101
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:47.800
But if you scroll down about us if anybody just coming return from the previous lecture What does that

102
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.010
remind you of.

103
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.470
That was quite literally how did their website.

104
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.960
It was a big hook followed by about us and then right down here it shows a web application.

105
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.900
So this is clearly not for a bank.

106
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:07.140
This would be great if you are trying to add in a mobile portfolio item right here.

107
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.020
That could be something that would be interesting you could even make this matter where you actually

108
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.090
put a screenshot of the template you're using in it.

109
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:20.680
Do you want it to and then immediately down here here services clients and this one could very easily

110
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.420
CIRCE's latest events.

111
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.780
This could be retrofit for blog posts.

112
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.560
This could be retrofit for latest portfolio items.

113
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.370
You can make this into literally anything but because it's also a template you could quite literally

114
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.620
just delete the section if you couldn't think of what it's useful for.

115
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.240
And then down here it's the contact information.

116
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:47.800
OK so we have a long page design that's very simple uses somewhat a lot of stock photography but you

117
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.670
can obviously tell that this would work for a development portfolio.

118
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.770
It doesn't have the depth of what other Web sites have that we previously saw in the last lecture but

119
00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.580
that's because those companies have been around for a long time they have a lot of content to display.

120
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.010
You're just starting off so you just want to get something that's high impact that you can get done

121
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.210
relatively quickly and then you start adding in layers.

122
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.280
OK so making a judgment on which template to purchase.

123
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.470
Typically I just base it off of the price and what I get for it.

124
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.830
This one is a WordPress theme.

125
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:27.760
So what that basically means is that I would need to set up a WordPress site on my own site host and

126
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.250
then install this as a theme.

127
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:37.030
I'm assuming that most of you guys out there are overly familiar with Wordpress or overly familiar with

128
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.560
hosting your own web sites.

129
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:45.940
I'm assuming this because this is a development business course but if you are at it's very very simple

130
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:52.960
to set up WordPress quite literally any web post out there that you pay $3 a month $10 about $20 a month

131
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.760
will have quick install instructions for wordpress.

132
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.980
Really all you would want to do is just take the name of your web host whether or not its you know dream

133
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:11.350
host or host gator or Godaddy or media temple or whatever you use plus WordPress WordPress installation

134
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.880
and that is quite literally easiest way you can find it through Google without even having to go through

135
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.050
their documentation.

136
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.270
You guys need any help with that just posts in the group discussion.

137
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:26.260
But anyway so I'm putting this out because while this is a design template because it comes as a WordPress

138
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.480
theme that saves you an enormous amount of time.

139
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:33.880
So it might be justified to pay a little bit more over here for what you're paying because you're not

140
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.800
going to be doing any of the programming at all it's not just a design template.

141
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:45.520
OK so after you pick what is a single site license this is where template monster kind of loses favor

142
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.190
with me slightly is that they try to give you a lot of upscale services and you know some of these things

143
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:57.280
over here are helpful if you are absolutely in a hurry and you're ok spending extra money getting it

144
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.810
done.

145
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:04.060
But some of them it just seems kind of wasteful if you know how much actual effort it goes into what

146
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.680
they're selling you.

147
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.970
Like for instance changing the color scheme that seems a little ridiculous because this is a WordPress

148
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:15.170
theme in the theme you will probably be able to change the color scheme.

149
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.880
So literally they're just hoping it's for someone who doesn't know that ready to use Web site again.

150
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.170
They're just going to open up a web host somewhere.

151
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.330
They're a partnership.

152
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.130
And then add it for you and then upload it.

153
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:35.110
They're going to charge you $300 but you could quite literally do that for about $8 or even cheaper

154
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:42.070
if you use some of those bargain dream like Barbara bargain Web hosting companies implementing your

155
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.780
logo again $49 to put in your logo that doesn't make any sense.

156
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.660
Moto press I can drop Ed..

157
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:55.120
That's something that I would only be interested in using if I if I was not familiar with say the Wordpress

158
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.980
theme but none of these are really ever worth it.

159
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.430
If you have the time if you are absolutely out of time then it might be worth it.

160
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.470
Like for instance this if you just wanted to get this up and get on with your life move on to your development

161
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.370
efforts trying to get clients and whatnot then maybe you want to do this because it will save you a

162
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.500
you know a half day's worth of work.

163
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:22.600
Exclusive licenses these are never really worth it if you are serious that you really really love this

164
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:28.510
design you could do that but that's more than what you should be spending on your own custom web site

165
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.050
down the road when you upgrade to that.

166
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.450
So I don't really see the point in this.

167
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.740
It's also difficult because they will sell you an exclusive license.

168
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.230
After that template has already been used.

169
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.990
So someone else can be definitely using it.

170
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.000
And that's that's not helpful.

171
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.360
That's not really the point of exclusive licenses.

172
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:53.150
OK so if you are in love with this template for whatever reason you could actually go ahead and buy

173
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.470
this.

174
00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:59.690
They would deliver to you in a file that you just upload and install on your Wordpress as a WordPress

175
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.190
theme.

176
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.370
Incredibly easy.

177
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:06.950
The other way of finding designs on Temple Monsour is quite literally up here you can literally just

178
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:14.250
look for web development so you could do web development templates web design templates.

179
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.670
There's a little bit of a distinction here in the sense that web development is going to overly focus

180
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.630
on the technical nature of the business.

181
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:29.060
And so when you look at the templates on there they're going to look a little more dry whereas web design

182
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.210
they're assuming that these are for designers.

183
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:36.360
And so a lot of the conventions on the templates are going to be different.

184
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:42.950
Typically I actually go with web design because they're a little bit more out there and more likely

185
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.090
that one of these templates is going to really stick out to me.

186
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:52.500
And so really like I was saying before it's just a job of visualization what you want to do is just

187
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.790
look for something that has the color scheme or the feel that you like.

188
00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:02.880
And then it's just a question of deciding whether or not it has some of the features you want does it.

189
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.860
Is it responsive.

190
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:09.480
I think it should does it have a portfolio and can you imagine where you're going to plug and play your

191
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.150
own information or your own images.

192
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:18.570
So for example here is one if you really like that color scheme that's great and it has a great hook

193
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.060
kind of type Margraf set right here very easy to notice.

194
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.690
The one downside though is that it's going to come with this high resolution image that goes right here

195
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.000
which is fantastic but what is it.

196
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.460
That's the problem with a lot of the templates out there.

197
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:39.010
Templates will put in stock photography that looks high resolution fantastic just not relevant.

198
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.460
And that's always a problem if you want to actually look and see how it looks in your browser.

199
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.080
Just go to view live demo.

200
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.590
This is actually quite helpful.

201
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.680
So you can get a better feel for it.

202
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.340
One thing that's worth noting is a lot of these things have cheesy animations.

203
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.590
You can turn those off and those are quite simple to actually do.

204
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:03.770
So yeah I would try to evaluate this in the same way that you would evaluate any of the other Web sites

205
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:04.560
we looked at.

206
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:10.110
So look for all of the sections and if they don't have sections they might list them generically So

207
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.970
just imagine where you'd put them.

208
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:12.240
Right.

209
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.430
So we notice here that there is a hook.

210
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.720
We notice that there's quite a lot of space over here for giving a value proposition pitch responsive

211
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.380
design clean code for 123 icons.

212
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.360
We would just retrofit this to say whatever we want it to say.

213
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.910
We could say you know fastest design or fastest development service in the business.

214
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.070
We could say user focused development.

215
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:44.940
And then we could put some pitch about how we give extra maintenance and service beyond the point of

216
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.680
developing it.

217
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:51.750
So you could say you know two years of completely free support or something like this all along those

218
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.320
lines.

219
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.490
And then you can see that there's other sections that are quite useful like running a testimonial section

220
00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.180
over here.

221
00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.510
You could very easily plug and play this right here.

222
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.880
And then down here these are always fun to put statistics.

223
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:09.540
One of the common clichés with web development businesses is they'll put you know how many cups of coffee

224
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.830
the team has had and how many late nights they've had and how many dogs they have running around the

225
00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:14.590
office.

226
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.870
You can do whatever you want.

227
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.940
Personality is always a positive thing when it comes to web presence.

228
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.410
And then this is nice because you can list out your portfolio.

229
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:27.150
I obviously would suggest changing the latest works to just portfolio because remember you always want

230
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.520
to limit your portfolio to five to 10 either way.

231
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.910
So and then right here it actually has your section right off the bat for portfolio that's fantastic

232
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.110
what I would do is change latests works to just portfolio and then limit the size.

233
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:45.840
We cover that actually later in the course where we talked about the optimum size and selection for

234
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.570
your portfolio put spoiler.

235
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.690
It's usually 5 to 10.

236
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.780
You don't typically want to go over 10.

237
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.820
So what you do is you would want to limit this.

238
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:55.560
Okay.

239
00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.240
And the last thing that we noticed or here is it obviously has a contact information and get in touch

240
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.710
box.

241
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.480
So this is all fantastic.

242
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.550
We can even view what it would look like on tablets.

243
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.310
This is great.

244
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.100
Looks very very snazzy.

245
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.830
And that is all pretty much typically what we would want.

246
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.510
Okay so template monster very good option for getting designs that you want.

247
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.440
I mean you could literally spend days and days on this just going through the sites and just piling

248
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.580
through them.

249
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:30.300
Be conscientious of what format you're getting and if it is Loizeaux type to see what it is if it's

250
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.700
for Wordpress for Joomla whether or not it's just a graphic design template or whatever it actually

251
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.770
is just you know when you buy it what does it come out like template monster.

252
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.610
The downside though is that they're just typically a little bit more expensive.

253
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.870
I think $75 is incredibly cheap for what you're getting out of it.

254
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:59.150
And for the actual quality of the designs but you can actually do cheaper if you wanted to.
