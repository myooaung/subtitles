00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.030
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to go over a strategy that we here

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.820
at Sprint click used to get a ton of clients early on in our history.

3
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.520
This one's a little more abstract.

4
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.420
What we're going to be talking about is how you can find similarities amongst your client your clientele

5
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.310
and your client profiles.

6
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.200
What do I mean by that.

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.420
You probably have identified a group of people are probably most likely to purchase from you or to become

8
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.350
clients.

9
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.330
Now we need to analyze that group of people see if there's something in common with them and see whether

10
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.940
or not something in common can be used to find them in mass or in some type of an index.

11
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.750
Hopefully going to make a little bit more sense than to actually get into it.

12
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.030
So without further ado let's get into the screencast.

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.540
So what I call this is the email scrapin blast.

14
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.570
So one of the things that you need to do before you can really find any type of growth hacks or successful

15
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.130
marketing strategies for advertising your development business.

16
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.380
You really need to kind of whittle down and hammer down on who exactly is your ideal customer base who

17
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.350
responds to your message the most.

18
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.210
And then what are the commonalities between those groups of people.

19
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.110
What do they have in common.

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.140
So for us the largest group of people that we worked with were startups and followed by Believe it or

21
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.210
not were graphic designers now graphic designers.

22
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.740
Why.

23
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.160
Well we actually cover this in another lecture.

24
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.120
But the reason why is because we partnered with them and they brought us clients and we brought them

25
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.750
clients so it worked out really well so we actually thought of them as a secondary market.

26
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.630
So one of the things that we did was we looked at some of the groups that were interested in our services

27
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.290
and this is all based off of what our value proposition was which was that we kind of catered towards

28
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.220
being cheap and being good.

29
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.220
And so we kind of looked for groups that were specifically attracted to us and they started to think

30
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.800
of ways of corralling these people together online and then using that as a way of advertising towards

31
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.040
them.

32
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.330
So I'll give you an example of one of the techniques we used that worked out really well.

33
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:29.260
So don't dot com is a Web site that helps freelancers who are designers set up their own portfolios

34
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.850
online.

35
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.050
There's a lot of companies out here out there that do this.

36
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.490
And so what was interesting about this platform was that they had a very large user base of our potential

37
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.730
clients.

38
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.310
We recognized that that was the case.

39
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.860
And what we kind of found out was that don't what they do is you sign up you pay I think it's something

40
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.400
like $5 a month and they give you a website that's very very basic and very very template it now template

41
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.130
it is the most important word in what I just said template Web sites always have similarities to them

42
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.750
since they have used template Web sites to give the graphic designers and they had as you can see 91000

43
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.360
graphic designers on their platform.

44
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.090
That was where we saw an opportunity to e-mail scrape and blog.

45
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.200
So I'll give you an example of what exactly we did.

46
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.070
They've recently changed and we use this strategy as well a year and a half ago so I'm not really entirely

47
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.000
surprised that they've changed but it used to be that they had a very very standard design not a lot

48
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.200
of customisation and that's why a lot of people like them because they are cheap but simple they would

49
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.490
get up very quickly.

50
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.460
It used to be the case that right at the bottom of every single thing they posted online would say powered

51
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.770
by don't.

52
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.180
And so literally all we had to do was search in Google for a hard search.

53
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.560
If you guys are not familiar with a hard restricted search basic what that means is that we would search

54
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.290
for something.

55
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.380
So we would search for powered by don't.

56
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.450
And we would do it in hard quotations OK what that means is they would search for exactly that text

57
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.750
nothing else and they used to have us on the surface.

58
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.900
So that was our technique we searched powered by dunked and walla.

59
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:30.330
We had a complete list of every single Don't Web site for the trickier ones or you ended up doing was

60
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.520
we would use this Web site.

61
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.640
And if you guys are not familiar with it it's called nerdy data.

62
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.890
So what it is it's a Web site that allows you to search the source code of Web sites.

63
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.890
Now they're not going to be searching the deep like server side programming code.

64
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.360
They're searching the HVM MCSA.

65
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.040
And it's not something that Google offers because why would someone specifically need that and it's

66
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.300
it's kind of hard to wrap your head around why someone would need this.

67
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.530
But one of the biggest reasons is marketing efforts as you can see right on their Web site generate

68
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:10.980
leads so using nerdy data what I can do and I can still do this is I can search for powered by don't.

69
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.360
And that was the tagline they used and it seems like now they might actually just hide it in the code.

70
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.640
And so what it does is it just searches for literally anything anywhere that someone has.

71
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.930
So what I can do is right there so what it did is it pulled up powered by dunk.

72
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.060
Now who else would have that other than someone using don't other than someone who is probably a graphic

73
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:47.120
designer so it looks like this person uses their system and is a designer wallah.

74
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.870
And so then we literally just did that and we just compiled and you can do it over here download these

75
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.050
results you can download them or you can do is you can use Google and then you can use a virtual assistant

76
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.940
or you can do it manually to just go through and compile all that information.

77
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.460
And now you have a list a basically a very long list of all these people that you know are in your client

78
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.530
group or potential client group.

79
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.010
Now you just need a way of contacting them and then it is just a matter of going through and going each

80
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.900
one of their Web sites and since they're all graphic designers they all want you to contact them so

81
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.550
it was always very very simple to contact them.

82
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.590
And so we just did that and that was one of the best ways that we found to contact people to get our

83
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.330
name out there.

84
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:39.180
Now between Google hard search and using nerdy data there are a lot of opportunities to dig out any

85
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.320
commonality between your client base.

86
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.160
So obviously first of all you need to figure out what your client base is.

87
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.460
And then second of all you need to find something they share in common.

88
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.880
If it's on the surface you can always use Google.

89
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.780
If it's on somewhere in their code maybe it's a more technical commonality than you would use nerdy

90
00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.460
data.

91
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.810
Now an example of nerdy data maybe you are trying to work with a certain WordPress plugin.

92
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.360
Well that certain WordPress plugin probably has the same code somewhere in it.

93
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.480
So you could probably lift that and search for it and you could probably find a list of people who are

94
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.640
using that plugins who maybe you offer server a service or you can fix certain plugins you've already

95
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.360
identified one that's broken.

96
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:29.190
There's a lot of different opportunities to use these two to find ways of grouping together your potential

97
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.640
client.

98
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.170
Now there's also opportunities where you don't even have to do it yourself.

99
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:40.120
So for us we again going after graphic designers and we covered this in another lecture.

100
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.360
So you might be somewhat familiar but what you can do is you can just go around and look to see whether

101
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:52.110
or not there are directories or whether or not they're already created indexes or list even of your

102
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.280
potential client group.

103
00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:02.160
So let's say you are looking for specifically small businesses that are between a certain size and maybe

104
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.720
they have some certain bent towards maybe their marketing agencies.

105
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.950
So specifically you could just Google marketing small business with one other piece of information and

106
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.330
you could see lists and lists of different companies that probably fit that description.

107
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.230
There's a lot of other companies that compile directories.

108
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.420
We got lucky because we just after some searching found the firm list of what the firm was does as they

109
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.960
list out all sorts of graphic design and web development companies out there.

110
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:37.080
And so quite literally all we have to do is just pick an area we're interested in we can pick say Idaho

111
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.530
and the United States go.

112
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:46.200
And then I can pick which town I want to the biggest city.

113
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:55.560
And then now I have a list of 21 companies that all exist in this area and are easily contactable.

114
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.220
So that was one way that we did it.

115
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.460
We just looked for lists now for you guys.

116
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.080
Specifically it just depends on who you're going for.

117
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.850
Who is your niece and then see whether or not someone's already done the hard work for you whether or

118
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.000
not someone has already made a list.

119
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.160
Sometimes you can purchase lists for marketing.

120
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.040
It really just takes some hard Google searching.

121
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.230
Just google your name of your niece plus list email list.

122
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.350
Anything along those lines.

123
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.160
Try to think of areas where those people work and see whether or not there's anywhere they could be

124
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.750
indexed.

125
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:37.650
We also were able to reach out to graphic designers through the same freelance Web sites that we covered

126
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.230
previously.

127
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:46.200
So what we quite literally did was went on to Elance went on to up work and use that as a way to contact

128
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.980
people because on say for instance up work I can go to find freelancers I can sort specifically by whatever

129
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.370
it is that I'm looking for.

130
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.810
And so what I can do is I can quite literally just search exactly what I want or sort by it.

131
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:06.600
So if I was specifically going for graphic design I could cook graphic design maybe I had an idea for

132
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.660
a campaign where I was going to say I want to go only after people who do logo designs are really only

133
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.760
going to go after people who do video video production design or maybe I want to make a web site for

134
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.700
people who do voice talent whatever it is these are indexed lists of people and you can contact them

135
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.200
very easily.

136
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.320
It's quite easy to find people.

137
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.680
And then once you get into contact with them then it's really up to you to craft your message and see

138
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.570
whether or not they're interested in your services.

139
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.660
OK guys so this one's a little bit more abstract.

140
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:42.360
It's very hard to make a generalized lecture specific to everyone's needs because everyone's specific

141
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.810
way of tackling this strategy is different.

142
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.700
The point is though that if you have a potential group of clients and you know that they are consistently

143
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.690
the ones that you want to be targeting those people have commonalities.

144
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.080
You can try to think of whether or not they have commonalities on their Web sites whether or not there

145
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.210
are places where they hang out specifically or things that they need.

146
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.760
And that's all in common.

147
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.420
And try to use those outlets to find ways of contacting them.

148
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.730
And if you can find ways of contacting them or where they're indexed then you can very easily create

149
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:19.480
a list and create a contact and marketing strategy from that.

150
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.900
OK guys if you need any clarification.

151
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.310
Post in the group discussion.

152
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.900
This one like I said a little bit more abstract some of you guys out there might not be entirely sure

153
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.950
still how this might apply to your business if you do just post in the group discussion.

154
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.090
I can try to help you out.

155
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:41.450
Otherwise guys will see in the next lecture.
