00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.290
Pay you guys will come back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about expectations

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.770
around your development business and what is the startup timeline going to look like and what you should

3
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.040
expect from it.

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.130
So is a web development business something that you could start on a Tuesday and make money with on

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.220
a Wednesday.

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.310
Well no.

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.830
Typically it's not the case unless you already have some set up arrangements before or you already have

8
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.030
some clientele and you're a programmer yourself and it might be the case that you can make some money

9
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.090
pretty much immediately.

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.670
But for 95 percent of the cases there's going to be a lot of work that goes up upfront in your business

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.220
before you start bringing in clientele.

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.840
So like any business out there your first going to have to start and do some strategy work.

13
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.370
Your first can have to figure out what is your angle what exactly you're going to try to sell.

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.610
Or you can pick a niche or you're going to be a generalist are you going to pick a specific technology.

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.200
What are you going to try to go after.

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.090
What do you think your value proposition is going to be.

17
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.670
We're going to cover later in the course.

18
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.200
How do you pick what your value proposition should be and also how do you decide whether or not you

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.350
should be a nice operator or a general kind of operator.

20
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.650
Those are entirely different lecturers.

21
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.400
But right now we're just talking about how the beginning of your startup you're going to think about

22
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.050
these things.

23
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.070
So yeah first you're gonna have to think about what exactly are you going to do and how are you going

24
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.590
to tackle this because it's a lot of different ways you can do this.

25
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.140
You can be a mobile only studio.

26
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.660
You could be a web only studio you could only work with wordpress you could only work with Drupal you

27
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.710
could specifically only work with front end technologies.

28
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.570
Lot of different ways you can do this so initially you need to make these decisions up front end and

29
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.080
I personally suggest that you do a little bit of research to see what you think there's an opportunity

30
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.680
for.

31
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.080
But more importantly take a little bit of time to assess where your skills are if you're a programmer

32
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.900
then it's probably going to be a smart thing to go into an area where you already have some prior established

33
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.220
skills or experience and if you don't then you should probably go into an area that you have some sort

34
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.030
of an inclination towards or if you have some deep connection to a specific business vertical or a specific

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.220
business community that might be how you angle this but there's usually a period of time at the very

36
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.630
beginning where you try to figure out how exactly you're going to do this and you need to understand

37
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.710
that while this is happening you're not going to make a ton of progress.

38
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.340
So it just depends on you and how quickly you can make decisions.

39
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.910
Some people just know exactly how they want to do this.

40
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.010
They know what angle they're going to go for they know how they want to present themselves and they're

41
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.940
going to do it tomorrow.

42
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.020
But some of you it might take a little bit of prodding and poking and figuring out what you think actually

43
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.730
makes sense and what you think actually works.

44
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.160
So after you do that you're going to first try to set up a presence for yourself somehow.

45
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.360
It might be the case that you know only all you do is make a profile on some freelancing Web sites.

46
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.370
It might be the case that you make your own web site itself.

47
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.440
And it might be the case that you only set up like a Facebook page but at first you're going to have

48
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.910
to spend a little bit of time figuring out a way that if people want to find you they can find you after

49
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.960
you've done that and you have some basic level identity.

50
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.290
It's probably something you're not going to be happy with by the way it's just going to be basic it's

51
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.610
just going to get your name out there.

52
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.920
Get away for people to contact you after that.

53
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.240
Then you're going to focus on how to capture clients and often simultaneously how you can piece together

54
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.380
a good team.

55
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.410
So now it really doesn't matter which way you go at this.

56
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.360
When I started Sprint kick I did both.

57
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.000
I actually started putting together a team wall I was looking for clients.

58
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.570
And it's I suggest doing that because finding the right team and finding the right freelancers it's

59
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.270
very trial and error and also finding a traction channel a way that you can get your word out there

60
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.730
and find people who are willing to pay you.

61
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.130
That also takes some trial and error.

62
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.770
And so if you do both at the same time they'll probably come together around the same kind of converge

63
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.060
at the same time and then everything will kind of come together.

64
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.240
But after you set out your project just be aware that there is what we kind of call the trough of sorrow

65
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.900
where you're putting yourself out there.

66
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.580
You know what your angle is but there's just going be a period of time where you just do not know exactly

67
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.100
where are going to find your big clients from and where are going to find your consistent business from.

68
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.690
It's a lot of work trying to figure that out and trying to test out everything you can.

69
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.820
And for a while there it's going to feel like you're not doing anything right.

70
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.300
Like with any business you just need to have faith.

71
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.650
People are always going to need development services for web and mobile.

72
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.890
They're always going to need that.

73
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.360
Right.

74
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.310
And they all get it from somewhere.

75
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.000
So there's always going to be an opportunity to either do it better or cheaper or find someone who you

76
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.250
can replace because have a better relationship with.

77
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.330
So just be aware that this is a process and this process takes some time.

78
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.930
Don't obviously get discouraged if you're in this process.

79
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.640
Obviously take advantage of me and the group discussions so that we can all kind of help you out.

80
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.220
But just understand that after that happens you're gonna have this period of time you're trying to configure

81
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.670
everything and you're trying to figure out who is excited about your product offering and you are also

82
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.040
trying to figure out what exactly can you build.

83
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.360
So after some experimentation you're going to start to figure out who are the good designers who are

84
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.010
the good developers who's consistent who's reliable who are the people that you might want to work with

85
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.070
full time or even hire full time.

86
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.730
And once you figure that out you'll start having a better idea of what exactly you good at what exactly

87
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.160
you could build.

88
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.400
And all of a sudden you'll know kind of where you're competitive and where you're not.

89
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.200
So I'll give you an example a Sprint card with Sprint kick we started off looking for pretty much anybody

90
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.010
who would be interested in what we were doing.

91
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.630
We looked at people who just wanted to make an e-commerce web store.

92
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.770
We looked for people who just wanted to make a blog and then we also look for people who wanted to build

93
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.130
custom applications from scratch.

94
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.050
What we found out was that our expertise and what we were competitive at was building large web applications

95
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.230
from scratch.

96
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.700
Why.

97
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.900
Because we were cheaper than everybody else and we had a lot of prior experience to that.

98
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.220
And also we weren't particularly great at keeping tabs of what every single technology that's out there

99
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.230
that helps you set up a web store or a basic web presence.

100
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.080
Now you could make a lot of money off of just going off for people who want to build blogs for us that

101
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.070
just didn't work out.

102
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.950
So we found our niche after we put together a team after we had a couple of projects and after we kind

103
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.610
of figured out you know this project came out good.

104
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.030
And this project came out a disaster.

105
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.590
Clearly something is intrinsic to how we are working and intrinsic to who we are that made this successful

106
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.940
and this one not so realistically keep your head in the game.

107
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.310
Just understand that since there are so many different ways you can create a development business.

108
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:50.260
Its going to take you a while to find your road to find the group of people that love what you do love

109
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.970
how you do it and are willing to pay you money and it just takes time.

110
00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.210
Now if you're someone who already has prior established networks or a deep domain expertise in something

111
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.010
then you have a pretty much a leg up.

112
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.210
You say your real estate agent and you want to start building web sites for real estate agents.

113
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.070
Your innate knowledge of real estate and networking with real estate and also with the fact that you

114
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.900
can approach people as a real estate agent that's really going to help you out and that's going to essentially

115
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.660
accelerate the startup timeline for you.

116
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.370
But for the rest of us out there we're just starting generic companies who maybe don't have an immediate

117
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.510
business network or an immediate group of people that we know we can email and get sales from.

118
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.190
It's just going to take some time.

119
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.570
Now if you follow this course we're going to go over all of the different ways that we found that consistently

120
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.640
will make business or consistently at least get you good consistent reliable leads.

121
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.530
Now I don't expect all of them to work for you I expect a couple to work really well and the rest of

122
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:50.580
them probably maybe not worth it for what you're trying to do or not cost effective for how you do it.

123
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.970
So be aware like any other business it's just going to take a lot of finagling it's going to take a

124
00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:01.420
lot of time and effort to figure out how it works how impressive you have to get how big your portfolio

125
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.470
has to get before people start paying you a lot of money after you figure out what you're good at and

126
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:11.830
who likes your stuff then it's a question of just growing or kind of becoming a master of the clients

127
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.030
that you already have.

128
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.410
Eventually you get to a point where your portfolio is large enough.

129
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.620
Your referral base is large enough that you essentially have to.

130
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:27.790
You can stop advertising for one and two you can start charging a lot more money because it a lot of

131
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:34.280
times it ends up happening is people will see your work or they've heard about you or you become saturated

132
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.390
in one area or one niche enough that people are willing to pay a premium to work with you at first you're

133
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:46.750
really going to be groveling and trying to really hardcore discount and make promises that are borderline

134
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.820
hard to actually uphold to get business.

135
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:56.530
But over time it gets a lot a lot easier to the point at which where we're at now four years later where

136
00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.870
we turned down nine out of 10 projects we literally only pick one out of 10 because we know that we

137
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.890
can absolutely do a fantastic job.

138
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:04.930
It's worth it for us.

139
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.280
Cost effective wise and it's worth it for us schedule wise.

140
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.810
But it just takes time to get to that point.

141
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:15.820
So be aware that there's a trough of sorrow you need to be a little bit persistent but if you follow

142
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.330
all the advice in this course you'll be able to cut the time honestly by half.

143
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.720
You'll probably move 80 percent of the time it takes to figure out what your niche is what is going

144
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.760
to be your repeatable strategy for finding business and how are you going to deliver on your promises

145
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.290
and ultimately make good margins.

146
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:33.670
Okay.

147
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:39.460
So if any of you guys thought this is going to be easy I've hopefully destroyed all kind of hope that

148
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.740
you have.

149
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.230
It's not entirely incredibly hard but just keep in mind it's something that takes time.

150
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.170
Follow the advice in this course you'll be able to accelerate your growth so much faster.

151
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.890
But just do be aware that there's going to be a period where it takes a while to figure everything out.

152
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.570
So see in the next lecture.
