00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.090
So here is where you write comments and I could put any type of comment I wanted on here I could say

2
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.470
you know I have new design tweaks for you to integrate and I can comment like that.

3
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.920
OK.

4
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.950
So now the person who is a theoretical freelancer would see this almost immediately.

5
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
What I can also do which is extremely helpful is I can just go up here and add attachments so I can

6
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.580
attach a computer Dropbox Google Drive.

7
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.170
So say this person is building a screen and I just changed it tweaked this small design on it and I

8
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.650
want them to change that.

9
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.270
All you have to do is go up here and attach from a computer and import it into this so quite literally

10
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.550
there's no more of this.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.270
Hey where's the design that we need.

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.380
Missing the wrong.

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.290
Know I have the right version of the design.

14
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.750
You don't have to send them this big convoluted folder full of designs you can literally just put it

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.530
on each individual task.

16
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.120
And one way of doing this is say if you want to if you're working with a developer and you want them

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.330
to build one big screen so I say like build per screen you would put this task up immediately go over

18
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.850
here give the drill down information specifically what you mean.

19
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.620
Any comments you have any directives you have.

20
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.450
And Attash the designs so the person comes up sees what they need to start working on first and then

21
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.730
grabs the designs downloads them and starts on it.

22
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.000
So that's a great way of dealing with some version tracking and specifically finding designs.

23
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.800
OK so there's a little bit other functionality over here you can set a due date and this is very very

24
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.390
helpful when you're working with a freelancer or a contractor because a lot of times you're going to

25
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.730
be inclined not to give them deadlines and that's generally not a great idea.

26
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.380
It's always a good idea to give them a deadline because it will allow them to prioritize what exactly

27
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.290
is most important and allow them to at least give you some type of idea of how quickly they're working

28
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.950
and when it's going to be done and the way that I suggest doing this especially with contract or outsource

29
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.950
labor is you don't set a due date yourself.

30
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.430
That doesn't really make sense.

31
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.190
Even if you are technical and even if you are very ingrained in the process and you know exactly how

32
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.850
long that will take to build the second screen it's not worth it for you to do that.

33
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.280
It just builds resentment and it's inevitably going to be incorrect.

34
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.760
You want them to set the due date and then you can have final say about whether or not you think it's

35
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.760
going to take too long and you can have that discussion with them.

36
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.050
But it makes more sense for them to reasonably give you a due date if they think it's going to take

37
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.010
them two days.

38
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.760
They should do that if they think it's going to take them three days.

39
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.250
They should do that.

40
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.110
Don't I always suggest don't try to shove that down their throat and make them make them accept a due

41
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.410
date that you arbitrarily made up in your head.

42
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.400
So right here and then all I can say when I want it to be done here is today you can't say in the past.

43
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.590
But you know let's say it's due in five days so I could say the 29th.

44
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.150
OK.

45
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.790
I can even be specific like say I have a product launch or an e-mail going out it's going out at 3:00

46
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.180
p.m. so I need to have this done and uploaded at 2:00 pm.

47
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.690
I can also set it to a recurring task and I can also you know do things like liking it.

48
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.880
That's helpful when you're in large organizations because people can like things.

49
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.110
It's helpful when you add adding things like ideas in here and then people can say and like it and then

50
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.690
you can go up here and sort by popularity.

51
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.230
OK.

52
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.450
Now now that you've set a due date on one of your task what you can then do is go and look at your calendar

53
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.690
for your project on this is kind of cool what it'll do is it'll automatically populate your task in

54
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.500
a calendar.

55
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.780
So I'm literally looking at this and today's Monday I could look at Monday and say oh by tomorrow I

56
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.850
have I expect this section to be done or this feature to be done or this bug to be fixed and I can see

57
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.170
oh and this one is specifically going to be uploaded at 2 pm.

58
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.760
I'm not familiar with it or I'd know off my head that says I can just click it and go directly to it

59
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.830
and then right there I can just see what exactly it is.

60
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.450
And typically with your freelancer your contractor you get a long thread of you know what's going on.

61
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.140
Explanation's conversations et cetera.

62
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.740
So very very helpful.

63
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.200
Big projects this will fill up very quickly.

64
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.590
It's also a very helpful tool.

65
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.060
You can go directly to attachments.

66
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.280
Now if I go to attachment So what's going to happen is going to take every single attachment that are

67
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.970
in any of those threads any of those tasks.

68
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.470
And it's going to put it here.

69
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.120
So it's going to be a big pile of all of the assets all of the files all of the instructions you needed

70
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.310
for the task.

71
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.170
And that's very very helpful if you're just looking specifically for a file.

72
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.320
You don't need to know what thread it was posted in and you can always just go to this pile right here

73
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.760
OK one of the other things that you it's very important to understand or do this is these are individual

74
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.900
tasks but they don't have to be tasks.

75
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.620
I can turn these into sections of I want to.

76
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.960
OK.

77
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.990
So now if I wanted one of these to instead be a section as opposed to a task I could just literally

78
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.740
put a colon at the end of it.

79
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.220
So you know I put a colon that turned it into a section as opposed to a task.

80
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.140
Now I don't want to do sections sections make a lot more sense because I can build this out say my application

81
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.780
has five screens I could build you know first screen and then we could say build second screen and we

82
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.890
could say build a screen like that and we go all the way down to five.

83
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.060
You also create them by going like this and just going new section right here and I'll add one.

84
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.410
Now if I wanted to add a task underneath this all I'd have to do is hit enter and there you go.

85
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.260
Now I have a task now I can get much more granular with it.

86
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.290
I can now say specifically what needs to be happening in the first screen.

87
00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:01.270
So the first screen has the Facebook log in and I could say Facebook log in to be installed and you

88
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.450
know you could say logo must be displayed etc. etc..

89
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.640
So what this allows us to do is branch them out into sections break down the sections in individual

90
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:20.080
pieces and then allow them to update you as individual things get finished and you have a real time

91
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.820
kind of trail of what's happening as they go and they click through them and you see kind of from a

92
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.280
project standpoint how quickly your application or your project or whatever it is you're working on

93
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.550
or building gets filled up.

94
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.720
And now as I am doing this I can again go back and look at the complete tasks.

95
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.590
There were other more interesting things you can do that is go to your project and just double tap it

96
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:53.170
and it'll actually give you a project overview over here right here where it says your progress as tasks

97
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.240
are being added and as tasks will remain.

98
00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.610
So at the very beginning we might add say a hundred different things and then right over here as we

99
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:07.600
start knocking them off we can see over time how quickly we are either accelerating in our project completion

100
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.940
or slowing down.

101
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.810
That's really helpful to see if you have a freelancer's just knocking out tasks knocking out tasks and

102
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.850
then all of a sudden maybe has another project pop up or you get distracted and then you see it start

103
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:25.330
to plateau or drop and all of a sudden that's a good way of channeling that they've lost enthusiasm

104
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.520
or lost interest or lost time.

105
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.320
You can also use statuses right here.

106
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.990
Here you can just post the statuses is helpful if you have multiple people working on a project and

107
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.980
that is not uncommon.

108
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:45.590
If I had multiple people I could just say freelance or to email feel bad for freelance or to at gmail

109
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.140
is about to get e-mailed but I can also add them into this project.

110
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.690
And then all of a sudden I can add statuses and any time I add a status they'll get notified of it.

111
00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.840
So I could say you know project going well.

112
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:10.350
I could also say you could also say you know the mobile application has crashed.

113
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.430
The thing works.

114
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.350
So yes.

115
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.120
OK.

116
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.330
Set that status.

117
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.890
Everyone gets notified.

118
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.520
So you set that status it goes to pretty much everyone when you need to do it and here is notify people

119
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:31.100
and then add them so that that and then any time I push a status it will quite literally just push that

120
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.570
message to everyone on their phones will get a push notification from the application.

121
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.690
Very helpful.

122
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:42.410
This is something you can use when your application is alive or whatever it is and you need immediate

123
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.290
feedback or immediate fixes.

124
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.760
Very very helpful thing else that we really need to cover is the inbox and you can see up here in the

125
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.920
inbox really all this is as you know as you have threads and idea multiple projects as people message

126
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.400
you or update threads.

127
00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.890
It's going to populate in here and as you get them populated you can say that you read them and they

128
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.460
disappear.

129
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:07.070
So this is typically something you can always check just to see what exactly you need to put your attention

130
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.800
towards If you're not so when you don't you check e-mail all the time.

131
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:16.410
OK so we've covered pretty much everything you need to know to get acquainted with asana very very simple.

132
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.430
It's all task based.

133
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.470
It has a very powerful notification system very easy to integrate your freelancers contractors into

134
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.630
your projects makes it such So there's really no excuse for them not to join it.

135
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:34.910
And overall a very easy way to keep track of what you're doing and keep track of where your project

136
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.840
is now that you're acquainted.

137
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:42.800
We can move on and I can show you how we use a sauna when we're building our projects and what's the

138
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:49.490
easy kind of template for setting up asana projects and for how you handle the actual workflow with

139
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.320
a freelancer.

140
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:58.790
So I'll see you guys in next lecture.
