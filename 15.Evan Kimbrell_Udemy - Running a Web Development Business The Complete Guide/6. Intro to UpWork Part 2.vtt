00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.390
Messages they just have a message section.

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:15.760
I don't like how it's separated out because on here it's like it's separate it out to where you have

3
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.570
to go to your messages section to message them and every time they message you it shows up in your message

4
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.950
section.

5
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.570
It just doesn't make sense to me that separate it out.

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.990
But one advantage though is that you don't have to go through finding your project finding the person

7
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.810
finding the screen send them a message you can just do this and send it to whoever you want.

8
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.670
Or you know someone that you've hired in the past or someone you've communicated with in the past could

9
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.320
just send them a message.

10
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.240
Get to work etc. etc. that can be a little bit helpful.

11
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.320
It's similar to Lance and it is in this out as well.

12
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.170
You have the ability to search for freelancers in jobs that kind of the same logic applies to you Lance

13
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.880
freelancers great if you want to search for individual people.

14
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.440
So like we used an example before let's search for Twilio in your search for jobs you knew the same

15
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.340
thing and you can borrow their their specifications or adopt some of the things they use that you like.

16
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.300
I like the ability to drill down on oDesk a little bit more than Elance and I'll show you why they just

17
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.730
give you a lot more control so I can just do a slider and how much I want to pay.

18
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.270
If you don't want to pay more than $20 an hour and my hours build I can set how long they've you know

19
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.160
how many they've they've built.

20
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.580
This is a big one for me.

21
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.820
You can ask by When's the last time that they logged on to oDesk and did something you can't do on elance

22
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.040
you can't do on a freelancer.

23
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.770
So because oDesk tracks their movements a lot more than the other two you can make sure that this person

24
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.470
is active on their system.

25
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.750
You might think that's you know why would I want to know that.

26
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.450
It's actually quite important.

27
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.520
Someone who is active in the system is going to be more responsive it's someone who's not going to disappear

28
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.070
on you and someone you know that when you message at 10:00 p.m. They're or respond by 11:00 p.m. on

29
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.780
elance you don't know if that person made their account it hasn't checked it in six months.

30
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.650
It's kind of impossible to tell sometimes.

31
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.080
And this is also a really cool benefit.

32
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.510
This new contact them they have the green and the yellow and the red dots next to the contact.

33
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.590
So like if I wanted to contact this guy or Rob for it you can see that he replies within a day.

34
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.690
That's awesome for me because I know maybe if I want to hire today or tomorrow I know that I can go

35
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.150
out and recruit people directly.

36
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.760
And I know that they're going to apply roughly within this time and so typically when I go and I recruit

37
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.870
people to my job I will look for the people that have green stars and I just skip or that he will be

38
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.780
yellow in the red unless they have really specific to what I need.

39
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.830
But I can save a lot of time doing that.

40
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.020
This is the way that you message people and recruit people.

41
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.640
I always suggest that when you do a job posting and we'll do this later when we do the dry run when

42
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.230
we go through and make an entire application I like doing this or I can message them and invite in this

43
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.320
case I can create a job specifically for them and if I had a job that was active it would give me a

44
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.220
screen asking to invite them specifically to it.

45
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.270
ODesk Lummis how many people you can invite to your your job.

46
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.410
I think it's like 20 a day.

47
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.230
So but that is quite nice.

48
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.240
Disremembered remember log in every day and get your 20 done because that's dramatically going to increase

49
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.550
your participation for people in your project.

50
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.440
But this is kind of nice.

51
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.150
I can send this person a specific job just for him see what he says.

52
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.780
If he accepts it see if he denies it.

53
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.480
All right.

54
00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.360
So the last thing I want to show you is just how you can how Otis streamlines all the information per

55
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.460
freelancer so you can kind of keep track of everything about that person and your relationship with

56
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.960
them.

57
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.860
And I typically find this to be quite useful.

58
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.090
So for me again I have to look for old jobs because I have not been using oDesk.

59
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.890
But here is an example of someone that I hired to do kind of as needed fixes you can tell the guy was

60
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.910
$13 an hour he bills a lot.

61
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.250
He's.

62
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.160
He's outsourced.

63
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.800
I can give you the contract that I had with that person and this is great when you know taxes come around

64
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.650
and you need to keep all your documents together.

65
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.740
But I could see right here.

66
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.940
Here's the feedback that he gave me.

67
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.850
I thought I'd given him feedback as well and I can go through all of our messages and it kind of this

68
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.530
is how much I pay to him and you know this is when I did the contract with them I can send him a message

69
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.050
I can throw them a bonus and I can see now I love this it can actually tell me what time it is where

70
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.510
they are.

71
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.410
Some are on here it also shows you when the last time you logged in was which is quite helpful too because

72
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.710
lot of times over freelancers say Oh I haven't seen it.

73
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.520
The message you sent them and you can also check and see that they've already logged on so that's not

74
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.860
true.

75
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.850
So yeah this is oDesk.

76
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.130
It's definitely something you should add to your lance typically like it's better but a lot of people

77
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.480
have had a really good experience with the oDesk still big wide range of freelancers on here.

78
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.700
I don't think you really go wrong.

79
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.170
Typically though when I look for freelancers I'll post on you Lance and oDesk.

80
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.750
Use them in tandem make sense considering they're actually one merged company.

81
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.880
But yeah I think it's something we're checking out.

82
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.240
Some of you like it more than Elance.

83
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.080
So next on a good idea we're going to freelancer

84
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.010
do.
