00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.320
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk a little bit about do you

2
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.880
build something yourself or do you contract it out.

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.730
You find someone else to do it for you.

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.650
Now if you are not a programmer you need to skip this lecture.

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.310
This is not going to help you at all.

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.810
This one is for you guys out there who already know how to program and are coming at this from the angle

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.580
of you already freelance or you're interested in freelancing or you're interested in growing an actual

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.830
business around your freelance business.

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.550
So you're probably wondering yourself so do I just build this myself and you after all do I know the

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.410
most about yourself.

11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.660
You know exactly what you're capable of.

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.780
So there's no real like chance for a miscommunication.

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.250
Now this is obviously up to every single person.

14
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.740
All you guys want to keep this small and you want to do all of your own projects that's perfectly fine.

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.570
My advice though is that if you want to become efficient and you want to grow this at all or just maintain

16
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.880
a much higher quality of life I strongly suggest that you do not program 100 percent of the time.

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.370
In fact it's of my opinion that you can't run a web development business if you're the only person doing

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.580
the work all the time.

19
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.640
So if you spend 100 percent of your time programming the sites and applications.

20
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.410
Who is going to be bringing in the new projects when your projects are over.

21
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.480
What do you do now.

22
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.020
Do you literally just have a period of time where you're just searching for the next contract.

23
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.230
You have to understand that contract.

24
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.070
In general it's usually like a burst of work and then you have maintenance work and then you have add

25
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.530
ons but those come at a much slower frequency and the amount of work is considerably smaller than the

26
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.170
first chunk of actual work on the project.

27
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.150
So let's accept the fact that you're going to have at least a smidge of marketing and sales that you're

28
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.570
going to have to do and perhaps it's only at the beginning.

29
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.060
So now how much marketing are you having to do.

30
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.400
Is it 10 percent of your time 20 percent or time 50 percent of your time let's say you spend 30 percent

31
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.420
of your time finding contracts and 70 percent of your time working on those contracts.

32
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.180
Do you feel comfortable being the lead developer or the person who's controls the entire project.

33
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.880
If you can only spend 70 percent of your time on that project what if it's more like 50 percent.

34
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.650
Do you really wanna spend 50 percent of your time on that project.

35
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.060
Now the reason why development firms are so successful when they're founded by someone who is a programmer

36
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.250
someone who is technical is because your expertise and your experience is going to allow you to have

37
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.890
critical insights and make much better project decisions during a project.

38
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.430
Now a non developer is not going to have that same advantage that you have now.

39
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.580
While you might be a fantastic developer now that you're trying to build a business around this you

40
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.180
need to understand that what you bring to the business might not necessarily be your programming skill.

41
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.910
By far with successful development companies the programmer or the original founder.

42
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.660
Their best kind of role is oversight.

43
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.020
Now you can still program on a day to day basis if that's the way you want to go but realistically you're

44
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.410
going to need to lay off just a little bit.

45
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.880
You're a much more useful to your project when you're inserting your little bits of brilliance directly

46
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.070
to a contractor or through management and basic project oversight.

47
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.830
If you listen to my previous lecture when we talked about subcontracting strategy you know that you

48
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.340
are probably the magic combination that can use low cost contractors to build high quality products.

49
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.650
And honestly if you wanted to tackle higher quality products more kind of premium side applications

50
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.830
you could work with higher paid contractors as well and then convert them into a really high high quality

51
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.810
of product.

52
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.940
However in my opinion since you're inclined to be technical it might be best for you to focus on low

53
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.480
cost options.

54
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.840
So just be aware if you're trying to build a successful development business and you're trying to grow

55
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.450
it whether that's growth in terms of better projects more projects or maybe you just want to get to

56
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.940
a position where you're more choosy about the projects you take in you're still going to need to be

57
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.540
very thoughtful about how you apply your time.

58
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.640
You're in the best position to help the project but if you're the person in the trenches doing the programming

59
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.360
every single day you're not going to benefit from the synergies of bringing in someone else to collaborate

60
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.330
with you.

61
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.820
So you're more than welcome to try whatever you want.

62
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.230
You can use this course in many different ways.

63
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.570
There are lots of ways that could help you just as an individual freelancer expand your clientele base

64
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.280
expand your business base.

65
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.130
But if you really want to be successful at this you really want to see the truth vantages of turning

66
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.610
your freelance operation into a legitimate business.

67
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.120
You need to consider taking time off of programming focusing on oversight and then focusing on delivering

68
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.100
value through that management.

69
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.940
Okay guys we're almost through the Getting midsections we only have a couple more lectures where we

70
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.230
talk about kind of planning and getting your head around what you're going to do and how you're going

71
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.160
to tackle this next section we're actually going to get into it.

72
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.730
OK guys.

73
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:20.860
Any questions just post in the group discussion.
