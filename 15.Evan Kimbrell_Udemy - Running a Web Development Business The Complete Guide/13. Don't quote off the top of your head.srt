00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:11,490
You guys will welcome back to the course so we're kind of a quick collector on something that a lot

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,430
of people who run the development business make a mistake with and that is don't ever quote off the

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,510
top of your head.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,920
Now this is something that you might not imagine right now but once you start getting into it happens

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,090
all the time.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,820
Such and Such we'll say I want to build this and that and they will ask you on the spot how many hours

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,230
do you think this will be.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,840
A lot of times you'll say oh I don't know and they'll still press you what range of hours do you think

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,020
it's going to be.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,770
This is something that you should almost never ever do even if you're really experienced with giving

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,310
estimates.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,520
Just don't do it.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,140
The upside potential is actually quite small.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,330
And the downside is quite large.

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,490
Now the biggest reason why this is a problem is because if you try to give an estimate and then later

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,340
on try to give a full estimate back to the person chances are you probably miss something or the client

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,420
forgot to mention something which happens all the time.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,870
And then the Eserine you give them is going to be different.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,480
That's a bad scenario.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,070
90 percent of the time if you give them a second estimate that's not even within their original range

21
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,860
you gave them you're going to lose that contract.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,540
Why.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,300
Well it just honestly it just makes sense.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,810
Even if you believe that person really tried their hardest to give you an estimate.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,480
You came back to them and they gave you a different one.

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,130
What would you think the price was higher than you would assume that they're trying to rip you off.

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,490
If it's lower you just assume that they're an idiot and they don't know what they're talking about.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,870
They're just throwing numbers out at random.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,040
You don't want to lose authority and you don't want to lose your position as an expert.

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,490
So just don't do it.

31
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,850
Now one thing to keep in mind is that it might frustrate the person you're talking to but be realistic.

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,010
No other development firm is going to do that.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,650
So it's not as if you're the only person sticking them.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,360
If they're talking to five different companies none of them are going to do that.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,590
And if one of them does that one is taking on some serious risk.

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,210
So it's not as if you're withholding information they could get from other people.

37
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,000
You're not putting yourself at a disadvantage you're pretty much doing the industry standard.

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,170
The best way of tackling these situations is to always say you're not sure but I can give you an estimate

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,420
in a short amount of time.

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,100
Then you need to rely on the framework you've established to give a ballpark estimate.

41
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,600
We covered that in a separate lecture.

42
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:33,030
That one is so incredibly crucial to landing clients focused on getting that framework done so that

43
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,820
you can create ballpark estimates worst case scenario.

44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,670
You can just give them a full estimate and a full proposal.

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:45,050
So best case scenario is you might make them slightly happier with you.

46
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,280
And worst case scenario is you block them off from ever being your client and you come off looking like

47
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,560
you don't know what you're talking about.

48
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,340
Now it might be possible that you run into a scenario where you absolutely just have to answer the question

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,080
some reason or another.

50
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,350
If that ever happens to you do this don't give them a range with two ends.

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,510
Give them a one end of the range that is usually enough to satisfy them.

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,250
So as opposed to saying hey your project is going to take a thousand to 600 hours to build say it's

53
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,530
going to take over a thousand or under 2000 or under 6400.

54
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,220
Basically what you're doing is you're kind of hedging your likelihood of getting the estimate correct.

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,190
And if it ends up being that you miss it just shyly then you might adjust the price to still capture

56
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,910
the client.

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,670
That's enough information to at least give them idea of hey this is big or hey this is small which is

58
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,650
really all they want if they're being really really pushy about it.

59
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:38,990
OK.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,240
So regardless of how well you think you know this project there's still information you're missing and

61
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,580
it's just a gamble that's not worth it.

62
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,120
The upside isn't very good and the downside is quite bad.

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,920
So don't do it.

64
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,600
Don't call off the top of your head.

65
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,630
This is something I get stuck with all the time.

66
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,190
I still make this mistake so try to avoid it as much as possible.

67
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,850
Worst case scenario gun to your head.

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,750
Give them one open ended range and don't give them the other number.

69
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,800
That should at least increase the odds that you don't shoot yourself in the foot.

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,220
All right guys.

71
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:21,110
