Hey guys.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.020
Welcome back to the course so in this lecture I'm going to try to acquaint you just a little bit with

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.490
how do development firms in general work.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.130
So there's actually a lot of different types of development companies but they only really fall into

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.590
two buckets.

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.750
Not all development firms are the same and not all of them try to take on the same types of projects.

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.380
So first off it's a decision between whether or not a firm is full stack or specialized.

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.580
Now what do I mean by that.

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.500
Previously we talked about what exactly is a dev stack.

10
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.250
And a lot of firms will build everything on that development stack so they'll cover every single one

11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.760
of those technologies.

12
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.710
If you need to build something it requires setting up a server.

13
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.860
They've got it covered.

14
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.580
A build something that requires writing server side programming like DHP covered sequel databases.

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:06.530
They'll do that for you if you want to even install the graphic design that you've had made before like

16
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.790
create your own HD Jamail javascript layer.

17
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.480
They'll do that.

18
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.150
That's what a full stack development firm is.

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.170
Typically those people are building something from scratch or they're building something kind of in

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.890
totality they don't usually pick up other projects that are halfway done or add on sections to someone

21
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.290
else's project.

22
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.410
Now the alternative to that is a specialized firm specialized firm might only pick one technology layer

23
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.540
and specialize in that.

24
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.250
A lot of firms you can go out and talk to you and they only will do say front end development meaning

25
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.060
they'll only do the javascript with or only do the HDMI in the CSSA although even only do the slicing

26
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.080
of the images from your graphic design.

27
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.110
A lot of firms out there will specialize in setting up servers.

28
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.960
A lot of firms will specialize in a very specific technology that might be popular or it might be something

29
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.330
that other people just do not specialize in.

30
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.380
Give you an example of that.

31
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.050
No.

32
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.330
S is a popular server side javascript which is kind of obscure and a not a lot of Web sites use it currently

33
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.500
but its in demand so a lot of companies will specialize in say that.

34
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.450
Now the other big dividing line between development firms is whether or not they build something thats

35
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.390
custom or they use platforms.

36
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.760
So now what I mean by that.

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.740
While a lot of people want to build something that doesnt necessarily need to be built from scratch.

38
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.560
They want to build something that has components that have been built elsewhere.

39
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.710
And so a lot of times people will say I want to build this website but I want it to be built on top

40
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.470
of something now that something might be say like Wordpress or Drupal if you're familiar with that.

41
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.380
A lot of firms work specifically with those platforms and they specialize in customizing those platforms

42
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.220
to fit people's needs.

43
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.600
The opposite of that is a firm that builds custom meaning if you have an idea they're going to build

44
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.040
the entirety of it they're going to build all of the architecture they're going to set everything up

45
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.930
themselves.

46
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.770
They're not going to reuse any code from anywhere.

47
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.970
They're not going to take any shortcuts.

48
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.540
Now you can actually build a firm that does both of them.

49
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.830
But what you'll notice is typically they're either one or the other firms that like to build custom

50
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.930
applications will insist on building custom applications and firms that like to use platforms almost

51
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.140
always will suggest using a platform as a way to kind of skip ahead in the development process and save

52
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.620
money.

53
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.610
I couldn't tell you how many fit into each category but if you do go and just take a browse around you'll

54
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.120
see that there's quite a lot of them.

55
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.390
So that should explain to you exactly what are the categories of development firms later we're going

56
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.820
to talk about how do you pick your strategy and how do you pick which one you want to be.

57
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.790
What's going to give you the most opportunity.

58
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.860
What's going to get your business the soonest and what fits best with your profile and the people that

59
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.970
you're working with.

60
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.200
Okay guys we're almost through the essentials section onto the next section.

61
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.320
No actually started getting into the formulation and the conception behind your firm.

62
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.870
These are all just the lectures of the things that you should know before you get into it.

63
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.890
This is kind of a crash course how to development firms work.

64
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.190
Any questions comments.

65
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:28.290
Just post them on the group discussion otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
