00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.170
You guys come back to the course.

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.330
So in this lecture I'm just going to talk a little bit about an option that is available to all of you

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.800
who do development businesses.

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.560
This is something that a lot of people do not take advantage of.

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.810
Now if you're following this course we've talked considerably about how important using subcontracting

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.870
is and that when you are using subcontracting the point is that you're going to have some sort of a

7
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:39.130
margin from what you pay your contractor and what you charge your client right now and that's primarily

8
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.620
what makes this a business.

9
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.220
That's primarily what makes it helpful for you.

10
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.010
Even if you are a programmer to bring in other people if you're just bringing in other people and charging

11
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.770
exactly what they are charging passing on essentially their fee then there's really not a huge point

12
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.110
to adding subcontractors in general.

13
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.550
So I want to talk just a little bit about what you can do.

14
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.970
This is a great strategy for getting off the ground after you do have your template Web site up and

15
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.640
you've gotten to a point where you think you know you've had enough clients and you have enough of a

16
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.460
portfolio what you can do is very very effective.

17
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.850
You can actually barter off your services to other people.

18
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.450
So if you don't have a great designer that you want to work with or you don't simply want to spend the

19
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.550
money to get the design done what you can actually do is barter for it.

20
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.040
So if someone were to design our website from scratch I mean I would probably say you know it's close

21
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:56.140
to 10 pages once a page with an entirely separate design it has custom J. Yes we have blog integration.

22
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.400
You know I'd probably say it's three to four thousand dollars and the way we went through multiple iterations

23
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.880
as well.

24
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.090
We have custom icon sets as well multiple logos et cetera.

25
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.440
So it probably costs you know $45000 to get this site designed.

26
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.190
What we actually ended up doing at the very beginning because I simply just didn't want to fork over

27
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.630
the mount of money is I just made a deal with a designer who was running a business who needed development

28
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.290
work and so we just split the two.

29
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.910
I gave him a reduced rate.

30
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.230
I reduced the rate down to what exactly I pay out to my contractors.

31
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.040
And then I gave him myself as a project manager and then I ran the management layer and he on the side

32
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.260
designed our Web site so I bring it up here because this is our old collaboration page where we used

33
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.610
to work with a lot of companies and do this barter system.

34
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.830
And that was a great way of collaborating and what we would typically do is mark ourselves at the bottom

35
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.820
of each one of these collaboration and we always do these for a reduced fee and it is a great way of

36
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.390
getting our name out there but also growing our portfolio.

37
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.680
So in this case the project that we built was called hub Qik.

38
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.820
We literally just did a swap and over the course of three months we built his application.

39
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.210
He designed our Web site.

40
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.730
It worked out perfectly well.

41
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.830
This is actually the designers web site.

42
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.860
He does a lot of high profile Web sites.

43
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.770
So the way that you would go about creating a partnership like this is pretty easy the way that we did

44
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.430
it actually was that we posted a collaboration page like this.

45
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.470
And we looked for people who essentially had an idea.

46
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.780
It was interesting and they themselves had design skills or some skill kind of in the same area and

47
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.950
they just wanted to see if they could get a reduced rate if as a project we liked or B that we could

48
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.310
somehow use to our advantage.

49
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.700
And they actually reach out to us through this.

50
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.910
But similarly what you can do is if you find a designer that you really do look like and there's some

51
00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.390
indication that they're building their own projects you can offer them development services in exchange

52
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.410
for design.

53
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:10.660
Now your infinite advantage in this scenario is that there's a margin between what you charge and what

54
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.790
your contractors expect you to pay them.

55
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.680
So if you charge $50 an hour and you owe your contractors $30 an hour you can charge $30 an hour and

56
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.460
then say f per For every hour that we work I just save you $20 an hour and you can use that as a rough

57
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.830
guideline to essentially barter saying you know this is how much of a reduction I'm giving you over

58
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.590
the course of your project I gave you a $2000 reduction.

59
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.470
So if you give us $2000 and design services that'll make up for it.

60
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.240
Typically graphic designers and even design firms like doing this because they like creating partnerships

61
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.090
with development firms they get to share their clients together but also again for them they get to

62
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.000
use it as a portfolio item and design it comes naturally to them.

63
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.130
So it's not as if they feel like they're having to pay you cold cash.

64
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.640
So yeah this is a kind of a virtuous circle scenario where you can create a synergistic relationship

65
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.290
and it actually ends up working out really well.

66
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.630
This was a very large application that we built that we also sent to this designer.

67
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.040
We worked together on four or five other projects after that.

68
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.760
So keep in mind guys you have a margin.

69
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.300
Use that margin to your advantage if you want to see if you can pull this off or reach out to designers

70
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.860
you like that have internal projects offer them vastly reduced development services in exchange for

71
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.730
design.

72
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.100
It's a slow road to getting a better web site but it saves you a ton of money and is a great way of

73
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.430
essentially getting a free Web site.

74
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.260
So keep that in mind.

75
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:57.090
I'll see you in the next lecture.
