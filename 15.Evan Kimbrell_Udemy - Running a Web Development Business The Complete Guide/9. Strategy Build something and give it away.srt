00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,040
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,050
So in this lecture I'm going to talk about what are the most powerful strategies out there for finding

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,750
clients.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,350
Now this strategy is called Give something away for free.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,900
Now you've probably heard that in other verticals or other businesses.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,540
A lot of times people give or create things.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,520
Those things have value.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,900
They give them away for free.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,880
Now this is especially potent in development businesses for a couple reasons.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,740
One is that when you create something for free and you give it away.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,240
Not only does it establish you won as someone who is competent it shows.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,460
Look at this thing I created it shows off to that person that you can master that technology or you

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,790
have such a good understanding of how that tech works that you can create it on your own and you're

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,500
so confident you can give it away for free.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,860
The second thing is what it does is that it actually puts you in the door with tons and tons of people.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,120
So not only does it raise your actual profile people might have heard of you if you give away something

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,410
that's really popular but it gets you automatic entry into conversations with people all over the world.

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,980
Now let me roll it back a little bit to help you understand what exactly I mean when it applies to a

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,150
development business.

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,730
Now typically what you would do is you would pick some type of tool that you think would be really really

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,130
helpful.

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,690
Or you go out and do some research on something that also you think would be really helpful.

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:38,010
You also do really simple things like create guides to links to popular tools or ways to fix problems

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,250
that you've run into.

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,090
Whatever it is something that your potential client group has problems with.

26
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,250
Now if you're trying to gain attention of say like the development community maybe you want to build

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,070
something around hard problems that developers have you create a free tool that solves that problem.

28
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,840
If you want to target a specific community let's go back to that real estate example.

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,800
Maybe you build a tool that is really makes it really easy for people to share photos of their spaces

30
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:14,010
or maybe you make a tool that automatically displays available houses on the market on a map something

31
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,520
like that.

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,930
Now the thing doesn't have to be incredibly complicated it just has to be something that you can do

33
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,360
simply that other people could not do very easily.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,840
And the reason why you can do it simply is because you have development expertise and you have development

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,770
capacity.

36
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,140
So really what you want to do is you want to think about what group are you trying to sell to.

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,880
And then think about any type of problem they have that could easily be solved by say like a web tool.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,100
Now the way that you're going to be successful with this is by how well you can understand your potential

39
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,390
customer and then how well you can identify a small problem they have that you could solve.

40
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,200
Now it's a good idea to go after a problem that everyone in your customer base potentially could have

41
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,150
and not just a standard solution for one person.

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,420
OK.

43
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,170
So to give you an example here at Sprint.

44
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,180
One of our biggest client bases is actually graphic designers and specifically graphic design studios.

45
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,410
Now how are their client.

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,570
So we've got a lot of our business by going after freelancers and graphic design firms and saying hey

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,250
you're losing a lot of money.

48
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,350
Why don't we partner together you design and we develop so we give you all of our design jobs.

49
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,990
You give us all of your development jobs and that's worked extra extraordinarily well.

50
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,770
We don't have to deal with finding new clients.

51
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,450
All we have to do is deal with keeping up the bargain of what are we just promised to the other firm.

52
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:43,890
So what we ended up doing was we had known that graphic designers do not have a ton of places or free

53
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,570
tools to show off their portfolio.

54
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,500
We also knew that while there are some tools out there like core a flaw or dribble typically they cost

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,660
money or Typically they are just really ugly and hard to customize.

56
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,060
And we also knew that graphic design firms really didn't like using those platforms for portfolios.

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,280
The reason they don't like that is because when you're a graphic design firm typically when you want

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,550
to show off a design you want to put more information about it.

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,440
Typically you want to do things like case studies you'd like to include testimonials quotes you probably

60
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,540
have a more holistic approach to it.

61
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,610
It's not just showing off your final product and a lot of freelancers like this too.

62
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:31,770
So what we did is we built a free portfolio tool that allowed you to present graphic design in a case

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,250
study type of manner.

64
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,410
And this is something that we cover.

65
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,580
If you've ever taken any of my other courses we actually cover this quite extensively.

66
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,900
We called the marketing access portal and there is something that we literally just launched as a part

67
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,060
of our development.

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,740
And then within our the app that we gave away completely free we just had lots of ways that you could

69
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,380
easily contact us.

70
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,690
Now that's a little bit of an exaggeration in terms of how far we went with it to get a lot of business

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,910
and to build hype but that's kind of the basic idea we identified that a good client base for US were

72
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,060
graphic design freelancers and graphic design firms right.

73
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,400
We knew that they had a problem or we knew that they had a solution out there that just wasn't perfect

74
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,550
and that since we had a lot of development capacity we could build something better for them.

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,550
So we did that.

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,570
And honestly you know with the portfolio we made isn't necessarily even better than anything out there.

77
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,880
That wasn't the point.

78
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,400
The point was just to get a lot of attention because people love free things.

79
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,750
So you can use that as a strategy in your development business.

80
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,150
Think of who you're selling to.

81
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,870
Think of a problem they have and see if you can solve that problem really easily because at the end

82
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,990
of the day that's a really good way of advertising yourself.

83
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,700
And the reason why it is so particularly effective is because you're giving them something for free.

84
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,680
So you're building trust with them.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,440
They like the fact that they got something for free and also it's very easy to publicize free goods

86
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,250
when you're selling something that's free.

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,460
The kind of negative reaction from anyone you show that to is always going to be significantly less

88
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,270
than if you're charging money for it.

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,780
I came up to you and said here's a tool it costs $100 versus if I said here's a tool.

90
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,410
It's completely free.

91
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,250
If it's completely free you might forego the fact that you don't know me.

92
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,890
You have no rapport with me and you don't know what the tool does.

93
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,330
So it makes it a lot easier to spread.

94
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,450
But it's kind of like a little bit of a Trojan horse because it actually is advertising.

95
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,200
It is getting your name out there showing what you're capable of.

96
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,500
And if you're smart you put your information all over it.

97
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,550
So it's a great way to reel back in customers.

98
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,380
So that was a big growth hack for us that we did that our second year and building the marketing access

99
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,440
portal made a huge jump in how many partnerships we made.

100
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,490
Okay guys try it out yourself if you need help thinking of ideas.

101
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,300
Not an expert in every single field but just posts in the group discussion we can always try to help

102
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,820
you out.

103
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:54,990
Otherwise see next lecture.
