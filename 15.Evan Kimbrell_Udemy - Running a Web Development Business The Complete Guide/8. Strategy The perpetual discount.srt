00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,050
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,820
So I've got another strategy for you that you could potentially use in your development business.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,120
So this strategy is called the perpetual discount.

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:23,130
Now what I mean by that perpetual discounting is kind of a marketing term is something that I kind of

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,580
made up is probably not exactly what it's called.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:32,460
But if you're familiar with you to me that's a great way to explain this to me constantly has displayed

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,990
really high prices for their courses but then they run massive discounts on that.

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,250
And that's typically how they sell most of their courses and what kind of happened at least in the marketplace

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,660
is that people have reacted to these non-stops sales by raising their price up and up and up just because

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:56,160
buying a $400 course for $10 is better than buying a $50 course for $10 gives you that optical illusion

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,060
that this is more valuable or I'm getting more of a discount.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,330
So it's big.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,260
It's a better deal.

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,180
I should really go and grab it now.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,260
Now you can implement something similar to this in your actual application.

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,040
When we talked about before about you know it's really about scoring points with your potential client.

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,970
They need something that is going to draw them towards you having them think that they're getting a

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,020
discount is always a good thing.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,530
So what you can do is you can for instance offer rates that are based off of the type of client you

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,370
could say this is what we charge for corporate accounts.

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,270
So we charge for startups so we charge for freelancers nonprofits something like that.

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,790
Then what you can often do is inflate those numbers and then when you pitch it to them obviously you

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,530
see if they accept it.

24
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,470
They usually don't.

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,130
And then you have some sort of a leverage point to lower the price to essentially sweeten your offer.

26
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,470
Now the question I think a lot of people ask is that in some way dishonest it really just kind of depends

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,130
how you think about it.

28
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,640
For us what we often do is will say you know our per hour cost is this and if there's a client that

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,350
we really want or something that we think is a really good portfolio item or something we'd actually

30
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,270
enjoy working on.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
We will give them a discount or we discount relatively quite often.

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,080
But for us it's actually true because we do charging 60 dollars an hour typically.

33
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,570
And then when we offer a discount that is a true discount.

34
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,300
But what we noticed is it's always better to offer a higher anchor price because of the perceived value

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,190
and then it gives you more room to leverage to lower the price.

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,670
Now this is helpful for closing deals.

37
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,170
Not necessarily helpful for attracting interest to you.

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:41,010
It is something that you can use later on to get attention towards you for clients but the best part

39
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,000
about this is more about negotiating a contract.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,580
A lot of times you will get stuck in a contract negotiation and after you've tried pretty much all your

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,510
techniques giving them a great portfolio giving them a really personalized proposal you know going above

42
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,030
and beyond answer all their questions all times are kind of at a loss for what you can do past this

43
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,650
point.

44
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,290
Budget is almost always the biggest factor in their decision.

45
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,140
Its just one of the things that they mention probably the least.

46
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,530
So if you advertise yourself at a much higher rate than what you're willing to work for that gives you

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,460
room to wiggle.

48
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,780
It's great if you get someone at a much higher rate.

49
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,330
That means you can spend more put more time and effort into making a better product.

50
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,880
But you can also lower the price as a way to close the contract.

51
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,830
So obviously don't go wild like you to me has where you have thousand dollar courses.

52
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,390
There's no point in saying I'm worth $100 but I'll give you ten.

53
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,690
For the most part if you have a contract negotiation being able to lower the price that can actually

54
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,370
get them over the hump.

55
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,010
And so offering what is called kind of a perpetual discount which is you know a false price and then

56
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,470
a much more realistic price.

57
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,780
And you know that you can always gravitate towards it.

58
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,860
That puts you in a much better position to close contracts and to bring in more business.

59
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,570
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
