00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,080
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,990
Welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about what are the things that you

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,810
should look for in a long term contractor and a long term partner.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,050
So obviously it's very important if you pick a long term partner that you focus on the ones that are

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,740
good and that you have a good rapport with them.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,540
But there are three things that I want to kind of get across to you that you should look for above everything

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,110
else.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,470
So number one is responsiveness.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,800
What are your responsibilities.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,920
How quickly does it take them to respond to a question or a problem that you bring up.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,930
Now why is that important.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,150
Well if you're working with a contractor and they're separated from your main group people their ability

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,900
to get work turnaround and deliver work is going to be crucial for you.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,910
There's a lot of great contractors out there that if they don't respond quickly and they can't turn

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,460
around work quickly you're going to inevitably have unhappy clients and they're not worth working with.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,320
Responsiveness is also indicative of how much they value your relationship and just how good of a contractor

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,330
they are in general.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,560
You want to know that if something happens or you need something done or you need an estimate that when

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,510
you contact them they'll respond quickly.

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,940
They don't you're going to lose clients you're going to miss deadlines and you're going to have project

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,730
complications throughout the entire process.

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,770
Now the second thing is maturity.

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,840
A lot of contractors you'll meet will never admit they've done something wrong and they also will never

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,030
admit or talk about honestly things that don't work out or talk about their weaknesses or disadvantages.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,260
If you want a long term partner you need someone who recognizes the mistakes they make and moves to

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,980
remedy them.

27
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,480
Immaturity is one of the hardest things to work with with a contractor.

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,020
It will break down communication every single step.

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,560
Mature contractors also know what it takes to get work done.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,910
They're willing to put in extra time when they need to.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,220
And you don't have to spend tons and tons of time arguing with them or trying to get them to do something

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,260
correctly.

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,150
They should have done the first time.

34
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,540
Now the third thing is you need to find a contractor that you see eye to eye with on quality.

35
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,300
So what it basically means is you need to have similar standards.

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,610
You could have a fantastic contractor that meets all your metrics for a good subcontractor.

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,730
But if they think something's ugly is pretty and you don't understand that you're always going to have

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,510
issues and that's something that unfortunately is unsurmountable.

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,100
You want to work with a contractor that naturally knows what a good quality product looks like.

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,310
So when in doubt and when you start backing off and not managing them so much you know they can deliver

41
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,640
what exactly you need.

42
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,030
Now if they don't even know what good is and we have a lecture on that you're just going to run into

43
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,100
problems you're never going to allow them to become autonomous and you're never going to allow yourself

44
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,210
to shift your resources to other parts of the business which is crucial if you want to grow your business.

45
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,180
Just in general that's number one of the number one problems you'll have with contractors.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,920
What they think is good is different than what you think.

47
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,620
That is an unbridgeable divide.

48
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,030
And unfortunately the only way you can address it is that with more and more of your time which is exactly

49
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,820
what you don't want to be doing.

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,690
OK guys take those three into consideration you're looking at long term contractors obviously pay attention

51
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,350
to the other things that we cover in this course for selecting them.

52
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,250
But if you're looking at someone and wondering if this is someone who's going to go the distance and

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,050
someone that you know is safe a solid choice and you know they're always going to be there for you.

54
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,000
Focus on those three things.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,290
Look for responsiveness.

56
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,280
Look for maturity and look for similar standards of quality.

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:51,110
All right guys see in the next lecture.
