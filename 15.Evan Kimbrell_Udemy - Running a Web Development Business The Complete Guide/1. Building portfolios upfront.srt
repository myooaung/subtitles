00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,000
Guys.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,950
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,220
So in this lecture Let's talk about portfolios.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,080
I mean to answer the question How important is your portfolio and you probably thought in your head.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,990
Yes it's very important and we know this but I really just want to talk a little bit about why they're

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,070
important and better ways of thinking about it.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,150
So portfolios are obviously very very big if since you're new to web development or maybe you are just

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,610
new and general you probably haven't noticed that every single development firm or freelancer has at

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,980
least some form of a portfolio.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,370
That's the way that we show clients what we're capable of and who we work with.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,240
No it's no exaggeration to say that if you do not have a portfolio you probably will not make a sale.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,840
The exception to this is if you make a sale through some sort of an inside connection inside connections

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,470
maybe they don't need a portfolio.

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,050
So now that we've pretty much gotten out of the way you need to have some form of a portfolio.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,130
Let's talk a little bit about what clients look for now.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,010
There are a lot of big things that clients look for and the more important ones are the things that

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,760
are actually happening subconsciously things that they're not consciously looking for or thinking about.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,120
So the three things that I've noticed over and over again.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,890
Clients first look to see whether or not you have consistent high quality across your portfolio then

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,290
they're going to look for whether or not they recognize any of the applications or sites that you have

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,130
in it.

22
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,560
And then after that they're going to look to see if there's any example in your portfolio that is similar

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,510
to what they're doing either in some technical regard design or regard or just in general.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,140
Okay so the first thing that they look at is is there a consistent quality across your portfolio.

25
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,030
Now why is that worth pointing out.

26
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,680
If I look at five Web sites or apps you made I'm going to expect that each one is going to be consistent

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,760
and how good they are how functional how pretty they are.

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,170
Now if I were to look at five.

29
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,460
One is fantastic.

30
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,260
One is terrible and three are OK.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,690
What does that signal to me.

32
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,750
It signals to me that I don't actually know what I'm going to get right because one out of five chances

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,690
say that you're going to come back something terrible.

34
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,790
And 60 percent of the time when you come back with something that's OK.

35
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,430
So typically clients whether or not they recognize us they're more interested in whether or not they

36
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,140
can see that you constantly produce the same quality.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,680
Now it's better to have slightly lower quality that's consistent then to have quality that's all over

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,280
the board.

39
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,750
When you have quality that's all over the board in your portfolio they just don't know what to think.

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,980
Now the second thing is do they recognize any of the apps.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,330
If they do that's a huge plus for you for some reason there's just some psychological effect going on

42
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,090
that when they know you've built something that they use they feel like all of a sudden you are much

43
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,120
more substantial you are much much more capable than you really are.

44
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,800
Not to say that you're not capable It's just that for some reason if I know that you've built something

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,110
that affects my life already or affects lots of other people I'm obviously going to put you on a much

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,170
higher pedestal.

47
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,700
Now the last thing was they're going to look for things that specifically apply to their project.

48
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,140
That's obviously a smart thing for them to do right.

49
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,650
Because if you can build something similar to what they want you to build chances are you can build

50
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,250
whatever it is they're asking for much more effectively.

51
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,690
That is something honestly when you even look for subcontractors look for people that have done work

52
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,640
before that's similar to what you work on or what you're hiring them for.

53
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,960
Now if you took the strategy of picking a specific need to go after then you're probably in luck in

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,830
this category because you're probably going to see something that's similar to what they want you to

55
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,510
build.

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,770
Now if you did a more general strategy you're probably at a disadvantage but in general if you pick

57
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,170
a wide spread of different things you might get lucky and they might find something.

58
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,840
It also is the case that a lot of times will specifically ask for something.

59
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,520
Or if you're in actual contact with them you can show them something that's similar.

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,720
Now just be aware at the very beginning of this whole process you're going to be at a huge disadvantage.

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,240
But I've built out this entire section to help you go from zero to something.

62
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,000
And I'm going to share pretty much all the hacks.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,100
I know that you can use to get to a point where you know you're not at a huge disadvantage anymore.

64
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,750
Now one big takeaway I want you to get from this lecture is that a lot of people don't realize this

65
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:38,050
but almost all big companies out there almost all prospective clients are only going to show five to

66
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,100
ten portfolio items and on the client side they're only going to look at maybe five to 10 portfolio

67
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,520
items.

68
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,070
Now what does that mean.

69
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,400
That means that you the upstart maybe with no portfolio at all.

70
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,060
You actually only need to get to that range after which that point there's not a huge advantage to being

71
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,330
a large established company at least in terms of a lot of companies out there have hundreds of the portfolio

72
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,450
items they're not going to show all of it it's unrealistic to show it and even if they do clients don't

73
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,590
look at that many.

74
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,290
The biggest vintage they have is that they can pick five to 10 that have consistent quality and probably

75
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,000
have some type of name recognition.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,780
Or they pick probably their best projects.

77
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,920
So keep that in mind.

78
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,180
You do not need a 100 portfolio items to establish the same amount of trust that you can get with five

79
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,970
to 10.

80
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:34,730
So that's a big advantage for you and just keep in mind you just need to get to the five to 10 range.

81
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,420
OK.

82
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,130
Any questions posed in the group discussion in the next lecture.

83
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,560
Going to keep this going.

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,390
We're going to talk a little bit more about easy ways to fill your portfolio how to tackle the arts

85
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:53,940
in the next lecture.
