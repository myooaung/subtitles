00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,830
You guys will come back to the course so in this lecture I'm going to talk about a distinction you should

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,920
make with your clients which is rich versus successful.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,510
This is a big problem that I had when I first started this development business.

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,730
I often would go after clients that had big budgets and I thought that should be the number one thing

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,080
I should be looking for more money I thought better projects.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,120
I thought it also meant that I'd have more future growth options and that hopefully they could refer

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,660
me to other people who are just as rich now that I've had quite a bit of experience running and growing

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,110
a development business or realize a very important distinction that should be made.

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,530
Some clients are rich and some clients are successful and kind of what I learned was that you would

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,410
position yourself to align with this client that is successful and has a track record of being successful.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,570
Whereas if you just focus on rich clients you actually are doing yourself a disservice.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,710
A rich client simply has lots of funds.

13
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,710
You don't know where they got the funds.

14
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,890
They could have inherited it.

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,850
You don't know what they did in the past to produce those funds.

16
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,230
Just the existence of funds does not mean that this person can create more funds in the future.

17
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,710
It's very possible that they had a very high up position in the past and whatever that was is completely

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,840
irrelevant to what they're doing now.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
Now a successful client is completely different.

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,460
This is someone who has a track record of successful projects.

21
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,170
They're not just someone who has a gigantic budget.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,960
They have a portfolio of their own so to speak and you can tell that they consistently pick ideas that

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,200
have actual potential to them and they've shown that in the past they were able to take things and do

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,480
something with it.

25
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,100
Now a rich client might be really hands off and they might be a really enjoyable client to work with.

26
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,470
But just in general these are not the types of clients that are going to grow your business.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,490
Rich clients might create large projects but those large projects do not have a very long life expectancy.

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,740
It's much better to work on a medium project that goes on for multiple years than a large project that

29
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,810
fails right out of the gate a successful client is going to launch something that brings you consistent

30
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,050
business consistently for a very long period of time.

31
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,540
They're going to refer you to similar people.

32
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,850
These are the types of people that in the future they'll ranch separate ventures as well and they're

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,630
probably going to be a similar level of successful.

34
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,010
If you look at this from a portfolio perspective it's really important to take into consideration how

35
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,580
successful a client's been in the past because the best portfolio items are companies that are out there

36
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,930
that are actually doing well getting customers and getting seen that dramatically increases the value

37
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,040
of your portfolio.

38
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,360
Someone looks at your portfolio and they see something they actually recognize.

39
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,620
That's a huge huge plus.

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,530
How many development studios out there have a portfolio or have an application they've built that you

41
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,610
actually recognize.

42
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,420
It's probably a very very small percentage.

43
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,070
So guys take this into consideration.

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,160
You should be vetting your clients just as much as they're vetting you.

45
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,020
Is your client someone who has a very large budget but you have no idea where it came from no idea whether

46
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,460
or not they're going to be successful and you have no idea if six months from now the project's going

47
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,870
to stick around.

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,480
Focus on clients that have a track record of success.

49
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,660
Try anything you can to hitch your wagon to them because they're going to bring you a lot more money

50
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
in the long term.

51
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,510
And a lot better referrals they going to bring you the momentum that allow you to grow your business.

52
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:39,900
All right guys.

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,990
