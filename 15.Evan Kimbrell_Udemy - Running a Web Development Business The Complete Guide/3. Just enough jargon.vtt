00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.950
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.470
So in this lecture we're going to talk about how do you control how much jargon you use in your everyday

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.430
communications with clients and what's the optimal level of confusing language.

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.700
Now if you don't know what I mean by jargon jargon just means technical words.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.500
And if you're in development you're using technical words all the time and clients probably won't understand

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.390
90 percent of it.

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.630
Now the standard advice from people who run development businesses is that you minimize your jargon

9
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.790
as much as possible.

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.090
Right.

11
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.030
Because you're more interested in communicating effectively to your client.

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.090
Personally I think that that's incredibly simplistic view of it.

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.580
There's a lot more that goes into this and I think a more nuanced approach is necessary.

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.150
So let's be obvious.

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
You don't want to have too much jargon if you have too much jargon.

16
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.950
It just confuses your client.

17
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.040
It limits how well you can actually communicate something to them and most importantly it makes you

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.980
look like a poor communicator because surely someone who works with clients on a day to day basis knows

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.610
that they shouldn't have to speak in really jargon sized language the way you speak to a developer or

20
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.480
even the way you speak to a designer.

21
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.360
It should be entirely different than the way you speak to a client only in situations where your client

22
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240
is as technical as they are.

23
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.170
Then you have the option to speak to them with lots of jargon.

24
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.610
But even in those cases I always find that it's not actually the most effective way now two little jargon

25
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.700
which is what a lot of people out there just don't realize also has negative effects too little jargon

26
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.100
makes it sound like you're not an expert at what you're talking about.

27
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.400
It also makes it sound like the project is really simple and kind of the immediate reaction early subconsciously

28
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.880
from your client is this is really simple why am I paying so much.

29
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.420
I think there's also a likelihood that if you speak to simply they also feel as if your position or

30
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.410
your role in this communication chain is unnecessary.

31
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:18.270
So there's obviously a happy middle in between using tons and tons of code language is really specific

32
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.110
details that are completely unnecessary and the other end where you basically turn everything into overly

33
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.740
simplified language that doesn't use anything remotely technical and just sounds incredibly vague.

34
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.870
Now what I've found to be effective and what I propose you do is that you use a kind of medium amount

35
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.530
of jargon use words and kind of code names of things that are more common.

36
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.420
While leaving out things that are less common when describing an action typically focus on using a simpler

37
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.960
verb when you describe what's happening because they only understand the actual action.

38
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.960
But then when explaining objects or technologies or platforms use the specific language.

39
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.210
Now the reason why I'd suggest inserting some a medium amount of jargon is because it sets the tone

40
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.060
and it makes you sound like you are a domain expert.

41
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.520
It makes it sound as if you know something that they don't know and it reassures them.

42
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.400
This is complicated and this is why I hired you.

43
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.680
OK.

44
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.120
Let's set up a scenario so you can get kind of the gist of what I'm talking about.

45
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.540
Let's say you built a site or an app and you built it deployed it.

46
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.190
And users are going to that page and every time they try to save information they're getting a big error

47
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.910
screen.

48
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.330
So something is clearly wrong and your client comes running to you to say that the sky is falling and

49
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.440
something something's wrong.

50
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.250
So how do you explain it to them.

51
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.960
Here's an example of an explanation that's too simplified the site's ability to save isn't working and

52
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.850
the information isn't going anywhere.

53
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.410
That's creating some issues on your site.

54
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.060
OK.

55
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.670
Now if you read that in text it doesn't actually really say anything.

56
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.470
I mean and most clients whether or not they're aware of it they know what's happening if you're trying

57
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.440
to save something in an error message comes up surely they know that it's the biggest point those who

58
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.490
set it like that you kind of sound like an idiot.

59
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.840
You generally want to avoid sounding like you're babying the client the babying that you do to your

60
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.710
client should be subtle and it should be on things that they don't even notice.

61
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.290
You'd actually be surprised clients liked to feel like they understand the jargon you use they'd like

62
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.380
to feel like they're in a technical conversation.

63
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.900
It makes them feel like they're kind of on the ground level.

64
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.720
So I always propose using a little bit more.

65
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.990
So this is an example again of a way to simplify.

66
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.370
So here's an example of an overly complex and overly jargon fied answer.

67
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.250
Your app instance is experiencing server lock and it can't authenticate with its connection.

68
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.160
Your users are getting thrown a javascript exception that might indicate that the build is incorrectly

69
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.610
set up on a actually.

70
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.030
OK.

71
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.020
Now let that sink in.

72
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.650
What did I just say.

73
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.170
I honestly I barely know what that means.

74
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.120
When you give an answer towards something's not working they kind of want to understand it in much simpler

75
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:21.020
terms and that the actual true to the definition to the T answer is very rarely helpful.

76
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.650
Make sure that you're not introducing concepts they've never heard of.

77
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.920
And more importantly never realistically could have heard now explain the name of a database.

78
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.180
That's common.

79
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.090
They can understand that that's helpful but explaining server lock and then going and saying that it

80
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.590
needs to authenticate its connection that's not necessary.

81
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.910
You don't need to say the phenomenon that's happening and you don't even need to say that it's a problem

82
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.220
with the authentication and not just the connection.

83
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.150
That's almost too much detail and it's completely missed when you explain it to them.

84
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.750
Use your users getting thrown a javascript exception.

85
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.270
Exceptions are a programming term.

86
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.740
You could just say is it error.

87
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.410
It doesn't.

88
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.420
I mean it's not technically correct but that's something they can understand and that's basically the

89
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.750
same thing again.

90
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.070
And the last thing you don't really need to call it a build.

91
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.170
That's not something that someone immediately knows you can just refer to the site.

92
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.110
You also don't need to see that it's incorrectly set up somewhere just say that it's it's not working

93
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.960
on this or it's not working on your server you don't need to explain the technology that runs it on

94
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.560
the server.

95
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:32.030
Ok so here is the ideal kind of response with concerns to how confusing and how jargon to fight it is

96
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.300
your siecle database is experiencing a common issue where if too much traffic hits it at the same time

97
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.110
it'll actually close its connections in the database.

98
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.940
This is common to the specific platform that we built your Web site on the error that you're seeing.

99
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.980
It's just the system's way of letting us know that none of that information is actually getting saved.

100
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.900
See that's right in the middle.

101
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.880
There's a couple of things you might have glossed over because you didn't know what it was but for the

102
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.730
most part I gave you a decent amount of detail but not so much detail that you actually get confused

103
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.830
and at the same time I didn't just kind of baby speak it or dumb it down so much that what I said doesn't

104
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.900
actually have any meaning.

105
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.950
OK so try to find a happy medium with jargon.

106
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:19.160
Personally I like using a little bit of jargon because it makes me sound like a domain expert and it

107
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.100
kind of sets the tone for the relationship.

108
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.890
It kind of divides between the person who is purchasing the software and the person who actually knows

109
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.290
how it works and what it takes to deliver it.

110
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.640
In my experience when you do that you'll notice that you get a little bit more respect.

111
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.780
They're more likely to trust you the more likely to believe you when you say an issue is hard.

112
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.570
But if you dumb it down too much or you make it too complicated they might just not understand what

113
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.460
the issue is.

114
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.420
Think it's too simple or just think that you're a very poor communicator.

115
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.560
OK guys so try to keep it level when you go with jargon don't go crazy with it.

116
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.140
And honestly at the very beginning you might not even know the jargon so try to learn a little bit so

117
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.130
that you can kind of pepper in your speech.

118
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:10.880
All right guys see in the next hour.
