1

00:00:04,680  -->  00:00:09,840
So in this video we're going to download
and install Python for the Windows platform.

2

00:00:09,840  -->  00:00:13,260
Now if you're running on a Mac
or a Linux machine, skip this video and

3

00:00:13,260  -->  00:00:17,900
refer to the appropriate video for your
operating system, which is in this section of the course.

4

00:00:17,900  -->  00:00:19,800
If you're on a
Windows platform we're gonna start by

5

00:00:19,800  -->  00:00:24,880
going to python.org,  which is the official Python website.

6

00:00:24,880  -->  00:00:28,320
Now I'm not going to select
to download there at the moment, cos if we

7

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:34,380
come over here and select it'll start
downloading, but if we come down to windows instead,

8

00:00:34,380  -->  00:00:38,140
note that we've got a version there, for both X64, which is

9

00:00:38,149  -->  00:00:43,679
x86 64, which is a 64-bit version of
Windows, and a 32-bit. So you will need

10

00:00:43,679  -->  00:00:47,609
to download the appropriate version for
your operating system. If you're not sure

11

00:00:47,609  -->  00:00:51,359
whether you're running a 32 or a 64-bit
version of Windows, we can come down here,

12

00:00:51,359  -->  00:00:56,699
and just type in under here, 32. That'll pop
up this little thing here and see if you

13

00:00:56,700  -->  00:01:01,500
have a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of Windows.
Check on that, and if that didn't work,

14

00:01:01,500  -->  00:01:06,320
you can just go into About in system
settings, and that would also get you there.

15

00:01:06,320  -->  00:01:10,160
And note down here under system
type we've got, in my case, 64-bit operating

16

00:01:10,170  -->  00:01:14,670
system, so that tells me that I'm running
a 64-bit version of Windows, and thus I

17

00:01:14,670  -->  00:01:18,000
need to download the 64-bit version of
Python.

18

00:01:18,000  -->  00:01:22,290
Now if yours doesn't say 64-bit but
instead says 32-bit, then obviously you'll

19

00:01:22,290  -->  00:01:26,440
need to download the 32-bit version.
Alright so I'm gonna close that down,

20

00:01:26,440  -->  00:01:30,300
and go back to the Python browser, and in my case,
what I'm going to do is select

21

00:01:30,300  -->  00:01:35,560
the executable installer for a 64 x86 64 which means 64-bit.

22

00:01:35,560  -->  00:01:40,680
If you're on a 32-bit machine, you would select that version down here, just the x86.

23

00:01:40,680  -->  00:01:46,980
Alright so I'm gonna click on executable. I'm gonna select run. Now that that's popped up I'm going to

24

00:01:46,980  -->  00:01:50,910
close down the browser, and you can see
confirmation there that I've selected the

25

00:01:50,910  -->  00:01:55,050
64-bit version of Windows. Importantly
before we start, make sure you check this

26

00:01:55,050  -->  00:01:59,670
box down here, Add Python 3.7 to path, and
that's so that you can access Python

27

00:01:59,670  -->  00:02:03,680
from the command line, which will become more important in future videos.

28

00:02:03,680  -->  00:02:05,780
For now though, now that we've
done that, we can come up here and click

29

00:02:05,790  -->  00:02:11,250
on Install now, click on that. We're going
to click on and select yes to that, and

30

00:02:11,250  -->  00:02:15,740
we'll let it go through and finish the
installation of Python now.

31

00:02:17,640  -->  00:02:21,090
Alright so at this point now, we don't
need to do anything else. We click on

32

00:02:21,090  -->  00:02:25,580
Close, and we've now installed Python for
the Windows platform.

33

00:02:25,580  -->  00:02:29,370
So at this point you can now skip
forward to the install IntelliJ IDEA

34

00:02:29,370  -->  00:02:33,150
installation video,
and bypass the Mac and Linux versions

35

00:02:33,150  -->  00:02:37,380
of the Python installation, cos we've now
installed Python for the Windows platform.

36

00:02:37,380  -->  00:02:43,340
I'll see you in that
installation video, IntelliJ IDEA, next.
