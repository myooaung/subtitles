00:00:05.380  -->  00:00:10.150
so in this video we are going to talk through potential
issues you may have with the next
2

2

00:00:10.150  -->  00:00:13.320
section of the course when we need to
make sure that Python or some
3

3

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:17.280
of the tools of Python are working
on the command line so what you need to
4

4

00:00:17.280  -->  00:00:21.190
do first on your Windows machine is you
need to open your command your command
5

5

00:00:21.190  -->  00:00:26.600
prompt and you normally click on the Windows
prompt the Windows button in the
6

6

00:00:26.600  -->  00:00:32.190
bottom left hand corner of your screen and
click on the run option so you select
7

7

00:00:32.190  -->  00:00:36.170
Run and a little window where you can
type in
8

8

00:00:36.170  -->  00:00:41.790
cmd for command prompt an open that and
you should get a little black screen pop up
9

9

00:00:41.790  -->  00:00:45.990
and if you can't find that just do a
search for command prompt so basically
10

10

00:00:45.990  -->  00:00:51.270
when I opened it up and I'm gonna do is
show you a screen where the command
11

11

00:00:51.270  -->  00:00:55.200
isn't working so if you get a screen like this
on the screen and you can see it got my
12

12

00:00:55.200  -->  00:01:01.150
windows open at the moment and notice how I have
typed in the commands pip I
13

13

00:01:01.150  -->  00:01:04.020
pressed enter and I got pip is not
recognized as an internal or external
14

14

00:01:04.020  -->  00:01:09.220
command so try doing that and if you get the
error get the error that says that it's
15

15

00:01:09.220  -->  00:01:13.760
not working then you need to follow the
instructions here to modify your Python
16

16

00:01:13.760  -->  00:01:18.630
installation now this is a assuming that
you've actually gone ahead and installed
17

17

00:01:18.630  -->  00:01:23.070
Python and obviously if got to this stage of
course presumably have done that if by
18

18

00:01:23.070  -->  00:01:28.980
chance you haven't installed the full Python
installation before you haven't got
19

19

00:01:28.980  -->  00:01:32.960
it running in IntelliJ then watch
towards the end of this video and I'll
20

20

00:01:32.960  -->  00:01:34.960
take you through the new installation
21

21

00:01:34.960  -->  00:01:38.570
but I am going to assume that you've basically gone
through the installation but you are still
22

22

00:01:38.570  -->  00:01:41.850
getting an error and will need to get
this pip command working so we're going
23

23

00:01:41.850  -->  00:01:43.300
to show you what to do
24

24

00:01:43.300  -->  00:01:46.980
the first thing you need to do is you
need to open up your Python
25

25

00:01:46.980  -->  00:01:51.240
installation again so double click the
file that you downloaded for Python and
26

26

00:01:51.240  -->  00:01:54.990
once you do that you should come up with this
modified set up and one you can also do
27

27

00:01:54.990  -->  00:01:58.990
which I won't show on the screen but you
can go into the Windows setup and you
28

28

00:01:58.990  -->  00:02:04.390
can come into the uninstall program
options select Python and you should have
29

29

00:02:04.390  -->  00:02:08.840
an option to modify so if you do get that
you get the screen to come up like this you
30

30

00:02:08.840  -->  00:02:12.000
wanna click on modify so you don't want to
click on uninstall
31

31

00:02:12.000  -->  00:02:16.130
click on modify and once you do that you
get this next screen you should get a screen
32

32

00:02:16.130  -->  00:02:18.760
that looks like that so what you want to do
is make sure that
33

33

00:02:18.760  -->  00:02:24.120
all those options are ticked
documentation pip tcl / TK and IDLE and
34

34

00:02:24.120  -->  00:02:27.750
Python tests suite so basically have everything ticked on the screen and if it has
35

35

00:02:27.750  -->  00:02:31.570
other options there now that you don't
see on the screen shots that is different on
36

36

00:02:31.570  -->  00:02:32.760
your machine
37

37

00:02:32.760  -->  00:02:37.110
have those ticked as well and click on Next what
should do is get a screen that looks very
38

38

00:02:37.110  -->  00:02:42.210
similar to this and make sure that the
options I've shown are selected at
39

39

00:02:42.210  -->  00:02:46.900
the very least associate files with Python
create shortcuts and add Python into
40

40

00:02:46.900  -->  00:02:51.370
environment variables so those are the important
ones particularly that third one add Python to
41

41

00:02:51.370  -->  00:02:54.950
environment variables because that's
actually how we get it to work
42

42

00:02:54.950  -->  00:02:58.710
so that when you type pip it will find the path to Python on
43

43

00:02:58.710  -->  00:03:02.740
your machine so without doing that you
are not going to be able to get it to work so make sure
44

44

00:03:02.740  -->  00:03:06.990
you select at the very least that option add Python to environment variables and if it
45

45

00:03:06.990  -->  00:03:10.870
happens to be worded slightly different
if it uses the Path or something like
46

46

00:03:10.870  -->  00:03:11.330
that
47

47

00:03:11.330  -->  00:03:16.680
select that option and once you've done that
click on install button as you see on the screen
48

48

00:03:16.680  -->  00:03:20.370
their and what you'll do you find that
it'll be fairly quick and it'll come up
49

49

00:03:20.370  -->  00:03:25.070
and say modification was successful modify was
successful at that point you finish the
50

50

00:03:25.070  -->  00:03:29.370
modification of your existing Python
installation and now we can go back
51

51

00:03:29.370  -->  00:03:33.210
and tests if our pip commands works again
so going back and show you and do
52

52

00:03:33.210  -->  00:03:37.010
that so now when you type pip you should
get something like this on-screen if you
53

53

00:03:37.010  -->  00:03:39.900
type pip instead of getting that to unknown
command that we got at the start of
54

54

00:03:39.900  -->  00:03:43.820
the video you should get something like
that shows that it's working and
55

55

00:03:43.820  -->  00:03:47.960
if you've got this and pip and you've
got that coming up on your screen your
56

56

00:03:47.960  -->  00:03:52.540
good to go and you can finish the video
now and move on to the next video now if
57

57

00:03:52.540  -->  00:03:56.150
you are at the stage where you are
installing this for the first time then
58

58

00:03:56.150  -->  00:03:59.370
continue watching but again if you've
got it working you've already had it
59

59

00:03:59.370  -->  00:04:02.260
installed and you follow these options
and it's working
60

60

00:04:02.260  -->  00:04:04.980
you don't need to watch the rest of the
video but for everyone else I'm gonna
61

61

00:04:04.980  -->  00:04:09.760
show you how to go about it on a new
installation on Windows of Python so
62

62

00:04:09.760  -->  00:04:12.990
once you've downloaded it for the first
time you get a screen similar to this
63

63

00:04:12.990  -->  00:04:19.120
and important thing I'm going to get you
to do is in the next screen slide is to
64

64

00:04:19.120  -->  00:04:24.370
click on the Add Python 3.5 on the path down
the bottom of the screen and that's very
65

65

00:04:24.370  -->  00:04:27.700
important to actually to add and that's
going to be how this will actually work
66

66

00:04:27.700  -->  00:04:31.260
for you without having to go through the
modification so click on that you
67

67

00:04:31.260  -->  00:04:32.170
should have a screen some
68

68

00:04:32.170  -->  00:04:35.340
like that once its clicked on that and
then moving on the next thing to do is
69

69

00:04:35.340  -->  00:04:39.480
to click on Customize installation so
selecting that option as you can see
70

70

00:04:39.480  -->  00:04:43.460
on the screen once you do that once you click
on customize installation you will get the
71

71

00:04:43.460  -->  00:04:46.850
screen that I'm just about to show you
now and it will come up with all these
72

72

00:04:46.850  -->  00:04:50.020
options so basically you want to select
everything on the screen that you can
73

73

00:04:50.020  -->  00:04:54.110
and if your screen looks slightly different to this
maybe you got a different version of python
74

74

00:04:54.110  -->  00:04:58.240
at some point in the future from when I
recorded this video just select
75

75

00:04:58.240  -->  00:05:01.540
everything on screen it doesn't really
matter but you wanna make sure at the very
76

76

00:05:01.540  -->  00:05:06.030
least that pup installed pip is the one
that we're gonna be using but it won't
77

77

00:05:06.030  -->  00:05:09.200
hurt to have everything else installed and it's
probably the best thing to do so click
78

78

00:05:09.200  -->  00:05:13.430
on all those options and click on Next
down the bottom of the screen once you
79

79

00:05:13.430  -->  00:05:16.620
do that you get a screen that looks very
similar to this now you can go ahead and
80

80

00:05:16.620  -->  00:05:19.560
click on install for all users if you
want and you can click on some of the
81

81

00:05:19.560  -->  00:05:20.460
other options
82

82

00:05:20.460  -->  00:05:25.410
the one that you really must click is add Python to
environment variables that's the
83

83

00:05:25.410  -->  00:05:29.400
one that will actually enable this
command to work so that we can actually
84

84

00:05:29.400  -->  00:05:34.150
use that command line option and the install
for all users is also optional and
85

85

00:05:34.150  -->  00:05:39.160
it won't hurt to click on associated files with
Python and create shortcuts really don't
86

86

00:05:39.160  -->  00:05:42.790
need to worry about pre compile standard
standard library and download debugging symbols and
87

87

00:05:42.790  -->  00:05:46.100
download debug libraries they are only
optional it is not something you need to worry
88

88

00:05:46.100  -->  00:05:51.500
about and once you do that click on
install what you'll see is you get a screen
89

89

00:05:51.500  -->  00:05:55.240
similar to this loading on the screen
and that will go ahead and install
90

90

00:05:55.240  -->  00:05:58.080
Python so it will take a few minutes to
actually go through and finish the
91

91

00:05:58.080  -->  00:06:02.290
installation and when its finally done you
get a screen similar to that set up was
92

92

00:06:02.290  -->  00:06:05.880
successful and you be able to click on close and you'll be good to go
93

93

00:06:05.880  -->  00:06:10.230
and go ahead and configure Python in IntelliJ and one other thing you can
94

94

00:06:10.230  -->  00:06:14.040
do just to double check is you can open a
command prompt and I mention how to do
95

95

00:06:14.040  -->  00:06:17.180
at the start of the video click on that
in type in pip
96

96

00:06:17.180  -->  00:06:20.390
and you should get this sort of output
something along those lines should work
97

97

00:06:20.390  -->  00:06:24.740
and if it doesn't work it means probably
you didn't click on the path environment
98

98

00:06:24.740  -->  00:06:28.180
variables option and if necessary that
still not working
99

99

00:06:28.180  -->  00:06:32.720
reboot the computer and it
should the work so that's it that's the
100

100

00:06:32.720  -->  00:06:37.230
installation options for Windows so at
this point you can now move on to the
101

101

00:06:37.230  -->  00:06:37.670
next video
