00:00:04.690  -->  00:00:07.450
In this video we're going to go ahead
2

2

00:00:07.450  -->  00:00:09.910
and download and install IntelliJ IDEA,
3

3

00:00:09.910  -->  00:00:12.129
which is the editor or integrated
4

4

00:00:12.129  -->  00:00:14.530
development environment ide that we're
5

5

00:00:14.530  -->  00:00:16.029
going to be using in this course for our
6

6

00:00:16.029  -->  00:00:18.610
programs. Now there are other IDEs
7

7

00:00:18.610  -->  00:00:21.100
available for python programming and if
8

8

00:00:21.100  -->  00:00:22.630
you're happy with the ide that you're
9

9

00:00:22.630  -->  00:00:24.490
already using, that's fine there's no
10

10

00:00:24.490  -->  00:00:26.949
need to install another one. We had to
11

11

00:00:26.949  -->  00:00:28.510
pick one for this course but you can
12

12

00:00:28.510  -->  00:00:30.130
take this course with any ide
13

13

00:00:30.130  -->  00:00:33.370
that supports python. Now this particular
14

14

00:00:33.370  -->  00:00:35.890
video is for the Windows platform, if
15

15

00:00:35.890  -->  00:00:37.239
you're running a Mac or you're running
16

16

00:00:37.239  -->  00:00:39.070
on Linux there are separate videos for
17

17

00:00:39.070  -->  00:00:40.989
both those operating systems in this
18

18

00:00:40.989  -->  00:00:43.180
course, so refer to those videos as
19

19

00:00:43.180  -->  00:00:45.039
appropriate but if run Windows you're in
20

20

00:00:45.039  -->  00:00:45.700
the right place,
21

21

00:00:45.700  -->  00:00:48.520
let's get started. You know if you've
22

22

00:00:48.520  -->  00:00:49.899
installed lots of software on your
23

23

00:00:49.899  -->  00:00:51.820
computer, you may be tempted to run
24

24

00:00:51.820  -->  00:00:53.800
through the installation without waiting
25

25

00:00:53.800  -->  00:00:56.050
for me to do with this video, now that's
26

26

00:00:56.050  -->  00:00:58.239
fine but watch out for a dialog such as
27

27

00:00:58.239  -->  00:00:59.980
the one you can see on screen asking for
28

28

00:00:59.980  -->  00:01:02.469
permissions to allow access on private
29

29

00:01:02.469  -->  00:01:04.750
networks you will more than likely see
30

30

00:01:04.750  -->  00:01:06.100
that when you're installing or running
31

31

00:01:06.100  -->  00:01:08.289
the IntelliJ for the first time and it's
32

32

00:01:08.289  -->  00:01:10.330
very important that you do allow access
33

33

00:01:10.330  -->  00:01:13.090
so watch out for that dialog. Now the
34

34

00:01:13.090  -->  00:01:15.099
option you want to tick here is the
35

35

00:01:15.099  -->  00:01:17.800
Private Networks box depending on your
36

36

00:01:17.800  -->  00:01:19.360
version of Windows you may have the
37

37

00:01:19.360  -->  00:01:21.310
public networks box ticked by default
38

38

00:01:21.310  -->  00:01:23.860
which in itself is a bit strange because
39

39

00:01:23.860  -->  00:01:25.390
it doesn't say that that option isn't
40

40

00:01:25.390  -->  00:01:27.640
recommended so whenever you do see this
41

41

00:01:27.640  -->  00:01:29.830
dialog make sure you tick the box to
42

42

00:01:29.830  -->  00:01:31.990
allow access on private networks and
43

43

00:01:31.990  -->  00:01:35.289
then untick the other box so what that
44

44

00:01:35.289  -->  00:01:37.720
does is configure your windows firewall
45

45

00:01:37.720  -->  00:01:40.599
so that IntelliJ IDEA can access the
46

46

00:01:40.599  -->  00:01:42.759
network and if you don't tick the box
47

47

00:01:42.759  -->  00:01:43.869
you have to configure your firewall
48

48

00:01:43.869  -->  00:01:47.250
manually and that'll be a bit of a pain.
49

49

00:01:47.250  -->  00:01:50.020
Alright, so JetBrains the maker of
50

50

00:01:50.020  -->  00:01:51.069
IntelliJ IDEA
51

51

00:01:51.069  -->  00:01:53.770
make two IDEs that are suitable for
52

52

00:01:53.770  -->  00:01:57.099
Python programming IntelliJ IDEA as well
53

53

00:01:57.099  -->  00:01:59.200
as Pycharm let's have a look at their
54

54

00:01:59.200  -->  00:02:02.590
website at JetBrains.com and I'll talk
55

55

00:02:02.590  -->  00:02:06.509
about the differences between the two.
56

56

00:02:06.509  -->  00:02:09.009
Once we get there click on the tools tab
57

57

00:02:09.009  -->  00:02:14.080
out here at the top and over here you
58

58

00:02:14.080  -->  00:02:15.430
can see that time we've got IntelliJ
59

59

00:02:15.430  -->  00:02:18.810
IDEA we've also got PyCharm there as well.
60

60

00:02:18.810  -->  00:02:21.250
So for positive programming they look
61

61

00:02:21.250  -->  00:02:23.230
identical, I'm going to be using this one
62

62

00:02:23.230  -->  00:02:24.480
IntelliJ IDEA
63

63

00:02:24.480  -->  00:02:26.530
but if you're wanting to use Pycharm
64

64

00:02:26.530  -->  00:02:28.000
instead everything will look almost
65

65

00:02:28.000  -->  00:02:30.519
exactly the same in the videos in this
66

66

00:02:30.519  -->  00:02:32.680
course, you know PyCharm has the
67

67

00:02:32.680  -->  00:02:34.719
advantage that you don't have to install
68

68

00:02:34.719  -->  00:02:37.329
a python plugin it's basically a version
69

69

00:02:37.329  -->  00:02:40.319
of IntelliJ IDEA that only does Python
70

70

00:02:40.319  -->  00:02:43.599
but the advantage here of IntelliJ IDEA
71

71

00:02:43.599  -->  00:02:46.209
is that it can be used for a whole range
72

72

00:02:46.209  -->  00:02:48.639
of languages so if you're planning to
73

73

00:02:48.639  -->  00:02:50.739
program in another language or perhaps
74

74

00:02:50.739  -->  00:02:52.239
you've got an existing course from the
75

75

00:02:52.239  -->  00:02:54.549
Learn Programming Academy range such as
76

76

00:02:54.549  -->  00:02:57.519
the Java master class then IntelliJ IDEA
77

77

00:02:57.519  -->  00:02:59.439
will probably probably be more suitable,
78

78

00:02:59.439  -->  00:03:01.720
so for that reason we suggest you
79

79

00:03:01.720  -->  00:03:05.319
install IntelliJ IDEA, hover over which
80

80

00:03:05.319  -->  00:03:06.609
and which one that tell you're more
81

81

00:03:06.609  -->  00:03:08.349
interested in selecting and then click
82

82

00:03:08.349  -->  00:03:10.810
on the download link. Now the IDE
83

83

00:03:10.810  -->  00:03:12.489
themselves come in two flavors,
84

84

00:03:12.489  -->  00:03:15.280
there's the Ultimate Edition for
85

85

00:03:15.280  -->  00:03:17.109
IntelliJ IDEA or the professional
86

86

00:03:17.109  -->  00:03:19.840
Edition for PyCharm, they're both the
87

87

00:03:19.840  -->  00:03:22.209
paid versions you can use them for 30
88

88

00:03:22.209  -->  00:03:24.489
days but after that you have to purchase
89

89

00:03:24.489  -->  00:03:27.040
a license to continue using them but
90

90

00:03:27.040  -->  00:03:28.870
each version has also got a Community
91

91

00:03:28.870  -->  00:03:32.340
Edition that is free for personal use.
92

92

00:03:32.340  -->  00:03:34.629
Now there are some features missing in
93

93

00:03:34.629  -->  00:03:36.430
the community versions but they're not
94

94

00:03:36.430  -->  00:03:38.079
things you'd need to worry about all
95

95

00:03:38.079  -->  00:03:40.750
learning Python, so I'm going to do is
96

96

00:03:40.750  -->  00:03:42.849
just go back you know I go to IntelliJ
97

97

00:03:42.849  -->  00:03:50.949
IDEA click home download you can see
98

98

00:03:50.949  -->  00:03:52.780
that IntelliJ IDEA has got the Ultimate
99

99

00:03:52.780  -->  00:03:55.269
Edition and the Community Edition but
100

100

00:03:55.269  -->  00:03:56.769
you can see here there's also a feature
101

101

00:03:56.769  -->  00:03:59.049
matrix that shows you the differences
102

102

00:03:59.049  -->  00:04:01.599
between the functionality and the
103

103

00:04:01.599  -->  00:04:03.340
Ultimate Edition and the Community
104

104

00:04:03.340  -->  00:04:05.889
Edition but again it's not something you
105

105

00:04:05.889  -->  00:04:07.930
need to worry about at this stage when
106

106

00:04:07.930  -->  00:04:10.299
you're just learning to use Python in
107

107

00:04:10.299  -->  00:04:12.009
quiet you get away with using the
108

108

00:04:12.009  -->  00:04:13.449
Community Edition without any problems
109

109

00:04:13.449  -->  00:04:15.759
and of course that's completely free and
110

110

00:04:15.759  -->  00:04:17.019
if all of this doesn't mean much at the
111

111

00:04:17.019  -->  00:04:18.579
moment don't worry about it just install
112

112

00:04:18.579  -->  00:04:20.199
the Community Edition because you can
113

113

00:04:20.199  -->  00:04:22.180
always change your mind later. So I'm
114

114

00:04:22.180  -->  00:04:23.830
going to click on and download and
115

115

00:04:23.830  -->  00:04:26.950
choose the Community Edition, now while
116

116

00:04:26.950  -->  00:04:29.080
that's downloading you've got a moment
117

117

00:04:29.080  -->  00:04:30.940
to start you'll see it's downloading
118

118

00:04:30.940  -->  00:04:31.979
down the bottom there,
119

119

00:04:31.979  -->  00:04:37.120
I'm gonna click on run and let that take
120

120

00:04:37.120  -->  00:04:39.250
continued downloading so I'll mention
121

121

00:04:39.250  -->  00:04:41.530
again that you don't have to install this IDE,
122

122

00:04:41.530  -->  00:04:42.729
if you've already got one that you're
123

123

00:04:42.729  -->  00:04:44.889
happy with for Python programming feel
124

124

00:04:44.889  -->  00:04:46.900
free to use that, but again we had to
125

125

00:04:46.900  -->  00:04:48.160
pick one and because I've created
126

126

00:04:48.160  -->  00:04:49.990
courses for a number of languages of
127

127

00:04:49.990  -->  00:04:52.419
picked an IDE that supports the more in
128

128

00:04:52.419  -->  00:04:54.910
IntelliJ IDEA you know I'll be showing
129

129

00:04:54.910  -->  00:04:57.069
you ways that IntelliJ can help you to
130

130

00:04:57.069  -->  00:04:59.139
find bugs in your code and some other
131

131

00:04:59.139  -->  00:05:01.569
features that modern ideas have to make
132

132

00:05:01.569  -->  00:05:02.919
programming easier.
133

133

00:05:02.919  -->  00:05:05.050
Most modern IDEs will have similar
134

134

00:05:05.050  -->  00:05:06.400
features and don't want you to know that
135

135

00:05:06.400  -->  00:05:08.080
something is possible you can Google
136

136

00:05:08.080  -->  00:05:09.849
have to do the same thing in any other
137

137

00:05:09.849  -->  00:05:12.370
ID that you've chosen the other thing I
138

138

00:05:12.370  -->  00:05:14.410
can do is also extend the trial period
139

139

00:05:14.410  -->  00:05:16.030
for IntelliJ IDEA
140

140

00:05:16.030  -->  00:05:17.889
if you're considering purchasing the
141

141

00:05:17.889  -->  00:05:20.139
Ultimate Edition, in other words if you'd
142

142

00:05:20.139  -->  00:05:21.880
like more time to evaluate the Ultimate
143

143

00:05:21.880  -->  00:05:23.530
Edition, so if that's something you're
144

144

00:05:23.530  -->  00:05:25.389
interested in check that out in a later
145

145

00:05:25.389  -->  00:05:26.860
lecture and it shows you how to get a
146

146

00:05:26.860  -->  00:05:28.960
special key that you'll need to paste
147

147

00:05:28.960  -->  00:05:31.150
into the Ultimate Edition to get the
148

148

00:05:31.150  -->  00:05:33.460
extra ninety days trial so with the 30
149

149

00:05:33.460  -->  00:05:35.740
days trial that it comes with, you'll get
150

150

00:05:35.740  -->  00:05:38.020
an extra 90 days on top of that but
151

151

00:05:38.020  -->  00:05:39.789
that's only in the ultimate edition you
152

152

00:05:39.789  -->  00:05:41.080
need to download that separately if you
153

153

00:05:41.080  -->  00:05:44.050
need need to but again just confirm that
154

154

00:05:44.050  -->  00:05:46.090
the Community Edition will work just
155

155

00:05:46.090  -->  00:05:48.490
fine in this course. Alright so I'm just
156

156

00:05:48.490  -->  00:05:49.960
going to pause the video for a bit now
157

157

00:05:49.960  -->  00:05:51.370
until it's finished downloading and then
158

158

00:05:51.370  -->  00:05:53.169
we'll go through and continue the
159

159

00:05:53.169  -->  00:05:56.949
installation. Okay so as you can see
160

160

00:05:56.949  -->  00:05:59.110
we're just about at 100% on the download
161

161

00:05:59.110  -->  00:06:05.860
now, I got the option to click on yes to
162

162

00:06:05.860  -->  00:06:08.800
allow this setup to make changes to my
163

163

00:06:08.800  -->  00:06:11.289
computer and the installation process is
164

164

00:06:11.289  -->  00:06:14.530
going to start so I'm going to click on
165

165

00:06:14.530  -->  00:06:17.830
next here I'm going to choose the
166

166

00:06:17.830  -->  00:06:19.180
default we'll leave the default which is
167

167

00:06:19.180  -->  00:06:21.849
the directory where IntelliJ IDEA is
168

168

00:06:21.849  -->  00:06:23.199
going to be installed and I don't need
169

169

00:06:23.199  -->  00:06:24.610
to make a change to that the default is
170

170

00:06:24.610  -->  00:06:29.199
fine click on next. Now this bit here is
171

171

00:06:29.199  -->  00:06:31.599
quite important you need to know whether
172

172

00:06:31.599  -->  00:06:33.990
you're running a 32-bit or 64-bit
173

173

00:06:33.990  -->  00:06:36.759
version of Windows. Now to find out which
174

174

00:06:36.759  -->  00:06:38.080
version you're running on your computer
175

175

00:06:38.080  -->  00:06:39.969
you want to get into the control panel
176

176

00:06:39.969  -->  00:06:42.639
or settings on Windows 10 so Windows 10
177

177

00:06:42.639  -->  00:06:44.889
which I'm running I'm just going to come down here
178

178

00:06:44.889  -->  00:06:46.419
right-click on the little windows logo
179

179

00:06:46.419  -->  00:06:50.139
windows icon click on settings and then
180

180

00:06:50.139  -->  00:06:52.180
I'm going to go ahead and type in system
181

181

00:06:52.180  -->  00:06:54.219
the top there in that little search box
182

182

00:06:54.219  -->  00:06:56.710
and just type enough letters until I can
183

183

00:06:56.710  -->  00:07:00.729
click on about your PC. So you see down
184

184

00:07:00.729  -->  00:07:02.169
here it's telling me what my system type
185

185

00:07:02.169  -->  00:07:04.960
is I'm using a 64-bit version of Windows
186

186

00:07:04.960  -->  00:07:08.050
and importantly though don't get
187

187

00:07:08.050  -->  00:07:09.999
confused with this bit over here x64
188

188

00:07:09.999  -->  00:07:12.039
based process or ignore that the
189

189

00:07:12.039  -->  00:07:14.590
important bit here is a 64-bit operating
190

190

00:07:14.590  -->  00:07:16.330
system because it is possible
191

191

00:07:16.330  -->  00:07:19.360
confusingly to have a 64-bit processor
192

192

00:07:19.360  -->  00:07:21.759
but to be running a 32-bit version of
193

193

00:07:21.759  -->  00:07:23.680
the Windows operating system, so you need
194

194

00:07:23.680  -->  00:07:24.789
to know which version you're running
195

195

00:07:24.789  -->  00:07:26.229
here and in my case you can see it says
196

196

00:07:26.229  -->  00:07:30.460
64-bit operating system. So again the
197

197

00:07:30.460  -->  00:07:31.810
important thing in here is to the left
198

198

00:07:31.810  -->  00:07:33.819
so the other option that could
199

199

00:07:33.819  -->  00:07:35.409
potentially come up there would be
200

200

00:07:35.409  -->  00:07:38.020
32-bit version, so I'm going to close
201

201

00:07:38.020  -->  00:07:40.240
that window now. I'll go back to the
202

202

00:07:40.240  -->  00:07:42.400
installation so in my case I'm going to
203

203

00:07:42.400  -->  00:07:45.430
select 64-bit launcher and I'm also
204

204

00:07:45.430  -->  00:07:46.569
going to leave this option down here
205

205

00:07:46.569  -->  00:07:49.029
download and install JRE x86 by
206

206

00:07:49.029  -->  00:07:52.719
JetBrains unticked with a 32-bit version
207

207

00:07:52.719  -->  00:07:54.759
of Windows you'd want instead to click
208

208

00:07:54.759  -->  00:07:57.639
on only the 32-bit launcher checkbox and
209

209

00:07:57.639  -->  00:07:59.979
then you'd come down here and you check
210

210

00:07:59.979  -->  00:08:04.289
on the download install JRE x86 by JetBrains
211

211

00:08:04.289  -->  00:08:07.629
and if you have got a 32-bit version of
212

212

00:08:07.629  -->  00:08:09.909
Windows and you don't do those two steps
213

213

00:08:09.909  -->  00:08:11.860
you'll find that IntelliJ won't work for
214

214

00:08:11.860  -->  00:08:13.870
you so again in my case I'm running a
215

215

00:08:13.870  -->  00:08:16.000
64-bit version I've got that version
216

216

00:08:16.000  -->  00:08:18.370
ticked I'm going to leave the JRE box
217

217

00:08:18.370  -->  00:08:20.589
unticked and the other options here is
218

218

00:08:20.589  -->  00:08:23.110
these file associations I suggest you
219

219

00:08:23.110  -->  00:08:25.180
click these three Association checkboxes
220

220

00:08:25.180  -->  00:08:27.159
that just enables those particular
221

221

00:08:27.159  -->  00:08:29.339
languages that if you click on a file
222

222

00:08:29.339  -->  00:08:31.509
it'll automatically open that file in
223

223

00:08:31.509  -->  00:08:33.010
IntelliJ IDEA, so I'm going to do that
224

224

00:08:33.010  -->  00:08:36.010
select those three boxes it's usually
225

225

00:08:36.010  -->  00:08:37.209
what you want to do and then you want to
226

226

00:08:37.209  -->  00:08:39.490
click on next and then I'm going to
227

227

00:08:39.490  -->  00:08:42.070
click on install. Alright so I'm just
228

228

00:08:42.070  -->  00:08:43.449
going to fast forward this little bit
229

229

00:08:43.449  -->  00:08:44.709
I have been a time and we'll
230

230

00:08:44.709  -->  00:08:46.600
come back after it's finished start this
231

231

00:08:46.600  -->  00:08:52.110
installation step.
232

232

00:08:52.110  -->  00:08:53.760
Now I can see we're just about finished
233

233

00:08:53.760  -->  00:08:58.759
now with the installation step
234

234

00:08:58.759  -->  00:09:00.809
the last thing we've got left to do now
235

235

00:09:00.809  -->  00:09:04.109
is to click on this checkbox so that we
236

236

00:09:04.109  -->  00:09:06.959
can run IntelliJ IDEA and by the way if
237

237

00:09:06.959  -->  00:09:08.209
you happen to have been running
238

238

00:09:08.209  -->  00:09:10.829
installing well the PyCharm and have the
239

239

00:09:10.829  -->  00:09:12.239
same option you just click on that check
240

240

00:09:12.239  -->  00:09:14.429
check box to run PyCharm in my case
241

241

00:09:14.429  -->  00:09:16.529
we've downloaded install IntelliJ IDEA
242

242

00:09:16.529  -->  00:09:19.019
so check that and click on finish and
243

243

00:09:19.019  -->  00:09:20.999
that'll start IntelliJ IDEA for the
244

244

00:09:20.999  -->  00:09:27.389
first time. Now the first time you do set
245

245

00:09:27.389  -->  00:09:29.789
this up you'll usually see this option
246

246

00:09:29.789  -->  00:09:31.619
and it's coming up telling us that we've
247

247

00:09:31.619  -->  00:09:34.099
got an option to import some settings
248

248

00:09:34.099  -->  00:09:36.239
now that would be useful if you're
249

249

00:09:36.239  -->  00:09:37.949
running IntelliJ, you oven or you've
250

250

00:09:37.949  -->  00:09:40.049
installed a previous version and you
251

251

00:09:40.049  -->  00:09:41.579
want to retain the settings that you've
252

252

00:09:41.579  -->  00:09:44.339
configured. Now in this case so I'm going
253

253

00:09:44.339  -->  00:09:46.289
to choose do not import settings which
254

254

00:09:46.289  -->  00:09:48.029
is actually the default option for me
255

255

00:09:48.029  -->  00:09:50.759
here otherwise there's a location found
256

256

00:09:50.759  -->  00:09:53.039
by IntelliJ and you could select that
257

257

00:09:53.039  -->  00:09:54.749
and then get IntelliJ or import those
258

258

00:09:54.749  -->  00:09:56.249
settings and use them in your
259

259

00:09:56.249  -->  00:09:58.859
installation of IntelliJ but again you
260

260

00:09:58.859  -->  00:10:01.229
can see in this case that I've got the
261

261

00:10:01.229  -->  00:10:03.449
option to choose a custom location but
262

262

00:10:03.449  -->  00:10:04.649
that actually is the version that I'm
263

263

00:10:04.649  -->  00:10:06.119
downloading, so in my case I'm going to
264

264

00:10:06.119  -->  00:10:09.119
click on do not import settings and
265

265

00:10:09.119  -->  00:10:12.899
click ok. Now if you're actually in
266

266

00:10:12.899  -->  00:10:15.359
Europe because of the new privacy
267

267

00:10:15.359  -->  00:10:17.669
legislations in force from the 25th of
268

268

00:10:17.669  -->  00:10:20.789
May, there's a screen that may pop up for
269

269

00:10:20.789  -->  00:10:22.979
you and you need to accept the privacy
270

270

00:10:22.979  -->  00:10:25.199
policy if that does so if you do see a
271

271

00:10:25.199  -->  00:10:27.449
screen about privacy policy scroll down
272

272

00:10:27.449  -->  00:10:29.399
to the bottom you need to do that for
273

273

00:10:29.399  -->  00:10:30.959
the accept button to become enabled and
274

274

00:10:30.959  -->  00:10:34.079
then click on ok. So don't worry at this
275

275

00:10:34.079  -->  00:10:35.819
point if you haven't seen a privacy
276

276

00:10:35.819  -->  00:10:37.379
policy, you can see in my case I didn't
277

277

00:10:37.379  -->  00:10:39.239
see that that's because I'm not in the
278

278

00:10:39.239  -->  00:10:42.509
UK. Next we go to a configuration section
279

279

00:10:42.509  -->  00:10:44.609
to just set up some settings and to tell
280

280

00:10:44.609  -->  00:10:47.189
IntelliJ what options we want so this is
281

281

00:10:47.189  -->  00:10:50.849
the theme and you can see the one on the
282

282

00:10:50.849  -->  00:10:52.349
left for me has got a dark background
283

283

00:10:52.349  -->  00:10:55.169
and the one on the right has got a white
284

284

00:10:55.169  -->  00:10:57.299
background and that could be reversed
285

285

00:10:57.299  -->  00:10:58.799
depending on the version that you're
286

286

00:10:58.799  -->  00:11:01.289
installing the select which one you
287

287

00:11:01.289  -->  00:11:03.419
prefer to work with knowing that you can
288

288

00:11:03.419  -->  00:11:05.549
always change it later so what I'm going
289

289

00:11:05.549  -->  00:11:06.720
to do is come over here and select the
290

290

00:11:06.720  -->  00:11:09.269
one with the white background because I
291

291

00:11:09.269  -->  00:11:10.619
think that comes out better in videos
292

292

00:11:10.619  -->  00:11:12.450
but you can choose whichever one you
293

293

00:11:12.450  -->  00:11:14.370
like in that scenario we're gonna click
294

294

00:11:14.370  -->  00:11:17.550
on next you know got this screen that
295

295

00:11:17.550  -->  00:11:19.830
pops up there's a series of plugins on
296

296

00:11:19.830  -->  00:11:21.270
the screen and you can choose all sorts
297

297

00:11:21.270  -->  00:11:23.730
of things what I suggest you do is leave
298

298

00:11:23.730  -->  00:11:25.830
this as it is for now and come back
299

299

00:11:25.830  -->  00:11:27.390
later if you decide you want to install
300

300

00:11:27.390  -->  00:11:29.070
plugins because you can do that at any
301

301

00:11:29.070  -->  00:11:31.350
time and one thing to note is if you're
302

302

00:11:31.350  -->  00:11:33.630
running the ultimate edition of IntelliJ
303

303

00:11:33.630  -->  00:11:36.060
you'll have more options to install more
304

304

00:11:36.060  -->  00:11:38.370
plug-ins for that this point I'm going
305

305

00:11:38.370  -->  00:11:39.750
to leave that and click on next over
306

306

00:11:39.750  -->  00:11:41.970
here and we get to this option for
307

307

00:11:41.970  -->  00:11:44.760
featured plugins the same deal here if
308

308

00:11:44.760  -->  00:11:45.960
you want to change or install these
309

309

00:11:45.960  -->  00:11:47.850
things which we aren't going to use in
310

310

00:11:47.850  -->  00:11:49.140
this particular course you can do that
311

311

00:11:49.140  -->  00:11:51.450
now but I'm going I'm going to actually
312

312

00:11:51.450  -->  00:11:53.790
skip both of those and click on the
313

313

00:11:53.790  -->  00:11:58.890
start using IntelliJ IDEA, you can see
314

314

00:11:58.890  -->  00:12:02.010
that's no loading up alright so the
315

315

00:12:02.010  -->  00:12:03.480
first thing we're going to do you know
316

316

00:12:03.480  -->  00:12:05.100
that we've got IntelliJ installed and
317

317

00:12:05.100  -->  00:12:07.050
that we've been through that first set
318

318

00:12:07.050  -->  00:12:10.350
up is to install the Python plugin. Now
319

319

00:12:10.350  -->  00:12:11.850
this is a plug-in that's been developed
320

320

00:12:11.850  -->  00:12:14.610
by IntelliJ so that it supports Python
321

321

00:12:14.610  -->  00:12:17.490
within the IDE now if you decided to
322

322

00:12:17.490  -->  00:12:19.920
install PyCharm instead you can skip
323

323

00:12:19.920  -->  00:12:22.380
this step and that's because pochamp
324

324

00:12:22.380  -->  00:12:24.290
automatically includes the Python
325

325

00:12:24.290  -->  00:12:26.880
component so it doesn't need the python
326

326

00:12:26.880  -->  00:12:29.970
plug-in to be installed separately but
327

327

00:12:29.970  -->  00:12:31.410
do make sure in that scenario if you
328

328

00:12:31.410  -->  00:12:33.000
have installed pycharm that you do watch
329

329

00:12:33.000  -->  00:12:35.400
the next video where we configure python
330

330

00:12:35.400  -->  00:12:36.720
that and change some other useful
331

331

00:12:36.720  -->  00:12:38.160
settings because that will apply to you.
332

332

00:12:38.160  -->  00:12:40.170
Now the python plug-in though it keeps
333

333

00:12:40.170  -->  00:12:42.270
IntelliJ IDEA the same capabilities as
334

334

00:12:42.270  -->  00:12:45.270
pycharm for Python programming so I'm
335

335

00:12:45.270  -->  00:12:46.590
going to come down here and click on
336

336

00:12:46.590  -->  00:12:49.170
configure then I'm going to select
337

337

00:12:49.170  -->  00:12:53.250
plugins in the search box at the top of
338

338

00:12:53.250  -->  00:12:56.930
the screen, I'm going to type in Python
339

339

00:12:56.930  -->  00:12:58.800
then I'm if I come down here and click
340

340

00:12:58.800  -->  00:13:00.330
on install JetBrains
341

341

00:13:00.330  -->  00:13:03.810
plug-in you can see we've got some
342

342

00:13:03.810  -->  00:13:05.190
options here we want to choose this one
343

343

00:13:05.190  -->  00:13:08.370
down here python community edition we
344

344

00:13:08.370  -->  00:13:09.720
want to choose the one that's basically
345

345

00:13:09.720  -->  00:13:11.430
from JetBrains these other two other
346

346

00:13:11.430  -->  00:13:13.020
products from other vendors they want to
347

347

00:13:13.020  -->  00:13:14.820
choose the JetBrains one and you can see
348

348

00:13:14.820  -->  00:13:16.380
it's general you got the largest number
349

349

00:13:16.380  -->  00:13:18.690
of downloads as wel, I'm going to go
350

350

00:13:18.690  -->  00:13:22.170
ahead and click on install over here and
351

351

00:13:22.170  -->  00:13:24.590
you can see that's downloading the plugin
352

352

00:13:24.590  -->  00:13:27.710
and it'll want us to restart IntelliJ
353

353

00:13:27.710  -->  00:13:30.980
IDEA. Notice how the buttons changed now
354

354

00:13:30.980  -->  00:13:33.020
we've got an option to restart IntelliJ
355

355

00:13:33.020  -->  00:13:35.560
IDE, I'm going to click on that
356

356

00:13:35.560  -->  00:13:40.820
click on ok we've got the option to
357

357

00:13:40.820  -->  00:13:44.170
restart so I'm gonna click on restart
358

358

00:13:44.170  -->  00:13:46.460
you can see IntelliJ IDEA is now
359

359

00:13:46.460  -->  00:13:50.290
restarting and this point we've actually
360

360

00:13:50.290  -->  00:13:52.580
finished IntelliJ is restarted so I'll
361

361

00:13:52.580  -->  00:13:54.680
stop the video here in the next one
362

362

00:13:54.680  -->  00:13:56.029
though we're going to make sure that the
363

363

00:13:56.029  -->  00:13:57.550
Python plugin is configured correctly
364

364

00:13:57.550  -->  00:13:59.510
but also we're going to make some
365

365

00:13:59.510  -->  00:14:01.400
changes to some other settings to make
366

366

00:14:01.400  -->  00:14:03.589
Python a bit easier to use and once
367

367

00:14:03.589  -->  00:14:05.839
again that applies to both IntelliJ IDEA
368

368

00:14:05.839  -->  00:14:08.660
as well as Pycharm so the steps in the
369

369

00:14:08.660  -->  00:14:10.400
next video will be the same for IntelliJ
370

370

00:14:10.400  -->  00:14:11.750
IDE and pycharm,
371

371

00:14:11.750  -->  00:14:13.700
so be sure to watch it even if you
372

372

00:14:13.700  -->  00:14:16.040
installed Pycharm instead. See you in the
373

373

00:14:16.040  -->  00:14:18.460
next video.
