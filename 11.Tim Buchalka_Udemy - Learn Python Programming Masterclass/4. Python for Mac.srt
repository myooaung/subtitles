00:00:04,660  -->  00:00:09,600
In this video, we want to download and
install Python for the Mac platform.

2

00:00:09,600  -->  00:00:12,020
So to do that we're going to go to
python.org in a browser,

3

00:00:12,020  -->  00:00:15,740
so python dot o r g.

4

00:00:15,740  -->  00:00:19,140
Once we get there we're gonna click on downloads, and notice when I do

5

00:00:19,140  -->  00:00:21,840
that I've got the option over here to
download for Mac OSX. I just need to

6

00:00:21,840  -->  00:00:25,140
come over here and click on that. Choose
the latest version, which you can see on

7

00:00:25,140  -->  00:00:29,010
the screen, as of the time I'm recording,
3.7.3, so I'm

8

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:31,590
gonna click on that. That's now downloading and you probably

9

00:00:31,590  -->  00:00:35,430
saw it in the top right hand corner
there, that's already finished. So I'm

10

00:00:35,430  -->  00:00:43,620
going to go to finder and check that out,
and I'm going to double click the pkg file to start installing it.

11

00:00:43,620  -->  00:00:46,460
And what I'll do is I'll close down the browser now because we're finished with that,

12

00:00:46,460  -->  00:00:48,880
for now at least.

13

00:00:52,440  -->  00:00:57,180
Alright I'll just close down find as well.
Alright so I'm going to click on continue.

14

00:00:57,180  -->  00:01:05,180
Click on continue, click on continue, click
on agree and click on install.

15

00:01:05,180  -->  00:01:10,000
Enter my password,

16

00:01:10,000  -->  00:01:15,800
and that'll go through and configure and install Python.

17

00:01:17,480  -->  00:01:21,020
Alright so at this point we're actually
done. We can end the video here, so skip

18

00:01:21,020  -->  00:01:25,460
ahead now to the installation of
IntelliJ IDEA, where we actually

19

00:01:25,460  -->  00:01:30,020
start installing the IDE that we're going to be using to type our Python programs in this course.

20

00:01:30,020  -->  00:01:32,880
See you in that next video.
