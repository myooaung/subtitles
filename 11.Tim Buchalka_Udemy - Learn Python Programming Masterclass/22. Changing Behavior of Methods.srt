1

00:00:05,760  -->  00:00:07,760
ok so as well as adding extra behavior
2

2

00:00:07,760  -->  00:00:09,860
to our subclasses we can also change
3

3

00:00:09,860  -->  00:00:12,020
the behavior of methods that exists in
4

4

00:00:12,020  -->  00:00:14,630
the superclass so to see how to do that
5

5

00:00:14,630  -->  00:00:17,210
we need to create a new vampire enemy
6

6

00:00:17,210  -->  00:00:18,800
but i think that makes for a good
7

7

00:00:18,800  -->  00:00:22,250
challenge
8

8

00:00:22,250  -->  00:00:27,850
ok so the challenge for you is to create
9

9

00:00:27,850  -->  00:00:30,370
that new vampire class that's a subclass
10

10

00:00:30,370  -->  00:00:33,280
of enemy now vampires have three lives
11

11

00:00:33,280  -->  00:00:36,190
and take 12 hit points of damage you can
12

12

00:00:36,190  -->  00:00:37,790
create a new python file for the
13

13

00:00:37,790  -->  00:00:39,620
vampire if you like but I've actually
14

14

00:00:39,620  -->  00:00:41,950
suggest adding it to the existing enemy
15

15

00:00:41,950  -->  00:00:46,160
.py file
16

16

00:00:46,160  -->  00:00:48,710
you want to test your class by creating
17

17

00:00:48,710  -->  00:00:51,020
one or two vampire instances and
18

18

00:00:51,020  -->  00:00:53,840
displaying their details also inflict
19

19

00:00:53,840  -->  00:00:55,700
some damage to make sure that the
20

20

00:00:55,700  -->  00:00:58,220
take_damaged method is working ok
21

21

00:00:58,220  -->  00:01:01,010
and also make sure that the trolls can
22

22

00:01:01,010  -->  00:01:02,990
also take damage because we haven't
23

23

00:01:02,990  -->  00:01:04,580
tested that so far
24

24

00:01:04,580  -->  00:01:06,020
alright so that's a challenge see how
25

25

00:01:06,020  -->  00:01:08,170
you go with it pause the video and I'll
26

26

00:01:08,170  -->  00:01:09,620
see you when you get back
27

27

00:01:09,620  -->  00:01:15,740
ok so let's go through my solution so
28

28

00:01:15,740  -->  00:01:17,420
what I'm going to do is add the vampire
29

29

00:01:17,420  -->  00:01:19,760
class to the enemy.py
30

30

00:01:19,760  -->  00:01:24,620
so....
31

31

00:01:24,620  -->  00:01:30,200
...
32

32

00:01:30,200  -->  00:02:08,020
...
33

33

00:02:08,020  -->  00:02:09,770
now we're going to be coming back
34

34

00:02:09,770  -->  00:02:12,100
to add more features to our class that
35

35

00:02:12,100  -->  00:02:14,210
vampire class but for now that's all we
36

36

00:02:14,210  -->  00:02:15,590
need for the challenge
37

37

00:02:15,590  -->  00:02:17,630
let's test this I'm going to go
38

38

00:02:17,630  -->  00:02:20,300
back to the main .py file the
39

39

00:02:20,300  -->  00:02:21,850
first thing we need to do is import the
40

40

00:02:21,850  -->  00:02:24,740
vampire class into this file so I'm
41

41

00:02:24,740  -->  00:02:27,950
going to add a comma at the end...
42

42

00:02:27,950  -->  00:02:30,020
again the warning because it's
43

43

00:02:30,020  -->  00:02:31,490
unused at the moment unused import
44

44

00:02:31,490  -->  00:02:33,850
statement going to delete the monster
45

45

00:02:33,850  -->  00:02:35,510
references out but let's actually add a
46

46

00:02:35,510  -->  00:02:39,130
vampire....
47

47

00:02:39,130  -->  00:02:44,990
...
48

48

00:02:44,990  -->  00:02:51,620
...
49

49

00:02:51,620  -->  00:02:53,510
....so that's
50

50

00:02:53,510  -->  00:02:57,070
clearly working ok ok now because our
51

51

00:02:57,070  -->  00:02:58,940
trolls and vampires all inherit from
52

52

00:02:58,940  -->  00:03:01,100
enemy they have all the methods that the
53

53

00:03:01,100  -->  00:03:03,910
enemy class defines so we can inflict
54

54

00:03:03,910  -->  00:03:06,620
damage on both trolls and vampires by
55

55

00:03:06,620  -->  00:03:09,800
calling the take_damaged method so
56

56

00:03:09,800  -->  00:03:12,380
let's go add some damage to the
57

57

00:03:12,380  -->  00:03:17,060
second troll...
58

58

00:03:17,060  -->  00:03:23,060
...
59

59

00:03:23,060  -->  00:03:34,570
...
60

60

00:03:34,570  -->  00:03:38,320
...so let's just confirm this
61

61

00:03:38,320  -->  00:03:42,820
will run it scrolling up we can see I
62

62

00:03:42,820  -->  00:03:45,050
took 18 points of damage have five left
63

63

00:03:45,050  -->  00:03:48,250
the message that was for ugh and ugh
64

64

00:03:48,250  -->  00:03:51,470
has now no more live one-hit points5 and
65

65

00:03:51,470  -->  00:03:53,270
scrolling down that took 5 points
66

66

00:03:53,270  -->  00:03:55,720
damages got seven left and you can see
67

67

00:03:55,720  -->  00:03:59,780
the confirmation of that live 3.7 but we
68

68

00:03:59,780  -->  00:04:01,910
should really test the other path
69

69

00:04:01,910  -->  00:04:03,440
through the take damage
70

70

00:04:03,440  -->  00:04:05,630
let's give ugh a hefty thrak with the
71

71

00:04:05,630  -->  00:04:08,150
sword glandarin and inflict 30
72

72

00:04:08,150  -->  00:04:10,060
points of damage and go back and do that
73

73

00:04:10,060  -->  00:04:14,730
will separate this will do...
74

74

00:04:14,730  -->  00:04:18,120
...
75

75

00:04:18,120  -->  00:04:27,660
...
76

76

00:04:27,660  -->  00:04:28,980
...i'm going to
77

77

00:04:28,980  -->  00:04:31,650
switch this to floating mode so that it
78

78

00:04:31,650  -->  00:04:32,970
doesn't affect the subtitles at the
79

79

00:04:32,970  -->  00:04:34,920
bottom of the screen then click on that
80

80

00:04:34,920  -->  00:04:36,600
that's going to put the run window up a
81

81

00:04:36,600  -->  00:04:38,580
little bit higher still be down a little
82

82

00:04:38,580  -->  00:04:40,410
bit more as well but you can also
83

83

00:04:40,410  -->  00:04:44,430
hide it when running it actually
84

84

00:04:44,430  -->  00:04:48,060
going to close it for now and run again we
85

85

00:04:48,060  -->  00:04:52,590
can see that ugh is now live 0 hit points5 so
86

86

00:04:52,590  -->  00:04:54,000
I'm still got a problem with hit points
87

87

00:04:54,000  -->  00:04:55,680
but you can see that ugh has lost a life
88

88

00:04:55,680  -->  00:04:57,630
here and we haven't got the message that
89

89

00:04:57,630  -->  00:04:59,760
appears when he's got zero or more hit
90

90

00:04:59,760  -->  00:05:01,590
points left so clearly this is something
91

91

00:05:01,590  -->  00:05:03,870
we need to fix close that down for now
92

92

00:05:03,870  -->  00:05:06,900
and go back to enemy.py
93

93

00:05:06,900  -->  00:05:08,340
really when a monsters got no lives
94

94

00:05:08,340  -->  00:05:10,800
left there dead at the moment you saw
95

95

00:05:10,800  -->  00:05:12,390
that we can keep fighting ugh
96

96

00:05:12,390  -->  00:05:15,270
had written a attack method it fought back
97

97

00:05:15,270  -->  00:05:18,060
that's not good but what is good is that
98

98

00:05:18,060  -->  00:05:19,560
we don't have to make changes to all
99

99

00:05:19,560  -->  00:05:20,840
our monsters
100

100

00:05:20,840  -->  00:05:22,680
okay we only got 2 at the moment but you
101

101

00:05:22,680  -->  00:05:24,390
could create 8 or 90 monsters in
102

102

00:05:24,390  -->  00:05:25,020
the game
103

103

00:05:25,020  -->  00:05:27,450
adding code to each class to track when the
104

104

00:05:27,450  -->  00:05:29,490
monsters dead would be a lot of work
105

105

00:05:29,490  -->  00:05:31,470
with that many enemies we also have to
106

106

00:05:31,470  -->  00:05:33,240
test the code for each monster to make
107

107

00:05:33,240  -->  00:05:36,180
sure we hadn't introduced to bug but
108

108

00:05:36,180  -->  00:05:38,880
getting back to our enemy class because
109

109

00:05:38,880  -->  00:05:40,280
all our monsters all subclasses the
110

110

00:05:40,280  -->  00:05:41,970
enemy class we can just add the
111

111

00:05:41,970  -->  00:05:43,920
necessary code to the enemy superclass
112

112

00:05:43,920  -->  00:05:45,720
and will be then automatically available
113

113

00:05:45,720  -->  00:05:49,080
in all subclasses so let's go ahead and
114

114

00:05:49,080  -->  00:05:51,000
make a change to start tracking when
115

115

00:05:51,000  -->  00:05:52,470
they reach their hit points where there
116

116

00:05:52,470  -->  00:05:54,330
should be dead and to do that want to
117

117

00:05:54,330  -->  00:05:57,630
start on here on line 8 by adding
118

118

00:05:57,630  -->  00:05:58,890
another attribute is going to be...
119

119

00:05:58,890  -->  00:06:04,340
....and what we
120

120

00:06:04,340  -->  00:06:05,880
want to do is have a look at this code
121

121

00:06:05,880  -->  00:06:09,300
in the take damage method and it's under
122

122

00:06:09,300  -->  00:06:11,640
this else where the life's self.lives
123

123

00:06:11,640  -->  00:06:14,030
is minus equal to 1 we need a
124

124

00:06:14,030  -->  00:06:16,770
test their the test is going to be...
125

125

00:06:16,770  -->  00:06:21,840
....
126

126

00:06:21,840  -->  00:06:57,060
....
127

127

00:06:57,060  -->  00:06:59,730
ok confirming that we've got a new
128

128

00:06:59,730  -->  00:07:01,650
attribute called alive that's
129

129

00:07:01,650  -->  00:07:03,840
initialized to true init method on line 8
130

130

00:07:03,840  -->  00:07:06,780
we then change the take_
131

131

00:07:06,780  -->  00:07:08,850
damage method so after losing a
132

132

00:07:08,850  -->  00:07:10,800
life we check to see if the life's left
133

133

00:07:10,800  -->  00:07:13,290
is still greater than 0 if the monster
134

134

00:07:13,290  -->  00:07:14,730
still has lives left
135

135

00:07:14,730  -->  00:07:15,930
we print a message saying they lost a
136

136

00:07:15,930  -->  00:07:18,240
life you can see that here on line 18
137

137

00:07:18,240  -->  00:07:21,000
and otherwise we set self.alive to
138

138

00:07:21,000  -->  00:07:23,040
false line 21
139

139

00:07:23,040  -->  00:07:24,510
that's because they're no longer alive
140

140

00:07:24,510  -->  00:07:28,650
because they reached 0 lives left
141

141

00:07:28,650  -->  00:07:30,060
let's confirm that this works
142

142

00:07:30,060  -->  00:07:32,070
so we're going to come down here and add
143

143

00:07:32,070  -->  00:07:36,810
some code let's add some code via a
144

144

00:07:36,810  -->  00:07:39,540
while loop that tests while the vampire is
145

145

00:07:39,540  -->  00:07:42,780
alive so...
146

146

00:07:42,780  -->  00:07:44,340
...
147

147

00:07:44,340  -->  00:07:54,150
...
148

148

00:07:54,150  -->  00:07:56,100
...basically going to keep
149

149

00:07:56,100  -->  00:07:58,500
taking one point of damage until all his
150

150

00:07:58,500  -->  00:08:00,660
life is overt in which case at that
151

151

00:08:00,660  -->  00:08:02,850
point the alive attribute will change
152

152

00:08:02,850  -->  00:08:05,010
from true to false the whille will exit
153

153

00:08:05,010  -->  00:08:06,780
and then the program should exit as well
154

154

00:08:06,780  -->  00:08:09,540
let's just run this to see if it works
155

155

00:08:09,540  -->  00:08:12,990
you can see there that we've got
156

156

00:08:12,990  -->  00:08:15,930
vlad take some damage there we got down
157

157

00:08:15,930  -->  00:08:19,680
to zero points left lost a life
158

158

00:08:19,680  -->  00:08:21,180
notice also hear he's lost another life
159

159

00:08:21,180  -->  00:08:23,160
and another life because hit points
160

160

00:08:23,160  -->  00:08:26,280
didn't get reset that's something we'll
161

161

00:08:26,280  -->  00:08:28,050
need to look at to reset the hit points
162

162

00:08:28,050  -->  00:08:30,690
back to a value when he has lost a life
163

163

00:08:30,690  -->  00:08:33,090
but he's still alive but you can see the
164

164

00:08:33,090  -->  00:08:35,100
principle of continuing taking damage
165

165

00:08:35,100  -->  00:08:38,730
until he has died works the loop exit
166

166

00:08:38,730  -->  00:08:41,040
and once you got to 0 lives blood was
167

167

00:08:41,040  -->  00:08:41,790
dead
168

168

00:08:41,790  -->  00:08:44,970
and the program exited and also up here
169

169

00:08:44,970  -->  00:08:48,450
ugh was dead as well at that point and
170

170

00:08:48,450  -->  00:08:49,650
again you could argue that we should be
171

171

00:08:49,650  -->  00:08:51,090
putting the hit points back to their
172

172

00:08:51,090  -->  00:08:53,130
original values when the monster
173

173

00:08:53,130  -->  00:08:54,570
losses a life
174

174

00:08:54,570  -->  00:08:56,370
that's up to as the designer of the class
175

175

00:08:56,370  -->  00:08:58,380
and if makes more sense for the
176

176

00:08:58,380  -->  00:09:00,150
monsters to behave like that then of
177

177

00:09:00,150  -->  00:09:01,920
course you're the Creator you can do
178

178

00:09:01,920  -->  00:09:02,430
that
179

179

00:09:02,430  -->  00:09:03,810
alright so i'm going to stop the video
180

180

00:09:03,810  -->  00:09:07,950
here now we've seen how to give a
181

181

00:09:07,950  -->  00:09:10,500
subclass additional behavior when we
182

182

00:09:10,500  -->  00:09:12,060
added the grunt method to the troll
183

183

00:09:12,060  -->  00:09:13,800
class in the next video we're going to
184

184

00:09:13,800  -->  00:09:15,360
look at how to override methods of the
185

185

00:09:15,360  -->  00:09:17,550
superclass to change the way that a
186

186

00:09:17,550  -->  00:09:20,070
subclass behaves and what I'll do is I'll
187

187

00:09:20,070  -->  00:09:22,920
just run it one more time I'm just gonna
188

188

00:09:22,920  -->  00:09:25,980
take this out of floating mode putting
189

189

00:09:25,980  -->  00:09:27,450
that back their on the screen
190

190

00:09:27,450  -->  00:09:35,120
okay i'll see you in the next video
