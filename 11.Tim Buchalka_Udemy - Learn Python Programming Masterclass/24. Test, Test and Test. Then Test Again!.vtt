00:00:04.480  -->  00:00:09.490
In this video, I want to talk about
testing code more thoroughly.

2

00:00:59.469  -->  00:01:02.180
Now when you come across terms like that,

3

00:01:02.180  -->  00:01:05.840
the Google search engine, or any search
engine, is indispensable. So I'm going to

4

00:01:05.840  -->  00:01:08.740
type in edge case.

5

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:14.580
You can see the first result there, is a
Wikipedia article, so I'm going to click

6

00:01:14.580  -->  00:01:19.740
into that. So an edge case is a problem
or situation, that occurs only at an

7

00:01:19.740  -->  00:01:25.140
extreme maximum or minimum operating
parameter. They give the example there, of

8

00:01:25.140  -->  00:01:29.370
a loudspeaker that works fine until you
crank the volume up to maximum. Now in

9

00:01:29.370  -->  00:01:35.500
the software engineering section, down
here, the example is dividing two numbers.

10

00:01:35.500  -->  00:01:39.720
If your code does that, then you should
test it with very large values, as well

11

00:01:39.720  -->  00:01:45.420
as very small values.

12

00:02:05.940  -->  00:02:07.619
There's also corner cases, and back at

13

00:02:07.619  -->  00:02:13.680
this Wikipedia article now, if I click
into corner case there

14

00:03:16.740  -->  00:03:19.800
Let's work on that in the next video.
