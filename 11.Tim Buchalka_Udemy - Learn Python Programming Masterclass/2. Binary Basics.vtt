1
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.570
So this section it kinda give
you an introduction to binary.
1

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.420
What it actually is?
2

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.240
So binary is actually
a base 2 number system,
3

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.270
it also known as the binary number system.
4

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.040
So it's actually helpful
to fewest computer program.
5

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.990
I don't wanna understand the basics of
binary when you're actually writing some
6

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.790
programs and an example of that
would be when you're writing or
7

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.150
when you're reading and writing.
8

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.690
Binary data into a file, but
9

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.760
we'll actually keep these
section fairly short and simple.
10

11
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.110
If you're already understand binary and
hexidecimal and
11

12
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.700
if you're comfortable with that.
12

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.980
You might wanna actually skip this section
and move straight on to section 9.
13

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.430
Now, the other thing is if you actually
struggle to understand this section,
14

15
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.750
don't necessarily let it put
you off the rest of the course.
15

16
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.610
The thing to remember is that
although many high-level languages
16

17
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.440
allow binary manipulation and
other binary operations in your coding,
17

18
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.290
they're not actually necessary for
the vast majority of programming tasks.
18

19
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.960
So if you're happy to take at face value
and believe us when we say that for
19

20
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.300
example, the number 256
requires two bytes,
20

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.820
then you can actually continue
with the rest of the course,
21

22
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.360
moving on to the next section without
really having to understand this section.
22

23
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.700
With that said, though,
we both really suggest you give it a go.
23

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.050
And just works through in perhaps
even watched the video a few time
24

25
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.730
because having that knowledge of binary,
really sorts of help you understand
25

26
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.600
what's sort of happening under
the hood at the hardware level and
26

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.900
speaking of hardware it's actually.
27

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.190
Possible to create computer circuitry
that actually works in decimal.
28

29
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.460
In other words having ten different
voltage range to represent the ten digits
29

30
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.890
of decimal for example.
30

31
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.740
But it's much simpler and hence cheaper
To just deal in terms of on and off.
31

32
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.920
So that's low voltage or high voltage.
32

33
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.780
And for that reason,
computers nowadays always work in binary.
33

34
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.100
And I'm gonna swap over, now,
to a page in my browser.
34

35
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.510
And just showing you the link up
there in the top left hand corner.
35

36
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.390
I've sized him up so
you can see it a little bit better.
36

37
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.830
And this is actually a video.
37

38
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.610
It's a little short video.
38

39
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.250
I would suggest that you actually
take the It's time to watch it.
39

40
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.940
Now it's a computer that worked in
decimal, rather than binary and
40

41
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.420
created initially in 1951 and
it has been restored.
41

42
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.890
It is now fully operational at
the National Museum of Computing
42

43
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.920
which is at Bletchley Park on the UK.
43

44
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.760
So I suggest you just take like
a few minutes to watch and
44

45
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.490
sort to see a different thing working
like a computer with decimal,
45

46
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.870
unlike all the modern day
computers which are in binary.
46

47
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.540
So that's it,
I'm gonna finish the video here.
47

48
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.280
In the next video we're gonna go ahead and
start having a look
48

49
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.340
at how to perform arithmetic using
only the digits zero and one.
49

50
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.580
So I'll see you in that next video.
