00:00:04.600  -->  00:00:05.430
<v Instructor>All right, so we're going</v>
2

2

00:00:05.430  -->  00:00:07.030
to move on now and combine
3

3

00:00:07.030  -->  00:00:11.030
what we've learned about databases and classes.
4

4

00:00:11.030  -->  00:00:12.730
Now, some of the inheritance examples
5

5

00:00:12.730  -->  00:00:15.320
in the object oriented programming section
6

6

00:00:15.320  -->  00:00:17.060
were quite theoretical.
7

7

00:00:17.060  -->  00:00:18.250
So we're going to have a look
8

8

00:00:18.250  -->  00:00:20.820
at how subclassing an existing class
9

9

00:00:20.820  -->  00:00:23.830
can be a great way to add extra functionality.
10

10

00:00:23.830  -->  00:00:25.830
One good thing about this is that,
11

11

00:00:25.830  -->  00:00:28.260
you don't have to have any idea on how the class
12

12

00:00:28.260  -->  00:00:31.450
that you're subclassing actually works.
13

13

00:00:31.450  -->  00:00:33.090
You have to know what it does, of course,
14

14

00:00:33.090  -->  00:00:37.270
and also how to use it, but that's about all you do need.
15

15

00:00:37.270  -->  00:00:39.000
We're going to use our music database
16

16

00:00:39.000  -->  00:00:41.500
to produce a visual database browser.
17

17

00:00:41.500  -->  00:00:43.270
Now the app will be quite simple.
18

18

00:00:43.270  -->  00:00:45.520
We're going to display a list of artists
19

19

00:00:45.520  -->  00:00:47.710
from the database in a list.
20

20

00:00:47.710  -->  00:00:49.840
And when you select one of the artists,
21

21

00:00:49.840  -->  00:00:52.250
another list will show all their albums.
22

22

00:00:52.250  -->  00:00:54.800
When you click on an album, you'll get to see
23

23

00:00:54.800  -->  00:00:58.070
all the songs on that album in a third list.
24

24

00:00:58.070  -->  00:00:59.940
All right, so let's get started.
25

25

00:00:59.940  -->  00:01:02.840
We need a copy of the music.db database file
26

26

00:01:02.840  -->  00:01:05.730
that we've used earlier in this course.
27

27

00:01:05.730  -->  00:01:08.660
And you can see I've just downloaded a copy onto my desktop
28

28

00:01:08.660  -->  00:01:10.140
which I'm going to be using shortly.
29

29

00:01:10.140  -->  00:01:12.350
You can also grab that from an earlier lecture
30

30

00:01:12.350  -->  00:01:15.000
or from the resources section of this video.
31

31

00:01:15.000  -->  00:01:19.160
I'm going to create a new path and project.
32

32

00:01:19.160  -->  00:01:22.750
We're going to call this one Music Browser.
33

33

00:01:29.020  -->  00:01:31.550
Copy that music.db into this folder.
34

34

00:01:31.550  -->  00:01:34.830
The easiest way is to just right-click the package name
35

35

00:01:34.830  -->  00:01:37.090
and go down to Reveal In Finder.
36

36

00:01:37.090  -->  00:01:39.390
It will be opened in explorer on Windows and Linux,
37

37

00:01:39.390  -->  00:01:41.010
I believe, or words to that effect.
38

38

00:01:41.010  -->  00:01:43.210
If you click on that that opens the folder.
39

39

00:01:43.210  -->  00:01:44.980
I'm going to go into that folder
40

40

00:01:44.980  -->  00:01:48.930
and then I'm just going to go back to my desktop.
41

41

00:01:48.930  -->  00:01:52.530
Then I'm going to take a copy of that music.db file
42

42

00:01:52.530  -->  00:01:53.750
and paste it in there.
43

43

00:01:53.750  -->  00:01:55.260
Whatever you need to do, to do the similar thing,
44

44

00:01:55.260  -->  00:01:58.130
paste that file in there so we've got access
45

45

00:01:58.130  -->  00:02:00.030
back in it in the IntelliJ.
46

46

00:02:00.030  -->  00:02:02.820
You can see for me it's now popped up in the list there.
47

47

00:02:02.820  -->  00:02:05.030
All right, let's create a new file,
48

48

00:02:05.030  -->  00:02:06.130
a new path and file.
49

49

00:02:06.130  -->  00:02:08.720
We're going to call it jukebox.
50

50

00:02:14.090  -->  00:02:16.630
Okay, let's make a bit more space there.
51

51

00:02:16.630  -->  00:02:17.860
I've created that file.
52

52

00:02:17.860  -->  00:02:21.860
We're going to start now with a small challenge.
53

53

00:02:27.100  -->  00:02:29.600
The challenge is to use the database tab
54

54

00:02:29.600  -->  00:02:32.130
to configure the data source correctly,
55

55

00:02:32.130  -->  00:02:34.640
so that we don't get those warning messages from IntelliJ
56

56

00:02:34.640  -->  00:02:37.860
that we've seen previously when working with databases.
57

57

00:02:37.860  -->  00:02:41.290
And this also has the added benefit of helping IntelliJ
58

58

00:02:41.290  -->  00:02:44.050
to check things like our column names.
59

59

00:02:44.050  -->  00:02:44.960
That's the challenge.
60

60

00:02:44.960  -->  00:02:45.820
Pause the video.
61

61

00:02:45.820  -->  00:02:49.990
Let's see how you go, and I'll see you when you get back.
62

62

00:02:51.400  -->  00:02:52.500
Okay. So how did you get on?
63

63

00:02:52.500  -->  00:02:54.330
Hopefully you managed to figure that out.
64

64

00:02:54.330  -->  00:02:56.260
If you do remember from when we configured
65

65

00:02:56.260  -->  00:02:59.160
the accounts database in the previous project.
66

66

00:02:59.160  -->  00:03:02.900
Dragging a database file onto the database tab only works
67

67

00:03:02.900  -->  00:03:06.230
if the file has got a .sqlite extension.
68

68

00:03:06.230  -->  00:03:07.930
Now having said that, the latest version
69

69

00:03:07.930  -->  00:03:11.340
of IntelliJ Idea on a Mac, I was actually happy
70

70

00:03:11.340  -->  00:03:14.810
to create a data source by dragging the file music.db
71

71

00:03:14.810  -->  00:03:16.500
onto the database pane.
72

72

00:03:16.500  -->  00:03:19.900
This maybe will change on other operating systems as well.
73

73

00:03:19.900  -->  00:03:22.100
But in any event, the first step is to right-click
74

74

00:03:22.100  -->  00:03:24.310
on the music.db file.
75

75

00:03:24.310  -->  00:03:27.220
We're going to refactor and rename,
76

76

00:03:28.080  -->  00:03:32.250
and we're going to change the extension to sqlite.
77

77

00:03:34.240  -->  00:03:37.090
All right, so now I've actually done that here,
78

78

00:03:37.090  -->  00:03:39.160
but you may not actually want to rename your file
79

79

00:03:39.160  -->  00:03:40.540
for whatever reason.
80

80

00:03:40.540  -->  00:03:41.830
Perhaps other programmes are using
81

81

00:03:41.830  -->  00:03:44.370
the same database file for example.
82

82

00:03:44.370  -->  00:03:46.210
Although, I've renamed it here,
83

83

00:03:46.210  -->  00:03:49.040
I'm actually going to configure the data source manually
84

84

00:03:49.040  -->  00:03:50.750
instead of dragging the file.
85

85

00:03:50.750  -->  00:03:52.600
And that's because dragging and dropping the file
86

86

00:03:52.600  -->  00:03:53.880
onto a database tab-
87

87

00:03:53.880  -->  00:03:57.450
This is the one over here I'm talking about.
88

88

00:03:57.450  -->  00:03:58.970
Well, that's really only a convenience
89

89

00:03:58.970  -->  00:04:00.480
but it's not essential.
90

90

00:04:00.480  -->  00:04:02.610
Now, configuring the data source manually
91

91

00:04:02.610  -->  00:04:06.080
let's you use a sqlite database with any file extension.
92

92

00:04:06.080  -->  00:04:08.100
If you happen to have renamed the database file
93

93

00:04:08.100  -->  00:04:09.820
and dragged into the database pane
94

94

00:04:09.820  -->  00:04:12.510
to configure the data source as we've done previously,
95

95

00:04:12.510  -->  00:04:15.800
then well done, that's a challenge completed successfully.
96

96

00:04:15.800  -->  00:04:18.540
I want to show you something that can go wrong.
97

97

00:04:18.540  -->  00:04:20.730
Before configuring the database
98

98

00:04:20.730  -->  00:04:24.890
I'm going to just paste some code into our jukebox.py file.
99

99

00:04:28.040  -->  00:04:30.770
There's the code there.
100

100

00:04:30.770  -->  00:04:33.580
Actually we'd expect, and I'll just close the database pane.
101

101

00:04:33.580  -->  00:04:35.110
We're getting those warnings
102

102

00:04:35.110  -->  00:04:37.500
about no data sources are being configured
103

103

00:04:37.500  -->  00:04:39.190
and also a couple of other warnings here about
104

104

00:04:39.190  -->  00:04:40.870
unable to resolve symbol albums,
105

105

00:04:40.870  -->  00:04:43.500
and unable to resolve table albums.
106

106

00:04:43.500  -->  00:04:45.610
You don't actually have to type this code in
107

107

00:04:45.610  -->  00:04:47.220
before configuring the data source.
108

108

00:04:47.220  -->  00:04:48.390
I've just done this so that you can see
109

109

00:04:48.390  -->  00:04:50.630
that things are working properly.
110

110

00:04:50.630  -->  00:04:52.840
It can be a very natural mistake that you make
111

111

00:04:52.840  -->  00:04:55.450
that will cause this particular error.
112

112

00:04:55.450  -->  00:04:57.860
We're going to go and configure this manually.
113

113

00:04:57.860  -->  00:05:00.020
I'm going to open the database tab again
114

114

00:05:00.020  -->  00:05:02.110
and click on plus.
115

115

00:05:02.110  -->  00:05:03.900
I'm going to choose data source,
116

116

00:05:03.900  -->  00:05:06.630
and then I'm going to choose sqlite xerial,
117

117

00:05:06.630  -->  00:05:08.210
this one down here.
118

118

00:05:09.070  -->  00:05:13.490
Next, you can actually come over here and use the ellipses
119

119

00:05:13.490  -->  00:05:17.520
next to the file, over here to the right or the file label,
120

120

00:05:17.520  -->  00:05:20.760
and that's one way to navigate to the actual folder.
121

121

00:05:20.760  -->  00:05:21.600
But you might be looking at that thinking,
122

122

00:05:21.600  -->  00:05:24.130
"Well, isn't this just quicker than just type in the name?"
123

123

00:05:24.130  -->  00:05:26.850
Because you know the name is music.sqlite.
124

124

00:05:26.850  -->  00:05:30.060
You could come over here and just type in music.
125

125

00:05:30.060  -->  00:05:32.330
With the theory being that music.sqlite,
126

126

00:05:32.330  -->  00:05:35.120
we can see it's over here in our project folder,
127

127

00:05:35.120  -->  00:05:37.890
so we don't need to worry about a path.
128

128

00:05:37.890  -->  00:05:39.330
I've changed the name as you can see there
129

129

00:05:39.330  -->  00:05:40.900
now to music.sqlite.
130

130

00:05:40.900  -->  00:05:41.980
You change it to whatever the name
131

131

00:05:41.980  -->  00:05:44.800
of the database file is on your system.
132

132

00:05:44.800  -->  00:05:47.950
That does work in that the test connexion button,
133

133

00:05:47.950  -->  00:05:51.290
which I'm going to press now, it does actually work.
134

134

00:05:51.290  -->  00:05:53.280
It says successful.
135

135

00:05:53.280  -->  00:05:55.780
But on Windows it doesn't report an error.
136

136

00:05:55.780  -->  00:05:59.120
With that said, if we click on okay now.
137

137

00:06:00.360  -->  00:06:02.280
Notice that, I'm not sure whether you were paying attention,
138

138

00:06:02.280  -->  00:06:03.930
but there's this little arrow, it was appearing
139

139

00:06:03.930  -->  00:06:06.650
to the left of the database name.
140

140

00:06:06.650  -->  00:06:08.820
The one that we normally click to get into the database
141

141

00:06:08.820  -->  00:06:12.370
to have a look at the tables and columns, etc,
142

142

00:06:12.370  -->  00:06:14.310
but then that disappeared.
143

143

00:06:14.310  -->  00:06:16.460
We can't browse the database now.
144

144

00:06:16.460  -->  00:06:18.880
The other thing is we go back to the code.
145

145

00:06:18.880  -->  00:06:22.710
We're still getting some weird warnings there.
146

146

00:06:24.300  -->  00:06:25.190
We're still getting a problem
147

147

00:06:25.190  -->  00:06:26.780
with resolving the symbol albums
148

148

00:06:26.780  -->  00:06:29.130
and resolving the table albums.
149

149

00:06:29.130  -->  00:06:32.100
In other words, IntelliJ is not recognising those.
150

150

00:06:32.100  -->  00:06:34.010
The thing is, it's not going to recognise those
151

151

00:06:34.010  -->  00:06:38.350
until you provide the full path to the file.
152

152

00:06:38.350  -->  00:06:40.810
That might make sense to just type in the name
153

153

00:06:40.810  -->  00:06:43.020
without a path that I actually did there,
154

154

00:06:43.020  -->  00:06:43.940
for the moment at least,
155

155

00:06:43.940  -->  00:06:45.820
or at least for this version of IntelliJ
156

156

00:06:45.820  -->  00:06:47.640
it doesn't actually work like that.
157

157

00:06:47.640  -->  00:06:49.350
But fortunately we can fix that.
158

158

00:06:49.350  -->  00:06:51.570
We can just go back to the data source properties.
159

159

00:06:51.570  -->  00:06:54.980
We can right-click and choose properties.
160

160

00:06:56.310  -->  00:06:58.880
I'm right-clicking the database file obviously.
161

161

00:06:58.880  -->  00:06:59.880
Alternatively I could have used
162

162

00:06:59.880  -->  00:07:02.090
the little wrench button there to get into the properties
163

163

00:07:02.090  -->  00:07:06.250
at the top of the toolbar there, just above the file name.
164

164

00:07:08.120  -->  00:07:11.310
If I change that now and actually click on the ellipses.
165

165

00:07:11.310  -->  00:07:14.900
This time if I now go to that folder again.
166

166

00:07:18.550  -->  00:07:21.720
I'll select my database, if I'll open,
167

167

00:07:22.790  -->  00:07:24.640
with a full path this time.
168

168

00:07:24.640  -->  00:07:25.830
Test connexion.
169

169

00:07:25.830  -->  00:07:26.680
Well, that still works.
170

170

00:07:26.680  -->  00:07:28.860
If I click on okay this time.
171

171

00:07:28.860  -->  00:07:29.920
You can see it having done,
172

172

00:07:29.920  -->  00:07:31.800
we firstly have got this little green arrow here.
173

173

00:07:31.800  -->  00:07:34.600
The arrows have disappeared from our path and code,
174

174

00:07:34.600  -->  00:07:36.380
but also we've got the little arrow now.
175

175

00:07:36.380  -->  00:07:38.560
We can click, we can open up tables and open up
176

176

00:07:38.560  -->  00:07:40.860
and get access to the columns.
177

177

00:07:40.860  -->  00:07:44.580
In any event, that's how to configure a data source manually
178

178

00:07:44.580  -->  00:07:46.080
instead of drag and drop.
179

179

00:07:46.080  -->  00:07:48.070
Along the way I also showed you a little problem
180

180

00:07:48.070  -->  00:07:51.050
that can pop up if you don't actually use the ellipses
181

181

00:07:51.050  -->  00:07:53.720
to select the database file with a full path.
182

182

00:07:53.720  -->  00:07:55.410
Make sure you do do that
183

183

00:07:55.410  -->  00:07:57.950
until IntelliJ hopefully can handle this problem
184

184

00:07:57.950  -->  00:07:59.620
and actually fix it.
185

185

00:07:59.620  -->  00:08:01.080
Incidentally, what we just did there
186

186

00:08:01.080  -->  00:08:03.130
with the manual configuration.
187

187

00:08:03.130  -->  00:08:04.280
Well, that's what you'd need to do
188

188

00:08:04.280  -->  00:08:06.900
if you were connecting to a client server database
189

189

00:08:06.900  -->  00:08:09.740
such as sql server or perhaps DB2.
190

190

00:08:10.790  -->  00:08:12.310
Just close the database tab,
191

191

00:08:12.310  -->  00:08:14.680
now that we've got our database centre find.
192

192

00:08:14.680  -->  00:08:17.890
I'm going to delete the code that I initially added,
193

193

00:08:17.890  -->  00:08:20.520
and we're going to start coding.
194

194

00:08:20.520  -->  00:08:22.820
We need to import sqlite, obviously,
195

195

00:08:22.820  -->  00:08:25.280
but also we need to import tkinter.
196

196

00:08:25.280  -->  00:08:27.880
And we're going to do that in the python2 friendly way
197

197

00:08:27.880  -->  00:08:29.200
and that's because this app is almost not going
198

198

00:08:29.200  -->  00:08:33.230
to be able to work with python2.7 and up.
199

199

00:08:33.230  -->  00:08:37.050
I'm going to start with the import to sqlite3.
200

200

00:08:37.050  -->  00:08:41.210
I'm going to need to add a try, colon, import tkinter.
201

201

00:08:42.290  -->  00:08:44.180
You've seen this code before.
202

202

00:08:44.180  -->  00:08:47.350
We need to add an except import error,
203

203

00:08:49.580  -->  00:08:51.830
colon, and that's python 2.
204

204

00:08:53.430  -->  00:08:57.600
In that case we're going to do import Tkinter as tkinter.
205

205

00:09:02.210  -->  00:09:04.180
Then we just can start with our connexion,
206

206

00:09:04.180  -->  00:09:06.510
conn equals sqlite3.connect.
207

207

00:09:08.040  -->  00:09:12.530
And of course the file name should be music.sqlite.
208

208

00:09:12.530  -->  00:09:15.070
If by chance you haven't renamed it and it's still db,
209

209

00:09:15.070  -->  00:09:18.210
obviously you need to change it to that name.
210

210

00:09:18.210  -->  00:09:20.350
All right, so next we're going to set up a window.
211

211

00:09:20.350  -->  00:09:22.390
It's a good idea to start with an idea
212

212

00:09:22.390  -->  00:09:24.680
of what it should look like.
213

213

00:09:24.680  -->  00:09:26.880
We're going to be creating a simple layout
214

214

00:09:26.880  -->  00:09:30.560
that I'm going to show you on the slide.
215

215

00:09:30.560  -->  00:09:32.990
That's what we're going to try and create here.
216

216

00:09:32.990  -->  00:09:34.540
You can see that it's pretty basic,
217

217

00:09:34.540  -->  00:09:37.540
but it demonstrates some very useful techniques
218

218

00:09:37.540  -->  00:09:40.690
for subclassing an existing class.
219

219

00:09:40.690  -->  00:09:43.570
We want to put a scroll-bar next to each list box,
220

220

00:09:43.570  -->  00:09:44.410
but we're going to put them
221

221

00:09:44.410  -->  00:09:46.700
in the same column as their listbox.
222

222

00:09:46.700  -->  00:09:50.450
In essence we're going to need three columns.
223

223

00:09:52.410  -->  00:09:55.990
The space between the lists will be set using padding,
224

224

00:09:55.990  -->  00:09:58.110
but there's something I want to demonstrate
225

225

00:09:58.110  -->  00:10:00.770
when we come to subclass the listboxes.
226

226

00:10:00.770  -->  00:10:03.700
We're going to set the padding on the left of each list,
227

227

00:10:03.700  -->  00:10:05.990
but for the far right of the display,
228

228

00:10:05.990  -->  00:10:07.820
I'm going to use another column
229

229

00:10:07.820  -->  00:10:10.960
to keep the songs list away from the edge of the window.
230

230

00:10:10.960  -->  00:10:12.160
You don't have to do that,
231

231

00:10:12.160  -->  00:10:16.320
I'm only doing it to make explaining something else easier.
232

232

00:10:18.620  -->  00:10:22.350
We also want a title, as you can see, above each box,
233

233

00:10:22.350  -->  00:10:24.680
so there'll be at least two rows.
234

234

00:10:24.680  -->  00:10:26.620
Because there's going to be far more artists
235

235

00:10:26.620  -->  00:10:28.240
than albums or songs,
236

236

00:10:28.240  -->  00:10:32.410
we're going to span the artists listbox over two rows.
237

237

00:10:35.020  -->  00:10:38.430
We're also going to leave a blank row along the bottom,
238

238

00:10:38.430  -->  00:10:39.640
and that's to keep everything away
239

239

00:10:39.640  -->  00:10:41.220
from the edge of the window.
240

240

00:10:41.220  -->  00:10:43.230
That's four rows in total.
241

241

00:10:43.230  -->  00:10:45.130
Now that we've decided all of that,
242

242

00:10:45.130  -->  00:10:49.100
we can go back and set up these windows.
243

243

00:10:49.100  -->  00:10:51.150
We're going to continue on
244

244

00:10:51.150  -->  00:10:54.610
and we're going to type mainwindow
245

245

00:10:54.610  -->  00:10:56.110
equals tkinter.Tk,
246

246

00:10:57.840  -->  00:11:00.340
parenthesis, mainwindow.title,
247

247

00:11:03.600  -->  00:11:06.080
parenthesis and in single quotes,
248

248

00:11:06.080  -->  00:11:08.580
Music Db Browser as the title.
249

249

00:11:10.290  -->  00:11:11.550
Then we want to set the geometry,
250

250

00:11:11.550  -->  00:11:13.880
so it's mainwindow.geometry.
251

251

00:11:15.340  -->  00:11:18.610
We're going to go for 1024 by 768,
252

252

00:11:18.610  -->  00:11:21.300
so we need parenthesis and in single quotes,
253

253

00:11:21.300  -->  00:11:22.130
1024x768.
254

254

00:11:26.130  -->  00:11:29.320
Let's go ahead now and configure the columns.
255

255

00:11:29.320  -->  00:11:31.570
Mainwindow.columnconfigure.
256

256

00:11:33.850  -->  00:11:37.980
We're going to go with zero, comma, space,
257

257

00:11:37.980  -->  00:11:39.480
weight equals two.
258

258

00:11:40.810  -->  00:11:43.390
Mainwindow.columnconfigure one,
259

259

00:11:45.130  -->  00:11:47.210
comma, weight equals two.
260

260

00:11:48.620  -->  00:11:52.780
Mainwindow.columnconfigure, parenthesis, two, comma, space,
261

261

00:11:54.140  -->  00:11:55.640
weight equals two.
262

262

00:11:56.550  -->  00:11:59.970
And last one, mainwindow.columnconfigure,
263

263

00:12:02.140  -->  00:12:04.220
three, weight equals one.
264

264

00:12:07.500  -->  00:12:11.670
Just as a reminder that's the spacer column on right.
265

265

00:12:14.590  -->  00:12:16.390
We now want to configure our rows.
266

266

00:12:16.390  -->  00:12:20.330
That's going to be mainwindow.rowconfigure,
267

267

00:12:20.330  -->  00:12:25.220
parenthesis, zero, comma, space, weight equals one.
268

268

00:12:25.220  -->  00:12:27.640
Then mainwindow.rowconfigure,
269

269

00:12:29.640  -->  00:12:31.800
parenthesis, one, comma,
270

270

00:12:31.800  -->  00:12:33.780
weight equals five.
271

271

00:12:33.780  -->  00:12:37.860
Mainwindow.rowconfigure, parenthesis, two, comma,
272

272

00:12:38.810  -->  00:12:41.140
space, weight equals five.
273

273

00:12:41.140  -->  00:12:45.590
And lastly, mainwindow.rowconfigure, parenthesis,
274

274

00:12:45.590  -->  00:12:48.840
three, comma, space, weight equals one.
275

275

00:12:51.020  -->  00:12:52.090
As you can see there,
276

276

00:12:52.090  -->  00:12:54.440
I've given more weight to the middle two rows
277

277

00:12:54.440  -->  00:12:57.180
and that's because they contain the listboxes.
278

278

00:12:57.180  -->  00:12:58.660
If you're not too sure what I'm doing here,
279

279

00:12:58.660  -->  00:13:01.340
do go back and check the tkinter videos
280

280

00:13:01.340  -->  00:13:03.010
in section 11 of the course,
281

281

00:13:03.010  -->  00:13:06.070
because I go into detail about what all this stuff means.
282

282

00:13:06.070  -->  00:13:07.540
I'm assuming at this stage of the course
283

283

00:13:07.540  -->  00:13:09.780
you've actually been through that.
284

284

00:13:09.780  -->  00:13:12.960
Next we need our labels and listboxes.
285

285

00:13:12.960  -->  00:13:14.000
We're going to create them
286

286

00:13:14.000  -->  00:13:16.560
after setting up the columns and rows.
287

287

00:13:16.560  -->  00:13:19.050
We're going to start with, and put a comment here
288

288

00:13:19.050  -->  00:13:21.330
just to indicate what we're doing.
289

289

00:13:21.330  -->  00:13:23.920
This is going to be the labels.
290

290

00:13:25.450  -->  00:13:29.830
We'll start with tkinter, that's going to be .label,
291

291

00:13:29.830  -->  00:13:32.990
parenthesis, mainwindow, comma, space,
292

292

00:13:34.320  -->  00:13:38.040
text equals, then artist in double quotes,
293

293

00:13:38.040  -->  00:13:42.200
right parenthesis then .grid, parenthesis, row equal zero,
294

294

00:13:43.260  -->  00:13:47.430
comma, space, column equal zero, right parenthesis.
295

295

00:13:48.900  -->  00:13:51.300
Let's just copy that line task,
296

296

00:13:51.300  -->  00:13:53.160
because we need two more labels.
297

297

00:13:53.160  -->  00:13:55.960
The first one is going to be,
298

298

00:13:55.960  -->  00:13:57.340
everything the same up until text.
299

299

00:13:57.340  -->  00:14:00.120
We're going to change the text to albums.
300

300

00:14:00.120  -->  00:14:02.150
Then the grid row reference, everything is the same,
301

301

00:14:02.150  -->  00:14:04.990
column is one, and for the third one
302

302

00:14:04.990  -->  00:14:06.460
that's going to be the third label,
303

303

00:14:06.460  -->  00:14:07.840
it's going to be songs.
304

304

00:14:07.840  -->  00:14:12.010
That's still on row zero, and the text is going to be songs.
305

305

00:14:14.370  -->  00:14:16.530
Okay, I love that.
306

306

00:14:16.530  -->  00:14:20.200
We've done that okay, and let's continue on.
307

307

00:14:21.540  -->  00:14:25.460
We're now going to work on the artists listbox.
308

308

00:14:27.900  -->  00:14:31.380
We're going to start with artistList
309

309

00:14:31.380  -->  00:14:33.460
equal to tkinter.listbox,
310

310

00:14:35.830  -->  00:14:37.830
parenthesis, mainwindow.
311

311

00:14:39.560  -->  00:14:41.980
Then we want artistList.grid,
312

312

00:14:43.970  -->  00:14:46.430
parenthesis, row equals one,
313

313

00:14:46.430  -->  00:14:49.590
comma, space, column equal zero, comma,
314

314

00:14:49.590  -->  00:14:52.750
space, sticky equals, in single quotes
315

315

00:14:53.590  -->  00:14:56.840
nsew, comma, space, rowspan equals two,
316

316

00:14:58.540  -->  00:15:02.630
comma, space and then padx equals parenthesis, 30,
317

317

00:15:02.630  -->  00:15:04.330
comma, space, zero.
318

318

00:15:04.330  -->  00:15:07.760
And then two right parenthesis to finish off the line.
319

319

00:15:07.760  -->  00:15:09.810
Then we need to also add a config.
320

320

00:15:09.810  -->  00:15:11.560
So artistList.config,
321

321

00:15:13.850  -->  00:15:16.560
parenthesis, and it's going to be border equals two,
322

322

00:15:16.560  -->  00:15:18.230
comma, space, relief
323

323

00:15:20.310  -->  00:15:23.960
is equal to, single quotes, sunken
324

324

00:15:23.960  -->  00:15:26.600
and then we just end parenthesis.
325

325

00:15:26.600  -->  00:15:29.570
That's our artist listbox, then we want to do
326

326

00:15:29.570  -->  00:15:32.330
the same for albums listbox and songs listbox,
327

327

00:15:32.330  -->  00:15:34.830
so let's go ahead and do that.
328

328

00:15:35.830  -->  00:15:38.410
This is going to be the albums.
329

329

00:15:40.260  -->  00:15:42.680
I'm going to start by albumLV
330

330

00:15:44.090  -->  00:15:46.090
equals tkinter.Variable,
331

331

00:15:48.520  -->  00:15:50.520
parenthesis, mainwindow.
332

332

00:15:52.250  -->  00:15:53.580
And albumLV.set,
333

333

00:15:55.400  -->  00:15:57.050
two left parenthesis there,
334

334

00:15:57.050  -->  00:15:59.270
then we want the text in double quotes,
335

335

00:15:59.270  -->  00:16:00.690
choose an artist,
336

336

00:16:02.240  -->  00:16:05.300
and a comma after the trailing double quote
337

337

00:16:05.300  -->  00:16:07.790
and then the two ending parenthesis.
338

338

00:16:07.790  -->  00:16:09.630
Then we want albumList
339

339

00:16:11.010  -->  00:16:14.030
is equal to tkinter.Listbox
340

340

00:16:14.030  -->  00:16:17.780
again, parenthesis, mainwindow, comma, space,
341

341

00:16:18.790  -->  00:16:21.380
listvariable, all in lowercase,
342

342

00:16:22.360  -->  00:16:26.440
equals albumLV that we defined on line 34 and 35.
343

343

00:16:29.050  -->  00:16:30.580
Then we want to set the grid,
344

344

00:16:30.580  -->  00:16:34.490
so it's going to be albumList.grid, parenthesis
345

345

00:16:36.120  -->  00:16:38.030
and we're going to start with row equals one, comma,
346

346

00:16:38.030  -->  00:16:41.250
space, column equals one, comma, space
347

347

00:16:41.250  -->  00:16:44.590
then sticky equals, single quotes, nsew,
348

348

00:16:47.080  -->  00:16:49.820
comma, space then padx equals,
349

349

00:16:49.820  -->  00:16:52.570
in parenthesis, 30, comma, space, zero
350

350

00:16:52.570  -->  00:16:55.590
then the two right parenthesis to end the line.
351

351

00:16:55.590  -->  00:16:57.340
Then we need a config as well,
352

352

00:16:57.340  -->  00:17:00.340
that's going to be albumList.config,
353

353

00:17:02.380  -->  00:17:06.210
border equals two in parenthesis, and relief equal sunken
354

354

00:17:06.210  -->  00:17:09.860
and sunken has single quotes around it.
355

355

00:17:09.860  -->  00:17:10.690
Sunken.
356

356

00:17:12.510  -->  00:17:13.980
All right.
357

357

00:17:13.980  -->  00:17:15.120
I'm making more space here,
358

358

00:17:15.120  -->  00:17:18.290
and let's finish off the songs listbox
359

359

00:17:19.250  -->  00:17:21.250
before we end the video.
360

360

00:17:25.980  -->  00:17:28.350
We're going to start there with our variable again,
361

361

00:17:28.350  -->  00:17:30.050
so songLV is equal
362

362

00:17:30.050  -->  00:17:31.630
to tkinter.Variable
363

363

00:17:33.780  -->  00:17:36.870
and it's going to be mainwindow.
364

364

00:17:36.870  -->  00:17:40.850
And songLV.set and then two left parenthesis
365

365

00:17:40.850  -->  00:17:43.600
in double quote, choose an album,
366

366

00:17:44.810  -->  00:17:47.320
and the double quote to finish off the line
367

367

00:17:47.320  -->  00:17:50.670
and then a comma, two right parenthesis.
368

368

00:17:50.670  -->  00:17:53.260
songList equals tkinter.listbox
369

369

00:17:56.150  -->  00:18:00.120
and it's going to be mainwindow in parenthesis, comma,
370

370

00:18:00.120  -->  00:18:04.290
then listvariable, all in lowercase, equals songLV.
371

371

00:18:06.890  -->  00:18:09.560
Then songList.grid, parenthesis,
372

372

00:18:11.180  -->  00:18:13.170
row equals one, comma, space,
373

373

00:18:13.170  -->  00:18:15.730
column equals two this time,
374

374

00:18:15.730  -->  00:18:18.850
space after the comma, and sticky equals,
375

375

00:18:18.850  -->  00:18:21.700
single quotes, nsew again.
376

376

00:18:21.700  -->  00:18:23.880
Single quotes around the text there,
377

377

00:18:23.880  -->  00:18:27.230
comma, space, padx equals and in parenthesis 30,
378

378

00:18:27.230  -->  00:18:31.470
comma, space, zero, then the two closing right parenthesis.
379

379

00:18:31.470  -->  00:18:33.120
Then we just need the config,
380

380

00:18:33.120  -->  00:18:34.700
so songList.config,
381

381

00:18:36.800  -->  00:18:38.870
border equals two, comma, space
382

382

00:18:38.870  -->  00:18:42.330
then relief equals, two single quotes,
383

383

00:18:42.330  -->  00:18:44.840
and it's going to be sunken within that.
384

384

00:18:44.840  -->  00:18:47.600
Then right parenthesis to close the line over.
385

385

00:18:47.600  -->  00:18:50.520
That's the user interface elements created,
386

386

00:18:50.520  -->  00:18:52.030
so we should be able to start a main loop
387

387

00:18:52.030  -->  00:18:53.630
and see how it works.
388

388

00:18:53.630  -->  00:18:55.610
Let's quickly do that before we end the video.
389

389

00:18:55.610  -->  00:18:58.700
I'm just going to put a code in here.
390

390

00:19:04.090  -->  00:19:04.930
Main loop.
391

391

00:19:06.420  -->  00:19:07.850
And the code is going to be pretty simple,
392

392

00:19:07.850  -->  00:19:10.930
it's going to be mainwindow.mainloop.
393

393

00:19:13.400  -->  00:19:18.220
We're going to print, closing database connexion.
394

394

00:19:18.220  -->  00:19:22.060
Of course we open that right up on line seven,
395

395

00:19:24.010  -->  00:19:25.870
I think I see up there.
396

396

00:19:25.870  -->  00:19:30.600
Then we need to actually close this, so conn.close.
397

397

00:19:30.600  -->  00:19:32.270
Let's just run that,
398

398

00:19:35.010  -->  00:19:36.820
and have a bit of look here.
399

399

00:19:36.820  -->  00:19:38.860
That's close to what we originally said we wanted,
400

400

00:19:38.860  -->  00:19:41.060
but we're missing scroll bars though.
401

401

00:19:41.060  -->  00:19:44.890
Let's start looking at that in the next video.
