00:00:04.340  -->  00:00:08.480
So because of the size of this course
and the sheer amount of a range of

2

00:00:08.480  -->  00:00:13.140
topics covered in it, you might from time
to time have a question you need help with.

3

00:00:13.140  -->  00:00:17.060
So this video is all about showing
you how to get help in that situation.

4

00:00:17.060  -->  00:00:20.980
So firstly, what you need to do to
get help is to log into the course,

5

00:00:20.980  -->  00:00:24.440
and when you log in you've got these options,
as you can see on the screen there.

6

00:00:24.440  -->  00:00:29.880
Choose a Q&amp;A. When you do that, you can
click on Ask a question, and enter a title

7

00:00:29.880  -->  00:00:33.980
about the question and some detailed
description, and I'll talk more about the

8

00:00:33.980  -->  00:00:37.960
types of, or how to go about describing
the problem, and then post the question.

9

00:00:37.960  -->  00:00:42.200
So it's literally that easy, and one of,
myself or Jean-Paul Roberts, my

10

00:00:42.200  -->  00:00:45.800
teaching assistant, or even a member of
another student, member of the community,

11

00:00:45.800  -->  00:00:49.130
will pop in there and actually help you
out. So, here's an example post just to

12

00:00:49.130  -->  00:00:53.020
give you an idea. So note the title
and the description there,

13

00:00:53.020  -->  00:00:57.420
but also, the other thing I want to show you is,
if you've got some source code that's not working,

14

00:00:57.420  -->  00:01:00.540
and this is a programming course so
that's probably, in a large amount of cases,

15

00:01:00.540  -->  00:01:05.400
the reason why you're posting. So
if it's not working, don't do a screen image.

16

00:01:05.400  -->  00:01:08.810
I suggest you actually post the code.
So click here and you can

17

00:01:08.810  -->  00:01:13.280
paste the code directly in, and notice
that when you do that, it gets all nicely

18

00:01:13.280  -->  00:01:17.360
color-coded and formatted. So that's
the preference, that makes it easy

19

00:01:17.360  -->  00:01:22.420
for other people to actually take that code and
try and use it, because if you post an image,

20

00:01:22.420  -->  00:01:25.360
if you take a screenshot of the
problem you're having, it's not possible

21

00:01:25.360  -->  00:01:29.440
for someone to grab your code and paste
it into their IDE, into IntelliJ,

22

00:01:29.440  -->  00:01:33.700
and get a result, trying to figure out what's
going on. So if you posted a source code,

23

00:01:33.700  -->  00:01:36.979
it just makes it a lot easier, and again,
doing it that way means that it's all

24

00:01:36.980  -->  00:01:40.729
nicely color-coded and formatted and
you're just improving, increasing the

25

00:01:40.729  -->  00:01:43.780
chances is what I'm trying to say,
of getting a resolution.

26

00:01:43.780  -->  00:01:48.800
Alright, but keep in mind that I mentioned images.
You can upload images. Sometimes images are preferable,

27

00:01:48.800  -->  00:01:51.900
if you've got some other issue or you
want to supplement what you've shown,

28

00:01:51.900  -->  00:01:55.000
or what you've put in your description,
with an image. That's how you can upload

29

00:01:55.000  -->  00:01:58.760
an image as well, so that's also included
there.  So do that if you need to.

30

00:01:58.760  -->  00:02:02.280
And the other thing I want to point out,
though, is before posting a question,

31

00:02:02.280  -->  00:02:05.560
realize that the chances are probably fairly
high that your question may already have

32

00:02:05.560  -->  00:02:09.460
been answered, so for that reason,
before posting a new question,

33

00:02:09.460  -->  00:02:14.800
I strongly suggest you try the search facility.
Now the search, very simple as you can there.

34

00:02:14.800  -->  00:02:17.040
Just type the question here,
as you can see,

35

00:02:17.040  -->  00:02:21.080
and it brings up an answer. So notice
that you can search all questions,

36

00:02:21.080  -->  00:02:26.140
all our lectures rather, or a specific lecture.
So you might want to hone your results

37

00:02:26.140  -->  00:02:28.989
to a specific lecture. That can be a good
idea if you've got a problem with a

38

00:02:28.989  -->  00:02:32.650
specific lecture, and try and search just
within that lecture, but you can also

39

00:02:32.650  -->  00:02:36.480
search across all lectures as well and
there's lots and lots of questions,

40

00:02:36.480  -->  00:02:39.140
a huge amount of questions here. So make
sure you take advantage of that.

41

00:02:39.140  -->  00:02:41.640
It'll definitely help you out.

42

00:02:41.640  -->  00:02:43.080
Alright, now the other thing I want to just

43

00:02:43.080  -->  00:02:46.960
quickly raise is being, or just some
tips on actually asking questions,

44

00:02:46.960  -->  00:02:50.340
and this'll help you in your future
career as a programmer as well.

45

00:02:50.340  -->  00:02:55.880
Firstly, be as specific as you possibly can.
So if you, let's just say you're

46

00:02:55.880  -->  00:02:59.880
getting stuck in a particular lecture. Now
if you just post a question and say,

47

00:02:59.880  -->  00:03:03.800
'I can't get this code to work, I can't get
the code from this lecture to work',

48

00:03:03.800  -->  00:03:07.500
that's technically correct. It's probably
not working for you, but it makes it

49

00:03:07.510  -->  00:03:10.510
really hard for anyone else to try and
help you, because you haven't given us

50

00:03:10.510  -->  00:03:14.200
any information to work with.
So basically, let us know the lecture

51

00:03:14.200  -->  00:03:17.919
that you're working on, paste in the code
you've used, using what I showed you

52

00:03:17.919  -->  00:03:21.280
earlier in the video and maybe a
screenshot of the exact area if you need

53

00:03:21.280  -->  00:03:25.120
to do that, as opposed to the code, you know,
the actual error message and so forth you're getting.

54

00:03:25.120  -->  00:03:27.660
Now this is great practice
for when you become a

55

00:03:27.660  -->  00:03:31.560
programmer in the real world, so because
if you're starting out in a new job,

56

00:03:31.560  -->  00:03:35.840
and you're stuck and you go to your team
leader or to another programmer for help,

57

00:03:35.840  -->  00:03:39.360
then you really do need to give them as
much information as possible. And that's

58

00:03:39.370  -->  00:03:42.760
because people in general aren't gonna
be happy if you just say, 'this is not

59

00:03:42.760  -->  00:03:46.320
working, can you help me?' or something
similar, because we're all busy in

60

00:03:46.320  -->  00:03:50.680
today's society. So you need to be as
specific as possible in the real world,

61

00:03:50.680  -->  00:03:53.980
and certainly that would apply here as
well, and that by doing that, being

62

00:03:53.980  -->  00:03:57.669
specific and saying exactly what's wrong,
that's really going to help you get

63

00:03:57.669  -->  00:04:01.920
answers quicker and make you a better
programmer as well, in the long term.

64

00:04:01.920  -->  00:04:06.260
The other thing that's also useful, is it's
usually better to ask a new question,

65

00:04:06.260  -->  00:04:10.080
rather than appending your question to
another question that's been previously answered,

66

00:04:10.080  -->  00:04:14.040
unless your question is completely related to that one,
if that makes sense.

67

00:04:14.040  -->  00:04:18.740
And the reason for that is that some of this
depends on the notification system of Udemy.

68

00:04:18.740  -->  00:04:20.820
Sometimes some of the older questions,

69

00:04:20.820  -->  00:04:23.780
if you post a follow-up question to a
question that's maybe been answered

70

00:04:23.780  -->  00:04:27.620
six months ago, those notifications don't always come through to

71

00:04:27.620  -->  00:04:29.700
the  people who are trying to answer
these questions for you.

72

00:04:29.700  -->  00:04:34.200
So it's usually better to post a new question
and get an answer to it that way.

73

00:04:34.200  -->  00:04:36.600
But again, always make sure you use
the search facility first because

74

00:04:36.600  -->  00:04:40.140
that's going to help you a lot, and 
give you the skills to make you a great

75

00:04:40.140  -->  00:04:43.240
productive programmer.
Alright so that's support.

76

00:04:43.240  -->  00:04:48.160
Let's finish the video here and I'll see you in the next one.
