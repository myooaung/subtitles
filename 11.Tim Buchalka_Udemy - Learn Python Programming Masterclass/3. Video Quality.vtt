00:00:04.100  -->  00:00:09.170
So all videos in this course have been
uploaded in 1080p, which is the highest

2

00:00:09.170  -->  00:00:13.900
quality format that udemy currently
accept for videos. So that's the good news.

3

00:00:13.900  -->  00:00:18.020
The bad news is that sometimes Udemy's
video player seems to act up,

4

00:00:18.020  -->  00:00:22.280
and what happens is it plays videos
with a bit of blurriness in them.

5

00:00:22.280  -->  00:00:26.320
But good news again, we're back to the good news,
is that blurriness is usually a temporary thing

6

00:00:26.320  -->  00:00:29.300
and can be overcome by following along here.

7

00:00:29.300  -->  00:00:34.060
So what I'm gonna do is come down here and click
on the little cog and choose a resolution,

8

00:00:34.060  -->  00:00:38.260
720p is the best one to choose,
normally, if you haven't got the

9

00:00:38.270  -->  00:00:42.170
auto option. But if you have got the auto
option, select that, because that will

10

00:00:42.170  -->  00:00:45.680
give you 1080p, which is, again,
the highest quality videos.

11

00:00:45.680  -->  00:00:52.000
Now Auto only shows if Udemy's video player dictates
that your internet speed is fast enough.

12

00:00:52.000  -->  00:00:55.840
So playing with these settings should actually fix any blurriness

13

00:00:55.840  -->  00:00:58.240
and ensure that your videos are crisp and clear,

14

00:00:58.240  -->  00:01:02.840
and keep in mind also, that it can take a short
while for the video to kick into high quality,

15

00:01:02.840  -->  00:01:06.400
at the start of playing a video.
Alright so that's video quality.

16

00:01:06.400  -->  00:01:09.640
Let's move on now to the next video.
