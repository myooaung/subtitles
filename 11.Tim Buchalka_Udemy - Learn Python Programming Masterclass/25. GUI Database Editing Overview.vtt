<v Speaker>In the next few videos in this section,</v>
2

2

00:00:07.650  -->  00:00:09.320
we're going to be using a way to view
3

3

00:00:09.320  -->  00:00:13.050
our database tables without leaving IntelliJ.
4

4

00:00:13.050  -->  00:00:16.890
Now the Ultimate Editions of IntelliJ and Pycharm
5

5

00:00:16.890  -->  00:00:21.390
include a plugin already called Database Tools and Sequel.
6

6

00:00:21.390  -->  00:00:23.840
But, unfortunately, that plugin's not available
7

7

00:00:23.840  -->  00:00:27.230
in the Community Editions of both versions of that software.
8

8

00:00:27.230  -->  00:00:30.790
So to compensate, we're going to instal another plugin
9

9

00:00:30.790  -->  00:00:33.660
that is available called Database Navigator.
10

10

00:00:33.660  -->  00:00:36.200
Again, just on those Community Editions.
11

11

00:00:36.200  -->  00:00:38.490
And it behaved in a similar manner, in fact,
12

12

00:00:38.490  -->  00:00:40.030
its view of the database schema's
13

13

00:00:40.030  -->  00:00:44.110
slightly better than the Ultimate Edition plugin.
14

14

00:00:46.060  -->  00:00:47.990
So I'm going to introduce both plugins
15

15

00:00:47.990  -->  00:00:49.740
and I've produced separate videos
16

16

00:00:49.740  -->  00:00:52.150
for the Ultimate and Community editions.
17

17

00:00:52.150  -->  00:00:53.780
Now if you're using the Ultimate edition
18

18

00:00:53.780  -->  00:00:55.420
of IntelliJ or PyCharm,
19

19

00:00:55.420  -->  00:00:58.050
then follow the instructions, in the next video,
20

20

00:00:58.050  -->  00:01:01.090
the one titled Ultimate Edition Database View.
21

21

00:01:01.090  -->  00:01:02.960
You can skip the video after that.
22

22

00:01:02.960  -->  00:01:05.060
Because that one's for the Community Edition.
23

23

00:01:05.060  -->  00:01:06.550
And if you're using the Community Edition
24

24

00:01:06.550  -->  00:01:08.280
of IntelliJ or PyCharm,
25

25

00:01:08.280  -->  00:01:10.850
then instead skip the next video
26

26

00:01:10.850  -->  00:01:12.410
and watch the one after that.
27

27

00:01:12.410  -->  00:01:15.990
And that one's called the Community Edition Database Plugin.
28

28

00:01:15.990  -->  00:01:18.510
And once you finished setting up the database,
29

29

00:01:18.510  -->  00:01:20.040
you'll be able to use that
30

30

00:01:20.040  -->  00:01:23.370
and get access to our gooey interface for database access,
31

31

00:01:23.370  -->  00:01:25.710
which is a lot more streamlined
32

32

00:01:25.710  -->  00:01:28.760
and easier to use than the command line.
33

33

00:01:28.760  -->  00:01:30.780
So move forward to the appropriate video.
34

34

00:01:30.780  -->  00:01:33.760
And get started and I'll see you in that video.
