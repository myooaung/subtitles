00:00:04.500  -->  00:00:08.890
Sometimes we need to check more than
just two cases. So looking at the code

2

00:00:08.890  -->  00:00:14.420
from the last video, we're testing to see
if age is greater than equal to 18 on line 5,

3

00:00:14.420  -->  00:00:19.780
and we test the opposite condition,
age less than 18, on line 11.

4

00:00:19.820  -->  00:00:24.420
In both cases, the condition can be either
True or False. If it's True,

5

00:00:24.420  -->  00:00:31.520
the code blocks on lines 6 and 7 and line 12 are executed.
If the condition evaluates to False,

6

00:00:31.520  -->  00:00:36.480
the code in the else block executes.
Python lets us test several conditions

7

00:00:36.480  -->  00:00:41.340
by using elif, so I'll explain a couple
of rules about elif in a moment.

8

00:00:41.340  -->  00:00:45.640
Firstly though, let's see an example of using it.
What I'm going to do is add another condition

9

00:00:45.640  -->  00:00:52.180
to the second if statement. So I'm gonna come
down here to line 12, after line 12,

10

00:00:52.180  -->  00:00:59.160
you could do a backspace there. I'm going to
type elif space age is equal to, that's two

11

00:00:59.160  -->  00:01:05.640
equal signs 900: and on the indented line I'm gonna type print,

12

00:01:05.640  -->  00:01:16.880
in parentheses double quotes,
Sorry, Yoda you die in Return of the Jedi,

13

00:01:16.880  -->  00:01:23.840
and I've left the final else on line 15.
So elif, if you haven't guessed it, is short for else if.

14

00:01:23.860  -->  00:01:28.520
The code now checks to see if age is
less than 18. If it is, the message on

15

00:01:28.539  -->  00:01:33.399
line 12 will be printed. If age isn't
less than 18, Python checks the elif

16

00:01:33.400  -->  00:01:40.020
condition on line 13. So that'll evaluate
to either True or False. If True,

17

00:01:40.020  -->  00:01:43.660
we let Yoda know of his demise. We're assuming
that anyone who's 900 years old must

18

00:01:43.660  -->  00:01:48.620
be Yoda from Star Wars, and if I just
spoiled that movie for you I do apologize.

19

00:01:48.620  -->  00:01:51.640
But moving on, if the age
doesn't equal 900,

20

00:01:51.640  -->  00:01:58.100
the condition evaluates to False and Python
continues with the else on line 15.

21

00:01:58.100  -->  00:02:01.740
Now before I run the program, what I'm going
to do is comment out the first if

22

00:02:01.749  -->  00:02:05.380
statement on lines 5 through 9, and
instead of having to manually go through

23

00:02:05.380  -->  00:02:09.490
each line, most IDEs do have a quick way
of doing that. So in IntelliJ I can just

24

00:02:09.490  -->  00:02:13.460
select the lines I want to comment out.
I'm on Windows, I can do a control

25

00:02:13.460  -->  00:02:18.680
forward slash,
and it's a Cmd / if you're on a Mac

26

00:02:18.680  -->  00:02:23.500
and the Ctrl slash will also work on
Linux. Alright, so that's commented out

27

00:02:23.500  -->  00:02:28.620
and now won't execute. Let's run the
program, and first, I'm going to enter Tim

28

00:02:28.629  -->  00:02:34.200
as my name again, which I've been doing.
Then next we have to enter an age.

29

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:39.000
We've got a few tests to perform, starting with
the value less than 18, so let's try that

30

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:44.540
and I'll do 11, and I'll just put the code
on screen there, so we can see that.

31

00:02:44.540  -->  00:02:49.500
So you can see that's less than 18 that I entered,
11, and the code on line 12 was executed,

32

00:02:49.500  -->  00:02:52.340
and we got that output, and
that's because the condition on line 11

33

00:02:52.359  -->  00:02:56.319
evaluated to a true, and just to be
consistent let's check what happens when

34

00:02:56.320  -->  00:03:04.200
I enter an age of exactly 18. Tim and
18, 18 You're old enough to vote.

35

00:03:04.200  -->  00:03:08.100
Please put an X in the box, and
this time the condition on line 11

36

00:03:08.100  -->  00:03:14.500
evaluated to False. Python then checks
the elif condition, the else if, on line 13.

37

00:03:14.500  -->  00:03:18.960
This also evaluates to False and
therefore, line 14 didn't get executed.

38

00:03:18.960  -->  00:03:23.040
Instead Python skipped to the else block.
There's no more conditions to check and

39

00:03:23.080  -->  00:03:26.720
none of the ones that were checked were
True, so we're left with the else.

40

00:03:26.720  -->  00:03:31.140
Lines 16 and 17 were executed and we get that
message that You're old enough to vote,

41

00:03:31.140  -->  00:03:35.280
and to put an X in the box. And just to
confirm, if we run this again,

42

00:03:35.280  -->  00:03:41.660
if I enter an age that's greater than 18, you should
see the same result. So I put, say 45.

43

00:03:41.660  -->  00:03:46.080
Same result as we just talked about,
when I entered 18.

44

00:03:46.080  -->  00:03:54.480
Alright, so the final test now is to enter 900 to see
whether that works, and you can see there 900,

45

00:03:54.489  -->  00:03:58.449
Sorry Yoda you die in Return of the Jedi.
So we're getting that message and

46

00:03:58.449  -->  00:04:03.760
that's because the elif, else if, for age
is equal to 900, evaluates to True,

47

00:04:03.760  -->  00:04:08.079
and line 14 was executed. So all that would
be much easier to understand if we could

48

00:04:08.080  -->  00:04:13.240
see the computer executing the code, line
by line. Well as it happens we can do that.

49

00:04:13.240  -->  00:04:15.980
In the next couple of videos we're
going to have a look at the debugger

50

00:04:15.980  -->  00:04:20.229
that's built into the IntelliJ IDEs.
We're going to look at the IntelliJ and

51

00:04:20.229  -->  00:04:24.969
PyCharm debugger in the next video. In
the video after that we'll see how to do

52

00:04:24.969  -->  00:04:28.029
the same thing with the debugger that's
built into IDLE. Now if you're using

53

00:04:28.029  -->  00:04:31.340
a different IDE, it probably
has a debugger as well,

54

00:04:31.340  -->  00:04:35.520
but please don't ask us how to use it.
There's literally hundreds of IDEs,

55

00:04:35.520  -->  00:04:38.960
and we've chosen to use the Jetbrains products for this course.

56

00:04:38.960  -->  00:04:42.220
If you use something else, then that's
either because you know how to use it,

57

00:04:42.220  -->  00:04:45.340
or there's someone in your company who does
know. We can't, unfortunately, provide

58

00:04:45.340  -->  00:04:48.640
support for other IDEs, but if it's
IntelliJ support you're after, were quite

59

00:04:48.640  -->  00:04:50.820
happy to help you with that.
So let's move on now,

60

00:04:50.820  -->  00:04:54.140
and I'll see you in the next video.
