00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,740
In this section we're going to look at more of Python's built in sequence types.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,630
We'll start with lists, coming up in the next video.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,710
Before that though, let's learn a little bit more about what a sequence type is.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,690
So we'll start with the documentation.  I'll paste in the link,
and again, it's in the resources section of this video.

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:31,480
So we're gonna be looking at three basic sequence types in this
section.  That's lists, tuples and range objects.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,650
We've already seen some of the most common sequence operations,

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,810
when we looked at strings, in an earlier section.
Although this version of the documentation doesn't include

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,110
str as one of the basic sequence types, they are in fact sequences.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,700
So what do I mean when I say sequence?

10
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,030
So I suggest you bookmark this page in your browser, because you'll find it useful to refer to.

11
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,510
We're going to start by looking at the first of these sequence types, lists, in the next video.
