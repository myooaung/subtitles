00:00:04,720  -->  00:00:08,020
Alright so let's go over the challenge
that I introduced at the end of the

2

00:00:08,020  -->  00:00:12,340
previous video. If you recall, the
challenge was to rewrite the program so

3

00:00:12,340  -->  00:00:17,320
that it tests for a correct guess first.
So to do that we need to start by

4

00:00:17,320  -->  00:00:21,120
changing line six. At the moment it's
checking the guess is not equal

5

00:00:21,120  -->  00:00:25,520
to answer, so we need to change the not equal to become equal to. So we're now checking,

6

00:00:25,520  -->  00:00:29,059
specifically, if guess is equal to
answer, then we're going to change that

7

00:00:29,060  -->  00:00:34,680
if it is. Then I come down here and take
a copy of this code, and I'm going to

8

00:00:34,680  -->  00:00:40,720
paste it under, we indent it on line 7.
So if guess is equal to answer, we're

9

00:00:40,730  -->  00:00:44,140
printing out the message "You've got it
first time", and the code here is going to

10

00:00:44,140  -->  00:00:48,040
remain the same, if guess is less than answer. I'm just going through the process of checking.

11

00:00:48,040  -->  00:00:50,840
In fact, I should really have
just cut that out altogether because I

12

00:00:50,840  -->  00:00:54,800
copied it, but that line is no longer
needed anymore. So I'm going to delete

13

00:00:54,800  -->  00:00:58,040
that, and we're doing that for the
scenario where they haven't got the

14

00:00:58,040  -->  00:01:02,780
answer right. So what we need to do is
remove this else altogether, and we need

15

00:01:02,780  -->  00:01:08,540
to come down here, after line 7, and
go back to the first indentation level

16

00:01:08,540  -->  00:01:13,429
and put an else colon there. And again,
what's happening here if guess is

17

00:01:13,429  -->  00:01:17,780
not equal to answer, then the else
clause gets executed and the code

18

00:01:17,780  -->  00:01:22,159
starting from line 9 will then go
through and get executed. And obviously,

19

00:01:22,159  -->  00:01:26,179
in the case of the guess equaling the
answer, which is the comparison on line

20

00:01:26,179  -->  00:01:31,100
6, if that's the case, only line 7
is going to be executed. So this is

21

00:01:31,100  -->  00:01:34,560
a third way to write the program and it
still does exactly the same thing.

22

00:01:34,560  -->  00:01:38,360
It's just phrased differently, just like you
can do with human languages.

23

00:01:38,360  -->  00:01:42,679
So here we're checking for a correct guess first.
Now it doesn't really matter which way

24

00:01:42,680  -->  00:01:45,860
round you do it. There's no necessarily
correct way of doing it.

25

00:01:45,860  -->  00:01:50,440
We're looking for the result here or for the solution, so if you manage to get the solution, congratulations.

26

00:01:50,440  -->  00:01:54,760
So let's just confirm we've
got this right. We'll just do a quick test.

27

00:01:54,760  -->  00:01:58,320
And firstly, I'll test to see whether
the number is correct, works,

28

00:01:58,320  -->  00:02:05,600
"You got it right first time" which is good. Lets do a
test where it's 1, "Please guess higher".

29

00:02:05,600  -->  00:02:08,880
We'll do 9. You can see that code has
been executed,

30

00:02:08,880  -->  00:02:15,060
and we'll do a test where we're starting off with a
high value, 9, "Please get lower", 1,

31

00:02:15,060  -->  00:02:19,020
"You have not guessed correctly". We'll just do one
more scenario, start with 1 again,

32

00:02:19,020  -->  00:02:23,420
we'll do 5. So clearly the code is still
working. Alright, so do make sure you

33

00:02:23,420  -->  00:02:26,600
test the programme as I've done, even
though I haven't done a complete test,

34

00:02:26,600  -->  00:02:30,060
and in the next video we're going to
start looking at more complex conditions.

35

00:02:30,060  -->  00:02:33,080
See you in the next video.
