00:00:05,020  -->  00:00:06,520
In this video we're going to go ahead
2

2

00:00:06,520  -->  00:00:09,160
and download and install Python or
3

3

00:00:09,160  -->  00:00:11,380
rather get Python 3 working on this
4

4

00:00:11,380  -->  00:00:13,500
computer. Now we don't actually have to
5

5

00:00:13,500  -->  00:00:15,160
download and install anything on most
6

6

00:00:15,160  -->  00:00:17,230
Linux distros and that's because it
7

7

00:00:17,230  -->  00:00:19,360
normally comes pre-installed with both
8

8

00:00:19,360  -->  00:00:21,490
Python 2 which we won't be using in this
9

9

00:00:21,490  -->  00:00:24,130
course and the newer Python 3, so to
10

10

00:00:24,130  -->  00:00:25,810
confirm that till you've got python on
11

11

00:00:25,810  -->  00:00:28,150
your Linux distribution and I'm running
12

12

00:00:28,150  -->  00:00:30,000
a bunty Linux 16.04 in this
13

13

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:32,230
example, just open a terminal or command
14

14

00:00:32,230  -->  00:00:34,080
window I'm going to click on terminal
15

15

00:00:34,080  -->  00:00:38,020
and so you can then type Python to see
16

16

00:00:38,020  -->  00:00:39,040
whether something comes up and you can
17

17

00:00:39,040  -->  00:00:40,270
see in my case I haven't actually
18

18

00:00:40,270  -->  00:00:42,880
installed anything but Python 2 was
19

19

00:00:42,880  -->  00:00:45,640
installed as a default program with this
20

20

00:00:45,640  -->  00:00:48,970
version of Ubuntu Linux. So version 2 as
21

21

00:00:48,970  -->  00:00:50,140
I mentioned isn't what we're going to be
22

22

00:00:50,140  -->  00:00:51,880
using in this course, so I'm going to do
23

23

00:00:51,880  -->  00:00:54,790
a ctrl D to exit out of that. The other
24

24

00:00:54,790  -->  00:00:56,410
thing we can check it is we can type
25

25

00:00:56,410  -->  00:00:58,480
Python and then the number 3 on the end
26

26

00:00:58,480  -->  00:01:01,480
without any spaces press enter and that
27

27

00:01:01,480  -->  00:01:03,310
also shows that we've got Python 3
28

28

00:01:03,310  -->  00:01:05,370
installed as well. So you can see there's
29

29

00:01:05,370  -->  00:01:07,900
two separate versions that are already installed
30

30

00:01:07,900  -->  00:01:10,750
meaning that unlike the Windows and Mac
31

31

00:01:10,750  -->  00:01:11,970
versions, we don't need to do any
32

32

00:01:11,970  -->  00:01:14,280
installation, we can use the version of
33

33

00:01:14,280  -->  00:01:16,990
Python that is already installed.
34

34

00:01:16,990  -->  00:01:19,030
Now Python does get updated and in fact if
35

35

00:01:19,030  -->  00:01:21,460
you went to the website right now for
36

36

00:01:21,460  -->  00:01:23,760
python.org, you'd see that the latest
37

37

00:01:23,760  -->  00:01:26,280
version is python 3 point six point two,
38

38

00:01:26,280  -->  00:01:28,350
so we've got a slightly older version
39

39

00:01:28,350  -->  00:01:30,070
but look it'll work just fine in this
40

40

00:01:30,070  -->  00:01:32,790
course and there's no sort of reason not
41

41

00:01:32,790  -->  00:01:35,560
to rush an upgrade and just a warning
42

42

00:01:35,560  -->  00:01:37,060
actually if you are thinking about doing
43

43

00:01:37,060  -->  00:01:39,240
that, be careful because python is
44

44

00:01:39,240  -->  00:01:42,150
heavily used within the GUI of many
45

45

00:01:42,150  -->  00:01:44,170
Linux distributions. So if you
46

46

00:01:44,170  -->  00:01:45,900
accidentally uninstalled Python or
47

47

00:01:45,900  -->  00:01:48,360
start you know installing different
48

48

00:01:48,360  -->  00:01:50,130
versions and so on and so forth you can
49

49

00:01:50,130  -->  00:01:52,110
get yourself into a situation where
50

50

00:01:52,110  -->  00:01:54,330
Linux won't boot or at least I won't
51

51

00:01:54,330  -->  00:01:55,810
have a GUI interface and that can be
52

52

00:01:55,810  -->  00:01:57,850
really difficult to recover from. So for
53

53

00:01:57,850  -->  00:01:59,790
that reason our recommendation is just
54

54

00:01:59,790  -->  00:02:02,560
to stick with the version of Python that
55

55

00:02:02,560  -->  00:02:04,990
is already in your Linux distribution,
56

56

00:02:04,990  -->  00:02:06,570
so long as it's three points something in
57

57

00:02:06,570  -->  00:02:08,500
my case you can see I've got three point
58

58

00:02:08,500  -->  00:02:10,560
five point two, we're actually good to go.
59

59

00:02:10,560  -->  00:02:12,760
Alright so I'm going to do a control d
60

60

00:02:12,760  -->  00:02:15,550
to get out of that, the other thing we
61

61

00:02:15,550  -->  00:02:18,010
need is something called idle which is
62

62

00:02:18,010  -->  00:02:18,850
an editor that
63

63

00:02:18,850  -->  00:02:20,230
we're going to be using at least early
64

64

00:02:20,230  -->  00:02:23,440
in the course to test some Python code
65

65

00:02:23,440  -->  00:02:26,350
out. So we can type in idle,
66

66

00:02:26,350  -->  00:02:29,140
idle and that doesn't work because it
67

67

00:02:29,140  -->  00:02:30,790
hasn't been installed and that would
68

68

00:02:30,790  -->  00:02:32,560
have been the older version that suits
69

69

00:02:32,560  -->  00:02:35,980
Python 2 and Python 3 would use something
70

70

00:02:35,980  -->  00:02:37,750
called idle 3 but you can see that's
71

71

00:02:37,750  -->  00:02:39,760
also not installed, so we need to go
72

72

00:02:39,760  -->  00:02:41,170
through the process of installing that
73

73

00:02:41,170  -->  00:02:43,540
for a Ubuntu Linux, so to do that I'm
74

74

00:02:43,540  -->  00:02:47,440
going to type in sudo apt - get a space
75

75

00:02:47,440  -->  00:02:49,240
between those two words space install
76

76

00:02:49,240  -->  00:02:55,420
space idle3 or idle3 press enter,
77

77

00:02:55,420  -->  00:03:01,800
I'm going to type my password, I can top it.
78

78

00:03:01,800  -->  00:03:04,990
Okay, so now go through and it's actually
79

79

00:03:04,990  -->  00:03:06,550
asked if I want to install it so I'm
80

80

00:03:06,550  -->  00:03:09,100
going to push yes or top y and press enter
81

81

00:03:09,100  -->  00:03:12,070
it's going to go ahead and install idle3
82

82

00:03:12,070  -->  00:03:14,230
for us and you'll be seeing how to use
83

83

00:03:14,230  -->  00:03:17,020
that program in the next video. Now it's
84

84

00:03:17,020  -->  00:03:18,580
complete as you can see there, so I can
85

85

00:03:18,580  -->  00:03:23,800
then just go ahead and type idle 3 and
86

86

00:03:23,800  -->  00:03:25,120
you can see that's now popped up a
87

87

00:03:25,120  -->  00:03:28,570
Python shell and within that window now
88

88

00:03:28,570  -->  00:03:30,370
we can start typing some Python commands
89

89

00:03:30,370  -->  00:03:32,440
but I'm going to finish the video here
90

90

00:03:32,440  -->  00:03:34,360
now. In the next video we'll go ahead and
91

91

00:03:34,360  -->  00:03:36,640
start using this Python shell to type in
92

92

00:03:36,640  -->  00:03:40,890
a few commands so see you in the next video.
