00:00:05,420  -->  00:00:12,610
so in this video I'm gonna do is install
the Python timezone package pytz
2

2

00:00:12,610  -->  00:00:17,150
and will show you how to do it for various platforms so first platform I wanna show you
3

3

00:00:17,150  -->  00:00:22,770
how to get this working on is windows
so what you need to do is open a command
4

4

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:25,890
prompt and when you open a command
prompt you should have something looks
5

5

00:00:25,890  -->  00:00:32,370
something like that and once it opens type pip3 install as you can see on the screen
6

6

00:00:32,370  -->  00:00:38,010
and one other thing to note is that you
need to open or you need to
7

7

00:00:38,010  -->  00:00:41,530
run the command prompt as an
administrator now on Windows 8 and 10 you
8

8

00:00:41,530  -->  00:00:45,650
can do this by pressing the Windows key
and x and choose command prompt admin from
9

9

00:00:45,650  -->  00:00:50,420
the list and in windows 7 and Vista type cmd
at the start menu search box and
10

10

00:00:50,420  -->  00:00:54,470
when a result appears right click and
choose Run as Administrator either way
11

11

00:00:54,470  -->  00:00:58,350
you get a screen that pops up similar to
this with a black background and on
12

12

00:00:58,350  -->  00:01:03,850
that screen you need to type pip3 intall
pytz and that
13

13

00:01:03,850  -->  00:01:09,520
will install the Python timezone library
into your system so at this point then
14

14

00:01:09,520  -->  00:01:13,490
press ENTER and once you press enter you
should get the following screen pop up
15

15

00:01:13,490  -->  00:01:18,820
and you can see it says collecting pytz starts downloading and you
16

16

00:01:18,820  -->  00:01:23,390
should find it will start downloading and
installing the Python timezone
17

17

00:01:23,390  -->  00:01:27,840
library and then once that's finished you get
that screen or something similar
18

18

00:01:27,840  -->  00:01:32,350
you can see it successfully installed pytz
and the version number which may end
19

19

00:01:32,350  -->  00:01:33,460
up being different
20

20

00:01:33,460  -->  00:01:37,770
to what you can see on the screen
and noticed in the bottom in gold you've got
21

21

00:01:37,770  -->  00:01:42,600
your using pip version 7 however version 8 is available so depending on which
22

22

00:01:42,600  -->  00:01:45,960
version you got you may get a message
similar to that you can safely ignore
23

23

00:01:45,960  -->  00:01:50,630
that because what we've done is we've
used the version of pip to download and install
24

24

00:01:50,630  -->  00:01:55,770
the right Python timezone library so if you do get that no problems you can
25

25

00:01:55,770  -->  00:02:00,050
continue knowing that you've actually
installed so at this point if your on Windows
26

26

00:02:00,050  -->  00:02:02,960
and you follow these instructions you
should have the Python timezone library
27

27

00:02:02,960  -->  00:02:06,590
installed and you can move on to
the next video where we can start actually
28

28

00:02:06,590  -->  00:02:11,710
using it the next operating system
I'm going to show you is Linux so if your running
29

29

00:02:11,710  -->  00:02:17,100
Ubuntu Linux here are the commands now just in
addition to that what I didn't show you
30

30

00:02:17,100  -->  00:02:18,650
in the previous video
31

31

00:02:18,650  -->  00:02:23,060
was how to install pip as
well as you may need to install pip on your
32

32

00:02:23,060  -->  00:02:28,280
Linux distro because it's not installed
by default so what you need to do there is
33

33

00:02:28,280  -->  00:02:33,530
open a terminal window as you would normally
open in Ubuntu and you should see something
34

34

00:02:33,530  -->  00:02:40,550
like this and typing....
35

35

00:02:40,550  -->  00:02:45,410
....so you do that and then press
36

36

00:02:45,410  -->  00:02:49,330
ENTER and you will find that it will start
downloading and you get something like this
37

37

00:02:49,330  -->  00:02:54,470
and you can see that its gone ahead and
downloaded the packages and then install
38

38

00:02:54,470  -->  00:02:58,650
it and on the bottom the last command
you can see...
39

39

00:02:58,650  -->  00:03:02,690
....and that just
confirms that were actually running the
40

40

00:03:02,690  -->  00:03:06,600
right version of pip so you have to do
that if you're running Ubuntu and if
41

41

00:03:06,600  -->  00:03:10,710
you're running another version another
distro of Linux you need to do is use
42

42

00:03:10,710  -->  00:03:16,530
the appropriate package manager installation
mechanism that is use to install it so
43

43

00:03:16,530  -->  00:03:21,210
that's installing pip and you need to
use the pip tool which incidentally
44

44

00:03:21,210  -->  00:03:25,410
again stands for pip install packages
so that we can install the Python timezone
45

45

00:03:25,410  -->  00:03:26,590
library
46

46

00:03:26,590  -->  00:03:31,020
now we've done that open a new commandant
or we can use the same one and you get
47

47

00:03:31,020  -->  00:03:35,440
something like this and type this
command so you can see I have type...
48

48

00:03:35,440  -->  00:03:42,280
...which again is
49

49

00:03:42,280  -->  00:03:46,630
the Python timezone package that
will go ahead and install that so
50

50

00:03:46,630  -->  00:03:50,520
once you've done that press ENTER and
then you get the following screen so you
51

51

00:03:50,520  -->  00:03:53,680
can see it's downloaded the relevant
file and the version again may be
52

52

00:03:53,680  -->  00:03:57,870
different depending when you're running
this and you can see it say installing collected
53

53

00:03:57,870  -->  00:04:02,630
packages pytz and successfully install
pytz cleaning up and you back to the
54

54

00:04:02,630  -->  00:04:06,430
command prompt at that point you've
have now got that installed and you can
55

55

00:04:06,430  -->  00:04:10,770
continue on now to the next video if your a
Linux user and we can start using this
56

56

00:04:10,770  -->  00:04:16,040
Python timezone packaged ok last but
certainly not least is Mac users I'm
57

57

00:04:16,040  -->  00:04:19,540
going to show you that live and it's
because I'm running this on a Mac so what
58

58

00:04:19,540  -->  00:04:24,090
you need to do is open a terminal window so
type terminal press
59

59

00:04:24,090  -->  00:04:28,320
ENTER then to get it installed this is a
assuming that you've installed pip3
60

60

00:04:28,320  -->  00:04:32,130
you should have done that based on
the previous videos if you
61

61

00:04:32,130  -->  00:04:38,580
haven't done that go ahead and do
that then type....
62

62

00:04:38,580  -->  00:04:41,550
.....
63

63

00:04:41,550  -->  00:04:47,480
....press enter and type in the regular password
64

64

00:04:47,480  -->  00:04:54,670
to your account and press enter and you should find it will
go ahead and install it for us and you
65

65

00:04:54,670  -->  00:04:57,860
may get that warning message but you can
safely ignore there is no problems there
66

66

00:04:57,860  -->  00:05:02,070
the main thing was that downloading as you can see installing
67

67

00:05:02,070  -->  00:05:08,940
collected packages pytz successfully
installed pytz-2015.7 so at
68

68

00:05:08,940  -->  00:05:12,040
that point we've now got the Python timezone library and we will be able to use
69

69

00:05:12,040  -->  00:05:16,050
that in the next video so that's it
that's how to go about installing the
70

70

00:05:16,050  -->  00:05:20,220
library and you be able to use this
mechanism for any library that you install
71

71

00:05:20,220  -->  00:05:23,400
in the future obviously just change the
name of the library that you want to
72

72

00:05:23,400  -->  00:05:26,820
install now that you've got the tools
installed on your computer and you can
73

73

00:05:26,820  -->  00:05:31,010
see a mechanism of doing that so I'm gonna end
the video here in the next video we are going
74

74

00:05:31,010  -->  00:05:35,290
to start making use of this some library
that we just installed so we'll see you
75

75

00:05:35,290  -->  00:05:35,830
in the next video
