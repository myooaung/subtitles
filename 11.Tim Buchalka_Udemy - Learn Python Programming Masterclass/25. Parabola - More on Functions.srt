00:00:05,500  -->  00:00:10,360
in the previous video we had a quick look
at Python functions and we saw how we can
2

2

00:00:10,360  -->  00:00:14,370
use them to perform actions or
return results and of course sometimes
3

3

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:18,550
do both of those things now our function
to print text centered on a 80 page
4

4

00:00:18,550  -->  00:00:23,080
character screen was modified to just
return the text to be printed to
5

5

00:00:23,080  -->  00:00:26,980
demonstrate how a function returns a
result with the return statement and
6

6

00:00:26,980  -->  00:00:31,400
also that there is often more than one
way to do something and deciding what to
7

7

00:00:31,400  -->  00:00:35,390
use or which way to use is part really
of the programs designed so functions are
8

8

00:00:35,390  -->  00:00:40,240
incredibly useful to allow the same
block of code to be used over and over
9

9

00:00:40,240  -->  00:00:46,550
again now they make programs easier to
design by breaking down the programming
10

10

00:00:46,550  -->  00:00:50,940
challenge up into manageable tasks and
the use of functions can make programs
11

11

00:00:50,940  -->  00:00:54,710
more reliable by providing code
blocks that can be thoroughly tested to
12

12

00:00:54,710  -->  00:00:58,630
make sure they perform their function
reliably now these advantages also
13

13

00:00:58,630  -->  00:01:03,040
come from using object-oriented
programming and classes and class
14

14

00:01:03,040  -->  00:01:07,260
methods are just functions so it's
important that you understand functions
15

15

00:01:07,260  -->  00:01:11,540
before we move on to object oriented
programming in the next section now I'm
16

16

00:01:11,540  -->  00:01:14,640
gonna start with some maths here but it's
not going to be anything too complicated
17

17

00:01:14,640  -->  00:01:18,170
so don't be too worried now parabola is a
very interesting shape
18

18

00:01:18,920  -->  00:01:24,070
parabolic reflectors can be used to
focus light or sound and are also used to
19

19

00:01:24,070  -->  00:01:29,400
focus the satellite signals used for
modern TV broadcast you can throw a ball in the
20

20

00:01:29,400  -->  00:01:34,250
air it follows a parabolic path as it
rises and falls back to earth now what I'm going
21

21

00:01:34,250  -->  00:01:38,790
to do is create a very simple equation
for a parabola so what we're going to do
22

22

00:01:38,790  -->  00:01:43,010
is so what I've done is I've created a new
project and I've also created a new
23

23

00:01:43,010  -->  00:01:47,890
python file so let's start with a
definition of a parabola functions so
24

24

00:01:47,890  -->  00:01:52,780
we're gonna type.....
25

25

00:01:52,780  -->  00:02:02,470
.....
26

26

00:02:04,080  -->  00:02:22,250
.....and that's
27

27

00:02:22,250  -->  00:02:27,140
it so you can see it's a very simplest
equation for parabola is y = x
28

28

00:02:27,140  -->  00:02:32,170
squared so X times X that I've done
on line 2 and so I've created a simple
29

29

00:02:32,170  -->  00:02:36,210
function to return the value of y for various values of x so if we run this
30

30

00:02:36,210  -->  00:02:43,830
we get to see you all the values of y
printed out and if you scroll up and
31

31

00:02:43,830  -->  00:02:46,630
down as you can see here right down the bottom
you can scroll right to the top
32

32

00:02:46,630  -->  00:02:52,050
and this is sort of a shape in the
numbers but just do that again you
33

33

00:02:52,050  -->  00:02:55,110
can see how the numbers sort of going down smaller
and go up again so its a bit of a shape
34

34

00:02:55,110  -->  00:02:56,320
their
35

35

00:02:56,320  -->  00:03:03,360
so its an interesting phenomenon with parabola
but it will be much nicer if we could plot them on a graph
36

36

00:03:03,360  -->  00:03:06,120
because that would actually make a lot of sense
to do it that way so why don't we do that
37

37

00:03:06,120  -->  00:03:09,980
why don't we continue on from there and do
that so i'm gonna make some modifications
38

38

00:03:09,980  -->  00:03:15,150
to this file now so that we can do that
so we leave the existing functionality we
39

39

00:03:15,150  -->  00:03:19,450
got in there but I'm gonna come back up here
and we're going to use tkinter
40

40

00:03:19,450  -->  00:03:29,040
again so come up with a try to start with you see this a number of times now so.....
41

41

00:03:29,040  -->  00:03:36,390
....
42

42

00:03:37,360  -->  00:03:45,220
.....we are going start on
line 7 we leave our parabola method their
43

43

00:03:45,820  -->  00:03:53,610
we are gonna take out this for loop now because actually we are gonna leave that because we are gonna modify it slowly so lets leave that their so on line 11 I'm gonna
44

44

00:03:53,610  -->  00:04:03,820
to start a main window for tkinter so....
45

45

00:04:03,820  -->  00:04:07,040
.....
46

46

00:04:07,880  -->  00:04:13,690
.....
47

47

00:04:14,420  -->  00:04:22,700
....and you can make yours
much bigger if you like just change that
48

48

00:04:22,700  -->  00:04:26,840
to the resolution of your monitor to a
larger value we didn't know how big to
49

49

00:04:26,840  -->  00:04:30,950
make it because we wanted to use values
that worked on pretty well all computers and
50

50

00:04:30,950  -->  00:04:34,510
that's why we left it at 640 by 480 but
feel free to increase
51

51

00:04:34,510  -->  00:04:41,280
those dimensions to larger number to suit
your computer so let's also create a
52

52

00:04:41,280  -->  00:04:55,400
canvas so.....
53

53

00:04:55,400  -->  00:05:04,010
.....
54

54

00:05:04,010  -->  00:05:07,010
....
55

55

00:05:08,310  -->  00:05:18,900
....so the program just creates a canvas and adds
it to the grid window manager it fills the
56

56

00:05:18,900  -->  00:05:24,750
Windows so if we just run this is to confirm
what its actually doing and it is not going to work
57

57

00:05:24,750  -->  00:05:32,390
until I end the main loop call so.... so I just remove the indent
58

58

00:05:32,390  -->  00:05:41,760
....try that again and it is running now and it's a
very basic window as you can see so the program
59

59

00:05:41,760  -->  00:05:47,030
creates a canvas and adds it to the grid window manage as you can see it fills the window and that way
60

60

00:05:47,030  -->  00:05:50,200
we don't have to worry about which
manager to use as its going to be the only
61

61

00:05:50,200  -->  00:05:54,070
thing in the window so if you want to
the pack manager would also do this as well
62

62

00:05:54,070  -->  00:05:58,820
but we chose grid because we want to
briefly add another canvas later now
63

63

00:05:58,820  -->  00:06:01,930
interestingly enough if you checked
out the documentation links from the
64

64

00:06:01,930  -->  00:06:05,890
tkinter section you may have actually come
across canvas now it lets you draw basic
65

65

00:06:05,890  -->  00:06:10,690
shapes such as lines rectangles and
circles and you can also place text and
66

66

00:06:10,690  -->  00:06:12,220
images on a canvas
67

67

00:06:12,220  -->  00:06:16,060
now the canvas coordinate system has 00 at
the top left
68

68

00:06:16,060  -->  00:06:17,830
whereas a normal graph
69

69

00:06:17,830  -->  00:06:21,940
have the origin 00 in the middle so it
also be nice to have the X&Y axis
70

70

00:06:21,940  -->  00:06:26,130
displayed on the graph now we can find the
midpoint of the screen by dividing the
71

71

00:06:26,130  -->  00:06:30,730
width and height by 2 and a canvas can
have its origin shifted by using the
72

72

00:06:30,730  -->  00:06:34,660
scroll region option now we want to
shift it right by half the width
73

73

00:06:34,660  -->  00:06:39,210
bringing 0 from the left hand edge in to the
middle and also shifted it down by half the
74

74

00:06:39,210  -->  00:06:43,340
height so this is something we will want
to do when we try to plot graphs on a
75

75

00:06:43,340  -->  00:06:49,270
canvas or draw axis function would be useful
for that purpose so lets defined that method now
76

76

00:06:49,270  -->  00:06:56,770
I'm going to close it down for now because we are finish with that come up here after parabola method and we define another
77

77

00:06:56,770  -->  00:07:05,040
one leaving two spaces between the other
function so as defined......and what I'll do
78

78

00:07:05,040  -->  00:07:09,490
is type this out and go through what we have done....
79

79

00:07:12,060  -->  00:07:15,890
......
80

80

00:07:17,410  -->  00:07:24,370
......
81

81

00:07:25,640  -->  00:07:41,850
.....
82

82

00:07:43,880  -->  00:08:13,530
.....
83

83

00:08:15,050  -->  00:08:18,130
......
84

84

00:08:18,130  -->  00:08:31,350
.....
85

85

00:08:31,350  -->  00:08:38,890
...so the first thing
that draw axis function does
86

86

00:08:38,890  -->  00:08:43,160
is called the canvas update method and it does that to make sure that we can actually
87

87

00:08:43,160  -->  00:08:47,890
access the width and height now we did
mention this that when we used
88

88

00:08:47,890  -->  00:08:54,480
winfo width and winfo height methods at the end of the calculator
challenge that you do need to do that
89

89

00:08:54,480  -->  00:08:55,700
you need to call canvas
90

90

00:08:55,700  -->  00:09:00,090
.update to make sure that those values
are available for you so we use them on the
91

91

00:09:00,090  -->  00:09:03,200
main window that time but actually
every widget is a window and has those
92

92

00:09:03,200  -->  00:09:04,400
methods available
93

93

00:09:04,400  -->  00:09:08,840
now the function that we have designed just divides those values by two to get the
94

94

00:09:08,840  -->  00:09:13,860
values for the X&Y origin now the scroll
region is just a box with one corner at
95

95

00:09:13,860  -->  00:09:19,980
minus x origin minus y origin and the
other and X origin y origin for example if you had a
96

96

00:09:19,980  -->  00:09:24,080
10 centimeters square piece of paper in
front of you with its top left hand in
97

97

00:09:24,080  -->  00:09:27,920
the middle of your desk bringing it up five
centimeters and left five centimeters
98

98

00:09:27,920  -->  00:09:32,620
replace the center of the paper in the
middle of your desk and that's exactly what
99

99

00:09:32,620  -->  00:09:36,060
we're doing here but on the screen so the
function after does that then draws a
100

100

00:09:36,060  -->  00:09:40,640
horizontal line for the x axis and a
vertical line for the Y axis so that's
101

101

00:09:40,640  -->  00:09:44,480
essentially what draw axis is
actually doing so when we call the draw
102

102

00:09:44,480  -->  00:09:49,350
axis functions we are going to reposition the
canvases origin and draw the X&Y axes on
103

103

00:09:49,350  -->  00:09:53,520
the canvas so we need to do in order to
do that we need to add a call to it just
104

104

00:09:53,520  -->  00:09:58,210
below what we've added the grid down here we do that on line 28 so....
105

105

00:09:58,210  -->  00:10:08,210
...so now we do that we run this we
should see the canvas divided into four
106

106

00:10:08,210  -->  00:10:10,010
quadrants by the X&Y axes
107

107

00:10:10,010  -->  00:10:13,010
lets give that a run
108

108

00:10:18,110  -->  00:10:23,170
if you're running on a Mac you might find you get a
result like this and it may happen on
109

109

00:10:23,170  -->  00:10:28,390
a Linux or Windows as well if that happens
the reason for its probably self-evident
110

110

00:10:28,390  -->  00:10:33,480
as I move this over notice on line 17
and 18 I used fill = white well in this
111

111

00:10:33,480  -->  00:10:39,310
case on my Mac the background is white so of
course drawing some lines is going to be
112

112

00:10:39,310  -->  00:10:42,310
drawn white on white which we cannot see
so if you are not seeing any results
113

113

00:10:42,910  -->  00:10:48,890
change the color so fill = white lets
change that to black we should now have black lines on a
114

114

00:10:48,890  -->  00:10:56,120
white background and thats should work for us so lets try that we can see now that
115

115

00:10:56,120  -->  00:11:01,450
is actually worked as we can see there
and the purpose was to divide into four
116

116

00:11:01,450  -->  00:11:05,810
quadrants the canvas and we've done that
it's been divided into four quadrants by
117

117

00:11:05,810  -->  00:11:11,330
the x and y axis so to draw graphs we want to plot
single points which a canvas doesn't
118

118

00:11:11,330  -->  00:11:15,860
provide a method for but a line of length one
will do so just a bit of important distinction
119

119

00:11:15,860  -->  00:11:20,250
so you can't actually plot individual
points on a canvas but by making their
120

120

00:11:20,250  -->  00:11:23,450
line length of 1 it will effectively do the
same thing so that's what we're gonna do
121

121

00:11:23,450  -->  00:11:27,600
so that also sounds like something you are gonna do a lot that's drawing those
122

122

00:11:27,600  -->  00:11:31,320
single points and then a create a
function called plot that will take
123

123

00:11:31,320  -->  00:11:36,620
a canvas as its first parameter followed by the
X&Y coordinates of the point to be
124

124

00:11:36,620  -->  00:11:44,160
plotted so lets go ahead and create that
going to come down here so we are gonna define a
125

125

00:11:44,160  -->  00:11:50,020
function plot and again the parameters
firstly is the canvas and also the X&Y
126

126

00:11:50,020  -->  00:11:54,710
coordinates where we want to plot and in
terms of what we need to do is gonna be....
127

127

00:11:54,710  -->  00:12:02,000
....
128

128

00:12:02,000  -->  00:12:10,330
...and lets got with a different color this time
129

129

00:12:10,330  -->  00:12:13,740
we are going with red so we should be able to see red on a white
130

130

00:12:13,740  -->  00:12:17,250
background again substitute the color if
appropriate
131

131

00:12:17,250  -->  00:12:20,880
if your getting a different result on your computer so that's all the plot needs to do
132

132

00:12:20,880  -->  00:12:24,370
and what would then do is change that so
instead of printing the output is going
133

133

00:12:24,370  -->  00:12:27,370
to actually plot the points instead so type...
134

134

00:12:28,060  -->  00:12:34,000
....ok so lets actually
run that this time
135

135

00:12:39,610  -->  00:12:43,620
now lets get a close up there you
may be can't see that very well because of
136

136

00:12:43,620  -->  00:12:47,940
the video but you can see that the
axis are printed and what you really
137

137

00:12:47,940  -->  00:12:51,730
can't see a lot of detail about is
because the points are very far apart
138

138

00:12:51,730  -->  00:12:57,140
but there is actually a vague parabola plotted
their you can sort of see that starting down here
139

139

00:12:57,140  -->  00:13:00,990
and moving down but again it's not really
the best example but with that said
140

140

00:13:00,990  -->  00:13:05,260
there's really two things wrong with the
graph firstly its upside down and second
141

141

00:13:05,260  -->  00:13:10,150
the values of y go to 900 which is far
more than half of the 480 that we have
142

142

00:13:10,150  -->  00:13:13,380
available in windows so in other words
were trying to draw off the screen both
143

143

00:13:13,380  -->  00:13:17,270
problems as it turns out can be solved
pretty easily and what we gonna do is make
144

144

00:13:17,270  -->  00:13:17,900
a change
145

145

00:13:17,900  -->  00:13:24,200
firstly I'm going to close this down on line out with our
parabola method currently we've got y
146

146

00:13:24,200  -->  00:13:30,580
= x * x if we change that to x * x / 100 that's gonna make sure that things
147

147

00:13:30,580  -->  00:13:34,140
are fit in that area it prevents the
y values from running off the screen so
148

148

00:13:34,140  -->  00:13:39,570
that's half the variable but we also then we want to go down to where we are calling plot here on line 36 and if we use the
149

149

00:13:39,570  -->  00:13:43,710
negative value of y negative y that
should flip the graph over and that's
150

150

00:13:43,710  -->  00:13:48,200
because the canvas coordinates system has
the y axis starting at the top with
151

151

00:13:48,200  -->  00:13:51,820
increasing numbers moving down the
screen whereas traditional grappling plotting
152

152

00:13:51,820  -->  00:13:55,810
has increasing y value moving up from
the axis so lets try running that again
153

153

00:13:55,810  -->  00:14:04,830
...so you can see we got a little bit different output this time its a bit more clearer but the parabolic
154

154

00:14:04,830  -->  00:14:08,650
function isn't really doing all it can
do thought at the moment the program needs to loop
155

155

00:14:08,650  -->  00:14:12,680
through the values it returns in order
to print a parabola so wouldn't it be more
156

156

00:14:12,680  -->  00:14:16,710
useful if the function plotted the points
no need to tell how big
157

157

00:14:16,710  -->  00:14:20,710
the parabola should be and give it a canvas to
draw on so we'll look at doing that and
158

158

00:14:20,710  -->  00:14:24,010
also fixing up some of these warnings
that you can see on the screen in the
159

159

00:14:24,010  -->  00:14:24,290
