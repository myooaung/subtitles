00:00:05,400  -->  00:00:06,520
<v Instructor>Alright, so we're on the way</v>
2

2

00:00:06,520  -->  00:00:08,920
to create a scrollable list box
3

3

00:00:08,920  -->  00:00:11,740
that can populate itself from our database.
4

4

00:00:11,740  -->  00:00:14,660
Now, we got the scrollable bit working in the previous video
5

5

00:00:14,660  -->  00:00:16,420
so the next step now is to look at getting
6

6

00:00:16,420  -->  00:00:18,980
the data into the lists.
7

7

00:00:18,980  -->  00:00:21,720
Now, we're gonna be creating another subclass soon
8

8

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:23,610
but first though, let's see what we have to do
9

9

00:00:23,610  -->  00:00:25,450
to populate the list boxes
10

10

00:00:25,450  -->  00:00:27,760
and allow clicking on an item in one list
11

11

00:00:27,760  -->  00:00:30,160
to cause another list to update.
12

12

00:00:30,160  -->  00:00:32,700
Now, the artist list is the simplest
13

13

00:00:32,700  -->  00:00:34,330
because that doesn't really update
14

14

00:00:34,330  -->  00:00:36,060
when something else is clicked,
15

15

00:00:36,060  -->  00:00:37,730
so we just execute a query
16

16

00:00:37,730  -->  00:00:41,320
and then insert the query result into the list box.
17

17

00:00:41,320  -->  00:00:45,270
So, to do that let's go to the artist list box
18

18

00:00:45,270  -->  00:00:46,900
and the configuration code here,
19

19

00:00:46,900  -->  00:00:50,060
below that artist list dot config line
20

20

00:00:50,990  -->  00:00:53,950
and on there we're gonna type in four,
21

21

00:00:53,950  -->  00:00:58,650
artist in, conn dot execute
22

22

00:00:58,650  -->  00:01:00,700
and the SQL query in double quotes will be
23

23

00:01:00,700  -->  00:01:03,370
select, space, artists dot name,
24

24

00:01:04,820  -->  00:01:08,740
from artists, order by,
25

25

00:01:10,090  -->  00:01:14,160
artists dot name,
26

26

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:16,000
colon and then we're gonna do
27

27

00:01:16,000  -->  00:01:19,500
artist list dot insert
28

28

00:01:20,570  -->  00:01:23,420
and it's gonna be TK inter dot END
29

29

00:01:23,420  -->  00:01:25,510
in upper case, comma, space,
30

30

00:01:25,510  -->  00:01:30,240
then artist zero in left square brackets
31

31

00:01:30,240  -->  00:01:31,920
and right parentheses.
32

32

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:32,990
So, let's actually try that.
33

33

00:01:32,990  -->  00:01:36,570
We'll try running this to see what happens.
34

34

00:01:37,930  -->  00:01:41,320
And we can see that very nicely.
35

35

00:01:41,320  -->  00:01:42,150
Let's move this out of the way
36

36

00:01:42,150  -->  00:01:43,050
so that we can see the code.
37

37

00:01:43,050  -->  00:01:46,270
We got the artists showing in the first list box,
38

38

00:01:46,270  -->  00:01:47,740
in the artist list box on the screen.
39

39

00:01:47,740  -->  00:01:48,970
So, that's pretty cool
40

40

00:01:48,970  -->  00:01:50,190
and obviously, I'm scrolling through that
41

41

00:01:50,190  -->  00:01:52,230
and that's working quite nicely.
42

42

00:01:52,230  -->  00:01:53,840
So, the next step that is to respond
43

43

00:01:53,840  -->  00:01:55,220
to one of these artists being clicked.
44

44

00:01:55,220  -->  00:01:57,560
At the moment that we can click it but nothing's happening.
45

45

00:01:57,560  -->  00:01:59,420
So, let's close that down.
46

46

00:01:59,420  -->  00:02:01,980
So, what do we need to do to get that to work?
47

47

00:02:01,980  -->  00:02:03,540
Well, we've seen how to cause a function
48

48

00:02:03,540  -->  00:02:06,030
to be executed when a button's clicked
49

49

00:02:06,030  -->  00:02:09,090
way back in the black jack game in section 11.
50

50

00:02:09,090  -->  00:02:10,860
Now, list boxes actually don't have
51

51

00:02:10,860  -->  00:02:13,040
an explicit command property,
52

52

00:02:13,040  -->  00:02:14,440
but they do have a number of events
53

53

00:02:14,440  -->  00:02:17,010
that we can bind functions to.
54

54

00:02:17,010  -->  00:02:20,100
Now, the one that we want is here is a virtual event
55

55

00:02:20,100  -->  00:02:21,850
called list box select,
56

56

00:02:21,850  -->  00:02:24,780
which the list box receives when an item's selected.
57

57

00:02:24,780  -->  00:02:27,060
And the good news is that we can bind our own function
58

58

00:02:27,060  -->  00:02:29,440
or method to that virtual event,
59

59

00:02:29,440  -->  00:02:32,600
so our function's called when the even happens.
60

60

00:02:32,600  -->  00:02:34,450
So, let's have a look at adding that.
61

61

00:02:34,450  -->  00:02:38,240
So, we're gonna add that below the SQL code
62

62

00:02:38,240  -->  00:02:40,510
and that's gonna be artist list
63

63

00:02:40,510  -->  00:02:41,350
dot bind
64

64

00:02:42,880  -->  00:02:45,820
then parentheses, single quote,
65

65

00:02:45,820  -->  00:02:48,150
and I want two less than signs,
66

66

00:02:48,150  -->  00:02:50,470
then list box selects
67

67

00:02:50,470  -->  00:02:54,370
and then we have two greater thans signs
68

68

00:02:54,370  -->  00:02:55,690
and then a single quote,
69

69

00:02:55,690  -->  00:02:57,710
comma, space,
70

70

00:02:57,710  -->  00:02:59,850
get_albums,
71

71

00:02:59,850  -->  00:03:01,490
then right parentheses.
72

72

00:03:01,490  -->  00:03:02,560
And obviously, we're getting an error there
73

73

00:03:02,560  -->  00:03:04,800
because we need to write that.
74

74

00:03:04,800  -->  00:03:05,910
But what we're actually doing here
75

75

00:03:05,910  -->  00:03:09,460
is that whenever an item's selected in the artist list,
76

76

00:03:09,460  -->  00:03:13,850
we going to get our get_albums method to be called.
77

77

00:03:13,850  -->  00:03:15,190
So, for that reason we better go ahead
78

78

00:03:15,190  -->  00:03:16,850
and actually write that method.
79

79

00:03:16,850  -->  00:03:19,380
Now, I'm gonna add it after the class definition,
80

80

00:03:19,380  -->  00:03:22,130
leaving the usual two lines before it.
81

81

00:03:22,130  -->  00:03:24,300
So, let's go up and do that.
82

82

00:03:24,300  -->  00:03:28,640
So, we're actually gonna add it right up here.
83

83

00:03:28,640  -->  00:03:30,160
Okay, on line 26
84

84

00:03:30,160  -->  00:03:34,250
and we're gonna start with def, space, get_albums
85

85

00:03:36,460  -->  00:03:39,120
and event in parentheses, colon,
86

86

00:03:40,420  -->  00:03:44,590
and then we're gonna do lb equals event dot widget,
87

87

00:03:46,670  -->  00:03:50,830
index equals lb dot cur selection,
88

88

00:03:52,660  -->  00:03:56,670
parentheses and then in square brackets, zero.
89

89

00:03:56,670  -->  00:04:00,250
Then we want artist_name is equal to lb dot
90

90

00:04:01,530  -->  00:04:03,940
get index,
91

91

00:04:03,940  -->  00:04:06,560
then a comma.
92

92

00:04:06,560  -->  00:04:08,040
And now what we need to do is,
93

93

00:04:08,040  -->  00:04:12,200
so we wanna get the artist ID from the database row,
94

94

00:04:16,310  -->  00:04:20,280
So, we do artist_ID is equal to
95

95

00:04:20,280  -->  00:04:21,620
conn dot execute
96

96

00:04:22,620  -->  00:04:25,150
and double quotes within parentheses
97

97

00:04:25,150  -->  00:04:29,310
is gonna be select artists dot _ID
98

98

00:04:30,580  -->  00:04:34,030
from artists where,
99

99

00:04:34,030  -->  00:04:35,180
and I'm not mentioning the spaces,
100

100

00:04:35,180  -->  00:04:38,050
but you'll know by now with SQL that we need to have spaces
101

101

00:04:38,050  -->  00:04:39,350
at the appropriate places there,
102

102

00:04:39,350  -->  00:04:43,340
where artists dot name equals question mark.
103

103

00:04:43,340  -->  00:04:45,440
So, we're using a placeholder there.
104

104

00:04:45,440  -->  00:04:47,810
Comma after the double quote,
105

105

00:04:47,810  -->  00:04:49,530
artist_name,
106

106

00:04:49,530  -->  00:04:51,170
right parentheses
107

107

00:04:51,170  -->  00:04:55,290
dot fetch one.
108

108

00:04:55,290  -->  00:04:56,220
On the next line we're gonna type
109

109

00:04:56,220  -->  00:04:59,980
list equals and two square brackets,
110

110

00:04:59,980  -->  00:05:04,930
then four, row in, conn dot execute,
111

111

00:05:04,930  -->  00:05:06,570
then the SQL we wanna write for this one
112

112

00:05:06,570  -->  00:05:08,450
in double quotes is gonna be
113

113

00:05:08,450  -->  00:05:10,280
select albums dot name
114

114

00:05:11,550  -->  00:05:14,180
from albums
115

115

00:05:14,180  -->  00:05:18,760
where albums dot artist
116

116

00:05:18,760  -->  00:05:19,860
equals placeholder
117

117

00:05:19,860  -->  00:05:22,530
or question mark and you wanna order by
118

118

00:05:22,530  -->  00:05:24,290
the albums dot name.
119

119

00:05:24,290  -->  00:05:26,320
Albums dot name.
120

120

00:05:26,320  -->  00:05:27,740
Then double quote, comma, space,
121

121

00:05:27,740  -->  00:05:30,630
then artist_ID,
122

122

00:05:30,630  -->  00:05:33,540
then colon, then a list dot append.
123

123

00:05:35,110  -->  00:05:39,280
In parentheses we wanna do row and square brackets and zero.
124

124

00:05:41,310  -->  00:05:44,350
And finally, after that has finished,
125

125

00:05:44,350  -->  00:05:48,330
we gonna type album LV dot set
126

126

00:05:48,330  -->  00:05:52,500
and in parentheses, tuple, a list.
127

127

00:05:53,780  -->  00:05:56,200
Alright, so when a bound function's called,
128

128

00:05:56,200  -->  00:05:58,130
it gets passed as single argument,
129

129

00:05:58,130  -->  00:06:01,460
this event here that you can see we've defined on line 26.
130

130

00:06:01,460  -->  00:06:03,520
So, we can use that to then retrieve a reference
131

131

00:06:03,520  -->  00:06:05,830
to the widget that triggered the effect.
132

132

00:06:05,830  -->  00:06:08,270
We're doing that you can see here on line 27.
133

133

00:06:08,270  -->  00:06:11,740
Now, a list box has got a cur selection method
134

134

00:06:11,740  -->  00:06:13,600
that returns a tuple,
135

135

00:06:13,600  -->  00:06:14,430
containing the positions
136

136

00:06:14,430  -->  00:06:16,880
of all the selector items in the list
137

137

00:06:16,880  -->  00:06:19,820
and we're calling that on line 28.
138

138

00:06:19,820  -->  00:06:21,390
Now, you've probably used list boxes
139

139

00:06:21,390  -->  00:06:23,620
in your operating system's GUI
140

140

00:06:23,620  -->  00:06:25,430
and know that you can use the control key
141

141

00:06:25,430  -->  00:06:29,030
or command on a Mac to select several items in the list.
142

142

00:06:29,030  -->  00:06:31,000
Now, we're actually only going to be allowing
143

143

00:06:31,000  -->  00:06:33,120
a single item to be selected
144

144

00:06:33,120  -->  00:06:34,550
and we're gonna be coming back to that
145

145

00:06:34,550  -->  00:06:36,300
when we produce our class.
146

146

00:06:36,300  -->  00:06:37,550
But that's where we're only allowing
147

147

00:06:37,550  -->  00:06:39,770
a single item to be selected,
148

148

00:06:39,770  -->  00:06:42,240
we'd actually just hard coding that fact
149

149

00:06:42,240  -->  00:06:45,020
for this value in square brackets here with zero
150

150

00:06:45,020  -->  00:06:46,790
from the return tuple.
151

151

00:06:46,790  -->  00:06:49,390
Now, once we know the position of the selected item,
152

152

00:06:49,390  -->  00:06:51,870
we can then use the get method
153

153

00:06:51,870  -->  00:06:54,310
to get that from the list box's list.
154

154

00:06:54,310  -->  00:06:55,800
So, at that point we know the artist name
155

155

00:06:55,800  -->  00:06:57,370
that was selected
156

156

00:06:57,370  -->  00:06:59,480
but unfortunately, the TK list box
157

157

00:06:59,480  -->  00:07:02,440
doesn't provide any way to associate an ID
158

158

00:07:02,440  -->  00:07:05,050
with the strings that it displays.
159

159

00:07:05,050  -->  00:07:07,640
So consequently, we have to query the database
160

160

00:07:07,640  -->  00:07:09,740
to retrieve the artist ID
161

161

00:07:09,740  -->  00:07:12,910
and you can see that we're doing that here on line 32.
162

162

00:07:12,910  -->  00:07:14,180
Now, we're using a local database,
163

163

00:07:14,180  -->  00:07:16,230
so that's not really a problem here.
164

164

00:07:16,230  -->  00:07:17,830
But if we were retrieving data
165

165

00:07:17,830  -->  00:07:19,470
perhaps from a remote database,
166

166

00:07:19,470  -->  00:07:21,940
then you might wanna reduce the number of network calls
167

167

00:07:21,940  -->  00:07:25,190
that you may have to make to fetch data.
168

168

00:07:25,190  -->  00:07:28,380
In that case, we could add a list to our subclass list box.
169

169

00:07:28,380  -->  00:07:31,040
We'd then store the database IDs in the list
170

170

00:07:31,040  -->  00:07:33,760
in the same position as the names in the list box.
171

171

00:07:33,760  -->  00:07:35,720
Now, that's not particularly difficult
172

172

00:07:35,720  -->  00:07:38,780
but you do have to be careful to keep the list in sync
173

173

00:07:38,780  -->  00:07:42,030
if rows can be inserted into and deleted from the database.
174

174

00:07:42,030  -->  00:07:43,490
So, a better option though in that case,
175

175

00:07:43,490  -->  00:07:47,160
might be to use the new TTK tree view widget
176

176

00:07:48,030  -->  00:07:49,990
and that'll let you store the IDs in a column
177

177

00:07:49,990  -->  00:07:51,790
alongside the names.
178

178

00:07:51,790  -->  00:07:53,640
But in this case, we're using a local database,
179

179

00:07:53,640  -->  00:07:57,900
so we just gonna run a query as you can see here on line 32,
180

180

00:07:57,900  -->  00:08:00,030
to return the ID for the specified artist,
181

181

00:08:00,030  -->  00:08:03,590
and it's obviously in the artist_ID variable.
182

182

00:08:03,590  -->  00:08:05,980
And now I've done something slightly sneaky
183

183

00:08:05,980  -->  00:08:10,460
when assigning the artist name to the artist_name variable.
184

184

00:08:10,460  -->  00:08:13,160
So, we're gonna use artist_name as a parameter
185

185

00:08:13,160  -->  00:08:15,810
to the query and we have to pass a tuple
186

186

00:08:15,810  -->  00:08:17,860
rather than a single value.
187

187

00:08:17,860  -->  00:08:21,170
I'm talking about this code here on line 29.
188

188

00:08:21,170  -->  00:08:24,260
So, artist_name is actually a tuple
189

189

00:08:24,260  -->  00:08:25,940
and we don't have to worry about using it
190

190

00:08:25,940  -->  00:08:27,620
when executing the query.
191

191

00:08:27,620  -->  00:08:31,330
The fetch one method that we're using on line 32
192

192

00:08:31,330  -->  00:08:34,230
on the cursor that comes back from conn dot execute,
193

193

00:08:34,230  -->  00:08:35,790
well, that returns a tuple,
194

194

00:08:35,790  -->  00:08:39,650
so the variable artist_ID will already be suitable
195

195

00:08:39,650  -->  00:08:42,020
for passing on to the next query.
196

196

00:08:42,020  -->  00:08:44,020
So, once we've got the artist ID,
197

197

00:08:44,020  -->  00:08:46,360
we then use that to query the album's table.
198

198

00:08:46,360  -->  00:08:49,190
You can see that code on line 34
199

199

00:08:49,190  -->  00:08:51,380
and from there, we're getting a list of the albums.
200

200

00:08:51,380  -->  00:08:52,560
Now, the remaining code after that
201

201

00:08:52,560  -->  00:08:55,320
should hopefully, be pretty straight forward for you.
202

202

00:08:55,320  -->  00:08:59,450
We're just appending the names to a list here on line 35
203

203

00:08:59,450  -->  00:09:01,410
and remember that the list box wants a tuple
204

204

00:09:01,410  -->  00:09:02,770
in the list variable,
205

205

00:09:02,770  -->  00:09:05,470
so we convert a list from a list to a tuple
206

206

00:09:05,470  -->  00:09:07,260
here on line 36,
207

207

00:09:07,260  -->  00:09:10,450
before setting it as the value for album LV.
208

208

00:09:10,450  -->  00:09:12,840
Alright, so at this point, with the code we've got,
209

209

00:09:12,840  -->  00:09:14,760
this should hopefully work,
210

210

00:09:14,760  -->  00:09:18,600
so let's actually run it and see what happens.
211

211

00:09:22,030  -->  00:09:25,510
Alright, so there's our list of artists.
212

212

00:09:25,510  -->  00:09:26,400
So, we can click a couple there,
213

213

00:09:26,400  -->  00:09:28,500
like 1,000 Maniacs
214

214

00:09:28,500  -->  00:09:30,780
and you can see Albums got updated here.
215

215

00:09:30,780  -->  00:09:32,690
B.B. King, Black Crows.
216

216

00:09:34,080  -->  00:09:35,400
Let's try one that's got a lot.
217

217

00:09:35,400  -->  00:09:37,180
I think Blue Oyster Cult.
218

218

00:09:37,180  -->  00:09:38,580
You can see that's got multiple albums there,
219

219

00:09:38,580  -->  00:09:40,100
so that's worked quite nicely.
220

220

00:09:40,100  -->  00:09:41,690
Bruce Springsteen
221

221

00:09:41,690  -->  00:09:42,680
and you got a single one.
222

222

00:09:42,680  -->  00:09:44,730
We can try another one from Aerosmith.
223

223

00:09:44,730  -->  00:09:46,230
I know he's got quite a few.
224

224

00:09:46,230  -->  00:09:48,770
So, that's working nicely as well.
225

225

00:09:48,770  -->  00:09:51,620
Alright, but what I'm gonna do is finish the video here.
226

226

00:09:51,620  -->  00:09:53,770
In the next video we're gonna continue on
227

227

00:09:53,770  -->  00:09:56,230
and we're going to get the songs working as well.
228

228

00:09:56,230  -->  00:09:58,050
So, we're gonna be able to click on an album
229

229

00:09:58,050  -->  00:10:00,170
and retrieve a list of songs.
230

230

00:10:00,170  -->  00:10:02,190
So, I'll see you in the next video.
