00:00:04.670  -->  00:00:08.570
In the previous video I issued you
with a challenge called the if challenge

2

00:00:08.570  -->  00:00:11.200
and in this video we're going to go
through the solution to that.

3

00:00:11.200  -->  00:00:17.820
So I'm going to start by creating a new file in
this project and we'll call it ifchallenge.

4

00:00:22.269  -->  00:00:26.810
Alright so the first step was to get the
name and age from the user and we do

5

00:00:26.810  -->  00:00:36.240
that using input name equals input
parentheses double quotes Please enter your name

6

00:00:36.240  -->  00:00:38.800
and put a colon and a space
there, then our double quote and right

7

00:00:38.809  -->  00:00:47.539
parenthesis. Next line, age equals int left
parentheses input left parenthesis and

8

00:00:47.539  -->  00:00:53.179
double quotes How old are you question
mark and a space there, double quote

9

00:00:53.179  -->  00:00:57.739
and two right parentheses. Alright, so far
so good. So remember to convert the age

10

00:00:57.740  -->  00:01:02.120
to an int using the int function and you can
see that we're using that on line 2.

11

00:01:02.120  -->  00:01:05.540
Now there are fewer ways to write the
conditions. I'm just going to use the

12

00:01:05.540  -->  00:01:10.430
values that we used in the challenge
description. So I'm going to type if 18

13

00:01:10.430  -->  00:01:17.350
is less than or equal to age less then 31:

14

00:01:17.350  -->  00:01:22.250
then I'm going to print a message, print
parenthesis double quotes Welcome to

15

00:01:22.250  -->  00:01:30.049
club 18 to 30 holidays comma then left
and right curly braces with a 0 in the

16

00:01:30.049  -->  00:01:34.250
middle of it. Then outside the double
quote dot format name and the two

17

00:01:34.250  -->  00:01:41.840
closing right parentheses else: on
the next line, print I'm sorry our

18

00:01:41.840  -->  00:01:49.670
holidays are only for cool people. Not sure
how polite that message was. Okay

19

00:01:49.670  -->  00:01:52.820
then we've got a double quote and right
parenthesis to end. Now you might have

20

00:01:52.820  -->  00:01:57.049
checked for the age being greater than
17, or tested for less than or equal to

21

00:01:57.049  -->  00:02:01.759
30. That will also work fine. Importantly
though, test your program thoroughly

22

00:02:01.759  -->  00:02:05.719
and that involves entering ages less than 30,
greater than 30 and also the specific

23

00:02:05.720  -->  00:02:10.940
endpoints 18 and 30. So let's just run
this to make sure that this does

24

00:02:10.940  -->  00:02:14.720
work for us.
Please enter your name, Tim. I'm gonna start with

25

00:02:14.720  -->  00:02:17.780
an age that's less than 18. We'll start with 17.

26

00:02:17.780  -->  00:02:24.280
I'm sorry, our holidays are only for cool people. Same
thing again, Tim again,  just something

27

00:02:24.290  -->  00:02:30.050
greater than 30 so we'll just do a 31
there, I'm sorry. That's working. Next, Tim

28

00:02:30.050  -->  00:02:34.720
again. This time we're going to try the
specific end points, are 18 in this case,

29

00:02:34.720  -->  00:02:44.450
Welcome, should be Welcome to. That's a
typo. Ok, so that's working and the last

30

00:02:44.450  -->  00:02:49.340
one will test is if it equals 30, Welcome
to club

31

00:02:49.340  -->  00:02:53.989
18 to 30 holidays Tim. Alright, so
that's the challenge solution and as I

32

00:02:53.989  -->  00:02:57.680
mentioned again, you might have checked for
the age being greater than 17 or tested

33

00:02:57.680  -->  00:03:01.700
for less than or equal to 30. That will
also work fine. Importantly though, make

34

00:03:01.700  -->  00:03:04.760
sure again, you do test your program
thoroughly. That's always very important,

35

00:03:04.760  -->  00:03:08.900
and you saw me test and what I did there
was I entered an age that was less than

36

00:03:08.900  -->  00:03:13.980
18, that was greater than 30, and then I also
used the specific endpoints 18 and 30

37

00:03:13.980  -->  00:03:17.750
and the program worked as expected.
Alright, so let's end the video here.

38

00:03:17.750  -->  00:03:23.709
In the next one, we're going to start looking at for loops.
See you in the next video.
