1

00:00:04,080  -->  00:00:09,120
So I feel it's really important that
you type along in this course.

2

00:00:09,120  -->  00:00:14,640
So in other words, don't just watch the videos.
Engage with the videos, follow along, type in the

3

00:00:14,640  -->  00:00:18,640
code as you see me typing it. and you'll
find you'll get a much better experience.

4

00:00:18,640  -->  00:00:22,560
The reality is that watching the videos
only, will only get you so far in your

5

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:26,700
programming journey. Doing, in other words,
following along and typing as I mentioned,

6

00:00:26,700  -->  00:00:31,600
will really help you master programming.
So typing in the program, running the

7

00:00:31,600  -->  00:00:36,020
program, finding errors, making errors and
fixing them, well that's your ticket to

8

00:00:36,020  -->  00:00:39,980
success and becoming a great
programmer. Basically, by going through

9

00:00:39,980  -->  00:00:43,559
that process, you'll find that your skills
will improve dramatically. So it's really

10

00:00:43,560  -->  00:00:47,160
highly recommended that you do follow
along for that reason, and I'll give you a bit

11

00:00:47,160  -->  00:00:50,910
of an overview here, that what a lot of
students do with videos, is that they'll

12

00:00:50,910  -->  00:00:53,789
actually watch a video once to get the
general feel for what's in the video.

13

00:00:53,789  -->  00:00:58,360
Then they'll go back and watch it again,
and the second time by going through,

14

00:00:58,360  -->  00:01:01,170
what they'll do is they'll actually type
along that second time. So they've got

15

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:04,800
the general idea from the first view, of
what the video is about, and they'll

16

00:01:04,800  -->  00:01:08,500
follow along with the second. And basically,
as they see me typing something on the screen,

17

00:01:08,500  -->  00:01:10,900
they'll do the same. And actually, typing

18

00:01:10,900  -->  00:01:14,380
the same thing in with their computer
into their own computer, your computer in

19

00:01:14,430  -->  00:01:18,300
other words, again, as I mentioned a few
times now, will help you become a

20

00:01:18,300  -->  00:01:22,140
better programmer, and really helps you
understand the material when you're

21

00:01:22,140  -->  00:01:25,200
actually typing it in, rather than just
watching it. So I know I've said that a

22

00:01:25,200  -->  00:01:28,400
few times, but frankly, I think
it's really important and will

23

00:01:28,400  -->  00:01:33,080
ultimately help you get the most out of your course,
out of this course, by actually doing that.

24

00:01:33,080  -->  00:01:36,020
And keep in mind that I've said that
to watch a video twice, but look, you

25

00:01:36,020  -->  00:01:39,840
don't necessarily have to watch a video
twice. It's just a suggestion, but one

26

00:01:39,840  -->  00:01:44,620
thing I would suggest you do is, if
something is unclear, please do go back

27

00:01:44,620  -->  00:01:48,120
and watch a video a second or maybe even
a third time if you don't understand it,

28

00:01:48,120  -->  00:01:51,360
because watching it a second
time can really help understand.

29

00:01:51,360  -->  00:01:56,420
And the analogy I'll use here is just, if you've ever
watched a movie, and watched it for the second time,

30

00:01:56,420  -->  00:01:58,890
often you'll actually see things the second

31

00:01:58,890  -->  00:02:03,300
playthrough of a video, of a movie rather,
that you didn't see the first time.

32

00:02:03,300  -->  00:02:08,000
And it's much the same with training
videos like this Python course videos,

33

00:02:08,000  -->  00:02:11,840
watching it for a second time,
something else might gel and sink in,

34

00:02:11,840  -->  00:02:14,960
and you go 'oh now I understand that now'
because you've seen it for a second time.

35

00:02:14,960  -->  00:02:18,800
So do that and don't be afraid to watch
a video for a second time,

36

00:02:18,800  -->  00:02:21,599
to make sure you really
understand it. Now as for all that code

37

00:02:21,600  -->  00:02:25,049
that I'm typing in, the source code,
that's available for you to download as well.

38

00:02:25,049  -->  00:02:28,860
Just go to the lecture at the end
of the course, marked, unsurprisingly,

39

00:02:28,860  -->  00:02:32,700
source code, and you can download it from
there. And in some situations  - there's

40

00:02:32,700  -->  00:02:36,260
certain lectures in this course - you
might find that the code's attached to those

41

00:02:36,260  -->  00:02:40,660
lectures as well. So check out the
resources sections with specific videos as well.

42

00:02:40,660  -->  00:02:43,980
So the source code, downloading
it, that can be great to use as a

43

00:02:43,980  -->  00:02:47,820
comparison tool to compare your code,
the code you've entered to your computer,

44

00:02:47,820  -->  00:02:51,680
or into your computer, to the code
that we've gone through in the video.

45

00:02:51,680  -->  00:02:56,720
Alright, enough about source code.
Let's move on now to the next video.
