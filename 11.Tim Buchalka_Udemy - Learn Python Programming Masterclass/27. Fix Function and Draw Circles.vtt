00:00:05.400  -->  00:00:09.550
ok so moving on what we going to do now is
clean up some of this
2

2

00:00:09.550  -->  00:00:13.640
code and we're going to put the code
back to how it was before because we
3

3

00:00:13.640  -->  00:00:16.990
finished I finished that part of the
video where I just want to demonstrate these
4

4

00:00:16.990  -->  00:00:21.490
multiple variables canvas and canvas 2 so lets
5

5

00:00:21.490  -->  00:00:25.530
actually put those back but before I do
that there is probably something that you
6

6

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:30.040
may have picked up and perhaps its been
bugging you for a few videos now I made a
7

7

00:00:30.040  -->  00:00:35.970
typo here on line 7 I guess I'm human as
actually in my haste to create the video
8

8

00:00:35.970  -->  00:00:41.280
I haven't fixed it so parblolah instead of parabola so I'm going to right click
9

9

00:00:41.280  -->  00:00:45.550
that refactor rename and call it what it what
should have been
10

10

00:00:46.650  -->  00:00:55.860
and its parabola and color
click on refactor and that actually fix it or will fix it
11

11

00:00:55.860  -->  00:01:00.430
comes up here an basically tells us
where it is in the program and we can click on
12

12

00:01:00.430  -->  00:01:05.870
over here do refactor ok so that's fix
that up and you can see that also fixed up on
13

13

00:01:05.870  -->  00:01:10.130
line 41 ok so let's clean up this
program and remove some of
14

14

00:01:10.130  -->  00:01:15.590
this extra code so in the previous video we
removed the print let's get rid of the
15

15

00:01:15.590  -->  00:01:25.060
multiple draw axis so I'm going to
close down and delete these 2 canvas objects which
16

16

00:01:25.060  -->  00:01:30.020
objects other than the call to it the print
going to delete that we no longer need that any more
17

17

00:01:30.020  -->  00:01:35.090
and also the plot method actually that's
ok for now but the other thing I
18

18

00:01:35.090  -->  00:01:39.580
wanted to point out here what I remembered was i
didnt also change lines 14 and 15
19

19

00:01:39.580  -->  00:01:44.220
notice how its still pointing out to canvas
so that was still accessing the canvas
20

20

00:01:44.220  -->  00:01:47.300
object from the main program and not
from the function so that's another
21

21

00:01:47.300  -->  00:01:52.510
reason why if you wanting to make sure that
you don't name these things the same so
22

22

00:01:52.510  -->  00:01:58.150
there's no confusion so that should actually been be page so I put that back to page now
23

23

00:01:58.150  -->  00:02:02.240
I can leave that print in their now so their also
should be just page now because we just
24

24

00:02:02.240  -->  00:02:08.540
referencing that variable and the other
thing to do is just make sure on line 30
25

25

00:02:08.540  -->  00:02:12.760
the width is set backed 640 so again if
you are using a different number they're
26

26

00:02:12.760  -->  00:02:17.310
you just basically doubling back to what it
originally in my case it was 640 X 480
27

27

00:02:17.310  -->  00:02:20.650
so now we should have our original program
back again so I would just run this gain to make
28

28

00:02:20.650  -->  00:02:27.280
sure it still works and tab over and
we've now got it working nicely again on the
29

29

00:02:27.280  -->  00:02:32.310
screen and now its centered and we've now only got one
axis so that's good that's all working how
30

30

00:02:32.310  -->  00:02:37.710
it should have been so what we gonna do
now is just change this around a
31

31

00:02:37.710  -->  00:02:40.400
little bit more and I mentioned I think
in the last video or the one before
32

32

00:02:40.400  -->  00:02:45.320
that the parabola function would be more
useful if it actually did the plotting
33

33

00:02:45.320  -->  00:02:48.990
and all we had to do was call it with it the
canvas and the size we wanted so
34

34

00:02:48.990  -->  00:02:53.850
instead of actually having to create a
range like this on lines 35 to 37 every
35

35

00:02:53.850  -->  00:02:57.530
time we want to essentially call the
parabola function we should be able to
36

36

00:02:57.530  -->  00:03:02.100
just pass size and get it to do the work for us so
how do we go about that when we make a
37

37

00:03:02.100  -->  00:03:06.840
change to this parabola method and what we are going to do
is we are going to change this instead of calling it
38

38

00:03:06.840  -->  00:03:13.330
x we are going to pass the canvas which we are going to call page and we are also gonna pass a size as
39

39

00:03:13.330  -->  00:03:25.490
well  so.....
40

40

00:03:25.490  -->  00:03:30.800
.....
41

41

00:03:30.800  -->  00:03:36.290
....and what we're going to
do is instead of returning this value
42

42

00:03:36.290  -->  00:03:39.170
because we won't need to return it anymore we're going to actually call the plot
43

43

00:03:39.170  -->  00:03:45.710
direct so...... and we
don't actually need the return any more
44

44

00:03:45.710  -->  00:03:48.740
because we're not going to be returning
that data type so you can see what we've
45

45

00:03:48.740  -->  00:03:52.860
done their we've essentially duplicated
what was on lines 36 to 38
46

46

00:03:52.860  -->  00:03:57.540
but we put that into a method so that we
can call a method to do that hard work
47

47

00:03:57.540  -->  00:04:01.420
for us and the method you can see there is
calculating X&Y
48

48

00:04:02.140  -->  00:04:06.020
and basically calling the plot
function to actually plot that out on the
49

49

00:04:06.020  -->  00:04:10.030
screen so consequently now we've done
that we can come down here on the line 36
50

50

00:04:10.030  -->  00:04:17.450
we can delete that and we can type....
51

51

00:04:17.450  -->  00:04:23.110
.....
52

52

00:04:24.980  -->  00:04:35.250
and if we run this now...you can their's 2 their now so its working
53

53

00:04:35.250  -->  00:04:39.570
but of course we got the same issue now the
parabolas are upside down so what I did
54

54

00:04:39.570  -->  00:04:43.730
is I actually forgot that we need to plot negative y rather than Y and it's
55

55

00:04:43.730  -->  00:04:48.920
probably best taken I got so often so I could fix the
problem by negating y and plotting the line
56

56

00:04:48.920  -->  00:04:53.080
this is the code that's on line 10 as you can see up there so I
57

57

00:04:53.080  -->  00:04:56.410
could negate that they're by putting a
negative in front of it but to save
58

58

00:04:56.410  -->  00:04:59.160
having to do that every time I want to plot a point to its probably a good
59

59

00:04:59.160  -->  00:05:03.190
idea to make that adjustment in the plot
function itself because this is
60

60

00:05:03.190  -->  00:05:06.930
something we need to do every time
we are plotting this parabola so what I'm gonna do
61

61

00:05:06.930  -->  00:05:10.320
is change the plot function
and at the same time you gonna get rid
62

62

00:05:10.320  -->  00:05:17.170
of that last warning so close â€œit down and move this over you can see we've largely fix this
63

63

00:05:17.170  -->  00:05:20.560
errors we still got the original
one there in relation to the import
64

64

00:05:20.560  -->  00:05:21.360
which is fine
65

65

00:05:21.360  -->  00:05:24.800
we will leave that but this one here is
the only one left because we're basically fix
66

66

00:05:24.800  -->  00:05:30.090
some of these by renaming them correctly
but the plot function on line 23 has still
67

67

00:05:30.090  -->  00:05:34.140
got the old canvas subject or canvas parameter name being canvas and
68

68

00:05:34.140  -->  00:05:36.920
IntelliJ is still complaining
about that or giving us a warning at
69

69

00:05:36.920  -->  00:05:41.080
least so I will do that will rename
that and will also fix this so it's
70

70

00:05:41.080  -->  00:05:47.880
negative y and that should fix the
problems so if I delete that and convert that
71

71

00:05:47.880  -->  00:05:54.610
and call it page but I could have refactored it of course.....and where its got
72

72

00:05:54.610  -->  00:06:01.590
y + 1 we are going to input negative y + 1 and that should fix that problem and you can see as
73

73

00:06:01.590  -->  00:06:06.220
far as IntelliJ is considered now we got the
tick there that it's quite happy that we
74

74

00:06:06.220  -->  00:06:09.900
haven't got any more of these weird errors
so I now that I've done that we should be able
75

75

00:06:09.900  -->  00:06:14.090
to run this and we should find that are
actually the correct way up our parabolas
76

76

00:06:14.090  -->  00:06:18.360
so let's have a look at them and that's
a very cool effect but that wasn't what was meant to
77

77

00:06:18.360  -->  00:06:22.860
happen so what I have done there
is added one negative y you can see here
78

78

00:06:22.860  -->  00:06:26.650
on line 24 but I did not update the other one
so what we actually need to do is do
79

79

00:06:26.650  -->  00:06:31.060
that in both places so the line should be x and that should be
80

80

00:06:31.060  -->  00:06:37.280
negative y...and then its x +1 and then its negative y + 1
81

81

00:06:37.280  -->  00:06:38.050
and then
82

82

00:06:38.050  -->  00:06:45.740
the fields so if we do that probably won't look quite as good as that but it will actually be a correct parabola
83

83

00:06:45.740  -->  00:06:49.860
so lets have a look their you go that's what I should
have done so it looks quite cool what we did but
84

84

00:06:49.860  -->  00:06:55.230
that was obviously wrong so that's the
correct parabolas their is 2 of them and
85

85

00:06:55.230  -->  00:06:58.530
they are  both the right way up there which
is good it's good it's a step in the
86

86

00:06:58.530  -->  00:07:02.620
right direction so the users of the plot
function can focus on how they expect the
87

87

00:07:02.620  -->  00:07:07.050
points to be plotted without having to remember to negate y and that is obviously
88

88

00:07:07.050  -->  00:07:12.000
ideal to place that in a function to
allow the programmer not have to
89

89

00:07:12.000  -->  00:07:14.930
remember all these things because
that's what a function is it's a code
90

90

00:07:14.930  -->  00:07:19.620
that is going to be duplicated or replicated
repeated a number of times so it makes
91

91

00:07:19.620  -->  00:07:22.330
sense to put that in there so that the
program calling it doesn't have to remember
92

92

00:07:22.330  -->  00:07:26.960
to do that now theres another way that
can be made to the parabola function
93

93

00:07:26.960  -->  00:07:30.920
actually there at the moment the loop
calculates
94

94

00:07:30.920  -->  00:07:36.020
now at the moment the
loop calculates the value of y you can see
95

95

00:07:36.020  -->  00:07:41.190
on line 9 for both positive and negative values
of x but the parabola is symmetric about
96

96

00:07:41.190  -->  00:07:45.460
the y axis so there's really no point
calculating y twice so what I mean
97

97

00:07:45.460  -->  00:07:50.230
by that I'm gonna change this range where it's got For x
a range of minus size to size we only really
98

98

00:07:50.230  -->  00:07:56.950
need to just change this......calculate it once which you can see we doing the on line 9
99

99

00:07:56.950  -->  00:08:01.080
and that's still going to be the same
calculation but when we plot it we can
100

100

00:08:01.080  -->  00:08:07.970
plot it that's correct there but we can add
a second plot now.....
101

101

00:08:07.970  -->  00:08:11.880
because essentially its the same thing we
just negating it and it's save us
102

102

00:08:11.880  -->  00:08:14.970
having to go through that entire range
so hopefully this is really pointing out
103

103

00:08:14.970  -->  00:08:19.850
some of the advantages of functions here
so we're changing the code in a single
104

104

00:08:19.850  -->  00:08:24.590
place and every parabola that's drawn
now benefits from the more efficient code so will just run this
105

105

00:08:24.590  -->  00:08:30.920
again to make sure it works because and you can see its still working and its more
106

106

00:08:30.920  -->  00:08:35.050
efficient so that's the great thing
about functions you write it in one place
107

107

00:08:35.050  -->  00:08:38.910
and calling it in multiple places and we
can make those changes and it just saves
108

108

00:08:38.910  -->  00:08:42.790
time and it's way more efficient
now this may not look too
109

109

00:08:42.790  -->  00:08:45.520
impressive because we only drawn 2 parabolas so
110

110

00:08:45.520  -->  00:08:50.730
let's add a function to draw circles for
a bit more practice so we are gonna add some code and
111

111

00:08:50.730  -->  00:09:01.730
will add it up here on line 14 so....
112

112

00:09:01.730  -->  00:09:11.130
.....
113

113

00:09:11.130  -->  00:09:24.570
....
114

114

00:09:24.570  -->  00:09:32.970
.....
115

115

00:09:33.850  -->  00:09:52.000
.....
116

116

00:09:52.000  -->  00:10:05.500
...we are gonna have to fix that math up so
117

117

00:10:05.500  -->  00:10:11.310
we need to import a library their we need to fix that up so....
118

118

00:10:11.310  -->  00:10:16.330
....
119

119

00:10:18.250  -->  00:10:27.180
...and we need to do an import math their
120

120

00:10:27.180  -->  00:10:41.210
for that libraries so we put that up on the first line.....ok so let me put the image on the screen their and what we should
121

121

00:10:41.210  -->  00:10:48.430
have their you can see the code now starting on
line 18 y = h + math.squareroot so in terms
122

122

00:10:48.430  -->  00:10:52.460
of calculating a circle its symmetric
about both axis so you only need to
123

123

00:10:52.460  -->  00:10:55.400
calculate a quarter of the points of its
circumference
124

124

00:10:55.400  -->  00:10:59.120
when you creating functions make sure
you've got two spaces between each one
125

125

00:10:59.120  -->  00:11:05.340
to avoid getting a warning for IntelliJ
so on line 18 we get a square root which can be
126

126

00:11:05.340  -->  00:11:09.710
either positive or negative to give to
give this 2 values for y now
127

127

00:11:09.710  -->  00:11:14.340
rather than calculating the square root twice we can
just negate y and add two times h
128

128

00:11:14.340  -->  00:11:15.090
back on again
129

129

00:11:15.090  -->  00:11:18.810
so a little bit of algebra involved their that you can
actually see there on the screen there now
130

130

00:11:18.810  -->  00:11:23.450
because minus y will also take off
h we add 2 times h back on lines
131

131

00:11:23.450  -->  00:11:28.080
20 and 22 in the same for x we
calculate the values for the other
132

132

00:11:28.080  -->  00:11:32.060
quadrants now if your struggling with this
algebra and don't worry too much about
133

133

00:11:32.060  -->  00:11:35.840
the actual formula the important thing here
is that the use of the function rather
134

134

00:11:35.840  -->  00:11:40.740
than the maths behind it now mathematical
functions are just one of the examples one
135

135

00:11:40.740  -->  00:11:43.960
of the things I should say that Python
functions can be used for
136

136

00:11:43.960  -->  00:11:47.900
and we are gonna be looking at plenty of other
examples as well and I've added the import
137

137

00:11:47.900  -->  00:11:52.500
as I mentioned on line 1 as well so this
will actually work so now we've got this function to
138

138

00:11:52.500  -->  00:11:56.740
draw circles with any radius centered where we liked on the canvas and we can
139

139

00:11:56.740  -->  00:12:01.240
call it a few times to create a pattern so
let's go ahead and do that now so down
140

140

00:12:01.240  -->  00:12:05.640
the bottom here just after the
two parabola calls lets actually add
141

141

00:12:05.640  -->  00:12:09.580
some and what I'm going to do just to save a bit
of time I'm gonna paste in some code
142

142

00:12:09.580  -->  00:12:15.510
...come down here and paste this code
and you can see their is a circle we
143

143

00:12:15.510  -->  00:12:18.130
are gonna call multiple times with
different values
144

144

00:12:18.130  -->  00:12:21.400
....so lets just run this and see that it works
145

145

00:12:28.650  -->  00:12:34.240
and one thing to note is the circles themselves do get vague around the edges and at
146

146

00:12:34.240  -->  00:12:37.650
the moment the function only plots
points the integer values of x
147

147

00:12:37.650  -->  00:12:41.970
so we don't get many points plotted and we can't use
decimal values in the step for our range
148

148

00:12:41.970  -->  00:12:45.800
so I'm gonna leave the video here in the next video
we'll just talked a little bit more about
149

149

00:12:45.800  -->  00:12:50.420
this and then we'll also have a mini
challenge for you to do as well so I'll
150

150

00:12:50.420  -->  00:12:51.280
see you in the next video
