00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:08,190
Now that I've installed the IDE and the
2

2

00:00:08,190  -->  00:00:09,480
python plug in if you
3

3

00:00:09,480  -->  00:00:12,059
installed IntelliJ IDEA rather than
4

4

00:00:12,059  -->  00:00:14,309
PyCharm we need to make sure that it can
5

5

00:00:14,309  -->  00:00:17,010
find Python. Now the steps are almost the
6

6

00:00:17,010  -->  00:00:19,560
same for IntelliJ IDE as they are for
7

7

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:21,840
PyCharm and the chances are that it's
8

8

00:00:21,840  -->  00:00:24,330
sorted itself out but just in case it
9

9

00:00:24,330  -->  00:00:25,440
hasn't I'm going to go through the steps
10

10

00:00:25,440  -->  00:00:28,650
to configure the Python SDK, so from
11

11

00:00:28,650  -->  00:00:31,320
IntelliJ IDEA first if you're using that
12

12

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:33,809
come down and click on configure and
13

13

00:00:33,809  -->  00:00:36,059
select project defaults and select a
14

14

00:00:36,059  -->  00:00:39,449
project structure on the left hand side
15

15

00:00:39,449  -->  00:00:41,969
here you want to click on SDKs this is
16

16

00:00:41,969  -->  00:00:45,539
where we set up the Python SDK then in
17

17

00:00:45,539  -->  00:00:48,769
pycharm, I'm just going to start that up,
18

18

00:00:48,769  -->  00:00:51,149
the process is a little bit different
19

19

00:00:51,149  -->  00:00:54,350
it's a lot different
20

20

00:00:54,350  -->  00:00:56,370
basically come down here to configure,
21

21

00:00:56,370  -->  00:01:00,839
let me select settings over here on the
22

22

00:01:00,839  -->  00:01:02,309
left hand side we choose project
23

23

00:01:02,309  -->  00:01:04,710
interpreter and we click on this little
24

24

00:01:04,710  -->  00:01:06,330
cog to the right of the project
25

25

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:09,810
interpreter field and then we click on
26

26

00:01:09,810  -->  00:01:12,600
add and that keeps us this screen here
27

27

00:01:12,600  -->  00:01:13,950
where we can add the Python interpreter
28

28

00:01:13,950  -->  00:01:18,180
if we go back to IntelliJ we can do the
29

29

00:01:18,180  -->  00:01:19,650
similar we'll get to the same screen in
30

30

00:01:19,650  -->  00:01:22,170
IntelliJ by clicking on the plus and
31

31

00:01:22,170  -->  00:01:23,880
because we're in IntelliJ we've got a
32

32

00:01:23,880  -->  00:01:26,040
choice of multiple languages I'm going
33

33

00:01:26,040  -->  00:01:28,680
to select a Python SDK so that's
34

34

00:01:28,680  -->  00:01:31,500
basically now the same screen that we
35

35

00:01:31,500  -->  00:01:34,680
saw in Pycharm, now you see that its
36

36

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:35,820
popped up here is talking about a
37

37

00:01:35,820  -->  00:01:38,760
virtual environment virtually env
38

38

00:01:38,760  -->  00:01:41,160
I'm not going to discuss these virtual
39

39

00:01:41,160  -->  00:01:42,750
environments just yet we're gonna be
40

40

00:01:42,750  -->  00:01:44,520
looking at them later in the course what
41

41

00:01:44,520  -->  00:01:45,960
they are though is briefly a way of
42

42

00:01:45,960  -->  00:01:48,060
keeping your Python environment separate
43

43

00:01:48,060  -->  00:01:49,800
so that things you can store for one
44

44

00:01:49,800  -->  00:01:51,990
project don't affect other projects you
45

45

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:54,090
may be working on. So we will be looking
46

46

00:01:54,090  -->  00:01:56,040
at those from the command line, so I
47

47

00:01:56,040  -->  00:01:57,930
won't be discussing these specific
48

48

00:01:57,930  -->  00:02:00,480
IntelliJ or pycharm options because
49

49

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:02,520
obviously this is a Python course and
50

50

00:02:02,520  -->  00:02:05,040
not an IntelliJ or pycharm course but
51

51

00:02:05,040  -->  00:02:06,810
once you've explained about virtually
52

52

00:02:06,810  -->  00:02:08,399
env, these are these virtual
53

53

00:02:08,399  -->  00:02:09,899
environments these options will make
54

54

00:02:09,899  -->  00:02:12,330
more sense, for now though making sure
55

55

00:02:12,330  -->  00:02:14,250
you've got the virtual env environment
56

56

00:02:14,250  -->  00:02:18,300
search option selected in the left pane
57

57

00:02:18,300  -->  00:02:20,910
the new environment set up selected and
58

58

00:02:20,910  -->  00:02:22,710
again you'll do this for both IntelliJ
59

59

00:02:22,710  -->  00:02:24,840
and for PyCharm, you're gonna click on
60

60

00:02:24,840  -->  00:02:26,670
both these boxes inherit global site
61

61

00:02:26,670  -->  00:02:28,590
packages and make available to all
62

62

00:02:28,590  -->  00:02:31,620
projects, now the location here should be
63

63

00:02:31,620  -->  00:02:34,110
your home directory and if you only have
64

64

00:02:34,110  -->  00:02:36,090
a plan to use one version of Python and
65

65

00:02:36,090  -->  00:02:38,850
you can leave that location unchanged
66

66

00:02:38,850  -->  00:02:41,580
otherwise, you want to add a slash
67

67

00:02:41,580  -->  00:02:44,640
forward slash Python in the version that
68

68

00:02:44,640  -->  00:02:46,410
you're actually installing, now in my
69

69

00:02:46,410  -->  00:02:48,090
case you can see the base interpreters
70

70

00:02:48,090  -->  00:02:51,120
3.5 but you may have 3.6 or
71

71

00:02:51,120  -->  00:02:53,400
even 3.7 or if you're
72

72

00:02:53,400  -->  00:02:54,960
running an older version of Ubuntu is
73

73

00:02:54,960  -->  00:02:56,760
3.4, any of those will be
74

74

00:02:56,760  -->  00:02:58,800
fine and will work just fine with this
75

75

00:02:58,800  -->  00:03:02,070
course, I've selected Python 3.5 to match
76

76

00:03:02,070  -->  00:03:05,190
my base interpreter and in late 2018
77

77

00:03:05,190  -->  00:03:07,560
Linux distros will probably start using
78

78

00:03:07,560  -->  00:03:10,230
Python 3.7 so don't be too perturbed
79

79

00:03:10,230  -->  00:03:11,520
with the number slightly different long
80

80

00:03:11,520  -->  00:03:13,140
as long as it's version 3 points
81

81

00:03:13,140  -->  00:03:15,150
something you'd probably be good you'll
82

82

00:03:15,150  -->  00:03:16,560
be good to go and three point four would
83

83

00:03:16,560  -->  00:03:18,030
probably be the worst would be the
84

84

00:03:18,030  -->  00:03:19,410
lowest version that would be acceptable
85

85

00:03:19,410  -->  00:03:21,870
here, that's also fine and if for some
86

86

00:03:21,870  -->  00:03:23,459
reason there's no base interpreter
87

87

00:03:23,459  -->  00:03:25,530
selected you come everybody click on the
88

88

00:03:25,530  -->  00:03:27,570
ellipsis button and you can navigate or
89

89

00:03:27,570  -->  00:03:29,700
browse to the folder to where path is in
90

90

00:03:29,700  -->  00:03:30,930
store to your particular Linux
91

91

00:03:30,930  -->  00:03:33,120
installation but in my case everything
92

92

00:03:33,120  -->  00:03:35,400
is good to go here and what I'm
93

93

00:03:35,400  -->  00:03:38,370
going to do is click on ok, again you'll
94

94

00:03:38,370  -->  00:03:40,770
get a similar thing with PyCharm if you
95

95

00:03:40,770  -->  00:03:42,270
do this you can see that it's loaded up
96

96

00:03:42,270  -->  00:03:45,420
and once you've done that, you close it
97

97

00:03:45,420  -->  00:03:48,239
off by clicking on ok, at that point
98

98

00:03:48,239  -->  00:03:50,010
you've got an installation set up and
99

99

00:03:50,010  -->  00:03:53,160
ready to go. Now I want to show you a
100

100

00:03:53,160  -->  00:03:55,380
worrying error message that came up on
101

101

00:03:55,380  -->  00:03:58,800
Ubuntu 18.04 so if you get
102

102

00:03:58,800  -->  00:04:00,840
something like this showing up it looks
103

103

00:04:00,840  -->  00:04:02,820
horrible but don't worry if you see this
104

104

00:04:02,820  -->  00:04:05,940
dialog because it is ok and you can
105

105

00:04:05,940  -->  00:04:07,890
recover from that, now I didn't get
106

106

00:04:07,890  -->  00:04:09,900
that error but what I can do is put my
107

107

00:04:09,900  -->  00:04:11,250
installation that I've just completed
108

108

00:04:11,250  -->  00:04:13,950
into the same state and I can do that by
109

109

00:04:13,950  -->  00:04:16,260
going back in into intelliJ configure
110

110

00:04:16,260  -->  00:04:20,190
project defaults project structure and
111

111

00:04:20,190  -->  00:04:22,049
what I can do is again simulate that
112

112

00:04:22,049  -->  00:04:25,020
error by clicking on the installation in
113

113

00:04:25,020  -->  00:04:27,990
my case part of python 3.5 and clicking
114

114

00:04:27,990  -->  00:04:30,090
on the minus button to remove it,
115

115

00:04:30,090  -->  00:04:31,500
so effectively if you did get that error
116

116

00:04:31,500  -->  00:04:33,889
and only if you got that error this is how you
117

117

00:04:33,889  -->  00:04:36,260
know actually overcome that, so you click
118

118

00:04:36,260  -->  00:04:38,979
on plus again and do a similar thing for
119

119

00:04:38,979  -->  00:04:42,080
pycharm, click on Python SDK which you
120

120

00:04:42,080  -->  00:04:43,370
wouldn't need to do that for pycharm
121

121

00:04:43,370  -->  00:04:45,260
because it selects it automatically,
122

122

00:04:45,260  -->  00:04:46,729
the difference though is this time again if
123

123

00:04:46,729  -->  00:04:48,229
you have recovered from this error you
124

124

00:04:48,229  -->  00:04:50,150
click on an existing environment you
125

125

00:04:50,150  -->  00:04:52,010
click on make available for all projects,
126

126

00:04:52,010  -->  00:04:54,979
you click on the ellipses and you'd
127

127

00:04:54,979  -->  00:04:58,010
never get to the folder that was that
128

128

00:04:58,010  -->  00:04:59,360
was where the virtual environment was
129

129

00:04:59,360  -->  00:05:01,370
set up and if you recall it was home
130

130

00:05:01,370  -->  00:05:04,040
parallels in my case there's a folder
131

131

00:05:04,040  -->  00:05:07,580
called vemv, go into the Python
132

132

00:05:07,580  -->  00:05:09,289
3.5 which was the folder that I called
133

133

00:05:09,289  -->  00:05:11,419
it and into the bin folder the subfolder
134

134

00:05:11,419  -->  00:05:13,160
again and you need to select your
135

135

00:05:13,160  -->  00:05:14,960
various of python, in my case it was
136

136

00:05:14,960  -->  00:05:17,539
Python 3.5, he'd select whichever version
137

137

00:05:17,539  -->  00:05:19,720
was appropriate and then click on ok
138

138

00:05:19,720  -->  00:05:23,419
then we click on ok again and that would
139

139

00:05:23,419  -->  00:05:25,699
fix and recover you from that actual
140

140

00:05:25,699  -->  00:05:27,320
error and again you had only fourth
141

141

00:05:27,320  -->  00:05:29,360
perform those steps of deleting and re
142

142

00:05:29,360  -->  00:05:30,650
adding if you got that error if you
143

143

00:05:30,650  -->  00:05:32,630
didn't get the error which I didn't get
144

144

00:05:32,630  -->  00:05:34,550
that first time, then now you wouldn't
145

145

00:05:34,550  -->  00:05:36,860
have to do that well let's swing over
146

146

00:05:36,860  -->  00:05:38,960
now to pycharm and see what that looks
147

147

00:05:38,960  -->  00:05:42,680
like with the installation completed so
148

148

00:05:42,680  -->  00:05:46,160
looking at Pycharm you have something
149

149

00:05:46,160  -->  00:05:48,349
probably similar to this you'll have a
150

150

00:05:48,349  -->  00:05:51,139
project interpreter now selected and you
151

151

00:05:51,139  -->  00:05:54,050
click on ok and you see that it updates
152

152

00:05:54,050  -->  00:05:55,729
the part will be updating the Python
153

153

00:05:55,729  -->  00:05:57,880
interpreter the first time you do that
154

154

00:05:57,880  -->  00:06:02,210
give it a moment to complete let me go
155

155

00:06:02,210  -->  00:06:03,349
back into it again just have a look
156

156

00:06:03,349  -->  00:06:05,720
configuring settings and you'd have
157

157

00:06:05,720  -->  00:06:07,010
something like that once it's all fully
158

158

00:06:07,010  -->  00:06:09,050
configured and working properly.
159

159

00:06:09,050  -->  00:06:11,120
Alright I'm just going to okay that so
160

160

00:06:11,120  -->  00:06:12,830
this point now we go back to IntelliJ
161

161

00:06:12,830  -->  00:06:14,660
and click on ok to that we've now got
162

162

00:06:14,660  -->  00:06:16,849
the installation complete there's one
163

163

00:06:16,849  -->  00:06:18,830
other thing that I want you to check
164

164

00:06:18,830  -->  00:06:21,380
just to make sure that so we've got show
165

165

00:06:21,380  -->  00:06:24,260
line numbers enabled in the setup now
166

166

00:06:24,260  -->  00:06:26,780
this this step is the same for both IDEs
167

167

00:06:26,780  -->  00:06:30,820
like you can't configure choose settings
168

168

00:06:30,820  -->  00:06:33,970
we want to come down here expand editor
169

169

00:06:33,970  -->  00:06:37,160
and expand general they're going to
170

170

00:06:37,160  -->  00:06:40,370
click on appearance we just want to make
171

171

00:06:40,370  -->  00:06:41,690
sure here that the show line numbers
172

172

00:06:41,690  -->  00:06:43,990
option is checked
173

173

00:06:43,990  -->  00:06:46,000
if it isn't make sure you do check it click
174

174

00:06:46,000  -->  00:06:48,310
ok and that's because it's very handy to
175

175

00:06:48,310  -->  00:06:49,800
see the line numbers in your code
176

176

00:06:49,800  -->  00:06:51,640
especially when you get errors and the
177

177

00:06:51,640  -->  00:06:53,440
error message talks about say line six
178

178

00:06:53,440  -->  00:06:55,510
for example but you can see the
179

179

00:06:55,510  -->  00:06:57,700
installation automatically had that show
180

180

00:06:57,700  -->  00:06:59,350
line numbers option enabled and I didn't
181

181

00:06:59,350  -->  00:07:01,090
need to do anything but just check it if
182

182

00:07:01,090  -->  00:07:02,770
it's not already enabled. Alright I'm
183

183

00:07:02,770  -->  00:07:04,420
going to close that, at this point now
184

184

00:07:04,420  -->  00:07:05,920
we've finished the configuration for
185

185

00:07:05,920  -->  00:07:08,650
IntelliJ IDEA and for PyCharm and we're
186

186

00:07:08,650  -->  00:07:10,930
ready to start programming. So in section 5,
187

187

00:07:10,930  -->  00:07:13,360
we'll write our first program I'll see
188

188

00:07:13,360  -->  00:07:16,110
you in next section.
