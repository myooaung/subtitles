00:00:04.720  -->  00:00:09.340
So at the moment, we're remastering this course,
and that means that we're re-recording it.

2

00:00:09.340  -->  00:00:13.190
So we're actually using larger fonts, we're
updating the content, and just generally,

3

00:00:13.190  -->  00:00:16.890
by doing this, we're making it a better course,
and a better learning experience for you.

4

00:00:16.890  -->  00:00:18.270
So why are we giving this away?

5

00:00:18.270  -->  00:00:19.869
A free 100% upgrade?

6

00:00:19.869  -->  00:00:21.189
Well, that's how we roll.

7

00:00:21.189  -->  00:00:23.399
We want to make this a
great experience for you.

8

00:00:23.399  -->  00:00:27.399
Seriously, though, apart from the changes
that I've mentioned, we're also looking at

9

00:00:27.399  -->  00:00:28.399
common areas.

10

00:00:28.399  -->  00:00:33.530
There has been a few videos, here and there,
that have been perhaps a little bit harder than

11

00:00:33.530  -->  00:00:35.250
other areas to understand.

12

00:00:35.250  -->  00:00:38.730
What we're doing is, in those scenarios, we're
just really adjusting the content, just making

13

00:00:38.730  -->  00:00:42.980
sure it's as easy and comprehensive
as we can make it.

14

00:00:42.980  -->  00:00:46.790
And this helps you to learn things at a quicker
pace - which obviously is a good thing.

15

00:00:46.790  -->  00:00:50.890
Now, another thing we've done, based on student
feedback, is we've now got slides available

16

00:00:50.890  -->  00:00:51.890
to download.

17

00:00:51.890  -->  00:00:55.890
So see the bonus lecture, the very last video
in this course, for more details about how you

18

00:00:55.890  -->  00:00:57.340
can get access to the slides.

19

00:00:57.340  -->  00:01:01.960
But getting back to the remastered content,
it's substantially, keep in mind, it's substanatially

20

00:01:01.960  -->  00:01:04.199
the same content that exists now.

21

00:01:04.199  -->  00:01:07.860
It's just improved, and actually looks better,
and it's easier to see on the screen.

22

00:01:07.860  -->  00:01:10.720
We're actually doing one section at a time.

23

00:01:10.720  -->  00:01:14.930
Once we complete an entire section, we'll
replace the old version of the videos with

24

00:01:14.930  -->  00:01:15.930
the new videos.

25

00:01:15.930  -->  00:01:16.930
So keep that in mind.

26

00:01:16.930  -->  00:01:20.790
It's a work in progresss, and you can see
information in the Work In Progress section,

27

00:01:20.790  -->  00:01:23.619
towards the end of the course, as to what
we're working on; and what hasn't been copied

28

00:01:23.619  -->  00:01:25.780
over into the new section.

29

00:01:25.780  -->  00:01:28.670
Now one question you might have is,
which section should you work on?

30

00:01:28.670  -->  00:01:32.709
Should you wait for the new content, or should
you just continue working through the existing

31

00:01:32.709  -->  00:01:33.709
content.

32

00:01:33.709  -->  00:01:37.539
Well our suggestion is to work through the course.

33

00:01:37.539  -->  00:01:38.579
Don't wait for the new content.

34

00:01:38.579  -->  00:01:41.649
When the content's there, sure,
go over and start using that.

35

00:01:41.649  -->  00:01:45.420
But just keep going through a section at a
time, as it is, because this course has been

36

00:01:45.420  -->  00:01:47.060
proven and tested for many years.

37

00:01:47.060  -->  00:01:48.530
We're just making it a bit better.

38

00:01:48.530  -->  00:01:52.929
In other words, don't wait for that old content,
keep in mind, don't wait for that new content,

39

00:01:52.929  -->  00:01:53.929
I should say.

40

00:01:53.929  -->  00:01:58.829
The old content is still 100% relevant, and
will help you become a productive programmer

41

00:01:58.829  -->  00:02:00.849
in the shortest possible time.

42

00:02:00.849  -->  00:02:03.099
Alright, I hope you enjoy this new content.

43

00:02:03.099  -->  00:02:04.210
Let's move on now to the next video.
