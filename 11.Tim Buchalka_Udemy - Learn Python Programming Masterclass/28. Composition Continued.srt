00:00:05,580  -->  00:00:07,730
now towards the end of the last video I
2

2

00:00:07,730  -->  00:00:09,990
mentioned that if we were going to fully
3

3

00:00:09,990  -->  00:00:12,060
implement the header then we could get
4

4

00:00:12,060  -->  00:00:14,430
our head class the same ability to add
5

5

00:00:14,430  -->  00:00:16,890
tags and build up its contents and in
6

6

00:00:16,890  -->  00:00:18,780
fact we might create a special kind of
7

7

00:00:18,780  -->  00:00:21,350
tag class that can contain other tags
8

8

00:00:21,350  -->  00:00:24,210
and then have both head and body inherit
9

9

00:00:24,210  -->  00:00:25,950
from that but we are keeping things
10

10

00:00:25,950  -->  00:00:27,630
simple here and at this point we've now
11

11

00:00:27,630  -->  00:00:30,030
got all the classes that make up our
12

12

00:00:30,030  -->  00:00:32,490
HTML document and we can create the
13

13

00:00:32,490  -->  00:00:34,410
document class let's go ahead and do
14

14

00:00:34,410  -->  00:00:38,060
that in the bottom
15

15

00:00:38,060  -->  00:00:48,260
ok so....
16

16

00:00:48,260  -->  00:00:50,760
....
17

17

00:00:50,760  -->  00:01:08,580
....
18

18

00:01:08,580  -->  00:01:14,550
...
19

19

00:01:14,550  -->  00:01:17,760
...
20

20

00:01:17,760  -->  00:01:22,440
...this init method
21

21

00:01:22,440  -->  00:01:25,170
defines three data attributes to hold
22

22

00:01:25,170  -->  00:01:28,320
the doctype head and body of a HTML
23

23

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:31,200
document now in all three cases a new
24

24

00:01:31,200  -->  00:01:32,880
object of the appropriate classes
25

25

00:01:32,880  -->  00:01:35,190
created as you can see and each attribute
26

26

00:01:35,190  -->  00:01:36,660
is assigned a reference to the new
27

27

00:01:36,660  -->  00:01:42,000
object so our HTML dot class is made up
28

28

00:01:42,000  -->  00:01:44,790
of instances of the three other classes
29

29

00:01:44,790  -->  00:01:47,280
so you could say that it's composed of
30

30

00:01:47,280  -->  00:01:49,410
the three other classes and that's
31

31

00:01:49,410  -->  00:01:52,020
composition now this example is pretty
32

32

00:01:52,020  -->  00:01:54,900
uncomplicated because the HTML. class
33

33

00:01:54,900  -->  00:01:57,660
is entirely composed of other classes it
34

34

00:01:57,660  -->  00:01:59,460
doesn't have any data attributes of its
35

35

00:01:59,460  -->  00:02:00,000
own
36

36

00:02:00,000  -->  00:02:02,070
now that doesn't have to be the case so
37

37

00:02:02,070  -->  00:02:03,330
I don't want to give the impression that
38

38

00:02:03,330  -->  00:02:05,640
composition means creating a class and
39

39

00:02:05,640  -->  00:02:07,470
entirely out of other classes
40

40

00:02:07,470  -->  00:02:09,840
the important thing is that our HTML
41

41

00:02:09,840  -->  00:02:12,380
. class contains other classes and
42

42

00:02:12,380  -->  00:02:14,360
can make use of the attributes that
43

43

00:02:14,360  -->  00:02:16,880
those classes provide alright i'll
44

44

00:02:16,880  -->  00:02:18,060
carry on with the code
45

45

00:02:18,060  -->  00:02:20,490
so we can see this program working and
46

46

00:02:20,490  -->  00:02:23,310
how it produces a html doc so we
47

47

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:26,010
want to add a method....
48

48

00:02:26,010  -->  00:02:27,540
...
49

49

00:02:27,540  -->  00:02:30,750
....
50

50

00:02:30,750  -->  00:02:36,090
...
51

51

00:02:36,090  -->  00:02:37,380
....
52

52

00:02:37,380  -->  00:02:42,060
....
53

53

00:02:42,060  -->  00:02:47,850
...we need to
54

54

00:02:47,850  -->  00:02:50,520
add content to our document and HTML
55

55

00:02:50,520  -->  00:02:53,730
content consists of various tags so what
56

56

00:02:53,730  -->  00:02:56,010
given the html. class and add tag or
57

57

00:02:56,010  -->  00:02:57,780
add_tagged method to allow
58

58

00:02:57,780  -->  00:03:00,360
tags to be added to the document this
59

59

00:03:00,360  -->  00:03:02,160
method just delegates the job of adding
60

60

00:03:02,160  -->  00:03:04,740
a tag to its instance of the body class
61

61

00:03:04,740  -->  00:03:06,870
the body class takes care of
62

62

00:03:06,870  -->  00:03:09,360
implementing the process of adding a new
63

63

00:03:09,360  -->  00:03:12,930
tag to its contents the HTML . class
64

64

00:03:12,930  -->  00:03:14,550
just passes on the name of the tag and
65

65

00:03:14,550  -->  00:03:16,980
the contents as you can see on line 53
66

66

00:03:16,980  -->  00:03:19,350
now we could have called this method
67

67

00:03:19,350  -->  00:03:21,180
anything add_content for
68

68

00:03:21,180  -->  00:03:23,820
example but by giving it the same name
69

69

00:03:23,820  -->  00:03:26,130
as the class that will actually be doing
70

70

00:03:26,130  -->  00:03:28,380
the work for us our body class in this
71

71

00:03:28,380  -->  00:03:31,110
case we can pass the HTML document
72

72

00:03:31,110  -->  00:03:33,480
object to any function that adds tags
73

73

00:03:33,480  -->  00:03:36,270
now the other thing we want to do with
74

74

00:03:36,270  -->  00:03:39,270
html objects is display so i'm
75

75

00:03:39,270  -->  00:03:45,960
going to add a display method....
76

76

00:03:45,960  -->  00:03:48,840
....
77

77

00:03:48,840  -->  00:03:52,320
....
78

78

00:03:52,320  -->  00:03:57,960
...
79

79

00:03:57,960  -->  00:04:07,110
...
80

80

00:04:07,110  -->  00:04:09,840
....
81

81

00:04:09,840  -->  00:04:17,820
....
82

82

00:04:17,820  -->  00:04:22,230
so once again this method delegates most
83

83

00:04:22,230  -->  00:04:24,770
of the work to the classes that contains
84

84

00:04:24,770  -->  00:04:28,500
so the DTD is displayed by calling the
85

85

00:04:28,500  -->  00:04:31,470
doc type instances display method now after
86

86

00:04:31,470  -->  00:04:33,720
the DTD everything else is enclosed in
87

87

00:04:33,720  -->  00:04:37,110
the HTML opening and closing tags on line
88

88

00:04:37,110  -->  00:04:40,650
57 and 60 now we could have created a
89

89

00:04:40,650  -->  00:04:42,840
class to handle that but that's really
90

90

00:04:42,840  -->  00:04:44,190
going to be too far
91

91

00:04:44,190  -->  00:04:46,140
there's only one html tag in a
92

92

00:04:46,140  -->  00:04:48,360
document and hard coding like this is a
93

93

00:04:48,360  -->  00:04:51,180
much simpler solution now the display
94

94

00:04:51,180  -->  00:04:53,520
the remaining content is also delegated
95

95

00:04:53,520  -->  00:04:56,430
to the appropriate classes so apart from
96

96

00:04:56,430  -->  00:04:58,260
including the opening and closing HTML
97

97

00:04:58,260  -->  00:05:01,020
tag our documents display method
98

98

00:05:01,020  -->  00:05:02,670
doesn't have a lot to do
99

99

00:05:02,670  -->  00:05:04,380
once again we could have called this
100

100

00:05:04,380  -->  00:05:06,420
method anything but by calling it
101

101

00:05:06,420  -->  00:05:08,910
display it matches the corresponding
102

102

00:05:08,910  -->  00:05:11,010
method in the classes its composed of
103

103

00:05:11,010  -->  00:05:13,800
by calling the method display it can then
104

104

00:05:13,800  -->  00:05:16,770
be used by any function that displays
105

105

00:05:16,770  -->  00:05:20,400
tag objects in fact the method it has are
106

106

00:05:20,400  -->  00:05:22,140
exactly the same as the method in the
107

107

00:05:22,140  -->  00:05:25,830
body class so our HTML dot class is now
108

108

00:05:25,830  -->  00:05:28,860
displaying polymorphic behavior it is a
109

109

00:05:28,860  -->  00:05:31,320
html doc but it can also be used
110

110

00:05:31,320  -->  00:05:34,140
in place of a body object it can even be
111

111

00:05:34,140  -->  00:05:35,670
used in place of any of our tag
112

112

00:05:35,670  -->  00:05:38,520
subclasses when pass to functions that
113

113

00:05:38,520  -->  00:05:40,830
just need to display method so we've
114

114

00:05:40,830  -->  00:05:42,840
implemented polymorphism without using
115

115

00:05:42,840  -->  00:05:45,180
inheritance we've used composition
116

116

00:05:45,180  -->  00:05:48,150
instead now the program itself does use
117

117

00:05:48,150  -->  00:05:50,430
inheritance all our other classes
118

118

00:05:50,430  -->  00:05:53,160
inherit from tagged but the HTML doc type
119

119

00:05:53,160  -->  00:05:55,920
isn't a subclass of tag it provides the
120

120

00:05:55,920  -->  00:05:58,290
same methods as their tags but does so
121

121

00:05:58,290  -->  00:06:00,330
by defining methods with the same name
122

122

00:06:00,330  -->  00:06:03,060
and then delegating the implementation
123

123

00:06:03,060  -->  00:06:04,920
of those methods to the classes that is
124

124

00:06:04,920  -->  00:06:07,290
composed of alright so let's see this
125

125

00:06:07,290  -->  00:06:09,290
running to make sure that this theory
126

126

00:06:09,290  -->  00:06:11,010
that we've been talking about does work
127

127

00:06:11,010  -->  00:06:14,370
in practice so we're going to add a
128

128

00:06:14,370  -->  00:06:16,470
method down here....
129

129

00:06:16,470  -->  00:06:19,040
....
130

130

00:06:19,040  -->  00:06:22,140
....
131

131

00:06:22,140  -->  00:06:25,230
...
132

132

00:06:25,230  -->  00:06:27,970
....
133

133

00:06:27,970  -->  00:06:33,490
....
134

134

00:06:33,490  -->  00:06:37,270
...
135

135

00:06:37,270  -->  00:06:42,520
....
136

136

00:06:42,520  -->  00:06:45,940
....
137

137

00:06:45,940  -->  00:06:48,040
...
138

138

00:06:48,040  -->  00:06:50,680
....
139

139

00:06:50,680  -->  00:06:54,190
....
140

140

00:06:54,190  -->  00:06:58,420
...
141

141

00:06:58,420  -->  00:07:27,100
...
142

142

00:07:27,100  -->  00:07:30,700
...creating a new
143

143

00:07:30,700  -->  00:07:33,070
HTML object and then were assigning the
144

144

00:07:33,070  -->  00:07:35,290
reference to it to a very variable
145

145

00:07:35,290  -->  00:07:38,050
called my_page so next we
146

146

00:07:38,050  -->  00:07:40,360
use this add_tag method to add a
147

147

00:07:40,360  -->  00:07:42,850
heading and a subheading now the add_tag
148

148

00:07:42,850  -->  00:07:45,010
method remember just
149

149

00:07:45,010  -->  00:07:46,840
delegate to the body classes add
150

150

00:07:46,840  -->  00:07:48,730
underscore tag method so these elements
151

151

00:07:48,730  -->  00:07:50,440
will really be added to the body section
152

152

00:07:50,440  -->  00:07:52,810
so effectively we're building up the
153

153

00:07:52,810  -->  00:07:55,120
document by calling the add_tag
154

154

00:07:55,120  -->  00:07:56,950
method to add the content that we want
155

155

00:07:56,950  -->  00:07:59,050
when we done the last line we're calling
156

156

00:07:59,050  -->  00:08:00,850
the display method to display the
157

157

00:08:00,850  -->  00:08:02,020
finished document
158

158

00:08:02,020  -->  00:08:03,910
alright so let's just run the program
159

159

00:08:03,910  -->  00:08:06,580
need to put a colon in that line
160

160

00:08:06,580  -->  00:08:10,780
correct on line are 63 and run this
161

161

00:08:10,780  -->  00:08:13,300
now
162

162

00:08:13,300  -->  00:08:15,340
and we got an error over here and we can see
163

163

00:08:15,340  -->  00:08:16,990
that the typo looks to me that I've use
164

164

00:08:16,990  -->  00:08:20,050
start _ capital T so just click on
165

165

00:08:20,050  -->  00:08:21,970
that to go to the link that's the
166

166

00:08:21,970  -->  00:08:23,620
problem you can see added a capital T
167

167

00:08:23,620  -->  00:08:26,620
i'll make the lowercase T because
168

168

00:08:26,620  -->  00:08:29,170
obviously the the attributes
169

169

00:08:29,170  -->  00:08:31,360
should be or have rather a lowercase T
170

170

00:08:31,360  -->  00:08:32,230
in its name
171

171

00:08:32,230  -->  00:08:35,680
let's just try running it again and this
172

172

00:08:35,680  -->  00:08:37,210
time we seem to fix it which is much
173

173

00:08:37,210  -->  00:08:38,120
better
174

174

00:08:38,120  -->  00:08:40,270
alright so you can see now if
175

175

00:08:40,270  -->  00:08:42,790
you familiar with HTML that this is now
176

176

00:08:42,790  -->  00:08:45,710
perfectly formed HTML code
177

177

00:08:45,710  -->  00:08:47,330
now it's not as readable as it would be
178

178

00:08:47,330  -->  00:08:49,640
if a human it type it manually but line
179

179

00:08:49,640  -->  00:08:51,650
breaks are ignored in HTML documents
180

180

00:08:51,650  -->  00:08:53,690
there only added to make it easy for
181

181

00:08:53,690  -->  00:08:56,330
humans to read if you're not familiar
182

182

00:08:56,330  -->  00:08:58,550
with HTML the real test will be if it
183

183

00:08:58,550  -->  00:09:01,210
displays correctly in a browser so let's
184

184

00:09:01,210  -->  00:09:02,690
actually make a change so that we could
185

185

00:09:02,690  -->  00:09:05,140
write the document out to a file instead
186

186

00:09:05,140  -->  00:09:07,090
of just printing it now the only changes
187

187

00:09:07,090  -->  00:09:09,400
we need to make are to the three display
188

188

00:09:09,400  -->  00:09:11,450
methods i'm going to start with the base
189

189

00:09:11,450  -->  00:09:13,790
class the tag classes go back up and
190

190

00:09:13,790  -->  00:09:16,010
look at that
191

191

00:09:16,010  -->  00:09:18,140
so the display method here on the line
192

192

00:09:18,140  -->  00:09:20,890
11 we want to change that what we're
193

193

00:09:20,890  -->  00:09:23,510
going to do is add another parameter here
194

194

00:09:23,510  -->  00:09:25,520
so after the display itself...
195

195

00:09:25,520  -->  00:09:29,830
....
196

196

00:09:29,830  -->  00:09:35,300
....
197

197

00:09:35,300  -->  00:09:38,710
ok so we've added a named parameter called
198

198

00:09:38,710  -->  00:09:41,060
file that matches the file parameter of
199

199

00:09:41,060  -->  00:09:43,130
the print function so we need to
200

200

00:09:43,130  -->  00:09:47,000
do the same in the body class down here
201

201

00:09:47,000  -->  00:09:48,560
under display in the body class on line
202

202

00:09:48,560  -->  00:09:54,640
38....
203

203

00:09:54,640  -->  00:09:58,130
...
204

204

00:09:58,130  -->  00:10:01,010
....
205

205

00:10:01,010  -->  00:10:04,370
alright so we added a filename parameter
206

206

00:10:04,370  -->  00:10:06,400
as you can see there to this method as
207

207

00:10:06,400  -->  00:10:08,450
well and then provide the default value
208

208

00:10:08,450  -->  00:10:11,930
of none so if a file isn't specified the
209

209

00:10:11,930  -->  00:10:13,340
class will be printed to the screen
210

210

00:10:13,340  -->  00:10:16,130
effectively alright so now the
211

211

00:10:16,130  -->  00:10:18,560
display method of the html. class
212

212

00:10:18,560  -->  00:10:22,550
ok so down here in the display method
213

213

00:10:22,550  -->  00:10:27,590
we put....
214

214

00:10:27,590  -->  00:10:30,010
....
215

215

00:10:30,010  -->  00:10:32,140
...
216

216

00:10:32,140  -->  00:10:36,460
....
217

217

00:10:36,460  -->  00:10:39,230
...
218

218

00:10:39,230  -->  00:10:58,580
...
219

219

00:10:58,580  -->  00:11:01,520
....so now that we've done that we can
220

220

00:11:01,520  -->  00:11:03,510
now send the output to a file if we want
221

221

00:11:03,510  -->  00:11:05,730
to using the technique we saw back in
222

222

00:11:05,730  -->  00:11:08,090
Section 10 when we're writing to files
223

223

00:11:08,090  -->  00:11:11,580
so let's end this video here now in the
224

224

00:11:11,580  -->  00:11:13,400
next video we'll come back and test
225

225

00:11:13,400  -->  00:11:14,760
this will talk a little bit more about
226

226

00:11:14,760  -->  00:11:17,010
composition and then we'll move on to a
227

227

00:11:17,010  -->  00:11:23,870
challenge see you in the next video
