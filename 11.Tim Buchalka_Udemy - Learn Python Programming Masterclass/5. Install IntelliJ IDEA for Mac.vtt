00:00:03.920  -->  00:00:09.540
In this video we're going to download and
install IntelliJ IDEA, which is the IDE

2

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:13.580
Integrated Development Environmental
editor, program if you will, that we're

3

00:00:13.580  -->  00:00:17.180
going to be using to run our programs in
this course, to actually create and run

4

00:00:17.180  -->  00:00:20.700
our programs, for that matter. So to
download that, we're going to go to

5

00:00:20.700  -->  00:00:25.760
jetbrains.com, www.jetbrains.com

6

00:00:26.000  -->  00:00:31.260
Once we get there we're going to come up to the
Tools menu at the top, select IntelliJ IDEA,

7

00:00:31.260  -->  00:00:37.900
you can see here, click on that. Click on
download.

8

00:00:37.900  -->  00:00:42.280
You can click on this little I agree, just to get rid of that on the screen. Now you've got two options here,

9

00:00:42.280  -->  00:00:46.660
when you go to download IntelliJ IDEA. You can
grab the Community Edition which we'll

10

00:00:46.660  -->  00:00:50.300
be doing, which is free open source.
You'll never need to pay for it.

11

00:00:50.300  -->  00:00:55.100
Alternatively you can choose the
Ultimate Edition which gives you the few

12

00:00:55.100  -->  00:00:59.390
extra options, and basically is for
commercial developers. You can see if I

13

00:00:59.390  -->  00:01:03.380
scroll down, there's some extra features
there; Javascript, Typescript, Java

14

00:01:03.380  -->  00:01:06.100
Enterprise Edition, Spring etc. So
basically, it gives you more

15

00:01:06.110  -->  00:01:09.890
functionality, which is how the company
makes their money, but the fact that they

16

00:01:09.890  -->  00:01:13.520
offer a free version, which is fully
featured and certainly enough for you

17

00:01:13.520  -->  00:01:17.870
to use in this course, is fantastic.
So we're going to click on download, here,

18

00:01:17.870  -->  00:01:21.780
to download the Community Edition.

19

00:01:21.960  -->  00:01:25.980
Alright, so I'm now gonna give that a
moment now to complete.

20

00:01:25.980  -->  00:01:31.200
Alright, you can see that IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition,
that's the C in IDEA there,

21

00:01:31.200  -->  00:01:38.140
has finished downloading. Click on the little
magnifying glass there to open Finder.

22

00:01:38.140  -->  00:01:41.390
We're going to double click the
dmg file to start installing it.

23

00:01:41.390  -->  00:01:47.220
I'm going to close down Safari because we
don't need that anymore,

24

00:01:47.220  -->  00:01:52.220
and I'll close down the Finder window for now as well because we really don't need that either.

25

00:01:52.220  -->  00:01:56.500
Drag it into applications, as no doubt you've
done before with applications on a Mac.

26

00:01:56.500  -->  00:01:59.220
Give that a moment to install.

27

00:01:59.220  -->  00:02:03.220
So I mentioned we're going to do some configuration of IntelliJ IDEA in another video,

28

00:02:03.220  -->  00:02:08.160
but we'll do the first parts of it in this video. So I'm going to go down now and double-click on the IntelliJ

29

00:02:08.160  -->  00:02:12.980
icon, IntelliJ IDEA CE. CE stands for
Community Edition. That's the free

30

00:02:12.980  -->  00:02:16.550
version that we've downloaded and now
installed. Double-click that to start off

31

00:02:16.580  -->  00:02:21.720
the process. I'm going to close down Finder now,
and close down the install window there,

32

00:02:21.720  -->  00:02:26.030
the installation, and I'll actually eject
IntelliJ IDEA CE because we've now

33

00:02:26.030  -->  00:02:28.660
finished with the installation.

34

00:02:28.660  -->  00:02:30.920
Alright we've got an option here telling us that it's from the app,

35

00:02:30.940  -->  00:02:33.640
the app is being downloaded from the internet, Are you sure?

36

00:02:33.640  -->  00:02:38.420
Well it's from jetbrains.com, which is the
official site for IntelliJ, so that's fine.

37

00:02:38.420  -->  00:02:41.260
I'm going to click on open as you saw.

38

00:02:41.260  -->  00:02:45.110
We're prompted for this option: If you're
installing IntelliJ IDEA for the first

39

00:02:45.110  -->  00:02:48.700
time, we haven't got any settings to
import, but if you had a previous

40

00:02:48.700  -->  00:02:52.360
installation you could click on the top
option, Config installation folder,

41

00:02:52.360  -->  00:02:55.900
and basically that would give the option to
drag those settings from the previous

42

00:02:55.900  -->  00:02:59.060
version into this current version, this
new version we're installing.

43

00:02:59.060  -->  00:03:03.620
I'm going to select Do not import settings because
it's a brand new install. Click OK.

44

00:03:03.620  -->  00:03:08.120
Privacy politic policy there, check the
check box, click on continue. You can read

45

00:03:08.120  -->  00:03:13.380
that if you like. We can send anonymous
data about features and plugins if you want.

46

00:03:13.380  -->  00:03:17.880
I generally click on Don't send but
you can choose either option.

47

00:03:17.880  -->  00:03:22.300
We're now presented with an option; which type of
screen color you would like. I'm going to

48

00:03:22.300  -->  00:03:27.440
leave mine set to light, and light comes
out better for videos, but if you prefer

49

00:03:27.440  -->  00:03:30.820
to use darkula, and that's my
development machine, is certainly using

50

00:03:30.820  -->  00:03:33.740
that - it's easier on the eyes - then select
that, but choose whichever one you want,

51

00:03:33.740  -->  00:03:38.800
noting you can change these options
later in Preferences. I'm gonna click on next.

52

00:03:38.800  -->  00:03:40.940
Keymap scheme, I'm going to leave us defaults.

53

00:03:40.940  -->  00:03:44.120
If you've used IntelliJ IDEA
before, you can change that by choosing the

54

00:03:44.120  -->  00:03:48.950
option on the right. I'm going to click on Next.
This gives you the option to invoke

55

00:03:48.950  -->  00:03:53.060
IntelliJ IDEA from the command line, if
that's something you're doing or have

56

00:03:53.060  -->  00:03:56.600
done in the past, or want to do from the
command line, and check the box.

57

00:03:56.600  -->  00:04:00.120
There's no harm in doing it, in any event, so  I'm going to do that.

58

00:04:00.120  -->  00:04:05.480
You've got various tools here, and keep in mind that if
you've chosen to download and install

59

00:04:05.480  -->  00:04:09.440
the Ultimate Edition, there'll be
additional features here. Generally I

60

00:04:09.440  -->  00:04:12.530
just leave everything as is and I don't
change anything, because you can always

61

00:04:12.530  -->  00:04:16.920
change plugins and add new plugins at a
later time as well. Click on Next.

62

00:04:16.920  -->  00:04:20.560
Same deal there. I'm not going to change
any of those settings. You can come back to it

63

00:04:20.560  -->  00:04:25.180
and you can see down here, preferences
plugins, if you do want to change that in the future.

64

00:04:25.180  -->  00:04:28.520
Click on Start using IntelliJ
IDEA,

65

00:04:28.520  -->  00:04:33.160
enter my password,

66

00:04:33.200  -->  00:04:37.660
and IntelliJ IDEA should
start up for us now.

67

00:04:37.660  -->  00:04:42.280
Ok, so at this point we're now done. I'm going to end the
video here. There is another video that

68

00:04:42.280  -->  00:04:45.220
we'll go through, and we'll go through
and enter, or do the configuration

69

00:04:45.220  -->  00:04:48.880
for IntelliJ IDEA, and 
that's actually connecting the SDKs and

70

00:04:48.880  -->  00:04:52.740
so on that we need for this course, but
we'll do all that in a separate video.

71

00:04:52.740  -->  00:04:56.800
Thanks for watching. Let's move on now to the next video.
