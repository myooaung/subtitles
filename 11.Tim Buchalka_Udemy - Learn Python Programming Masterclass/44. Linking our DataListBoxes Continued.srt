00:00:04,460  -->  00:00:07,510
<v ->Alright, so continuing on with our project.</v>
2

2

00:00:07,510  -->  00:00:09,330
We're almost done at this point,
3

3

00:00:09,330  -->  00:00:12,730
but what if our data listBox isn't linked to another one?
4

4

00:00:12,730  -->  00:00:13,750
So we're going to need some way
5

5

00:00:13,750  -->  00:00:15,830
of linking two listBoxes together
6

6

00:00:15,830  -->  00:00:20,700
and this on_select method you can see here on line 59.
7

7

00:00:20,700  -->  00:00:22,410
Well, that should only try to requery
8

8

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:24,930
another listBox if there actually is one.
9

9

00:00:24,930  -->  00:00:26,160
Now in a minute, what we're going to do
10

10

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:28,250
is add another couple of fields to the class
11

11

00:00:28,250  -->  00:00:29,680
to handle the link.
12

12

00:00:29,680  -->  00:00:31,690
We're gonna finish off this method first, though.
13

13

00:00:31,690  -->  00:00:33,180
We're gonna get it to check
14

14

00:00:33,180  -->  00:00:34,910
that there is a link to this box
15

15

00:00:34,910  -->  00:00:39,020
before trying to requery one, so let's do that.
16

16

00:00:39,020  -->  00:00:41,270
We're going to put if self.
17

17

00:00:42,490  -->  00:00:45,660
so that's linked, and it's called box:
18

18

00:00:46,680  -->  00:00:49,110
we're gonna add that field shortly as I said,
19

19

00:00:49,110  -->  00:00:50,530
and then we're going to indent everything else.
20

20

00:00:50,530  -->  00:00:53,490
I'm gonna remove this extra commented out code now,
21

21

00:00:53,490  -->  00:00:55,650
which we no longer need.
22

22

00:00:55,650  -->  00:00:58,570
I'm also going to indent this code.
23

23

00:00:59,820  -->  00:01:03,630
And I'll just put another tab or space in there
24

24

00:01:03,630  -->  00:01:05,350
because IntelliJ was complaining
25

25

00:01:05,350  -->  00:01:08,850
that the hash was too close to the code,
26

26

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:10,300
you need to put at least two spaces
27

27

00:01:10,300  -->  00:01:11,800
when you're actually adding a comment.
28

28

00:01:11,800  -->  00:01:13,550
So I've got rid of that warning.
29

29

00:01:13,550  -->  00:01:15,080
The other thing we're going to do here
30

30

00:01:15,080  -->  00:01:17,750
is change this albumList.requery,
31

31

00:01:17,750  -->  00:01:22,600
let's change that self.linked_box is what it should be.
32

32

00:01:22,600  -->  00:01:26,100
So that's self.linked_box.requery link id,
33

33

00:01:29,570  -->  00:01:32,650
so we haven't got the aristList hard coded anymore.
34

34

00:01:32,650  -->  00:01:34,980
So before we can see the new class working
35

35

00:01:34,980  -->  00:01:36,520
we need to add a way to link
36

36

00:01:36,520  -->  00:01:38,560
one data listBox to another.
37

37

00:01:38,560  -->  00:01:40,600
Now, not all listBoxes will be linked.
38

38

00:01:40,600  -->  00:01:43,300
Our songs list doesn't cause another box to be updated
39

39

00:01:43,300  -->  00:01:45,680
and we may want to use a single data listBox
40

40

00:01:45,680  -->  00:01:47,640
to display a database table
41

41

00:01:47,640  -->  00:01:50,120
without linking it to anything else.
42

42

00:01:50,120  -->  00:01:52,950
So rather than insisting that another data listBox
43

43

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:55,450
is provided in the class init method,
44

44

00:01:55,450  -->  00:01:57,230
we're going to add a link method
45

45

00:01:57,230  -->  00:01:59,190
that can be used if required.
46

46

00:01:59,190  -->  00:02:00,630
Now we're going to use the link method
47

47

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:03,650
by passing it a widget that we wanna link to
48

48

00:02:03,650  -->  00:02:06,250
and a database column that forms that link,
49

49

00:02:06,250  -->  00:02:07,580
and that means we're going to need
50

50

00:02:07,580  -->  00:02:10,450
another couple of data attributes in our class.
51

51

00:02:10,450  -->  00:02:13,680
Let's go back up to the top and add those data attributes,
52

52

00:02:13,680  -->  00:02:14,920
and we're going to put them just after
53

53

00:02:14,920  -->  00:02:17,760
the super call here in line 30.
54

54

00:02:17,760  -->  00:02:21,930
So first one, self. and it's going to be linked_box,
55

55

00:02:22,870  -->  00:02:25,290
we set that to none initially,
56

56

00:02:25,290  -->  00:02:27,950
and likewise for self.link_field
57

57

00:02:28,970  -->  00:02:30,490
we're going to set that to none,
58

58

00:02:30,490  -->  00:02:33,110
so that's our two attributes.
59

59

00:02:33,110  -->  00:02:34,410
And again, we're defaulting to none
60

60

00:02:34,410  -->  00:02:36,380
so that there's no link to start with.
61

61

00:02:36,380  -->  00:02:38,580
Now, if we need to link two listBoxes
62

62

00:02:38,580  -->  00:02:40,610
then we're going to call that link method,
63

63

00:02:40,610  -->  00:02:41,620
so let's add that method,
64

64

00:02:41,620  -->  00:02:45,780
and I'm gonna add that just after the clear method here,
65

65

00:02:46,800  -->  00:02:48,970
so it's gonna be def link,
66

66

00:02:50,420  -->  00:02:51,840
we've got self as an argument,
67

67

00:02:51,840  -->  00:02:53,670
, widget , link_field:
68

68

00:02:57,590  -->  00:03:01,760
and we're gonna put self.linked_box = widget
69

69

00:03:03,730  -->  00:03:07,140
and then we're gonna do widget.link_field
70

70

00:03:09,680  -->  00:03:12,100
gonna set that to link_field,
71

71

00:03:13,290  -->  00:03:14,980
so we're basically saving the value
72

72

00:03:14,980  -->  00:03:17,190
that was passed in the argument.
73

73

00:03:17,190  -->  00:03:18,540
So at this point whenever we want
74

74

00:03:18,540  -->  00:03:20,560
to link two listBoxes together,
75

75

00:03:20,560  -->  00:03:24,070
we can call this new link method of the master listBox,
76

76

00:03:24,070  -->  00:03:25,390
then we're passing in a reference
77

77

00:03:25,390  -->  00:03:27,590
to the data listBox that we wanna link to
78

78

00:03:27,590  -->  00:03:29,450
as well as the name of the column
79

79

00:03:29,450  -->  00:03:31,830
in the linked data listBoxes table.
80

80

00:03:31,830  -->  00:03:33,880
I'm gonna go through what this method's doing again
81

81

00:03:33,880  -->  00:03:35,570
once we've seen it working
82

82

00:03:35,570  -->  00:03:37,930
and can refer to the actual widgets.
83

83

00:03:37,930  -->  00:03:39,590
So that's fixed some of the warnings,
84

84

00:03:39,590  -->  00:03:41,780
if we have a look at our own query method,
85

85

00:03:41,780  -->  00:03:43,210
that's looking a lot better now,
86

86

00:03:43,210  -->  00:03:44,780
we fixed some of those warnings,
87

87

00:03:44,780  -->  00:03:46,920
but we've still got one more error to fix,
88

88

00:03:46,920  -->  00:03:48,040
so we come over here and have a look
89

89

00:03:48,040  -->  00:03:51,210
in our right margin and click on that,
90

90

00:03:52,070  -->  00:03:55,150
and you can see I've got a problem on line 115,
91

91

00:03:55,150  -->  00:03:56,480
and you can see with the code there
92

92

00:03:56,480  -->  00:03:59,200
that that's where we downed the listBox select event
93

93

00:03:59,200  -->  00:04:01,490
to the get_albums function.
94

94

00:04:01,490  -->  00:04:02,710
Now we've moved that function
95

95

00:04:02,710  -->  00:04:04,870
into the class and renamed it,
96

96

00:04:04,870  -->  00:04:07,090
which is why we're now, of course, getting that error.
97

97

00:04:07,090  -->  00:04:08,780
Now there's no reason why we have to perform
98

98

00:04:08,780  -->  00:04:10,450
the bind in the main programme.
99

99

00:04:10,450  -->  00:04:12,220
Our data listBox class knows
100

100

00:04:12,220  -->  00:04:13,620
that it's got a nonselect method,
101

101

00:04:13,620  -->  00:04:15,670
so we can bind to the method itself.
102

102

00:04:15,670  -->  00:04:19,670
So I'm gonna cut that line of code out,
103

103

00:04:19,670  -->  00:04:22,450
and I'm going to paste it to the data listBox init method,
104

104

00:04:22,450  -->  00:04:24,080
so I'm gonna go right up to the top,
105

105

00:04:24,080  -->  00:04:26,080
the init method up here,
106

106

00:04:27,410  -->  00:04:29,840
and I'm going to paste it after our data attributes
107

107

00:04:29,840  -->  00:04:32,140
before the sql select statement,
108

108

00:04:32,140  -->  00:04:33,620
paste it in there like that.
109

109

00:04:33,620  -->  00:04:37,800
Now we're no longer binding to the get_albums function
110

110

00:04:37,800  -->  00:04:40,660
so we have to change that in our on_select method,
111

111

00:04:40,660  -->  00:04:42,150
and we also wanna use self, though,
112

112

00:04:42,150  -->  00:04:44,920
instead of referring to the artistList widget,
113

113

00:04:44,920  -->  00:04:47,170
so I'm gonna change that to
114

114

00:04:48,630  -->  00:04:53,020
remove the artistList call there, that should be self.bind.
115

115

00:04:53,020  -->  00:04:54,710
The listBox select is still correct,
116

116

00:04:54,710  -->  00:04:57,640
but instead of the get_albums function
117

117

00:04:57,640  -->  00:05:00,230
it's going to be self, or method I should say,
118

118

00:05:00,230  -->  00:05:02,900
it's going to be self.on_select,
119

119

00:05:05,700  -->  00:05:07,250
and be careful when you're making that change
120

120

00:05:07,250  -->  00:05:10,670
because you can see here that IntelliJ tried to be helpful
121

121

00:05:10,670  -->  00:05:14,040
and added the parenthesis after the on_select.
122

122

00:05:14,040  -->  00:05:16,420
We actually don't want that, we wanna remove that,
123

123

00:05:16,420  -->  00:05:17,810
and again, the reason we're moving it is
124

124

00:05:17,810  -->  00:05:20,240
that if we left it with the parenthesis
125

125

00:05:20,240  -->  00:05:21,620
then that would result in binding
126

126

00:05:21,620  -->  00:05:23,510
to the result of calling the method
127

127

00:05:23,510  -->  00:05:25,360
and our method returns none in this case,
128

128

00:05:25,360  -->  00:05:26,960
which, by the way, is the default
129

129

00:05:26,960  -->  00:05:28,570
for all functions and methods
130

130

00:05:28,570  -->  00:05:30,950
if you don't explicitly return anything,
131

131

00:05:30,950  -->  00:05:32,620
and we wanna bind to the method,
132

132

00:05:32,620  -->  00:05:35,330
not to the value that calling it returns,
133

133

00:05:35,330  -->  00:05:36,310
so watch out for that.
134

134

00:05:36,310  -->  00:05:38,270
I'm saying, I know we've talked about that in the past,
135

135

00:05:38,270  -->  00:05:40,050
but it's a very easy mistake to make,
136

136

00:05:40,050  -->  00:05:41,780
especially with IntelliJ's, you know,
137

137

00:05:41,780  -->  00:05:43,920
quote unquote helpfulness here.
138

138

00:05:43,920  -->  00:05:44,810
Alright, so I fixed that,
139

139

00:05:44,810  -->  00:05:46,840
now I'm going to delete one of those lines
140

140

00:05:46,840  -->  00:05:48,990
to keep IntelliJ happy.
141

141

00:05:48,990  -->  00:05:52,390
Okay, so once our main code's created the albumList
142

142

00:05:52,390  -->  00:05:54,850
we can actually link it to the artistList,
143

143

00:05:54,850  -->  00:05:57,620
so let's go ahead and do that.
144

144

00:05:57,620  -->  00:05:59,620
We're gonna go down here
145

145

00:06:01,330  -->  00:06:04,300
and the moment we've got this albumList.bind
146

146

00:06:04,300  -->  00:06:08,470
to get_songs, so I'm actually gonna comment that out.
147

147

00:06:09,800  -->  00:06:10,930
What we're going to do instead
148

148

00:06:10,930  -->  00:06:12,930
is do an artistList.link
149

149

00:06:15,470  -->  00:06:18,670
and it's going to be to albumList,
150

150

00:06:18,670  -->  00:06:20,840
and then the field artist.
151

151

00:06:22,940  -->  00:06:24,490
Moving down we can do the same
152

152

00:06:24,490  -->  00:06:27,480
to link the songList to the albumList,
153

153

00:06:27,480  -->  00:06:30,810
so let's go ahead and do that.
154

154

00:06:30,810  -->  00:06:34,060
Then we'll do, this case albumList.link
155

155

00:06:35,800  -->  00:06:38,770
and that's going to be to songList in this case
156

156

00:06:38,770  -->  00:06:43,470
and then album, that's the column name, or the field.
157

157

00:06:43,470  -->  00:06:45,050
Alright, so let's run the programme.
158

158

00:06:45,050  -->  00:06:47,830
It should allow the album and songLists to be updated
159

159

00:06:47,830  -->  00:06:50,840
when items are selected in the list that they're linked to,
160

160

00:06:50,840  -->  00:06:54,090
so we'll actually run that and see.
161

161

00:06:54,090  -->  00:06:57,170
Go ahead and have a look at the code,
162

162

00:06:58,250  -->  00:07:00,420
and we can select, should be able to select an artist,
163

163

00:07:00,420  -->  00:07:02,970
we can see that's updating okay,
164

164

00:07:02,970  -->  00:07:05,520
and if I come over and click on an album
165

165

00:07:05,520  -->  00:07:07,630
we actually get a crash,
166

166

00:07:07,630  -->  00:07:09,320
so it's almost working.
167

167

00:07:09,320  -->  00:07:11,740
So selecting the artists you saw worked fine
168

168

00:07:11,740  -->  00:07:13,340
and the correct albums are displayed,
169

169

00:07:13,340  -->  00:07:15,410
but soon as I actually selected an album
170

170

00:07:15,410  -->  00:07:17,020
we actually had a crash.
171

171

00:07:17,020  -->  00:07:19,150
And if you come down here and look at the error,
172

172

00:07:19,150  -->  00:07:21,600
and I'll just close that down for now,
173

173

00:07:21,600  -->  00:07:22,830
and the error's saying here
174

174

00:07:22,830  -->  00:07:25,270
that there's no such column artists.
175

175

00:07:25,270  -->  00:07:26,810
Well the songs table doesn't actually have
176

176

00:07:26,810  -->  00:07:29,200
an artists column, so we shouldn't be referring
177

177

00:07:29,200  -->  00:07:31,500
to the artists column in the songs table,
178

178

00:07:31,500  -->  00:07:34,190
so obviously at this point something's not right.
179

179

00:07:34,190  -->  00:07:37,150
So if you click on this link to here in the error trace,
180

180

00:07:37,150  -->  00:07:41,190
that actually takes us to the line where the problem is.
181

181

00:07:41,190  -->  00:07:42,240
Well, that's actually the line
182

182

00:07:42,240  -->  00:07:43,980
that's actually executing the sql,
183

183

00:07:43,980  -->  00:07:46,150
but if you look above on line 56
184

184

00:07:46,150  -->  00:07:48,050
that's actually where the problem is.
185

185

00:07:48,050  -->  00:07:50,340
So I've still got the artists column hard coded
186

186

00:07:50,340  -->  00:07:53,660
as you can see here, into the sql where clause,
187

187

00:07:53,660  -->  00:07:56,060
and what we should be doing is using the link field,
188

188

00:07:56,060  -->  00:07:58,810
the one that was set when we call the link method,
189

189

00:07:58,810  -->  00:08:00,130
so let's go ahead and change that.
190

190

00:08:00,130  -->  00:08:04,050
So I'm going to delete the artist in the double quotes
191

191

00:08:04,050  -->  00:08:08,220
and we're going to replace that with self.link_field
192

192

00:08:09,390  -->  00:08:11,940
so we get the right column for the right table.
193

193

00:08:11,940  -->  00:08:13,980
But that raises another question, now,
194

194

00:08:13,980  -->  00:08:15,180
and that question is, what happens
195

195

00:08:15,180  -->  00:08:17,420
if we don't have a link field,
196

196

00:08:17,420  -->  00:08:20,180
because the listBox hasn't been linked to another one?
197

197

00:08:20,180  -->  00:08:22,020
Well in that cause, calling requery
198

198

00:08:22,020  -->  00:08:24,240
should populate the list with all the rows
199

199

00:08:24,240  -->  00:08:25,730
so we wanna execute the code
200

200

00:08:25,730  -->  00:08:27,650
in the else block in that scenario.
201

201

00:08:27,650  -->  00:08:31,200
So we can fix this by adding a test for the link_field
202

202

00:08:31,200  -->  00:08:33,300
as well as the link_value.
203

203

00:08:33,300  -->  00:08:34,480
So if we go ahead and do that,
204

204

00:08:34,480  -->  00:08:37,980
so I've got if link_value here on line 55,
205

205

00:08:38,880  -->  00:08:43,050
if we do or add the words "and" and self.link_field
206

206

00:08:45,970  -->  00:08:47,400
we're now only gonna execute that
207

207

00:08:47,400  -->  00:08:49,240
if there is a link that has been established
208

208

00:08:49,240  -->  00:08:51,640
between the two listBoxes.
209

209

00:08:51,640  -->  00:08:54,040
Otherwise the else code is gonna be executed,
210

210

00:08:54,040  -->  00:08:56,750
and reflectively going to get the entire contents
211

211

00:08:56,750  -->  00:08:58,790
of the table added to the listBox
212

212

00:08:58,790  -->  00:09:01,400
and that's actually what we want in this scenario.
213

213

00:09:01,400  -->  00:09:05,360
Alright, so we're going to also make a change down here
214

214

00:09:05,360  -->  00:09:07,750
after the call to self.clear,
215

215

00:09:07,750  -->  00:09:09,980
then we're actually through and adding the code there
216

216

00:09:09,980  -->  00:09:13,510
so you can see that adds the entries to the listBox.
217

217

00:09:13,510  -->  00:09:16,030
What we need to do also is down here
218

218

00:09:16,030  -->  00:09:18,950
put in some code if self.linked_box
219

219

00:09:22,210  -->  00:09:25,460
then we wanna do self.linked_box.clear.
220

220

00:09:28,830  -->  00:09:29,730
Now the reason we're doing that,
221

221

00:09:29,730  -->  00:09:32,900
that's to clear out the data in any linked data listBox
222

222

00:09:32,900  -->  00:09:35,420
so that way when we select a new artist
223

223

00:09:35,420  -->  00:09:38,620
the songs for the previous album aren't still displayed,
224

224

00:09:38,620  -->  00:09:39,720
and that's the reason, by the way,
225

225

00:09:39,720  -->  00:09:42,600
that we added a clear method in the first place
226

226

00:09:42,600  -->  00:09:45,430
rather than just deleting the list items earlier.
227

227

00:09:45,430  -->  00:09:47,350
So we need a method on the linked listBox
228

228

00:09:47,350  -->  00:09:49,300
to tell it to delete its contents.
229

229

00:09:49,300  -->  00:09:50,960
Alright, so let's actually try running this again,
230

230

00:09:50,960  -->  00:09:55,130
and hopefully things will actually work properly now.
231

231

00:09:58,980  -->  00:10:01,320
Alright, so if I select an artist,
232

232

00:10:01,320  -->  00:10:02,520
okay, so we've got an error there,
233

233

00:10:02,520  -->  00:10:04,040
let's just have a look.
234

234

00:10:04,040  -->  00:10:07,090
Can't convert DataListBox object to string implicitly,
235

235

00:10:07,090  -->  00:10:08,640
okay just click on that,
236

236

00:10:08,640  -->  00:10:09,840
and I've made a typo here,
237

237

00:10:09,840  -->  00:10:13,140
I've actually typed in self.linked_box,
238

238

00:10:13,140  -->  00:10:14,870
but it actually should be link_field,
239

239

00:10:14,870  -->  00:10:17,610
because the field is ultimately gonna be
240

240

00:10:17,610  -->  00:10:18,980
the column name for the database
241

241

00:10:18,980  -->  00:10:20,080
that we're trying to add,
242

242

00:10:20,080  -->  00:10:22,940
so that's just a typo, so I'll fix that.
243

243

00:10:22,940  -->  00:10:26,290
Link_field, that should fix that up,
244

244

00:10:26,290  -->  00:10:29,370
so let's just try running that again.
245

245

00:10:35,150  -->  00:10:37,990
Let's see how we go this time.
246

246

00:10:37,990  -->  00:10:40,590
Alright so, we'll try running it again,
247

247

00:10:40,590  -->  00:10:41,980
this time we haven't got an error there, that's good,
248

248

00:10:41,980  -->  00:10:43,510
so we've got artists showing,
249

249

00:10:43,510  -->  00:10:45,790
albums you saw was updating automatically,
250

250

00:10:45,790  -->  00:10:46,870
so each time we're clicking we're getting
251

251

00:10:46,870  -->  00:10:48,610
the list of albums, so that's good,
252

252

00:10:48,610  -->  00:10:50,400
and multiple albums are being shown.
253

253

00:10:50,400  -->  00:10:52,170
Now if we click on an album
254

254

00:10:52,170  -->  00:10:53,760
we're correctly getting the list of songs,
255

255

00:10:53,760  -->  00:10:56,090
and that's updating as well.
256

256

00:10:56,090  -->  00:10:58,460
So that's good, everything's now working great,
257

257

00:10:58,460  -->  00:11:00,230
and you can see that as I was selecting items
258

258

00:11:00,230  -->  00:11:01,860
in any one odd data listBox,
259

259

00:11:01,860  -->  00:11:03,770
the corresponding data is displayed
260

260

00:11:03,770  -->  00:11:05,880
in the linked data listBox,
261

261

00:11:05,880  -->  00:11:08,200
and I think at this point that's pretty impressive.
262

262

00:11:08,200  -->  00:11:11,290
So we've taken the basic tkinter listbox
263

263

00:11:11,290  -->  00:11:14,350
and now created our own scrollable version of it,
264

264

00:11:14,350  -->  00:11:16,870
and with that extended that further
265

265

00:11:16,870  -->  00:11:18,460
to produce a data listBox that can
266

266

00:11:18,460  -->  00:11:21,300
load its own data from a database table
267

267

00:11:21,300  -->  00:11:24,550
as well as triggering loading in another data listBox.
268

268

00:11:24,550  -->  00:11:27,340
So the code in the main programme becomes a lot cleaner
269

269

00:11:27,340  -->  00:11:30,270
and easier to instal as a result of this,
270

270

00:11:30,270  -->  00:11:31,750
but with that said we've still got a bit
271

271

00:11:31,750  -->  00:11:34,430
of tidying up to do there in the code
272

272

00:11:34,430  -->  00:11:35,880
before I end this video,
273

273

00:11:35,880  -->  00:11:38,770
and I'm just gonna close this down.
274

274

00:11:38,770  -->  00:11:40,400
Now to start with, we don't need
275

275

00:11:40,400  -->  00:11:43,280
this get_songs function anymore
276

276

00:11:43,280  -->  00:11:46,820
'cause that's now all handled by our data listBox class,
277

277

00:11:46,820  -->  00:11:48,840
and we also don't need to connect to the database
278

278

00:11:48,840  -->  00:11:50,750
right at the start of the programme.
279

279

00:11:50,750  -->  00:11:52,810
Now, we did that originally because our functions
280

280

00:11:52,810  -->  00:11:55,200
were using the global database connexion,
281

281

00:11:55,200  -->  00:11:56,760
but now that we're passing the connexion
282

282

00:11:56,760  -->  00:11:58,550
to our data listBox objects
283

283

00:11:58,550  -->  00:12:01,200
that code can come down to the main programme.
284

284

00:12:01,200  -->  00:12:02,860
We should also add a condition
285

285

00:12:02,860  -->  00:12:04,500
so that the main code isn't executed
286

286

00:12:04,500  -->  00:12:06,920
when the module's imported by another programme,
287

287

00:12:06,920  -->  00:12:08,840
and that'll then let other programmes
288

288

00:12:08,840  -->  00:12:11,690
use our scroll box and data listBox classes.
289

289

00:12:11,690  -->  00:12:12,750
Let's go ahead and do that,
290

290

00:12:12,750  -->  00:12:15,960
so I'm actually going to delete the get_songs function
291

291

00:12:15,960  -->  00:12:17,370
because that's existed in quite a few
292

292

00:12:17,370  -->  00:12:20,120
other versions of the video prior to this,
293

293

00:12:20,120  -->  00:12:23,690
or videos prior to this, so we don't need to preserve that,
294

294

00:12:23,690  -->  00:12:25,720
and clean up some of this.
295

295

00:12:25,720  -->  00:12:28,210
Let's also add that code there
296

296

00:12:28,210  -->  00:12:30,200
to make sure that the main code
297

297

00:12:30,200  -->  00:12:32,080
isn't executed when the module's imported.
298

298

00:12:32,080  -->  00:12:35,330
So if __name__ is equal to '__main__' :
299

299

00:12:43,530  -->  00:12:45,060
and from there we want to indent the code
300

300

00:12:45,060  -->  00:12:48,810
but we gotta start by moving this connexion,
301

301

00:12:49,740  -->  00:12:52,680
I'll comment that out and we'll delete this,
302

302

00:12:52,680  -->  00:12:55,110
clear up some spaces there,
303

303

00:12:55,110  -->  00:12:58,360
then I'm gonna come down and put that code in here,
304

304

00:12:58,360  -->  00:13:01,520
and then we're going to indent this other code,
305

305

00:13:01,520  -->  00:13:02,420
then go right down to the bottom
306

306

00:13:02,420  -->  00:13:05,080
and indent all of that, like so.
307

307

00:13:07,350  -->  00:13:09,100
Now we also were loading data
308

308

00:13:09,100  -->  00:13:11,790
into the albums and songLists when the programme starts,
309

309

00:13:11,790  -->  00:13:13,840
and if you recall we did that when testing earlier
310

310

00:13:13,840  -->  00:13:16,480
but we can now go ahead and delete those lines now.
311

311

00:13:16,480  -->  00:13:18,330
So in terms of that code you've got
312

312

00:13:18,330  -->  00:13:21,310
this requery here, firstly for albums,
313

313

00:13:21,310  -->  00:13:23,710
so let's, I'll just comment that out.
314

314

00:13:23,710  -->  00:13:26,000
You could just as easily delete that if you prefer.
315

315

00:13:26,000  -->  00:13:29,100
We've also got another one in the songs,
316

316

00:13:29,100  -->  00:13:31,040
the songlist.requery, which we no longer need
317

317

00:13:31,040  -->  00:13:32,580
to have that code there anymore.
318

318

00:13:32,580  -->  00:13:33,790
But of course we do wanna leave
319

319

00:13:33,790  -->  00:13:35,290
the original artists in there,
320

320

00:13:35,290  -->  00:13:37,100
so that all the artists are initially loaded,
321

321

00:13:37,100  -->  00:13:39,550
so that's good, that's now fixed.
322

322

00:13:39,550  -->  00:13:41,340
And down here for the main loop
323

323

00:13:41,340  -->  00:13:42,810
we can also get rid of the testList
324

324

00:13:42,810  -->  00:13:45,230
and the albumLV.set tuple,
325

325

00:13:45,230  -->  00:13:48,110
you don't actually want that to be populated either,
326

326

00:13:48,110  -->  00:13:49,680
so let's actually get rid of that as well,
327

327

00:13:49,680  -->  00:13:51,570
comment that out.
328

328

00:13:51,570  -->  00:13:54,630
Which really only leaves the code for the main loop
329

329

00:13:54,630  -->  00:13:56,970
in printing, the fact that we're closing
330

330

00:13:56,970  -->  00:13:59,830
the database connexion and then the connection.close,
331

331

00:13:59,830  -->  00:14:03,990
so let's just run this to make sure that it still works.
332

332

00:14:08,300  -->  00:14:10,740
So I've now only got the artists populated initially.
333

333

00:14:10,740  -->  00:14:13,740
We can click on a particular artist.
334

334

00:14:14,940  -->  00:14:17,210
By the way, we can click on songs as well,
335

335

00:14:17,210  -->  00:14:20,240
and because that's not associated with any other listBox
336

336

00:14:20,240  -->  00:14:21,240
we're not getting any errors,
337

337

00:14:21,240  -->  00:14:23,940
and that's working as well as we think it should be working,
338

338

00:14:23,940  -->  00:14:26,420
and we're still getting our other selects working correctly
339

339

00:14:26,420  -->  00:14:29,990
and the various data listBoxes being updated on the screen.
340

340

00:14:29,990  -->  00:14:33,440
So that's actually it, that's our data ListBox finished.
341

341

00:14:33,440  -->  00:14:35,120
I think you'd agree that the main program's now
342

342

00:14:35,120  -->  00:14:37,020
a lot tidier than what it was,
343

343

00:14:37,020  -->  00:14:39,180
and we haven't got any code copied and pasted,
344

344

00:14:39,180  -->  00:14:40,600
more to the point.
345

345

00:14:40,600  -->  00:14:44,350
We've also now got two completely reusable classes
346

346

00:14:44,350  -->  00:14:46,330
that we can import into other projects
347

347

00:14:46,330  -->  00:14:47,810
whenever we need a scrolling listBox
348

348

00:14:47,810  -->  00:14:51,620
or one that can display data from a database table.
349

349

00:14:51,620  -->  00:14:54,480
Now, there is a bug in the data listBox class, though.
350

350

00:14:54,480  -->  00:14:55,400
Let's see if you can figure out
351

351

00:14:55,400  -->  00:14:57,180
and try and spot what that is.
352

352

00:14:57,180  -->  00:14:59,630
In the next video I'm gonna show you what the bug is
353

353

00:14:59,630  -->  00:15:02,550
and then set you a challenge to fix that bug,
354

354

00:15:02,550  -->  00:15:04,880
so I will see you in the next video.
