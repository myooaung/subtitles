1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,190
All right just before we move on now with his course, I've actually got a set of free video resources

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,840
that I suggest you check out.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,880
Now, these videos are freely available on YouTube, and there's a link to this playlist of videos in the

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,990
next video - in the next lecture, I should say, here on Udemy.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,410
Now the purpose of these videos, which I've put together and then continuing to record, is to give you

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,140
a resource to answer the most common questions that relate to programming.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,780
Now these quote these videos on YouTube aren't going to teach you how to program.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,660
And that's because that's what this course is all about.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:36,670
But they answer a lot of very common questions. Things like how long does it take to become a programmer?

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,880
Do you need to have good math skills to become a programmer?

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,440
Am I too old to start a career in programming? How to transition from another career to programming?

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,400
and lots of other questions. And I answer questions like that on the YouTube channel. And I'm putting

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,840
them on the YouTube channel because it's a resource that I can give out freely to all my students.

14
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,500
There's no catch there's no obligation it's totally free.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,450
So check that out, and you can click on the link in the next lecture here on Udemy to access that playlist.

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,700
And when you get there I suggest you click on this little icon here, it's the subscribe button and then

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,540
also click on the little bell notification, and what that does is send an email, or YouTube rather

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,530
will send you an email, every time I release a new video.

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,620
Now I'm currently releasing a new video six days a week, and the other important thing here, the other important

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,780
thing to mention here, is that if you've got a question relating to a career or something of that

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,890
nature, you can leave it as a comment on any of those videos.

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,680
And I'll actually follow that up with a video in the future.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,820
So it's a resource there for you, to really help complement the skills you learn in this course and

24
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,490
answer a lot of your career related questions.

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,810
That of course we all have when we're starting out in a career in programming.

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,360
All right so that's enough about that, I just wanted to throw that out there. A link, as I said, in the next video.

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,340
But for now let's continue on with the videos in this course.
