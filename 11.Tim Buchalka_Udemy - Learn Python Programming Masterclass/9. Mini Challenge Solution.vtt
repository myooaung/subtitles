00:00:04.720  -->  00:00:08.080
Alright, so let's go through the
solution to the mini challenge, that I

2

00:00:08.080  -->  00:00:11.500
added at the end of the last video. And
how did you get on? Did you manage to

3

00:00:11.500  -->  00:00:17.420
complete it? The reality is, that adding a
new item involves far more work than it should.

4

00:00:17.420  -->  00:00:20.820
We have to make three changes to
the program, so let's go through and add

5

00:00:20.830  -->  00:00:25.090
the option to the menu first. So I'm
coming down and adding an option to

6

00:00:25.090  -->  00:00:30.980
option 6, down here, which is our hdmi
cable: print parentheses double quotes

7

00:00:30.980  -->  00:00:35.400
6 : hdmi cable, and we've got a double quote

8

00:00:35.410  -->  00:00:40.089
and a right parenthesis. Next, we have to
include a test for when the customer

9

00:00:40.089  -->  00:00:47.520
chooses item 6 - that'll be here. So we'll
add an elif there: elif current_choice

10

00:00:47.520  -->  00:00:52.960
is equal to - two equal signs - and
6 in single quotes and a colon.

11

00:00:52.960  -->  00:01:01.720
Then we'll do a computer_parts.append and in parentheses, we're going to add hdmi cable.

12

00:01:01.720  -->  00:01:05.780
So that's the second change. The
program still won't work, though,

13

00:01:05.780  -->  00:01:10.720
and that's because - if we go back up to line
five here - we check that the choice is in 1,

14

00:01:10.720  -->  00:01:15.640
2, 3, 4, 5. If we were happy to lose line 6 -
the line that prints the choice being

15

00:01:15.640  -->  00:01:20.530
added - then we could delete line 5 as
well, but if we want to keep that print

16

00:01:20.530  -->  00:01:27.260
statement, we need to add 6 to the string,
on line 5. I'm going to do that.

17

00:01:27.260  -->  00:01:32.580
Let's test the program to make sure that we can add an hdmi cable. I'm gonna add another

18

00:01:32.590  -->  00:01:39.130
item first - a computer, adding one. Let's
do 6, adding hdmi cable. Let's exit the

19

00:01:39.130  -->  00:01:44.840
program now, and you can see we've now
got a computer and a hdmi cable.

20

00:01:44.840  -->  00:01:48.400
Alright, so that works, but I think you'd
agree it was much harder than it should

21

00:01:48.400  -->  00:01:52.880
have been. This code - the way it's been
coded - isn't very easy to maintain.

22

00:01:52.880  -->  00:01:56.320
So it would certainly be much neater if we
could just add new items to a list and

23

00:01:56.320  -->  00:02:01.510
have everything else just work. Can we do
that? Of course we can, and this is a good

24

00:02:01.510  -->  00:02:05.470
way to see how useful lists can be, and
we'll start improving our code to achieve

25

00:02:05.470  -->  00:02:08.970
that, in the next video.
