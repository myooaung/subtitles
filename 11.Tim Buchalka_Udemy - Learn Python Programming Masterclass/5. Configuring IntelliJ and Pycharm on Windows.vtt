00:00:04.700  -->  00:00:07.279
So now that we've installed the IDE and
2

2

00:00:07.279  -->  00:00:09.410
the Python plugin if you installed
3

3

00:00:09.410  -->  00:00:12.530
intelliJ IDEA rather than PyCharm,
4

4

00:00:12.530  -->  00:00:13.849
we need to make sure that we can find
5

5

00:00:13.849  -->  00:00:16.760
Python. Now the steps are almost the same
6

6

00:00:16.760  -->  00:00:20.000
for IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm and the
7

7

00:00:20.000  -->  00:00:21.890
chances are that it's sorted itself out
8

8

00:00:21.890  -->  00:00:24.289
automatically but just in case it hasn't,
9

9

00:00:24.289  -->  00:00:25.670
I'm going to go through the steps to
10

10

00:00:25.670  -->  00:00:28.939
configure the Python SDK, we're going to
11

11

00:00:28.939  -->  00:00:31.189
do that for both IntelliJ IDEA and
12

12

00:00:31.189  -->  00:00:34.610
PyCharm. So starting with IntelliJ IDEA
13

13

00:00:34.610  -->  00:00:36.920
first, to do this come down here and
14

14

00:00:36.920  -->  00:00:39.559
click on configure select project
15

15

00:00:39.559  -->  00:00:43.960
defaults then select project structure,
16

16

00:00:43.960  -->  00:00:46.400
in the left hand side when that pops up
17

17

00:00:46.400  -->  00:00:48.559
click on SDKs and I'm just going to move
18

18

00:00:48.559  -->  00:00:49.640
that to the center of the screen a bit
19

19

00:00:49.640  -->  00:00:53.479
more I'll select SDKs and that's where
20

20

00:00:53.479  -->  00:00:56.659
we set up the Python SDK now in pycharm
21

21

00:00:56.659  -->  00:00:57.920
it's slightly different so I'm going to
22

22

00:00:57.920  -->  00:01:03.140
write Python or start to PyCharm so in
23

23

00:01:03.140  -->  00:01:05.089
Pycharm the way we do that click on
24

24

00:01:05.089  -->  00:01:13.100
configure and select settings and over
25

25

00:01:13.100  -->  00:01:14.810
here to the left we click on project
26

26

00:01:14.810  -->  00:01:17.299
interpreter, you notice that I'm using
27

27

00:01:17.299  -->  00:01:19.369
the dark healer theme here for Pycharm
28

28

00:01:19.369  -->  00:01:21.859
so that can tell at a glance which IDE
29

29

00:01:21.859  -->  00:01:24.469
I'm showing on the screen, so Pycharm
30

30

00:01:24.469  -->  00:01:26.450
it's got this little cog over here on
31

31

00:01:26.450  -->  00:01:29.000
the right-hand side of works as the of
32

32

00:01:29.000  -->  00:01:31.460
the project interpreter box so I'm going
33

33

00:01:31.460  -->  00:01:34.210
to click on that and then click on add
34

34

00:01:34.210  -->  00:01:36.740
this brings us to the add Python
35

35

00:01:36.740  -->  00:01:42.219
interpreter screen so back in IntelliJ IDEA,
36

36

00:01:42.219  -->  00:01:44.899
we can get to that same screen by
37

37

00:01:44.899  -->  00:01:47.899
clicking on this little plus button and
38

38

00:01:47.899  -->  00:01:51.619
selecting Python SDK now at this point
39

39

00:01:51.619  -->  00:01:53.869
both IDEs are going to look the same so
40

40

00:01:53.869  -->  00:01:56.090
I'm going to continue with IDE but
41

41

00:01:56.090  -->  00:01:57.740
you'll do the same as I'm doing here if
42

42

00:01:57.740  -->  00:02:00.289
you're using Python. Now we've got this
43

43

00:02:00.289  -->  00:02:02.509
virtual env environment showing up here
44

44

00:02:02.509  -->  00:02:05.990
I'm not going to explain this virtual env
45

45

00:02:05.990  -->  00:02:07.789
just yet and that's because we're going
46

46

00:02:07.789  -->  00:02:08.990
to be looking at them later in the
47

47

00:02:08.990  -->  00:02:11.090
course what they are is a way of keeping
48

48

00:02:11.090  -->  00:02:13.760
your path in environments separate so
49

49

00:02:13.760  -->  00:02:15.200
that things you install for one project
50

50

00:02:15.200  -->  00:02:17.299
don't affect other projects you may be
51

51

00:02:17.299  -->  00:02:18.380
working on
52

52

00:02:18.380  -->  00:02:19.580
and we'll be looking at them from the
53

53

00:02:19.580  -->  00:02:22.010
command line so I won't be discussing
54

54

00:02:22.010  -->  00:02:24.080
these options this is a Python course
55

55

00:02:24.080  -->  00:02:26.870
after all not an IntelliJ or PyCharm
56

56

00:02:26.870  -->  00:02:29.000
course but once we've explained about
57

57

00:02:29.000  -->  00:02:31.160
virtually env these options will make
58

58

00:02:31.160  -->  00:02:33.560
more sense, for now though to get things
59

59

00:02:33.560  -->  00:02:36.170
working making sure that you've got a
60

60

00:02:36.170  -->  00:02:37.880
virtualenv clicked over here to the
61

61

00:02:37.880  -->  00:02:40.580
left hand side in the left pane come
62

62

00:02:40.580  -->  00:02:41.840
over here and make sure a new
63

63

00:02:41.840  -->  00:02:44.330
environment is selected then you want to
64

64

00:02:44.330  -->  00:02:46.280
tick both these boxes inherent to global
65

65

00:02:46.280  -->  00:02:48.620
site packages and make available to all
66

66

00:02:48.620  -->  00:02:52.880
projects. Now the location here that
67

67

00:02:52.880  -->  00:02:55.310
should be your home directory in my case
68

68

00:02:55.310  -->  00:02:57.290
it's C colon backslash users backslash
69

69

00:02:57.290  -->  00:03:01.220
Tim that is my home folder then the V E
70

70

00:03:01.220  -->  00:03:03.230
and V stands for virtual in V
71

71

00:03:03.230  -->  00:03:05.360
environment and that's been added
72

72

00:03:05.360  -->  00:03:07.880
automatically by IntelliJ and there's
73

73

00:03:07.880  -->  00:03:09.680
also this option on there in here which
74

74

00:03:09.680  -->  00:03:12.890
is optional, we can remove that and that
75

75

00:03:12.890  -->  00:03:14.390
would be a good default as I've got it
76

76

00:03:14.390  -->  00:03:16.940
there now if you only ever wanted to use
77

77

00:03:16.940  -->  00:03:19.610
one version of Python otherwise what you
78

78

00:03:19.610  -->  00:03:21.260
can do is add the specific version of
79

79

00:03:21.260  -->  00:03:23.450
Python that you installed in this
80

80

00:03:23.450  -->  00:03:25.400
section of the course and I'm going to
81

81

00:03:25.400  -->  00:03:27.230
do that just so you can see how to use
82

82

00:03:27.230  -->  00:03:29.300
different versions of Python if you want
83

83

00:03:29.300  -->  00:03:34.400
so in my case it was Python 3.6 so I'm
84

84

00:03:34.400  -->  00:03:36.470
just going to select Python 3.6 s the
85

85

00:03:36.470  -->  00:03:38.540
folder there you can see my folder is
86

86

00:03:38.540  -->  00:03:41.270
now C colon backslash users backslash T
87

87

00:03:41.270  -->  00:03:44.240
and back slash V env backslash Python
88

88

00:03:44.240  -->  00:03:48.380
3.6 now IntelliJ IDEA or pycharm should
89

89

00:03:48.380  -->  00:03:50.900
have found your Python 3.6 installation
90

90

00:03:50.900  -->  00:03:52.760
or whatever version of python you're
91

91

00:03:52.760  -->  00:03:56.090
using now if you've installed Python 3.7
92

92

00:03:56.090  -->  00:03:59.720
which should be out late in 2018 then
93

93

00:03:59.720  -->  00:04:01.420
that's the version that you'd want here
94

94

00:04:01.420  -->  00:04:03.740
but if there's no base interpreters
95

95

00:04:03.740  -->  00:04:05.900
showing and it's a base interpreted box
96

96

00:04:05.900  -->  00:04:07.490
then you want to come over and click the
97

97

00:04:07.490  -->  00:04:09.080
ellipsis button over here to the right
98

98

00:04:09.080  -->  00:04:11.630
and then navigate browse to where you've
99

99

00:04:11.630  -->  00:04:13.190
installed Python and select that folder,
100

100

00:04:13.190  -->  00:04:16.010
in my case it's founded automatically so
101

101

00:04:16.010  -->  00:04:18.080
I don't need to do anything so all I
102

102

00:04:18.080  -->  00:04:19.430
really need to do at this point is click
103

103

00:04:19.430  -->  00:04:23.590
on ok and you can see after a moment
104

104

00:04:23.590  -->  00:04:26.600
IntelliJ IDEA has configured the Python
105

105

00:04:26.600  -->  00:04:29.450
3.6 installation for me and we're ready
106

106

00:04:29.450  -->  00:04:31.390
to go, so that's
107

107

00:04:31.390  -->  00:04:33.820
things set up an IntelliJ well let's
108

108

00:04:33.820  -->  00:04:35.620
swing over to Pycharm I'm going to
109

109

00:04:35.620  -->  00:04:37.480
pause the video and show you what that
110

110

00:04:37.480  -->  00:04:38.920
looks like after you've gone through the
111

111

00:04:38.920  -->  00:04:43.900
same process in pycharm alright so here
112

112

00:04:43.900  -->  00:04:45.370
we are now in pycharm and you can see
113

113

00:04:45.370  -->  00:04:47.440
this is what the screen looks like if
114

114

00:04:47.440  -->  00:04:49.210
you follow the same instructions to set
115

115

00:04:49.210  -->  00:04:51.610
up by your project interpreter in
116

116

00:04:51.610  -->  00:04:54.400
PyCharm. Another point now we can just
117

117

00:04:54.400  -->  00:04:56.470
click on ok and we're ready to start
118

118

00:04:56.470  -->  00:04:59.590
creating Python projects you get that
119

119

00:04:59.590  -->  00:05:00.520
little option there where it's just
120

120

00:05:00.520  -->  00:05:02.500
going through setting things up and
121

121

00:05:02.500  -->  00:05:04.690
likewise for IntelliJ if I go back to
122

122

00:05:04.690  -->  00:05:07.120
that click on OK and we're good to go so
123

123

00:05:07.120  -->  00:05:09.040
both basically at this point we've done
124

124

00:05:09.040  -->  00:05:10.810
some basic configuration for both
125

125

00:05:10.810  -->  00:05:14.470
IntelliJ IDE and pycharm. Now there's one
126

126

00:05:14.470  -->  00:05:16.780
more change I want to make and that's to
127

127

00:05:16.780  -->  00:05:18.880
get the IDE to show line numbers in our
128

128

00:05:18.880  -->  00:05:21.340
code now the steps are the same for both
129

129

00:05:21.340  -->  00:05:22.840
IDE so I'm just going to show you what
130

130

00:05:22.840  -->  00:05:25.000
an intelligent idea when I come over
131

131

00:05:25.000  -->  00:05:28.360
here and click on configure click on
132

132

00:05:28.360  -->  00:05:32.050
settings then you want to come down here
133

133

00:05:32.050  -->  00:05:34.140
to editor and expand the little
134

134

00:05:34.140  -->  00:05:36.460
triangles the little greater than sign
135

135

00:05:36.460  -->  00:05:38.110
so that we get the list here of options
136

136

00:05:38.110  -->  00:05:41.490
they want to select general spare that
137

137

00:05:41.490  -->  00:05:45.250
they want to click on appearance and we
138

138

00:05:45.250  -->  00:05:47.140
want to make sure here is that the
139

139

00:05:47.140  -->  00:05:49.090
option to show line numbers is checked.
140

140

00:05:49.090  -->  00:05:51.700
Now in older versions of IntelliJ IDEA
141

141

00:05:51.700  -->  00:05:54.250
or pycharm does show line numbers wasn't
142

142

00:05:54.250  -->  00:05:56.680
a default option so if it isn't ticked
143

143

00:05:56.680  -->  00:05:59.260
make sure you do check that and tick it
144

144

00:05:59.260  -->  00:06:00.610
in my case you can see that it's ticked
145

145

00:06:00.610  -->  00:06:02.350
already and that's because it's very
146

146

00:06:02.350  -->  00:06:04.030
handy to see in line numbers in your
147

147

00:06:04.030  -->  00:06:06.250
code especially when you get errors in
148

148

00:06:06.250  -->  00:06:07.990
the error message talks about line 6 for
149

149

00:06:07.990  -->  00:06:09.910
example but in my case you can see
150

150

00:06:09.910  -->  00:06:11.580
that's good to go, so I can click on OK
151

151

00:06:11.580  -->  00:06:15.070
and again same steps for pycharm if
152

152

00:06:15.070  -->  00:06:16.960
you're using that. Alright so at this
153

153

00:06:16.960  -->  00:06:17.860
point we're now ready to start
154

154

00:06:17.860  -->  00:06:20.470
programming in Python, so skip over the
155

155

00:06:20.470  -->  00:06:22.570
sections for installing and setting up
156

156

00:06:22.570  -->  00:06:25.090
Python and IntelliJ on a Mac and Linux
