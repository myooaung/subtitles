00:00:05.360  -->  00:00:07.580
in this video we're going to install the
2

2

00:00:07.580  -->  00:00:09.860
sql lite three command line shell for
3

3

00:00:09.860  -->  00:00:12.500
Windows computers now if you're using a
4

4

00:00:12.500  -->  00:00:13.940
Mac or Linux machine
5

5

00:00:13.940  -->  00:00:15.770
skip to the next video or the video
6

6

00:00:15.770  -->  00:00:18.260
after that for your operating system but
7

7

00:00:18.260  -->  00:00:19.550
if you're in Windows you're in the right
8

8

00:00:19.550  -->  00:00:22.610
place so let's make a start now python
9

9

00:00:22.610  -->  00:00:24.650
includes sqlite in its standard
10

10

00:00:24.650  -->  00:00:26.630
library so we don't need to install
11

11

00:00:26.630  -->  00:00:28.310
anything to use sqlite in our Python
12

12

00:00:28.310  -->  00:00:31.670
programs now thing to keep in mind here
13

13

00:00:31.670  -->  00:00:33.410
that writing data base code
14

14

00:00:33.410  -->  00:00:35.240
straightaway isn't the easiest way to
15

15

00:00:35.240  -->  00:00:37.450
learn about sqlite and the sql
16

16

00:00:37.450  -->  00:00:40.060
language so if you get errors you have to
17

17

00:00:40.060  -->  00:00:42.490
work out if it's the error or the errors
18

18

00:00:42.490  -->  00:00:45.110
in your python code or in the sql
19

19

00:00:45.110  -->  00:00:47.830
statement that you've used so what we're
20

20

00:00:47.830  -->  00:00:49.630
going to do to start is we're going to
21

21

00:00:49.630  -->  00:00:51.970
start by installing the sqlite command line
22

22

00:00:51.970  -->  00:00:54.610
shell so that we can create databases
23

23

00:00:54.610  -->  00:00:56.410
and use sql commands without having
24

24

00:00:56.410  -->  00:00:58.810
to worry about Python code yet on
25

25

00:00:58.810  -->  00:01:00.610
Windows the sqlite command-line
26

26

00:01:00.610  -->  00:01:03.400
shell is an executable file called sql
27

27

00:01:03.400  -->  00:01:07.090
light three dot exe unfortunately this
28

28

00:01:07.090  -->  00:01:09.470
isn't included with python so this video
29

29

00:01:09.470  -->  00:01:11.210
we're going to see how to download that
30

30

00:01:11.210  -->  00:01:12.950
executable and add it to our computers
31

31

00:01:12.950  -->  00:01:14.780
path so that we can use it
32

32

00:01:14.780  -->  00:01:16.670
first things first we're going to go to
33

33

00:01:16.670  -->  00:01:25.070
the sqlite website....and
34

34

00:01:25.070  -->  00:01:26.360
you can see at the top we get there there's
35

35

00:01:26.360  -->  00:01:27.770
a download link so i'm going to click on
36

36

00:01:27.770  -->  00:01:31.340
that now there is actually an installer
37

37

00:01:31.340  -->  00:01:32.900
for sqlite instead it's packaged
38

38

00:01:32.900  -->  00:01:35.540
into a number of zip files now I mention
39

39

00:01:35.540  -->  00:01:37.430
that sqlite is included in the standard
40

40

00:01:37.430  -->  00:01:39.980
Python libraries so consequently we
41

41

00:01:39.980  -->  00:01:41.300
don't need to install sqlite
42

42

00:01:41.300  -->  00:01:44.330
itself the file we want actually is a
43

43

00:01:44.330  -->  00:01:46.610
bundle up command line tools for managing
44

44

00:01:46.610  -->  00:01:48.530
sql li like databases you can see we've
45

45

00:01:48.530  -->  00:01:50.060
got one here we've got a osx version
46

46

00:01:50.060  -->  00:01:52.160
there and down here we've got a windows
47

47

00:01:52.160  -->  00:01:54.250
version here a bundle of command line
48

48

00:01:54.250  -->  00:01:55.820
tools for managing sqlite databases
49

49

00:01:55.820  -->  00:01:57.800
i'm going to click on that link now
50

50

00:01:57.800  -->  00:02:00.050
bearing in mind when you're
51

51

00:02:00.050  -->  00:02:01.490
watching this video the version number
52

52

00:02:01.490  -->  00:02:03.950
may have changed but that's alright if
53

53

00:02:03.950  -->  00:02:05.480
it's a later version and click on that
54

54

00:02:05.480  -->  00:02:08.990
one and leave that downloading it's
55

55

00:02:08.990  -->  00:02:10.160
actually finished it was quite a quick
56

56

00:02:10.160  -->  00:02:12.680
download I do notice that the description
57

57

00:02:12.680  -->  00:02:15.280
for this file includes links to the
58

58

00:02:15.280  -->  00:02:17.780
three executables over here we've got
59

59

00:02:17.780  -->  00:02:18.980
the command line shell
60

60

00:02:18.980  -->  00:02:21.380
sql diff .exe and sqlite analyzer
61

61

00:02:21.380  -->  00:02:24.200
dot exe I suggest you bookmark
62

62

00:02:24.200  -->  00:02:25.820
this page so that you can come back here
63

63

00:02:25.820  -->  00:02:27.080
and check those links and in the future
64

64

00:02:27.080  -->  00:02:29.810
but the tool we need at the moment is the
65

65

00:02:29.810  -->  00:02:32.090
Command line shell so what we need to do is
66

66

00:02:32.090  -->  00:02:33.740
extract the contents of the zip file to
67

67

00:02:33.740  -->  00:02:35.210
a suitable directory and then add that
68

68

00:02:35.210  -->  00:02:37.430
directory to our path i'm going to do is
69

69

00:02:37.430  -->  00:02:39.890
just go to the folder where that is
70

70

00:02:39.890  -->  00:02:41.960
sqlite was opened and you can
71

71

00:02:41.960  -->  00:02:43.130
see that I've actually got sqlite tools
72

72

00:02:43.130  -->  00:02:45.770
there so I'm just going to extract
73

73

00:02:45.770  -->  00:02:47.870
all extracted currently in that current
74

74

00:02:47.870  -->  00:02:50.630
path for now it's quite quick because
75

75

00:02:50.630  -->  00:02:52.970
its only a small file what I'm going to
76

76

00:02:52.970  -->  00:02:54.380
do now we're going to move these
77

77

00:02:54.380  -->  00:02:55.730
I'm going to right-click that the
78

78

00:02:55.730  -->  00:02:58.310
folder that was extracted ok so I'm
79

79

00:02:58.310  -->  00:02:59.450
going to cut that folder and then what
80

80

00:02:59.450  -->  00:03:00.560
i'm going to do i'm actually going to
81

81

00:03:00.560  -->  00:03:04.220
put this in my users like sort of main
82

82

00:03:04.220  -->  00:03:06.140
home folder that you can put this in the
83

83

00:03:06.140  -->  00:03:07.970
program files directory or somewhere
84

84

00:03:07.970  -->  00:03:10.160
else doesn't really matter but for
85

85

00:03:10.160  -->  00:03:11.570
simplicity what i'm going to do is just
86

86

00:03:11.570  -->  00:03:15.500
go to my local disk into my users and
87

87

00:03:15.500  -->  00:03:16.880
Tim which is the folder that I'm
88

88

00:03:16.880  -->  00:03:18.110
gonna put it I'm going to actually save
89

89

00:03:18.110  -->  00:03:19.790
it in there but again the choice is
90

90

00:03:19.790  -->  00:03:21.080
yours to where you want to save it so
91

91

00:03:21.080  -->  00:03:23.270
i'm going to right click and do paste to
92

92

00:03:23.270  -->  00:03:25.520
put in it and that's now the folder
93

93

00:03:25.520  -->  00:03:28.220
I moved over and we double-click
94

94

00:03:28.220  -->  00:03:31.460
it now to open the folder what we can do
95

95

00:03:31.460  -->  00:03:33.350
up here is we can actually come up here
96

96

00:03:33.350  -->  00:03:35.210
and click the address bar and
97

97

00:03:35.210  -->  00:03:37.370
then click on control c that's
98

98

00:03:37.370  -->  00:03:38.930
actually gonna take a copy of the path
99

99

00:03:38.930  -->  00:03:40.940
which we can use to actually update the
100

100

00:03:40.940  -->  00:03:43.070
path on the computer now the
101

101

00:03:43.070  -->  00:03:45.440
instructions to set the path start off
102

102

00:03:45.440  -->  00:03:47.660
slightly differently depending on which
103

103

00:03:47.660  -->  00:03:49.300
version of windows that you're
104

104

00:03:49.300  -->  00:03:52.130
using i'm using Windows 10 here and if
105

105

00:03:52.130  -->  00:03:53.570
your keyboards got a
106

106

00:03:53.570  -->  00:03:55.940
Windows key the quickest way for all
107

107

00:03:55.940  -->  00:03:57.950
versions of windows is to use windows
108

108

00:03:57.950  -->  00:03:59.870
and pause i hold down the windows key
109

109

00:03:59.870  -->  00:04:01.430
press pause which I'm going to do or
110

110

00:04:01.430  -->  00:04:03.830
click pause that brings up this window
111

111

00:04:03.830  -->  00:04:06.050
here otherwise we just need to navigate
112

112

00:04:06.050  -->  00:04:08.660
to the control panel system and security
113

113

00:04:08.660  -->  00:04:10.880
and system on your version of windows
114

114

00:04:10.880  -->  00:04:13.370
to get access to it and then from here
115

115

00:04:13.370  -->  00:04:15.260
we can actually click on the advanced
116

116

00:04:15.260  -->  00:04:17.120
system settings on the left i'm going
117

117

00:04:17.120  -->  00:04:19.700
to click on that that takes you to the
118

118

00:04:19.700  -->  00:04:22.550
system properties dialog which is where
119

119

00:04:22.550  -->  00:04:24.320
all other windows version should
120

120

00:04:24.320  -->  00:04:26.360
already be so basically a couple of ways
121

121

00:04:26.360  -->  00:04:27.710
to get there but the bottom line is you
122

122

00:04:27.710  -->  00:04:29.570
want to get to this location and from
123

123

00:04:29.570  -->  00:04:31.640
here what we want to do is click on
124

124

00:04:31.640  -->  00:04:32.300
environment
125

125

00:04:32.300  -->  00:04:35.630
variables and just a quick note that if
126

126

00:04:35.630  -->  00:04:37.070
for some reason you couldn't get there
127

127

00:04:37.070  -->  00:04:39.110
with the windows key you can actually
128

128

00:04:39.110  -->  00:04:41.180
just a right click the my computer icon
129

129

00:04:41.180  -->  00:04:42.560
on your desktop and choose properties
130

130

00:04:42.560  -->  00:04:44.660
and you there as well
131

131

00:04:44.660  -->  00:04:46.880
alright so we're actually here now and
132

132

00:04:46.880  -->  00:04:49.130
what we want to do is come down here to
133

133

00:04:49.130  -->  00:04:52.520
where it's got the edit button are
134

134

00:04:52.520  -->  00:04:54.200
making sure that path is selected over
135

135

00:04:54.200  -->  00:04:56.510
here under user variables unless you
136

136

00:04:56.510  -->  00:04:59.090
really comfortable with doing this leave
137

137

00:04:59.090  -->  00:05:00.770
the system variable section down here at
138

138

00:05:00.770  -->  00:05:02.840
the bottom completely alone if you mess
139

139

00:05:02.840  -->  00:05:04.790
up the system path variables it can be
140

140

00:05:04.790  -->  00:05:05.930
really quite difficult to recover
141

141

00:05:05.930  -->  00:05:07.850
windows so you can get into difficulty
142

142

00:05:07.850  -->  00:05:10.430
so just you don't touch that area but
143

143

00:05:10.430  -->  00:05:11.990
under the user variable their may or may not
144

144

00:05:11.990  -->  00:05:14.270
already be a path variable as you can
145

145

00:05:14.270  -->  00:05:16.370
see here in my case it already exists
146

146

00:05:16.370  -->  00:05:17.420
and I actually got my python
147

147

00:05:17.420  -->  00:05:19.850
installation actually in the path but if
148

148

00:05:19.850  -->  00:05:21.200
you're not there
149

149

00:05:21.200  -->  00:05:22.910
you don't see a path variable you click
150

150

00:05:22.910  -->  00:05:26.240
on new and you actually specify the
151

151

00:05:26.240  -->  00:05:28.220
pathnames as path the word path and then
152

152

00:05:28.220  -->  00:05:29.690
you type in the value or paste in the
153

153

00:05:29.690  -->  00:05:32.000
value right here so put those details in
154

154

00:05:32.000  -->  00:05:33.680
but in my case because the path already
155

155

00:05:33.680  -->  00:05:36.560
exists i'm going to click on edit so
156

156

00:05:36.560  -->  00:05:39.080
select path click on edit and what we're
157

157

00:05:39.080  -->  00:05:41.180
going to do now is actually add the path
158

158

00:05:41.180  -->  00:05:43.490
now this is actually showing a new path
159

159

00:05:43.490  -->  00:05:46.280
variable being created on Windows 10 if
160

160

00:05:46.280  -->  00:05:48.020
your editing an existing path variable
161

161

00:05:48.020  -->  00:05:49.610
leave the name unchange just add a
162

162

00:05:49.610  -->  00:05:51.560
semicolon to the end of the previous
163

163

00:05:51.560  -->  00:05:53.720
value as a couple of ways of doing it
164

164

00:05:53.720  -->  00:05:56.030
but this is the new way on Windows 10
165

165

00:05:56.030  -->  00:05:57.230
where you click on new
166

166

00:05:57.230  -->  00:06:00.830
just actually paste in the value their
167

167

00:06:00.830  -->  00:06:02.720
for some reason the control
168

168

00:06:02.720  -->  00:06:04.850
c didn't work so just
169

169

00:06:04.850  -->  00:06:08.930
get back to the Explorer again i can
170

170

00:06:08.930  -->  00:06:10.040
actually just going to their we can make
171

171

00:06:10.040  -->  00:06:11.360
sure that that's actually showing like
172

172

00:06:11.360  -->  00:06:12.830
that I think that is what I did last time will
173

173

00:06:12.830  -->  00:06:15.380
control c their or right-click
174

174

00:06:15.380  -->  00:06:16.760
and do a copy for want to that way to
175

175

00:06:16.760  -->  00:06:19.550
copy that entire path and if I go back now
176

176

00:06:19.550  -->  00:06:22.190
to the system environment variables area
177

177

00:06:22.190  -->  00:06:25.610
click on new I can paste that in and
178

178

00:06:25.610  -->  00:06:27.290
that's now that variable that's been
179

179

00:06:27.290  -->  00:06:29.450
added so either way whether you've got
180

180

00:06:29.450  -->  00:06:30.950
the option to do it this way we've got
181

181

00:06:30.950  -->  00:06:33.350
an older way may just be shown the entire
182

182

00:06:33.350  -->  00:06:35.030
path got the old way
183

183

00:06:35.030  -->  00:06:38.210
go to the end the end of the paths
184

184

00:06:38.210  -->  00:06:40.190
settings that the various paths the
185

185

00:06:40.190  -->  00:06:42.710
defined on your system put a semicolon there and
186

186

00:06:42.710  -->  00:06:44.060
paste in the values but in this case
187

187

00:06:44.060  -->  00:06:45.870
this is a new way that Windows 10 does it
188

188

00:06:45.870  -->  00:06:47.730
you just select new and you enter another
189

189

00:06:47.730  -->  00:06:50.790
values there click on ok and what's
190

190

00:06:50.790  -->  00:06:53.040
happened now is that Windows 10 has
191

191

00:06:53.040  -->  00:06:54.600
actually updated our environment variable
192

192

00:06:54.600  -->  00:06:57.660
so click okay close it down i can click on ok
193

193

00:06:57.660  -->  00:07:00.450
their alright at that point the path now
194

194

00:07:00.450  -->  00:07:02.460
been set so what we can do now is check
195

195

00:07:02.460  -->  00:07:04.290
that the sqlite command line shell is
196

196

00:07:04.290  -->  00:07:06.720
working the easiest way to do that is
197

197

00:07:06.720  -->  00:07:09.240
just to come down to here you can either
198

198

00:07:09.240  -->  00:07:12.270
just type it if it's under Windows 10 type
199

199

00:07:12.270  -->  00:07:15.780
CMD alternatively you can actually click
200

200

00:07:15.780  -->  00:07:17.280
on the right click on the windows
201

201

00:07:17.280  -->  00:07:20.760
startup image down here right click
202

202

00:07:20.760  -->  00:07:22.590
and select run and the type cmd
203

203

00:07:22.590  -->  00:07:23.820
either way you get to the command line
204

204

00:07:23.820  -->  00:07:25.230
prompt block like you can see the screen
205

205

00:07:25.230  -->  00:07:27.060
there and what we can do now is type...
206

206

00:07:27.060  -->  00:07:30.510
...just to verify that sqlite 3
207

207

00:07:30.510  -->  00:07:32.460
is working and you can see that
208

208

00:07:32.460  -->  00:07:34.320
is actually working actually came
209

209

00:07:34.320  -->  00:07:36.240
up and started up for us and that's good
210

210

00:07:36.240  -->  00:07:38.040
and as we can see that the things
211

211

00:07:38.040  -->  00:07:40.650
are working nicely and keep in mind you
212

212

00:07:40.650  -->  00:07:42.570
may see a slightly different version
213

213

00:07:42.570  -->  00:07:44.610
number showing on the screen to what I got here
214

214

00:07:44.610  -->  00:07:46.050
but that's ok so long as it
215

215

00:07:46.050  -->  00:07:47.130
actually works
216

216

00:07:47.130  -->  00:07:49.230
it means it's the sqlite command
217

217

00:07:49.230  -->  00:07:51.690
line shell is ready to go we can
218

218

00:07:51.690  -->  00:07:53.580
start using that in future videos
219

219

00:07:53.580  -->  00:07:56.760
alright so type in....to get out of
220

220

00:07:56.760  -->  00:07:59.580
sqlite three and type exit to close down
221

221

00:07:59.580  -->  00:08:01.710
the command prompt window and at this point
222

222

00:08:01.710  -->  00:08:03.210
your good to go sqlite three is
223

223

00:08:03.210  -->  00:08:06.480
installed on your Windows machine unless
224

224

00:08:06.480  -->  00:08:08.370
you've got a mac and a linux machine
225

225

00:08:08.370  -->  00:08:10.140
also you can actually skip the next two
226

226

00:08:10.140  -->  00:08:12.180
videos and move on to start where we
227

227

00:08:12.180  -->  00:08:14.490
actually start using sqlite3 i'll
228

228

00:08:14.490  -->  00:08:20.420
see you in the next video
