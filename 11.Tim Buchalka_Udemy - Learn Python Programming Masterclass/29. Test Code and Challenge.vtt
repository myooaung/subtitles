00:00:05.460  -->  00:00:07.620
alright so the changes we made at the
2

2

00:00:07.620  -->  00:00:09.930
end of the last video enable us to send
3

3

00:00:09.930  -->  00:00:11.550
the output to a file if you want to
4

4

00:00:11.550  -->  00:00:13.640
using the technique we saw back in
5

5

00:00:13.640  -->  00:00:15.720
Section 10 when we were writing to
6

6

00:00:15.720  -->  00:00:16.830
files
7

7

00:00:16.830  -->  00:00:18.380
alright so let's make sure that it still
8

8

00:00:18.380  -->  00:00:20.000
works and that it looks the same as it did
9

9

00:00:20.000  -->  00:00:22.310
before so now we can send the output to
10

10

00:00:22.310  -->  00:00:24.320
a file and see how it displays in a
11

11

00:00:24.320  -->  00:00:26.370
browser so lets actually do that so what
12

12

00:00:26.370  -->  00:00:29.040
we're going to do is after the
13

13

00:00:29.040  -->  00:00:32.240
tag the paragraph tag we're going to do
14

14

00:00:32.240  -->  00:00:39.330
....
15

15

00:00:39.330  -->  00:00:45.330
....
16

16

00:00:45.330  -->  00:00:48.030
...
17

17

00:00:48.030  -->  00:00:51.240
....
18

18

00:00:51.240  -->  00:00:54.830
...
19

19

00:00:54.830  -->  00:01:00.830
....
20

20

00:01:00.830  -->  00:01:02.780
and we'll just open the project pane so
21

21

00:01:02.780  -->  00:01:03.810
we can see that the file gets
22

22

00:01:03.810  -->  00:01:05.990
created for us now if you are using
23

23

00:01:05.990  -->  00:01:07.620
linux or mac do make sure you add the
24

24

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:10.380
dot HTML file extension even if you
25

25

00:01:10.380  -->  00:01:11.540
wouldn't normally do that and I'll
26

26

00:01:11.540  -->  00:01:13.170
explain why in a minute
27

27

00:01:13.170  -->  00:01:14.750
now we can send the output of the
28

28

00:01:14.750  -->  00:01:17.160
display method to a file by adding test
29

29

00:01:17.160  -->  00:01:20.100
_doc as the named perimeter in the
30

30

00:01:20.100  -->  00:01:22.350
call to display and you saw me do that on line
31

31

00:01:22.350  -->  00:01:27.540
69 so let's just run this you can
32

32

00:01:27.540  -->  00:01:29.490
see that was very quick and then the
33

33

00:01:29.490  -->  00:01:33.090
file test.HTML appeared now intelliJ
34

34

00:01:33.090  -->  00:01:35.390
understands about HTML so i can
35

35

00:01:35.390  -->  00:01:36.810
right-click the test file in the project
36

36

00:01:36.810  -->  00:01:41.100
pane the context menu their is an open in
37

37

00:01:41.100  -->  00:01:44.280
browser down here and that's why I
38

38

00:01:44.280  -->  00:01:45.660
mentioned that you should include the
39

39

00:01:45.660  -->  00:01:48.180
file extension linux and osx don't
40

40

00:01:48.180  -->  00:01:49.980
rely on the file extension to decide
41

41

00:01:49.980  -->  00:01:51.500
what to do with the file but
42

42

00:01:51.500  -->  00:01:53.030
intelliJ has adopted the windows
43

43

00:01:53.030  -->  00:01:54.860
approach and does use the file extension
44

44

00:01:54.860  -->  00:01:57.840
so if the file doesn't have a dot HTM or
45

45

00:01:57.840  -->  00:02:00.600
dot HTML extension then you won't get
46

46

00:02:00.600  -->  00:02:02.570
the option to open in your browser
47

47

00:02:02.570  -->  00:02:04.820
alright so in my case though i'm going
48

48

00:02:04.820  -->  00:02:06.140
to choose chrome which is the one that I
49

49

00:02:06.140  -->  00:02:07.610
normally do when i'm recording videos
50

50

00:02:07.610  -->  00:02:09.860
you can choose the default
51

51

00:02:09.860  -->  00:02:12.720
browser and we can see that it's
52

52

00:02:12.720  -->  00:02:14.220
actually popped up now and it's working
53

53

00:02:14.220  -->  00:02:15.330
quite nicely
54

54

00:02:15.330  -->  00:02:18.240
alright so that's composition now we've
55

55

00:02:18.240  -->  00:02:19.060
used both
56

56

00:02:19.060  -->  00:02:21.340
composition and inheritance in this program
57

57

00:02:21.340  -->  00:02:23.320
so it's a good example of the
58

58

00:02:23.320  -->  00:02:25.300
differences between them and when you
59

59

00:02:25.300  -->  00:02:28.150
use each one so getting back to our code
60

60

00:02:28.150  -->  00:02:34.090
now our basic classes all inherit from
61

61

00:02:34.090  -->  00:02:35.920
tagged and when we talk about head for
62

62

00:02:35.920  -->  00:02:39.090
example would say that head is a tag
63

63

00:02:39.090  -->  00:02:41.920
similarly body is a tag and so is
64

64

00:02:41.920  -->  00:02:44.260
doctype although doc type are slightly
65

65

00:02:44.260  -->  00:02:46.150
different kind of tag it doesn't have a
66

66

00:02:46.150  -->  00:02:48.430
corresponding end tag so whenever you
67

67

00:02:48.430  -->  00:02:49.870
have a relationship that can be
68

68

00:02:49.870  -->  00:02:51.900
described using is a that's an
69

69

00:02:51.900  -->  00:02:53.110
indication that you should consider
70

70

00:02:53.110  -->  00:02:55.900
using inheritance to model the objects
71

71

00:02:55.900  -->  00:02:57.870
composition is used when the
72

72

00:02:57.870  -->  00:03:00.700
relationship is described as a has a a
73

73

00:03:00.700  -->  00:03:03.930
document has a doctype and has a body so
74

74

00:03:03.930  -->  00:03:05.860
composition is more appropriate to model
75

75

00:03:05.860  -->  00:03:06.970
the document
76

76

00:03:06.970  -->  00:03:08.430
ok there's another example of
77

77

00:03:08.430  -->  00:03:10.270
composition being used in our body class
78

78

00:03:10.270  -->  00:03:13.030
so let's have a look at that HTML
79

79

00:03:13.030  -->  00:03:14.620
doc object has to contain a
80

80

00:03:14.620  -->  00:03:18.090
doctype a head tag and a body tag so it's
81

81

00:03:18.090  -->  00:03:20.500
effectively not an HTML document without
82

82

00:03:20.500  -->  00:03:21.220
them
83

83

00:03:21.220  -->  00:03:23.340
so these three components are created
84

84

00:03:23.340  -->  00:03:25.120
when each instance of the class is
85

85

00:03:25.120  -->  00:03:28.590
created in the init method you can see
86

86

00:03:28.590  -->  00:03:29.920
its doing that down here starting on line
87

87

00:03:29.920  -->  00:03:33.210
47 now body object has any number of
88

88

00:03:33.210  -->  00:03:36.240
tags and maybe empty that would make for
89

89

00:03:36.240  -->  00:03:38.320
a very interesting document but it would
90

90

00:03:38.320  -->  00:03:41.340
actually conform to the specification so
91

91

00:03:41.340  -->  00:03:43.210
we don't create any objects when body
92

92

00:03:43.210  -->  00:03:45.550
instances are created instead we just
93

93

00:03:45.550  -->  00:03:47.860
create an empty list ready to contain
94

94

00:03:47.860  -->  00:03:50.890
the tags when they're added you can see
95

95

00:03:50.890  -->  00:03:53.260
that code for that here on line 32 now
96

96

00:03:53.260  -->  00:03:55.240
when a tag is added to the body by
97

97

00:03:55.240  -->  00:03:57.040
calling the body classes add_
98

98

00:03:57.040  -->  00:04:00.120
tag method a new tag objects created then
99

99

00:04:00.120  -->  00:04:02.800
appended to the list now this is also
100

100

00:04:02.800  -->  00:04:05.620
composition but now the body class has
101

101

00:04:05.620  -->  00:04:08.400
its own attributes isn't just composed
102

102

00:04:08.400  -->  00:04:10.150
of its composite classes
103

103

00:04:10.150  -->  00:04:11.860
it has an underscore body _
104

104

00:04:11.860  -->  00:04:14.460
contents data attribute and a method
105

105

00:04:14.460  -->  00:04:16.330
called add underscore tag
106

106

00:04:16.330  -->  00:04:18.090
alright so at this point anything else
107

107

00:04:18.090  -->  00:04:20.260
to say about this wil all be repetition
108

108

00:04:20.260  -->  00:04:22.650
so it's time for a challenge to
109

109

00:04:22.650  -->  00:04:24.730
consolidate what we covered to give you
110

110

00:04:24.730  -->  00:04:27.300
a bit of a chance to apply it at the
111

111

00:04:27.300  -->  00:04:29.670
moment ahead class doesn't create a
112

112

00:04:29.670  -->  00:04:31.990
document header with anything in it
113

113

00:04:31.990  -->  00:04:33.760
so your challenge is to modify the
114

114

00:04:33.760  -->  00:04:36.310
program so that the head class can
115

115

00:04:36.310  -->  00:04:39.430
include a title tag and your HTML should
116

116

00:04:39.430  -->  00:04:40.690
look something like this
117

117

00:04:40.690  -->  00:04:42.400
although there's no need to include
118

118

00:04:42.400  -->  00:04:44.320
line-breaks indenting I've just done
119

119

00:04:44.320  -->  00:04:46.480
that to make it easy to read but the
120

120

00:04:46.480  -->  00:04:48.670
text for the title will be passed to the
121

121

00:04:48.670  -->  00:04:51.220
html dot classes init method where
122

122

00:04:51.220  -->  00:04:53.500
the documents created alright so that's
123

123

00:04:53.500  -->  00:04:55.600
the challenge see how you go with that
124

124

00:04:55.600  -->  00:04:57.400
pause the video and I'll see you when
125

125

00:04:57.400  -->  00:05:01.870
you get back ok so the basic approach
126

126

00:05:01.870  -->  00:05:03.640
this challenge will probably be the same
127

127

00:05:03.640  -->  00:05:06.010
for all solutions but you may well have
128

128

00:05:06.010  -->  00:05:07.600
a different implementation to my
129

129

00:05:07.600  -->  00:05:10.090
solution as always that's fine
130

130

00:05:10.090  -->  00:05:12.970
the real test is does it work if you get
131

131

00:05:12.970  -->  00:05:14.650
the correct HTML produced then
132

132

00:05:14.650  -->  00:05:15.820
congratulations
133

133

00:05:15.820  -->  00:05:18.820
alright so if you read through the basic
134

134

00:05:18.820  -->  00:05:21.850
HTML structure that we looked in the
135

135

00:05:21.850  -->  00:05:23.740
browser earlier you may have noticed
136

136

00:05:23.740  -->  00:05:25.000
that the head can contain a few
137

137

00:05:25.000  -->  00:05:27.160
different tags so you may have made the
138

138

00:05:27.160  -->  00:05:30.700
head class behave like a body class with
139

139

00:05:30.700  -->  00:05:32.770
an add_tag method to add new content
140

140

00:05:32.770  -->  00:05:35.350
to the head element that's fine it's
141

141

00:05:35.350  -->  00:05:37.360
probably the way you do things so that
142

142

00:05:37.360  -->  00:05:40.090
the program correctly reflects the HTML
143

143

00:05:40.090  -->  00:05:42.730
specification the challenge we asked for
144

144

00:05:42.730  -->  00:05:45.220
a title so for my solution i'm just
145

145

00:05:45.220  -->  00:05:47.260
going to add a title and nothing more
146

146

00:05:47.260  -->  00:05:48.880
so the first step is to modify the head
147

147

00:05:48.880  -->  00:05:53.200
class and we need to modify the init
148

148

00:05:53.200  -->  00:05:55.540
method to take another argument which
149

149

00:05:55.540  -->  00:05:57.550
effectively will be the title going to
150

150

00:05:57.550  -->  00:06:00.850
come up here we're going to put....
151

151

00:06:00.850  -->  00:06:05.500
....
152

152

00:06:05.500  -->  00:06:09.160
...
153

153

00:06:09.160  -->  00:06:13.270
...
154

154

00:06:13.270  -->  00:06:16.480
....
155

155

00:06:16.480  -->  00:06:17.740
...
156

156

00:06:17.740  -->  00:06:20.080
...
157

157

00:06:20.080  -->  00:06:22.180
....
158

158

00:06:22.180  -->  00:06:27.340
...
159

159

00:06:27.340  -->  00:06:31.180
....so this creates a new
160

160

00:06:31.180  -->  00:06:34.390
tag with the name title and the contents
161

161

00:06:34.390  -->  00:06:36.400
being the text that was passed in to the
162

162

00:06:36.400  -->  00:06:39.070
init method now the head contents are
163

163

00:06:39.070  -->  00:06:41.200
then set to this the string
164

164

00:06:41.200  -->  00:06:43.450
representation of this new tag now we
165

165

00:06:43.450  -->  00:06:45.380
can improve that slightly
166

166

00:06:45.380  -->  00:06:47.170
if the title doesn't contain any text
167

167

00:06:47.170  -->  00:06:48.770
then we really don't want an empty tag
168

168

00:06:48.770  -->  00:06:51.580
inside the head so we can give the title
169

169

00:06:51.580  -->  00:06:53.830
parameter a default value than test
170

170

00:06:53.830  -->  00:06:56.330
this before creating the tag
171

171

00:06:56.330  -->  00:06:57.980
let's go ahead and do that i'm going to
172

172

00:06:57.980  -->  00:07:02.450
put....
173

173

00:07:02.450  -->  00:07:03.730
...
174

174

00:07:03.730  -->  00:07:14.360
...
175

175

00:07:14.360  -->  00:07:15.800
alright next thing we need to do is
176

176

00:07:15.800  -->  00:07:19.580
modify the HTML dot class now first it
177

177

00:07:19.580  -->  00:07:21.700
needs a parameter to the init method to
178

178

00:07:21.700  -->  00:07:24.550
accept the title and we'll use a named
179

179

00:07:24.550  -->  00:07:26.110
parameter with the default value here as
180

180

00:07:26.110  -->  00:07:28.790
well that way a document can be created
181

181

00:07:28.790  -->  00:07:32.270
without providing a title so come
182

182

00:07:32.270  -->  00:07:37.190
down to the html doc the init Method...
183

183

00:07:37.190  -->  00:07:39.500
...
184

184

00:07:39.500  -->  00:07:44.800
...
185

185

00:07:44.800  -->  00:07:48.790
...now the html .
186

186

00:07:48.790  -->  00:07:50.420
class doesn't have to do anything with
187

187

00:07:50.420  -->  00:07:52.600
the title it's just passing it on to the
188

188

00:07:52.600  -->  00:07:54.610
head class when it creates a new head
189

189

00:07:54.610  -->  00:07:56.720
object and that should be all we need to
190

190

00:07:56.720  -->  00:07:59.270
do I'm going to start by making sure we haven't
191

191

00:07:59.270  -->  00:08:00.890
broken anything so i'm going to run the
192

192

00:08:00.890  -->  00:08:05.140
program if we don't got any errors that is a
193

193

00:08:05.140  -->  00:08:07.580
good sign and what i can do is open the
194

194

00:08:07.580  -->  00:08:09.580
project pane I can also double-click
195

195

00:08:09.580  -->  00:08:11.980
that if i wanted to open the HTML file
196

196

00:08:11.980  -->  00:08:13.670
in the default browser but I'm going to
197

197

00:08:13.670  -->  00:08:15.980
right click it open a browser and choose
198

198

00:08:15.980  -->  00:08:19.910
chrome again that's it opening up now
199

199

00:08:19.910  -->  00:08:22.580
in a new tab if we have a look at the
200

200

00:08:22.580  -->  00:08:26.390
HTML so far so good we haven't past a title
201

201

00:08:26.390  -->  00:08:28.190
in so we haven't got a title and the
202

202

00:08:28.190  -->  00:08:29.950
head tags up there on line three
203

203

00:08:29.950  -->  00:08:32.830
so that's good that's working so let's
204

204

00:08:32.830  -->  00:08:34.730
see now if it works when we do passing a
205

205

00:08:34.730  -->  00:08:36.550
title and i'll provide that when we
206

206

00:08:36.550  -->  00:08:39.790
create the HTML doc instance go back
207

207

00:08:39.790  -->  00:08:40.700
to the code again
208

208

00:08:40.700  -->  00:08:44.470
so where we need to change this is on line
209

209

00:08:44.470  -->  00:08:48.140
67 let's just make that....
210

210

00:08:48.140  -->  00:08:52.210
....all right we'll run
211

211

00:08:52.210  -->  00:08:57.340
again in a browser or open in browser and
212

212

00:08:57.340  -->  00:08:58.720
look at the source
213

213

00:08:58.720  -->  00:09:01.900
okay for some reason we haven't got a
214

214

00:09:01.900  -->  00:09:03.070
a title lets just go back and check our
215

215

00:09:03.070  -->  00:09:08.080
code ok looking at the code
216

216

00:09:08.080  -->  00:09:09.700
definitely got the title in there and we go
217

217

00:09:09.700  -->  00:09:12.260
back down I'll go back up i should say
218

218

00:09:12.260  -->  00:09:13.130
to the head
219

219

00:09:13.130  -->  00:09:15.860
we've definitely got the title
220

220

00:09:15.860  -->  00:09:18.700
arguments showing init method and we're
221

221

00:09:18.700  -->  00:09:21.760
definitely creating a tag and that should all
222

222

00:09:21.760  -->  00:09:23.470
be ok as far as I'm concerns just try
223

223

00:09:23.470  -->  00:09:28.010
running it again and go back to browser
224

224

00:09:28.010  -->  00:09:29.570
what we need to do is need to open it
225

225

00:09:29.570  -->  00:09:35.440
again open browser Chrome again let's
226

226

00:09:35.440  -->  00:09:38.360
just look at the page source and it is
227

227

00:09:38.360  -->  00:09:40.210
....
228

228

00:09:40.210  -->  00:09:43.720
...
229

229

00:09:43.720  -->  00:09:46.310
...
230

230

00:09:46.310  -->  00:09:50.650
...ok so false alarm
231

231

00:09:50.650  -->  00:09:52.690
that was all working correctly and with
232

232

00:09:52.690  -->  00:09:55.190
now got the test html containing a
233

233

00:09:55.190  -->  00:09:58.330
title tag inside the head and by the way
234

234

00:09:58.330  -->  00:09:59.470
the other way we could have checked for
235

235

00:09:59.470  -->  00:10:01.880
that is if we just go back and
236

236

00:10:01.880  -->  00:10:05.870
closed down these view sources depending on
237

237

00:10:05.870  -->  00:10:07.880
the browser you can actually see the
238

238

00:10:07.880  -->  00:10:10.570
title in the browser bar but I can't the way
239

239

00:10:10.570  -->  00:10:11.890
chrome is configured on my
240

240

00:10:11.890  -->  00:10:13.660
computer right now that would be a
241

241

00:10:13.660  -->  00:10:15.740
second way of doing it anyway because in
242

242

00:10:15.740  -->  00:10:17.360
my case I'm still just seeing the URL of
243

243

00:10:17.360  -->  00:10:21.910
the document but depending on how your
244

244

00:10:21.910  -->  00:10:24.010
browser is configured you probably see
245

245

00:10:24.010  -->  00:10:25.810
the title in the browser's address bar
246

246

00:10:25.810  -->  00:10:26.590
anyway
the title in the browser's address bar
247

247

00:10:26.590  -->  00:10:28.810
alright so that's it that's composition
248

248

00:10:28.810  -->  00:10:30.970
in action in the next video we're going
249

249

00:10:30.970  -->  00:10:32.020
to look at something that's often
250

250

00:10:32.020  -->  00:10:33.740
described as a weaker form of
251

251

00:10:33.740  -->  00:10:36.700
composition and that's aggregation see
252

252

00:10:36.700  -->  00:10:42.450
you in the next video
