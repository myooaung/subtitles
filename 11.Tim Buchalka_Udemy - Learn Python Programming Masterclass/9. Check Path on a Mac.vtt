00:00:05.280  -->  00:00:08.680
so on this video I just wanna go
through and do a check if you're running a
2

2

00:00:08.680  -->  00:00:13.170
Mac computer to make sure that you can
use the pip 3 command that we need in
3

3

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:18.070
order to go further into the course so the way
to check it is to hold down command and
4

4

00:00:18.070  -->  00:00:25.810
press space then type terminal a first few letters is fin and then type pip3
5

5

00:00:25.810  -->  00:00:33.320
if you get something like that that's come up, so if
6

6

00:00:33.320  -->  00:00:35.690
you get a command like that that means that
you're good to go
7

7

00:00:35.690  -->  00:00:39.170
and everything is fine so if that's the
case you don't need to do anything else
8

8

00:00:39.170  -->  00:00:42.560
and you can finish the video now or leave the video and move on to the next one
9

9

00:00:42.560  -->  00:00:47.130
because your computer is
already configured correctly ok so I just
10

10

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:50.810
cleared the screen but if you've
actually type that command and you've
11

11

00:00:50.810  -->  00:00:54.250
got something like this and I'm going to type it again
pip3
12

12

00:00:54.250  -->  00:00:58.720
if you get an error like that then it means that there's
probably a step you missed when you first
13

13

00:00:58.720  -->  00:01:02.780
install the software and we need to go
ahead and fixed it up so that it will
14

14

00:01:02.780  -->  00:01:06.900
actually work now there is a way fairly
easily that's fairly easily done within
15

15

00:01:06.900  -->  00:01:13.120
the way Python 3.5 is set up to
activate that command so it will work from the command line
16

16

00:01:13.120  -->  00:01:19.620
that's all you really need to do so
coming back to finder and open applications
17

17

00:01:19.620  -->  00:01:25.110
come down here to Python 3.5 and then
click on update shell profile.command
18

18

00:01:25.110  -->  00:01:29.890
and you can see that I've done
that and it has come up and said this script will
19

19

00:01:29.890  -->  00:01:33.330
update your shell profile when the bin
directory of Pythono is not early enough of
20

20

00:01:33.330  -->  00:01:36.920
the Path of your shell these changes will only
be effective only in shell
21

21

00:01:36.920  -->  00:01:40.710
windows that you have open after reading the script now in
this case it has come up and said all right you
22

22

00:01:40.710  -->  00:01:46.710
are a Python lover already log out but what
it should do ordinarily for anyone else it
23

23

00:01:46.710  -->  00:01:50.470
will add that to your script and that means that down
the track when you type these commands
24

24

00:01:50.470  -->  00:01:58.870
it should work so if I go back now closes
down and open terminal window again
25

25

00:01:58.870  -->  00:02:05.850
terminal window and if I typed pip3 that's now working for me so you
26

26

00:02:05.850  -->  00:02:09.350
need to do the same there to make sure
it works and if you have no success you
27

27

00:02:09.350  -->  00:02:12.890
have a problem go ahead and redo an
installation again and I'm gonna bring
28

28

00:02:12.890  -->  00:02:17.190
that up on the screen now so you can see
29

29

00:02:17.190  -->  00:02:21.060
I'm going to go ahead and
reinstall it so clicking on
30

30

00:02:21.060  -->  00:02:22.930
continue continue
31

31

00:02:22.930  -->  00:02:33.740
agree install and by doing this this should in
fact actually set up for your path
32

32

00:02:33.740  -->  00:02:36.580
anyway but for some reason if you've got
some corruption or something along those
33

33

00:02:36.580  -->  00:02:40.890
lines then this would just force that
to be fixed and we
34

34

00:02:40.890  -->  00:02:47.210
should find its all updated and the environments
are actually updated for you automatically
35

35

00:02:47.210  -->  00:02:51.940
software was completed and at that point again if
you go to terminal now type terminal type
36

36

00:02:51.940  -->  00:02:57.370
pip3 you should find that that will then work for you
so again you only need to do the installation
37

37

00:02:57.370  -->  00:03:01.460
step if you found that other little
update method going into applications
38

38

00:03:01.460  -->  00:03:06.430
didn't work for you and what you may need to do
is also reboot your computer once for the
39

39

00:03:06.430  -->  00:03:11.240
changes take effect the bottom line is
to continue in the course you need to go
40

40

00:03:11.240  -->  00:03:15.580
into terminal and type pip 3 and if pip3 is
working you don't need to do anything
41

41

00:03:15.580  -->  00:03:18.640
else and your good to go so that's it I'll see you in the next
video
