00:00:04.940  -->  00:00:08.900
So now that we've seen how to use the
debugger to step through our code line by line,

2

00:00:08.900  -->  00:00:11.760
let's explore if statements a bit more.

3

00:00:11.760  -->  00:00:15.180
So I'm going to continue with the
project we set up for this section of

4

00:00:15.180  -->  00:00:21.680
the course - Program Flow. I'm going to
create a new python file and we're going to call that guessing game.

5

00:00:26.000  -->  00:00:29.140
Alright. Now I'm going to start this up very simply

6

00:00:29.140  -->  00:00:32.680
but we'll improve it as we go along.
Firstly, I'm going to start by binding

7

00:00:32.720  -->  00:00:36.560
a variable to the answer. Now the answer
will always be five at the moment

8

00:00:36.560  -->  00:00:42.000
and that's a bit boring but we'll improve
the program later. So answer = 5

9

00:00:42.000  -->  00:00:45.600
So next I want to print a prompt to let
the user know what they're entering,

10

00:00:45.600  -->  00:00:49.670
and then we'll use the input function to get their input. So on line 3 I'm gonna

11

00:00:49.670  -->  00:00:58.360
type print parenthesis double quotes,
Please guess a number between one and ten.

12

00:00:58.360  -->  00:01:03.340
We'll put a colon and a space there, then we've got that closing double quote and right parenthesis.

13

00:01:03.340  -->  00:01:08.180
Then we're going to accept
the input by typing guess equals int

14

00:01:08.180  -->  00:01:13.820
left parentheses input, left and right
parentheses and then a closing right parenthesis.

15

00:01:13.820  -->  00:01:17.240
Now I haven't provided a prompt
this time. We're printing a message on

16

00:01:17.240  -->  00:01:20.520
line three which tells the player what
the program's expecting them to do.

17

00:01:20.520  -->  00:01:24.580
Line four uses the input function without a prompt, but we still need the opening and

18

00:01:24.590  -->  00:01:28.970
closing parentheses after it, as you saw
me type. As before, we're using the int

19

00:01:28.970  -->  00:01:33.380
function to convert their input to an
integer. All input is stored as a string,

20

00:01:33.380  -->  00:01:37.500
but here we want to deal with numbers. So on line 4, we're actually binding the

21

00:01:37.500  -->  00:01:41.460
name guess to the integer value that
we've converted to an integer.

22

00:01:41.460  -->  00:01:44.980
So make sure you only entered valid numbers when
we run the program. We'll be looking at

23

00:01:44.980  -->  00:01:47.640
how to cope with invalid input later in
the course.

24

00:01:47.640  -->  00:01:51.320
Alright though, now it's time to see if
the players guess was correct. Now here,

25

00:01:51.320  -->  00:01:55.160
when we run the program, there's three
possible outcomes. The guess could be too

26

00:01:55.160  -->  00:02:00.110
low, it could be too high or they could
have guessed it correctly. What we want

27

00:02:00.110  -->  00:02:05.000
to do first is test for a too low guess.
We'll do that first and we'll do that on

28

00:02:05.040  -->  00:02:14.440
line 6 by typing if guess is less than
answer : then in parentheses, sorry print, then

29

00:02:14.440  -->  00:02:20.440
parenthesis on line 7, double quotes,
Please guess higher. Then we've got our

30

00:02:20.440  -->  00:02:25.400
closing double quote and right parenthesis. So
basically, if their guess is less than the

31

00:02:25.400  -->  00:02:29.660
answer, we print a message asking them to
guess higher. Now there's a bit more we

32

00:02:29.660  -->  00:02:32.959
need to do here but we'll come back to
that. Before we do though, let's add a

33

00:02:32.960  -->  00:02:37.700
test for the guess being too high. Now
we can do that using elif. So I'm here on

34

00:02:37.740  -->  00:02:43.940
line 8, I'm going to type elif guess.
This time I'm going to type greater than

35

00:02:43.940  -->  00:02:48.100
answer :
Then we're going to print on line 9,

36

00:02:48.100  -->  00:02:54.700
parenthesis double quote, Please guess
lower. Then we've got our closing double

37

00:02:54.700  -->  00:02:59.440
quote and right parenthesis. Now you might
think that we can just use if there, and

38

00:02:59.440  -->  00:03:04.620
you often can, but I'm going to discuss
why that's sometimes not a good idea, shortly.

39

00:03:04.620  -->  00:03:09.139
Alright, so if the condition on
line 6 is false, the condition on line

40

00:03:09.140  -->  00:03:13.400
8 is tested, and if that evaluates to
true, in other words, if their guess is

41

00:03:13.400  -->  00:03:18.100
greater than the answer, then we print
the message Please guess lower. So that's

42

00:03:18.109  -->  00:03:21.799
two of the three possible outcomes dealt
with. We're checking for the guess being

43

00:03:21.800  -->  00:03:26.360
less than the answer, and for it being
greater than the answer, so far. If both

44

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:30.260
those conditions are false, then the
guess must be equal to the answer.

45

00:03:30.260  -->  00:03:33.640
In other words, they've guessed correctly. So
therefore, we can handle everything else

46

00:03:33.640  -->  00:03:38.560
here using else. So we're going to type
else: on line 10, and print a message,

47

00:03:38.560  -->  00:03:44.820
print parenthesis double quote, You got it
first time, then we've got a closing

48

00:03:44.820  -->  00:03:50.060
double quote and right parenthesis. So
basically, the message on line 11 is only

49

00:03:50.060  -->  00:03:52.909
going to be printed if both the
conditions on line 6 and line 8

50

00:03:52.909  -->  00:03:58.720
evaluate to false. Because else picks up
everything else, it must come after the

51

00:03:58.720  -->  00:04:04.060
if and elif blocks. elif must follow an if,
and all elif blocks have to appear

52

00:04:04.060  -->  00:04:08.000
before the else block, if there is one.
Right, so let's run the program a few

53

00:04:08.000  -->  00:04:13.120
times to check that it's working. I'm
gonna run it now. Now first I'm gonna

54

00:04:13.129  -->  00:04:17.959
enter my guess as 4. Remember to click
into the run pane, as I just did, before

55

00:04:17.959  -->  00:04:22.520
typing your guess. We get the message "Please 
guess higher", which is correct because

56

00:04:22.520  -->  00:04:27.540
obviously 4 is less than 5. I'm gonna
run it again,

57

00:04:27.540  -->  00:04:32.680
and this time I'm gonna type a higher value, 8.
You can see we've got the output "Please

58

00:04:32.680  -->  00:04:37.600
guess lower", which is also correct. 8, of
course, is more or higher than 5.

59

00:04:37.600  -->  00:04:41.380
The third test is when the guess is correct,
so I'm going to run that again,

60

00:04:41.380  -->  00:04:46.140
and this time I'm going to type in the value 5,
and we've got the message "You got it

61

00:04:46.140  -->  00:04:50.820
first time" on screen. So run the program
a few times with different guesses to

62

00:04:50.820  -->  00:04:54.220
make sure it works, and in the next video
what we'll do is, we'll run the program

63

00:04:54.220  -->  00:04:59.670
in the debugger to check what it's doing.
See you in the next video.
