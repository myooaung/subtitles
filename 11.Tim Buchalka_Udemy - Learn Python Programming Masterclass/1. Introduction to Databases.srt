00:00:05,420  -->  00:00:07,570
in this section we're going to look at
2

2

00:00:07,570  -->  00:00:09,940
databases and the sqlite database
3

3

00:00:09,940  -->  00:00:11,690
that's included with the python
4

4

00:00:11,690  -->  00:00:14,470
standard modules now if we are going to use a
5

5

00:00:14,470  -->  00:00:16,880
database in our programs it's very
6

6

00:00:16,880  -->  00:00:18,710
important to understand specifically
7

7

00:00:18,710  -->  00:00:21,320
what a databases is s think of a
8

8

00:00:21,320  -->  00:00:23,240
database is just an organized collection
9

9

00:00:23,240  -->  00:00:25,450
of data that can be used to store
10

10

00:00:25,450  -->  00:00:27,770
information on a computer or access from
11

11

00:00:27,770  -->  00:00:31,470
a web server over the Internet
12

12

00:00:31,470  -->  00:00:34,080
also though if you've used an android or
13

13

00:00:34,080  -->  00:00:36,810
iOS phone or tablet and run an app on one of
14

14

00:00:36,810  -->  00:00:38,900
those devices chances are really high
15

15

00:00:38,900  -->  00:00:41,430
that a sqlite database has been used in
16

16

00:00:41,430  -->  00:00:44,240
some capacity Android itself uses many
17

17

00:00:44,240  -->  00:00:46,310
databases to store things like your
18

18

00:00:46,310  -->  00:00:48,840
contact info text messages and your
19

19

00:00:48,840  -->  00:00:51,570
browser history search history is also
20

20

00:00:51,570  -->  00:00:53,570
stored in the database which is how the
21

21

00:00:53,570  -->  00:00:55,590
Google search on your android phone if
22

22

00:00:55,590  -->  00:00:57,780
you've got one knows watching search for
23

23

00:00:57,780  -->  00:00:59,670
previously can then offer suggestions
24

24

00:00:59,670  -->  00:01:01,710
anything that stores and retrieves
25

25

00:01:01,710  -->  00:01:03,600
information can really be called a
26

26

00:01:03,600  -->  00:01:05,810
database these days though the term
27

27

00:01:05,810  -->  00:01:08,250
database is normally used to refer to
28

28

00:01:08,250  -->  00:01:13,050
more structured data
29

29

00:01:13,050  -->  00:01:16,020
now vendor such as Microsoft Oracle and
30

30

00:01:16,020  -->  00:01:18,710
IBM produce database management systems
31

31

00:01:18,710  -->  00:01:21,990
based on a relational database over here
32

32

00:01:21,990  -->  00:01:24,530
data is stored in rows and columns with
33

33

00:01:24,530  -->  00:01:26,940
a row corresponding to a single record
34

34

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:29,840
and the columns representing the fields
35

35

00:01:29,840  -->  00:01:32,090
that make up a record such as the name
36

36

00:01:32,090  -->  00:01:34,440
address and date of birth in the case of
37

37

00:01:34,440  -->  00:01:36,630
a person's record or stock number
38

38

00:01:36,630  -->  00:01:39,120
description qty in a stock keeping
39

39

00:01:39,120  -->  00:01:43,240
application
40

40

00:01:43,240  -->  00:01:45,040
now theirs a huge number of database
41

41

00:01:45,040  -->  00:01:46,810
systems out there probably the most
42

42

00:01:46,810  -->  00:01:48,640
well-known of the traditional databases
43

43

00:01:48,640  -->  00:01:52,510
being sql server oracle and db2 the
44

44

00:01:52,510  -->  00:01:55,540
Oracle own the Java language after
45

45

00:01:55,540  -->  00:01:57,850
buying sum micro systems but they were
46

46

00:01:57,850  -->  00:02:00,030
originally created as a database company
47

47

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:02,320
now these traditional databases
48

48

00:02:02,320  -->  00:02:04,270
typically use structured query language
49

49

00:02:04,270  -->  00:02:07,630
shortened to sql or SQL depending how
50

50

00:02:07,630  -->  00:02:09,550
you want to pronounce it and use these
51

51

00:02:09,550  -->  00:02:11,560
for performing or use a sql for
52

52

00:02:11,560  -->  00:02:14,280
performing operations such as query and
53

53

00:02:14,280  -->  00:02:17,020
updating data but is now also a growing
54

54

00:02:17,020  -->  00:02:19,510
interest in no sql databases used for
55

55

00:02:19,510  -->  00:02:24,500
storing and processing big data
56

56

00:02:24,500  -->  00:02:27,410
getting back to android the android
57

57

00:02:27,410  -->  00:02:28,790
operating system includes a public
58

58

00:02:28,790  -->  00:02:30,590
domain database engine called sqlite
59

59

00:02:30,590  -->  00:02:32,990
and Python includes support for
60

60

00:02:32,990  -->  00:02:34,700
sqlite databases in the standard
61

61

00:02:34,700  -->  00:02:37,220
library now unlike traditional database
62

62

00:02:37,220  -->  00:02:38,960
management systems such a sql server
63

63

00:02:38,960  -->  00:02:41,900
or oracle sqlite is completely
64

64

00:02:41,900  -->  00:02:43,790
self-contained it doesn't actually need
65

65

00:02:43,790  -->  00:02:46,610
a separate server to run on now sqlite
66

66

00:02:46,610  -->  00:02:48,590
was designed to be embedded into systems
67

67

00:02:48,590  -->  00:02:50,390
originally actually missile guidance
68

68

00:02:50,390  -->  00:02:53,030
systems so it uses the sql language
69

69

00:02:53,030  -->  00:02:55,730
which makes it very easy to use if you
70

70

00:02:55,730  -->  00:02:58,040
already know a bit about databases and
71

71

00:02:58,040  -->  00:02:59,450
it really means that you can move on to
72

72

00:02:59,450  -->  00:03:02,030
use another sql database or other
73

73

00:03:02,030  -->  00:03:04,430
databases once you've learned the basics
74

74

00:03:04,430  -->  00:03:09,230
of sql with sqlite
75

75

00:03:09,230  -->  00:03:11,000
and getting back to the history of
76

76

00:03:11,000  -->  00:03:13,220
sql it was developed originally from
77

77

00:03:13,220  -->  00:03:15,710
Edgar F Codds work on relational
78

78

00:03:15,710  -->  00:03:18,080
databases in the nineteen seventies and
79

79

00:03:18,080  -->  00:03:21,370
became an ansi standard in 1986 now
80

80

00:03:21,370  -->  00:03:22,940
sqlite implements most of the
81

81

00:03:22,940  -->  00:03:25,970
features of sql 92 and although their has
82

82

00:03:25,970  -->  00:03:28,010
been for revisions of the standard since
83

83

00:03:28,010  -->  00:03:30,010
sql 92 includes everything needed
84

84

00:03:30,010  -->  00:03:32,930
for most database tasks and just as an
85

85

00:03:32,930  -->  00:03:35,900
aside text messages on iphone are also
86

86

00:03:35,900  -->  00:03:38,150
stored in a sqlite database so really
87

87

00:03:38,150  -->  00:03:39,710
sqlite is used quite
88

88

00:03:39,710  -->  00:03:44,230
heavily out there
89

89

00:03:44,230  -->  00:03:46,040
now if you freaking out about now at
90

90

00:03:46,040  -->  00:03:47,480
the prospect of having to learn yet
91

91

00:03:47,480  -->  00:03:48,710
another language
92

92

00:03:48,710  -->  00:03:51,130
don't worry sql is the language but
93

93

00:03:51,130  -->  00:03:53,350
it's nowhere near as complicated as Java
94

94

00:03:53,350  -->  00:03:55,730
or Python in fact you can actually do a
95

95

00:03:55,730  -->  00:03:57,710
lot of database work with only the four
96

96

00:03:57,710  -->  00:04:01,300
commands select insert update and delete
97

97

00:04:01,300  -->  00:04:04,540
if you are going to do a lot of database
98

98

00:04:04,540  -->  00:04:06,650
work then you will need to learn sql
99

99

00:04:06,650  -->  00:04:08,930
more fully than what we need here and
100

100

00:04:08,930  -->  00:04:10,010
you'll also need to learn about things
101

101

00:04:10,010  -->  00:04:12,550
like normalization but the basics that
102

102

00:04:12,550  -->  00:04:14,960
i'm going to cover will allow you to create programs
103

103

00:04:14,960  -->  00:04:17,350
that can do basic storage update and
104

104

00:04:17,350  -->  00:04:22,270
retrieval of information in a database
105

105

00:04:22,270  -->  00:04:24,260
so sqlite itself has been around
106

106

00:04:24,260  -->  00:04:26,860
since around the year 2000 it's a very
107

107

00:04:26,860  -->  00:04:29,780
fast and very stable standalone database
108

108

00:04:29,780  -->  00:04:32,570
in fact it's the most widely deployed
109

109

00:04:32,570  -->  00:04:35,200
database engine in the world actually
110

110

00:04:35,200  -->  00:04:36,760
close to being the most widely deployed
111

111

00:04:36,760  -->  00:04:38,780
piece of software any kind which is
112

112

00:04:38,780  -->  00:04:40,130
pretty impressive if you think about it
113

113

00:04:40,130  -->  00:04:42,470
so if you want to go and check out some
114

114

00:04:42,470  -->  00:04:44,660
examples of its use in justifications for
115

115

00:04:44,660  -->  00:04:46,280
the claim that it's the most widely
116

116

00:04:46,280  -->  00:04:48,380
deployed database engine in the world
117

117

00:04:48,380  -->  00:04:50,600
check out....
118

118

00:04:50,600  -->  00:04:55,220
....
119

119

00:04:55,220  -->  00:04:57,290
you can also find more information out
120

120

00:04:57,290  -->  00:04:59,180
about sqlite that same website
121

121

00:04:59,180  -->  00:05:01,430
just visit...
122

122

00:05:01,430  -->  00:05:03,140
or if you happen to have
123

123

00:05:03,140  -->  00:05:04,610
been on the other pages click on the
124

124

00:05:04,610  -->  00:05:06,470
sqlite logo to get back there good
125

125

00:05:06,470  -->  00:05:07,820
information on that site you want to
126

126

00:05:07,820  -->  00:05:09,650
find out more about sqlite
127

127

00:05:09,650  -->  00:05:10,880
alright so let's start off in the next
128

128

00:05:10,880  -->  00:05:12,680
video by having a look at some basic
129

129

00:05:12,680  -->  00:05:15,110
database terminology for things like
130

130

00:05:15,110  -->  00:05:18,230
tables records and fields recordsets and
131

131

00:05:18,230  -->  00:05:20,840
why they're important and after we've
132

132

00:05:20,840  -->  00:05:22,550
done that we'll then move onto actually
133

133

00:05:22,550  -->  00:05:24,500
using sqlite to create databases
134

134

00:05:24,500  -->  00:05:26,690
and store information but in the next
135

135

00:05:26,690  -->  00:05:28,280
video as i mentioned we'll go ahead and
136

136

00:05:28,280  -->  00:05:30,470
start looking at that terminology see
137

137

00:05:30,470  -->  00:05:36,220
you in the next video
