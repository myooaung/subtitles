00:00:05.440  -->  00:00:07.200
<v Instructor>So, as we saw in the previous video,</v>
2

2

00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:09.820
we got our basic screen up and working
3

3

00:00:09.820  -->  00:00:12.140
but we're missing scroll bars though.
4

4

00:00:12.140  -->  00:00:15.080
Now, we could put scroll bars in their own columns
5

5

00:00:15.080  -->  00:00:16.730
next to the list boxes,
6

6

00:00:16.730  -->  00:00:18.920
and if you set them to be sticky to the left-hand side
7

7

00:00:18.920  -->  00:00:21.570
of the column, so to the west, in other words,
8

8

00:00:21.570  -->  00:00:24.410
they'd appear right up against the appropriate list box.
9

9

00:00:24.410  -->  00:00:27.220
And that's a perfectly acceptable way to do it
10

10

00:00:27.220  -->  00:00:29.340
but I don't actually want to do that here.
11

11

00:00:29.340  -->  00:00:31.110
So, in case you haven't guessed,
12

12

00:00:31.110  -->  00:00:33.290
we're gonna be creating our own classes,
13

13

00:00:33.290  -->  00:00:34.990
we're gonna create our own classes
14

14

00:00:34.990  -->  00:00:36.480
and they're gonna inherit from
15

15

00:00:36.480  -->  00:00:39.220
the TK inter list box class.
16

16

00:00:39.220  -->  00:00:40.960
So, our class is going to deal with loading data
17

17

00:00:40.960  -->  00:00:43.450
from the database but while we're at it,
18

18

00:00:43.450  -->  00:00:45.940
we may as well give them scroll bars as well.
19

19

00:00:45.940  -->  00:00:48.750
So, when the new list box objects are created,
20

20

00:00:48.750  -->  00:00:51.150
they won't know that there's a column to the right
21

21

00:00:51.150  -->  00:00:52.690
that can host a scroll bar.
22

22

00:00:52.690  -->  00:00:54.930
So, it's probably better to put the scroll bars
23

23

00:00:54.930  -->  00:00:57.330
in the same column as the list boxes.
24

24

00:00:57.330  -->  00:00:59.660
Now, it may not be obvious that you can do that
25

25

00:00:59.660  -->  00:01:01.050
but as long as the scroll bars
26

26

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:03.250
are set to be sticky to the right,
27

27

00:01:03.250  -->  00:01:04.400
the east, in other words,
28

28

00:01:04.400  -->  00:01:06.170
then the list box will only fill the width
29

29

00:01:06.170  -->  00:01:09.650
of a column up to the scroll bar.
30

30

00:01:09.650  -->  00:01:10.560
So, let's close this down
31

31

00:01:10.560  -->  00:01:13.020
and what I'm going to do is we're gonna add a scroll bar
32

32

00:01:13.020  -->  00:01:15.050
to the artist's list first,
33

33

00:01:15.050  -->  00:01:16.350
then we can copy and paste the code
34

34

00:01:16.350  -->  00:01:18.480
for the other list boxes.
35

35

00:01:18.480  -->  00:01:21.890
So, I'm gonna go back up to the artist's list code
36

36

00:01:21.890  -->  00:01:25.640
below the definition, the config line on line 31.
37

37

00:01:25.640  -->  00:01:27.620
Let's continue on with our scroll bar.
38

38

00:01:27.620  -->  00:01:30.760
So, I'm gonna type artist, scroll
39

39

00:01:30.760  -->  00:01:34.060
is equal to TK inter dot scroll bar,
40

40

00:01:34.060  -->  00:01:36.000
with a capital S,
41

41

00:01:36.000  -->  00:01:38.550
parentheses, main window,
42

42

00:01:38.550  -->  00:01:39.840
comma, space,
43

43

00:01:39.840  -->  00:01:43.970
then orient equals TK inter
44

44

00:01:43.970  -->  00:01:46.590
dot VERTICAL, all in upper case,
45

45

00:01:46.590  -->  00:01:47.840
comma, space,
46

46

00:01:47.840  -->  00:01:49.910
command, equals,
47

47

00:01:49.910  -->  00:01:51.540
that's gonna be artist list
48

48

00:01:51.540  -->  00:01:53.620
dot Y view
49

49

00:01:55.360  -->  00:01:58.560
and then on the next line we want artist scroll,
50

50

00:01:58.560  -->  00:02:02.580
dot grid, row equals one,
51

51

00:02:02.580  -->  00:02:04.180
comma, space, colon
52

52

00:02:04.180  -->  00:02:07.150
equals zero, comma, space, sticky,
53

53

00:02:07.150  -->  00:02:09.400
equals, single quotes, NSE,
54

54

00:02:10.890  -->  00:02:13.890
comma, the row span is equal to two.
55

55

00:02:16.130  -->  00:02:17.750
Then the last line,
56

56

00:02:17.750  -->  00:02:18.750
artist list.
57

57

00:02:19.620  -->  00:02:22.610
There you want left square brackets,
58

58

00:02:22.610  -->  00:02:23.500
two single quotes,
59

59

00:02:23.500  -->  00:02:25.380
then we want within those two single quotes,
60

60

00:02:25.380  -->  00:02:26.960
wide scroll command
61

61

00:02:29.880  -->  00:02:32.480
equals, then it's artist scroll
62

62

00:02:32.480  -->  00:02:34.730
dot set
63

63

00:02:34.730  -->  00:02:36.210
and that should be it.
64

64

00:02:36.210  -->  00:02:38.790
So, let's just run this code.
65

65

00:02:38.790  -->  00:02:40.710
Then check out the code
66

66

00:02:42.140  -->  00:02:43.890
and we can see now very faintly,
67

67

00:02:43.890  -->  00:02:45.360
but it's actually there,
68

68

00:02:45.360  -->  00:02:47.160
a scroll bar neatly tied now
69

69

00:02:47.160  -->  00:02:48.350
to the list box, as you can see,
70

70

00:02:48.350  -->  00:02:51.430
and obviously, once we start populating that with some data,
71

71

00:02:51.430  -->  00:02:53.560
we'll be able to see that a little bit easier.
72

72

00:02:53.560  -->  00:02:55.590
So, at the moment, obviously because of that,
73

73

00:02:55.590  -->  00:02:58.150
the fact that there's no data, it doesn't scroll
74

74

00:02:58.150  -->  00:03:00.440
but you probably less concerned about that
75

75

00:03:00.440  -->  00:03:02.510
than about the fact that I've just suggested
76

76

00:03:02.510  -->  00:03:04.730
copying and pasting code.
77

77

00:03:04.730  -->  00:03:07.530
So, when you're performing basic initialization,
78

78

00:03:07.530  -->  00:03:08.750
then you really just can't get away
79

79

00:03:08.750  -->  00:03:10.410
from copying and pasting,
80

80

00:03:10.410  -->  00:03:12.440
but when you're adding functionality,
81

81

00:03:12.440  -->  00:03:16.260
as we are here, there's always a better way.
82

82

00:03:16.260  -->  00:03:18.430
And here it turns out that there is.
83

83

00:03:18.430  -->  00:03:20.130
But before we look at that,
84

84

00:03:20.130  -->  00:03:21.840
let's review the code that we've got so far.
85

85

00:03:21.840  -->  00:03:24.580
So, I'm just gonna close this down.
86

86

00:03:24.580  -->  00:03:26.510
Most of it is pretty straightforward
87

87

00:03:26.510  -->  00:03:28.450
but there are a couple of things
88

88

00:03:28.450  -->  00:03:30.300
that I haven't discussed before.
89

89

00:03:30.300  -->  00:03:32.280
So, I'm gonna start with the album list box
90

90

00:03:32.280  -->  00:03:34.130
here on line 38
91

91

00:03:34.130  -->  00:03:37.990
and specifically, this TK inter dot variable line.
92

92

00:03:37.990  -->  00:03:42.060
You know, TK inter variables attract variables.
93

93

00:03:42.060  -->  00:03:44.020
What that means is that when they change
94

94

00:03:44.020  -->  00:03:47.710
anything using them is notified of the change.
95

95

00:03:47.710  -->  00:03:51.560
So, what we've done here is create a TK inter variable
96

96

00:03:51.560  -->  00:03:53.920
and again, I'm talking about the code on line 38,
97

97

00:03:53.920  -->  00:03:58.140
called album LV, then we've used the list variable property,
98

98

00:03:58.140  -->  00:04:00.770
this is the code on line 40 now,
99

99

00:04:00.770  -->  00:04:02.080
and that's from the album's list box
100

100

00:04:02.080  -->  00:04:05.100
and that connects the variable to the list box.
101

101

00:04:05.100  -->  00:04:08.590
Now, if the variable changes, the list box is informed
102

102

00:04:08.590  -->  00:04:11.670
and you can display the new contents of the variable.
103

103

00:04:11.670  -->  00:04:12.700
So, to demonstrate that,
104

104

00:04:12.700  -->  00:04:15.310
we're gonna assign a new value to album LV
105

105

00:04:15.310  -->  00:04:16.950
before calling the main loop,
106

106

00:04:16.950  -->  00:04:18.990
so the code down here, in other words.
107

107

00:04:18.990  -->  00:04:20.890
So, let's go ahead and do that.
108

108

00:04:20.890  -->  00:04:23.300
So, we're gonna type album LV
109

109

00:04:24.180  -->  00:04:26.380
dot set and two parentheses,
110

110

00:04:26.380  -->  00:04:28.170
two left parentheses that was,
111

111

00:04:28.170  -->  00:04:30.080
and one, comma, space, two, comma, space,
112

112

00:04:30.080  -->  00:04:32.280
three, comma, space, four, comma, space
113

113

00:04:32.280  -->  00:04:35.360
then five and then two right parentheses.
114

114

00:04:35.360  -->  00:04:38.670
Now, the thing to remember with TK inter variables
115

115

00:04:38.670  -->  00:04:41.280
is that you just can't assign a new value to them,
116

116

00:04:41.280  -->  00:04:43.370
you actually have to use the set method,
117

117

00:04:43.370  -->  00:04:45.460
as I've done here on line 52,
118

118

00:04:45.460  -->  00:04:48.100
so here what I'm dong is assigning a new tuple
119

119

00:04:48.100  -->  00:04:50.660
and because we're passing a tuple to a function
120

120

00:04:50.660  -->  00:04:52.600
we have to enclose the tuple
121

121

00:04:52.600  -->  00:04:54.100
in another set of parentheses.
122

122

00:04:54.100  -->  00:04:56.150
So, that's why there's two parentheses there.
123

123

00:04:56.150  -->  00:04:58.570
So, if you run this code now,
124

124

00:05:03.970  -->  00:05:05.880
you can see that the album's list box
125

125

00:05:05.880  -->  00:05:08.320
is displaying the items from the tuple.
126

126

00:05:08.320  -->  00:05:11.060
So, our album LV variable's bound
127

127

00:05:11.060  -->  00:05:12.560
to the album's list box
128

128

00:05:12.560  -->  00:05:15.220
and if its contents change, then the list box
129

129

00:05:15.220  -->  00:05:17.330
will display those new values automatically,
130

130

00:05:17.330  -->  00:05:20.060
as you can see that it's done here.
131

131

00:05:20.060  -->  00:05:21.620
Now, I know this is a bit artificial
132

132

00:05:21.620  -->  00:05:23.950
and we change the album LV,
133

133

00:05:23.950  -->  00:05:26.300
let's just close this down,
134

134

00:05:26.300  -->  00:05:28.590
we changed the album LV variable
135

135

00:05:28.590  -->  00:05:29.900
before starting the main loop,
136

136

00:05:29.900  -->  00:05:32.180
so in other words, we changed it on line 52
137

137

00:05:32.180  -->  00:05:35.130
and the main loop starts on line 53,
138

138

00:05:35.130  -->  00:05:38.030
but it works the same way when our gooey is running.
139

139

00:05:38.030  -->  00:05:40.410
Now, that's actually gonna be very useful.
140

140

00:05:40.410  -->  00:05:42.490
When we read the albums for a new artist,
141

141

00:05:42.490  -->  00:05:44.720
we just have to store the values in a tuple
142

142

00:05:44.720  -->  00:05:46.800
and assign it to the album's LV.
143

143

00:05:46.800  -->  00:05:50.240
Then the list box will be updated automatically.
144

144

00:05:50.240  -->  00:05:53.040
Now, the second thing is how we connect the scroll bars
145

145

00:05:53.040  -->  00:05:54.790
to the list boxes.
146

146

00:05:54.790  -->  00:05:56.510
When the scroll bar scrolls,
147

147

00:05:56.510  -->  00:06:00.100
it has to notify the list box that it's done so.
148

148

00:06:00.100  -->  00:06:02.860
Now, the list box also has to tell the scroll bar
149

149

00:06:02.860  -->  00:06:04.490
how far it can scroll,
150

150

00:06:04.490  -->  00:06:05.920
remembering that we've just seen a way
151

151

00:06:05.920  -->  00:06:08.980
to update the list box contents dynamically.
152

152

00:06:08.980  -->  00:06:11.660
So the communication, in fact, is two way.
153

153

00:06:11.660  -->  00:06:15.280
Now, the list box has actually got a Y view method
154

154

00:06:15.280  -->  00:06:19.630
that's used to change the vertical position of the list box.
155

155

00:06:19.630  -->  00:06:21.710
So, if you wanted to scroll horizontally,
156

156

00:06:21.710  -->  00:06:25.360
then you would use the X view method instead.
157

157

00:06:25.360  -->  00:06:28.530
So basically, if this code on line 33,
158

158

00:06:29.790  -->  00:06:30.870
we're telling the scroll bar
159

159

00:06:30.870  -->  00:06:33.900
that it should call the artist list's Y view method
160

160

00:06:33.900  -->  00:06:37.750
when it scrolls, which is exactly what we want here.
161

161

00:06:37.750  -->  00:06:39.710
Now, any method that has a Y view property
162

162

00:06:39.710  -->  00:06:41.490
can be scrolled vertically
163

163

00:06:41.490  -->  00:06:43.040
and the same for X view
164

164

00:06:43.040  -->  00:06:46.340
but of course, only horizontally in that case, of course.
165

165

00:06:46.340  -->  00:06:48.050
Now, to communicate the other way,
166

166

00:06:48.050  -->  00:06:50.990
we're using the scroll bar's set method.
167

167

00:06:50.990  -->  00:06:53.110
This is the code here on line 35.
168

168

00:06:53.110  -->  00:06:54.910
So, we're telling the list box
169

169

00:06:54.910  -->  00:06:57.070
to call the scroll bar's set method
170

170

00:06:57.070  -->  00:06:59.190
whenever anything happens
171

171

00:06:59.190  -->  00:07:01.270
that it should tell the scroll view about.
172

172

00:07:01.270  -->  00:07:02.660
So, if we use the arrow keys
173

173

00:07:02.660  -->  00:07:04.610
to move through the list, for example,
174

174

00:07:04.610  -->  00:07:06.460
the list box will set the scroll bar
175

175

00:07:06.460  -->  00:07:09.370
according to how far through the list we are.
176

176

00:07:09.370  -->  00:07:11.460
So, that's all we have to do to implement scrolling
177

177

00:07:11.460  -->  00:07:13.480
on any widget that supports it.
178

178

00:07:13.480  -->  00:07:17.080
We set the scroll bar's command property,
179

179

00:07:17.080  -->  00:07:20.580
line 33 again, set that to the Y view method of the widget,
180

180

00:07:20.580  -->  00:07:22.250
we wanna scroll and then we use
181

181

00:07:22.250  -->  00:07:24.360
the widget's Y scroll command
182

182

00:07:24.360  -->  00:07:26.590
here on line 35, use that property
183

183

00:07:26.590  -->  00:07:30.030
to the set method of the scroll bar.
184

184

00:07:30.030  -->  00:07:31.780
Okay, so despite what I said,
185

185

00:07:31.780  -->  00:07:34.160
I'm actually going to copy and paste the code.
186

186

00:07:34.160  -->  00:07:37.510
And I'm gonna do that just so we can see the common elements
187

187

00:07:37.510  -->  00:07:38.650
and then in the next video,
188

188

00:07:38.650  -->  00:07:41.350
what we're gonna do is subclass the list class box
189

189

00:07:41.350  -->  00:07:44.280
to produce our own scrollable list box.
190

190

00:07:44.280  -->  00:07:45.540
So, what we want to do for now
191

191

00:07:45.540  -->  00:07:47.260
is copy these three lines,
192

192

00:07:47.260  -->  00:07:49.890
this artist scroll definition
193

193

00:07:49.890  -->  00:07:50.940
and then the dot grid
194

194

00:07:50.940  -->  00:07:53.480
and then the setting up of the Y scroll command.
195

195

00:07:53.480  -->  00:07:55.100
So, we'll copy those three lines.
196

196

00:07:55.100  -->  00:07:56.730
Now, we're gonna come down here
197

197

00:07:56.730  -->  00:07:59.660
and do this for the albums.
198

198

00:07:59.660  -->  00:08:01.220
Paste it down there like so.
199

199

00:08:01.220  -->  00:08:02.900
Then, we obviously need to make a change there
200

200

00:08:02.900  -->  00:08:06.380
to change the definitions from artist scroll to album,
201

201

00:08:06.380  -->  00:08:08.660
so I'm gonna do that.
202

202

00:08:08.660  -->  00:08:09.490
Album.
203

203

00:08:20.730  -->  00:08:22.320
And the other thing I need to do is make sure
204

204

00:08:22.320  -->  00:08:26.150
that I actually change the column to one there
205

205

00:08:27.090  -->  00:08:30.400
because obviously album is in column one,
206

206

00:08:30.400  -->  00:08:33.260
as opposed to the artist being in column zero.
207

207

00:08:33.260  -->  00:08:35.970
And everything else should be good to go there.
208

208

00:08:35.970  -->  00:08:38.610
Alright, so one final thing before I finish this video
209

209

00:08:38.610  -->  00:08:41.390
is to test that the scrolling really works.
210

210

00:08:41.390  -->  00:08:43.450
So, let's go ahead and add a load of items
211

211

00:08:43.450  -->  00:08:45.800
to the album's list box.
212

212

00:08:45.800  -->  00:08:46.980
I'm gonna go down here below
213

213

00:08:46.980  -->  00:08:48.730
the main loop comment
214

214

00:08:50.040  -->  00:08:53.320
and we're actually gonna start by typing test,
215

215

00:08:53.320  -->  00:08:55.240
list is equal to range,
216

216

00:08:57.250  -->  00:09:00.740
parentheses, zero, comma, space, 100, parentheses
217

217

00:09:00.740  -->  00:09:02.010
or right parentheses.
218

218

00:09:02.010  -->  00:09:04.680
And then we're gonna do album LV
219

219

00:09:05.670  -->  00:09:10.290
dot, set, parentheses, tuple,
220

220

00:09:10.290  -->  00:09:12.980
parentheses, test, list
221

221

00:09:12.980  -->  00:09:15.510
and the two right ending parentheses.
222

222

00:09:15.510  -->  00:09:17.320
So, what we're doing here is,
223

223

00:09:17.320  -->  00:09:18.400
and actually I'll delete that next line
224

224

00:09:18.400  -->  00:09:19.900
before I continue.
225

225

00:09:20.800  -->  00:09:21.630
There we go.
226

226

00:09:21.630  -->  00:09:23.700
So, what we're doing here is we're creating a list
227

227

00:09:23.700  -->  00:09:25.690
and then converting it to a tuple
228

228

00:09:25.690  -->  00:09:28.400
before assigning that to our album LV variable
229

229

00:09:28.400  -->  00:09:30.230
using its set method,
230

230

00:09:30.230  -->  00:09:32.550
and obviously can see that code on line 57.
231

231

00:09:32.550  -->  00:09:34.630
Now I'm gonna stop the video here
232

232

00:09:34.630  -->  00:09:36.750
and in the next one we're gonna see how to create
233

233

00:09:36.750  -->  00:09:38.270
that scrollable list box class
234

234

00:09:38.270  -->  00:09:39.820
that I mentioned, so that we don't have to keep
235

235

00:09:39.820  -->  00:09:42.150
duplicating this code.
236

236

00:09:42.150  -->  00:09:45.420
Before that though, we need to look at args and KW args.
237

237

00:09:45.420  -->  00:09:47.060
So, we're gonna see what they're all about
238

238

00:09:47.060  -->  00:09:48.600
in the next video.
