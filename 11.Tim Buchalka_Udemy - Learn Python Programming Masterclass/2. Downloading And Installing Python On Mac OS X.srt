00:00:05,340  -->  00:00:07,200
In this video we're gonna go ahead and
2

2

00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:09,720
download and install Python for a Mac.
3

3

00:00:09,720  -->  00:00:11,460
Now if you're running Python on a
4

4

00:00:11,460  -->  00:00:13,590
Windows machine or running Python on a
5

5

00:00:13,590  -->  00:00:15,690
Linux machine, then you want to actually
6

6

00:00:15,690  -->  00:00:17,460
refer to a separate video that I've got
7

7

00:00:17,460  -->  00:00:19,940
in this part of the course for each of
8

8

00:00:19,940  -->  00:00:22,280
those other platforms and the reason for
9

9

00:00:22,280  -->  00:00:23,870
that is that the process is a little bit
10

10

00:00:23,870  -->  00:00:25,260
different depending on which platform
11

11

00:00:25,260  -->  00:00:27,030
you're actually running it on. So in this
12

12

00:00:27,030  -->  00:00:29,010
case, we're going to install a Python
13

13

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:31,710
on a Mac, so first things to do first
14

14

00:00:31,710  -->  00:00:36,120
thing to do is to go to python.org and
15

15

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:37,140
we're going to download the latest
16

16

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:39,240
version, so I'm going to hover over here
17

17

00:00:39,240  -->  00:00:41,400
to downloads noting that because I'm on
18

18

00:00:41,400  -->  00:00:43,380
a Mac, it's come up and showing me the
19

19

00:00:43,380  -->  00:00:45,630
download automatically, so the version we
20

20

00:00:45,630  -->  00:00:47,130
want to select is one here to the left,
21

21

00:00:47,130  -->  00:00:49,200
Python six three point six point
22

22

00:00:49,200  -->  00:00:51,420
two and that's the current version as of
23

23

00:00:51,420  -->  00:00:52,880
the time that I'm recording this video,
24

24

00:00:52,880  -->  00:00:54,990
you might find in the future it'll be a
25

25

00:00:54,990  -->  00:00:56,630
later version, so you just grab the
26

26

00:00:56,630  -->  00:00:58,670
latest one that appears and click on
27

27

00:00:58,670  -->  00:01:02,330
that I'm gonna save that and what I want
28

28

00:01:02,330  -->  00:01:03,540
to do though is just mention here that
29

29

00:01:03,540  -->  00:01:06,060
this Python 2.7, we definitely don't want
30

30

00:01:06,060  -->  00:01:08,130
that and the reason is that this course
31

31

00:01:08,130  -->  00:01:10,620
deals with Python 3 but the other reason
32

32

00:01:10,620  -->  00:01:12,710
is that Python 2 actually already exists
33

33

00:01:12,710  -->  00:01:14,570
on a Mac. So while that's downloading,
34

34

00:01:14,570  -->  00:01:16,140
well it's actually finished now, but I
35

35

00:01:16,140  -->  00:01:19,280
just want to briefly go into terminal so
36

36

00:01:19,280  -->  00:01:20,780
I'll press the command space and typed
37

37

00:01:20,780  -->  00:01:23,750
terminal, I'm gonna type Python so we
38

38

00:01:23,750  -->  00:01:25,170
haven't actually installed Python yet
39

39

00:01:25,170  -->  00:01:27,170
we've only downloaded it. We'll go ahead
40

40

00:01:27,170  -->  00:01:28,950
and type those commands and notice that
41

41

00:01:28,950  -->  00:01:30,920
we actually get something working,
42

42

00:01:30,920  -->  00:01:32,940
it's come up and said Python 2.7
43

43

00:01:32,940  -->  00:01:35,310
so that's installed by default on a Mac.
44

44

00:01:35,310  -->  00:01:36,960
So in case you're wondering how it got
45

45

00:01:36,960  -->  00:01:39,030
there it's when you install or whether
46

46

00:01:39,030  -->  00:01:40,250
your Mac is installed with the new
47

47

00:01:40,250  -->  00:01:41,750
version and whatever operating version
48

48

00:01:41,750  -->  00:01:43,620
of OS X that you're running Python
49

49

00:01:43,620  -->  00:01:46,380
version 2 is installed, but in our case
50

50

00:01:46,380  -->  00:01:48,170
we don't want to use version 2, we want
51

51

00:01:48,170  -->  00:01:50,550
to use version 3, so consequently I'm
52

52

00:01:50,550  -->  00:01:51,890
going to exit out of that prompt by
53

53

00:01:51,890  -->  00:01:56,390
doing a control d and the command we
54

54

00:01:56,390  -->  00:01:58,100
would normally type would be Python 3
55

55

00:01:58,100  -->  00:02:00,090
that would be how we access version 3
56

56

00:02:00,090  -->  00:02:02,210
and higher, but you can see that the
57

57

00:02:02,210  -->  00:02:03,840
moments coming up coming up and saying
58

58

00:02:03,840  -->  00:02:06,300
that python 3 command were not found. So what
59

59

00:02:06,300  -->  00:02:07,700
we now need to do is swing over and
60

60

00:02:07,700  -->  00:02:12,320
install python 3, so i'm going to log out
61

61

00:02:12,320  -->  00:02:16,110
the topping exit close down terminal and
62

62

00:02:16,110  -->  00:02:18,640
come over here to where it was downloaded
63

63

00:02:18,640  -->  00:02:20,350
to open the package that we downloaded
64

64

00:02:20,350  -->  00:02:23,310
python 3.6, we're going to go ahead now
65

65

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:25,240
and install that, so I'm gonna click on
66

66

00:02:25,240  -->  00:02:27,800
continue we're going to continue again
67

67

00:02:27,800  -->  00:02:30,030
and one more time you can read all these
68

68

00:02:30,030  -->  00:02:32,190
things if you want but clicking
69

69

00:02:32,190  -->  00:02:34,030
through fast to get the installation
70

70

00:02:34,030  -->  00:02:36,100
completed, we're going to agree to the
71

71

00:02:36,100  -->  00:02:39,330
software license click on install,
72

72

00:02:39,330  -->  00:02:43,720
I'm going to type my password we'll give it
73

73

00:02:43,720  -->  00:02:48,830
a moment to complete.
74

74

00:02:48,830  -->  00:02:50,800
Okay so I can see the installations now
75

75

00:02:50,800  -->  00:02:51,970
been completed so I can close
76

76

00:02:51,970  -->  00:02:53,630
that down, I'm going to move the
77

77

00:02:53,630  -->  00:02:55,280
installer that we downloaded to the
78

78

00:02:55,280  -->  00:02:57,190
trash because we're finished with it.
79

79

00:02:57,190  -->  00:02:58,130
Now the last thing we need to do in this
80

80

00:02:58,130  -->  00:03:00,160
video now is just check that Python 3 is
81

81

00:03:00,160  -->  00:03:01,850
available so I'm going to hold down
82

82

00:03:01,850  -->  00:03:03,970
command and press space again and type
83

83

00:03:03,970  -->  00:03:05,630
in terminal just going to select what's
84

84

00:03:05,630  -->  00:03:06,680
there because that's remembered it from
85

85

00:03:06,680  -->  00:03:09,910
last time press enter and if recall
86

86

00:03:09,910  -->  00:03:11,720
last time we try this Python 3
87

87

00:03:11,720  -->  00:03:14,160
didn't work, but now if I type Python 3
88

88

00:03:14,160  -->  00:03:16,490
we can see that in fact it's now working.
89

89

00:03:16,490  -->  00:03:18,910
So what's happened is python 3 has been
90

90

00:03:18,910  -->  00:03:22,220
installed and the Mac has been updated
91

91

00:03:22,220  -->  00:03:23,930
with that and we can now start accessing
92

92

00:03:23,930  -->  00:03:25,190
that and we'll be using that server
93

93

00:03:25,190  -->  00:03:27,250
version of Python throughout the course,
94

94

00:03:27,250  -->  00:03:30,410
control d to exit in just a confirmation
95

95

00:03:30,410  -->  00:03:32,600
if we just type Python without the 3 on
96

96

00:03:32,600  -->  00:03:34,640
the end, we still get access to the old
97

97

00:03:34,640  -->  00:03:35,990
part of it so in effect we've got two
98

98

00:03:35,990  -->  00:03:38,000
versions, we haven't affected the version
99

99

00:03:38,000  -->  00:03:40,160
that comes with the Mac by default what
100

100

00:03:40,160  -->  00:03:41,630
we've done is installed an additional
101

101

00:03:41,630  -->  00:03:43,010
version and we'll be using that
102

102

00:03:43,010  -->  00:03:44,510
additional version as we go through this
103

103

00:03:44,510  -->  00:03:46,610
course. Alright, so we'll finish the video
104

104

00:03:46,610  -->  00:03:50,550
here, I'll see you in the next one.
