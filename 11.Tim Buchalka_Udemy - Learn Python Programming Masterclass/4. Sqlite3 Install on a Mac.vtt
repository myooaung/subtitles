00:00:04.660  -->  00:00:06.160
so in this video we're going to see how to
2

2

00:00:06.160  -->  00:00:08.610
run the sqlite command-line shell on
3

3

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:11.320
a mac if you're using Windows refer to
4

4

00:00:11.320  -->  00:00:13.740
the previous video if you're using linux
5

5

00:00:13.740  -->  00:00:15.720
and actually refer to the video after
6

6

00:00:15.720  -->  00:00:17.620
this one where we actually set up for
7

7

00:00:17.620  -->  00:00:19.540
those relevant operating systems but if
8

8

00:00:19.540  -->  00:00:20.530
you're on a Mac you're in the right
9

9

00:00:20.530  -->  00:00:21.390
place
10

10

00:00:21.390  -->  00:00:24.120
let's get started now as it turns out
11

11

00:00:24.120  -->  00:00:26.550
python includes sqlite in its
12

12

00:00:26.550  -->  00:00:28.200
standard library so we don't actually
13

13

00:00:28.200  -->  00:00:30.180
need to install anything to install a
14

14

00:00:30.180  -->  00:00:32.100
sqlite in our python programs
15

15

00:00:32.100  -->  00:00:35.200
but writing database code straightaway
16

16

00:00:35.200  -->  00:00:36.930
isn't the easiest way to learn about
17

17

00:00:36.930  -->  00:00:39.370
sqlite and the sql language if
18

18

00:00:39.370  -->  00:00:40.840
you get errors you have to work out then
19

19

00:00:40.840  -->  00:00:42.930
if the errors in your python code or the
20

20

00:00:42.930  -->  00:00:45.300
sql statements that you've used so
21

21

00:00:45.300  -->  00:00:46.540
what we're going to do is we're going to
22

22

00:00:46.540  -->  00:00:47.730
start out by using the sqlite
23

23

00:00:47.730  -->  00:00:50.070
command line shell so that we can create
24

24

00:00:50.070  -->  00:00:51.820
databases and use sql commands
25

25

00:00:51.820  -->  00:00:53.550
directly without having to worry about
26

26

00:00:53.550  -->  00:00:55.320
the python side of things that for now
27

27

00:00:55.320  -->  00:00:58.230
now on a Mac turns out this is really
28

28

00:00:58.230  -->  00:01:00.090
really easy and that's because the
29

29

00:01:00.090  -->  00:01:02.680
sqlite command line shell is already installed
30

30

00:01:02.680  -->  00:01:04.500
on a mac so there's really nothing else
31

31

00:01:04.500  -->  00:01:06.210
we need to do to be able to get to work
32

32

00:01:06.210  -->  00:01:08.410
to be able to get that up and running so
33

33

00:01:08.410  -->  00:01:10.240
just to confirm that it is working
34

34

00:01:10.240  -->  00:01:12.430
open a terminal session you can do that
35

35

00:01:12.430  -->  00:01:16.300
by holding a command pressing space that
36

36

00:01:16.300  -->  00:01:17.800
will open that screen up there and we can
37

37

00:01:17.800  -->  00:01:21.700
just type in terminal press enter that
38

38

00:01:21.700  -->  00:01:23.710
loads the terminal screen and to test
39

39

00:01:23.710  -->  00:01:25.780
that we've got a sqlite
40

40

00:01:25.780  -->  00:01:27.730
sqlite is installed we type...
41

41

00:01:27.730  -->  00:01:31.600
....and you
42

42

00:01:31.600  -->  00:01:32.740
can see that we've got some
43

43

00:01:32.740  -->  00:01:34.600
text showing on the screen you can
44

44

00:01:34.600  -->  00:01:36.130
see that sqlite3 is actually
45

45

00:01:36.130  -->  00:01:38.560
successfully installed now don't worry
46

46

00:01:38.560  -->  00:01:40.180
if you see slightly different version
47

47

00:01:40.180  -->  00:01:42.400
numbers there this program is updated
48

48

00:01:42.400  -->  00:01:44.620
from time to time but to so long as you
49

49

00:01:44.620  -->  00:01:46.480
you actually can see that it has started
50

50

00:01:46.480  -->  00:01:48.010
the program and it looks like it's
51

51

00:01:48.010  -->  00:01:49.780
working then we're good to go
52

52

00:01:49.780  -->  00:01:51.370
so at this point we can quit out of this
53

53

00:01:51.370  -->  00:01:55.210
by typing....going to type exit
54

54

00:01:55.210  -->  00:01:56.650
to close down the command shell and I
55

55

00:01:56.650  -->  00:01:57.820
going to close down the terminal
56

56

00:01:57.820  -->  00:02:01.390
window and this point we're good to go
57

57

00:02:01.390  -->  00:02:03.760
so skip the next video unless for some
58

58

00:02:03.760  -->  00:02:05.710
reason you also want to install sqlite3
59

59

00:02:05.710  -->  00:02:07.990
on a linux machine and the
60

60

00:02:07.990  -->  00:02:09.790
video after that then actually go ahead
61

61

00:02:09.790  -->  00:02:12.510
and start using sqlite so i'll see
62

62

00:02:12.510  -->  00:02:18.530
you in the next video
