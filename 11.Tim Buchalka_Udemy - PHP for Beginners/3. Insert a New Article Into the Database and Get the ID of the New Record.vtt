00:04.450 --> 00:09.270
Now we know that esky Well we need to insert the data from the farm into the database.

00:09.430 --> 00:14.610
We can use this code here in our new article page.

00:14.770 --> 00:20.590
We've already got code in article that psap here to execute and ask you our statement.

00:20.590 --> 00:22.390
So that start by copying that

00:26.440 --> 00:27.580
and pasting it here

00:30.100 --> 00:38.560
replacing the avad Dump line in our new article script will change the ESC you l from a select to an

00:38.560 --> 00:42.820
insert into the article table.

00:42.820 --> 00:48.850
We want the value in the idae column to be assigned after magically So we'll add to the list of columns

00:49.780 --> 00:52.390
and emett the I.D. column.

00:54.530 --> 00:57.660
Next we'll add the list of values.

00:58.040 --> 01:06.350
And for now let's just concatenate the values in the post array directly into the Eskew L string making

01:06.350 --> 01:11.880
sure we surround each value in single quotes and that we separate them with commas.

01:12.230 --> 01:18.860
And at the end we have a closing bracket before we continue let's check the ESC u l string that we're

01:18.860 --> 01:24.240
creating here by dumping it out and exiting the script.

01:27.480 --> 01:33.270
Then in the browser if we add some values to the farm and submit it.

01:33.600 --> 01:37.610
This is the esky Well statement that we're going to execute.

01:40.430 --> 01:45.500
That looks good so we can continue with our code.

01:46.370 --> 01:53.840
We can delete this line now and next will execute the ESC u l using the my ESC You will I query function

01:53.840 --> 01:56.230
here and that's before.

01:56.240 --> 02:03.290
If the results are false we'll print out the error next though we're not selecting data so we don't

02:03.290 --> 02:05.550
want to use this function.

02:08.360 --> 02:15.110
Instead let's skip the I.D. of the new word inserted rijkaard this I.D. will be assigned automatically

02:15.260 --> 02:16.910
by the database server.

02:19.320 --> 02:25.920
We can get this using the my esky Well I insert idae function which returns the automatically generated

02:25.950 --> 02:36.330
idae used in the insert query so that call this function passing in the database connection variable.

02:36.330 --> 02:41.640
For now lets just print out this value like that.

02:41.640 --> 02:48.060
One more thing we need to do is include the code that connects to the database which is this required

02:48.070 --> 02:49.910
line here.

02:49.950 --> 02:50.940
So will copy that

02:53.880 --> 02:55.990
and in our new article script.

02:56.190 --> 02:56.790
It here

02:59.670 --> 03:02.770
before we create our Eskew L statement.

03:05.020 --> 03:06.700
Let's give that a try.

03:06.700 --> 03:14.330
If we add some values into the form inputs and then submit the farm we get the message.

03:14.350 --> 03:18.980
Telling us the idea of the rijkaard that's been inserted.

03:22.110 --> 03:28.260
If we look at the database Here's the new rijkaard and it's eidy corresponds to the value we got from

03:28.320 --> 03:32.380
my esky Well I insert idees function.

03:34.430 --> 03:41.370
So now we can see this record on our index page and on the individual article page like that.

03:44.640 --> 03:50.490
When we inserted this rijkaard we made sure that all the fields had valid data in for example the date

03:50.490 --> 03:57.850
time value here needs to be specified like this year dash month dash day and so on.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.970
At the moment we get an error.

04:00.030 --> 04:06.450
If we didn't specify this value with this farmer at all if we admitted it all together for now we'll

04:06.450 --> 04:12.170
make sure we enter valid data into the farm and will look at how to validate this data shortly.
