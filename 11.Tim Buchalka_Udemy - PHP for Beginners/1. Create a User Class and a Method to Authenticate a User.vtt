Previously we added a luggin page and used this to restrict access to the new article page.

00:17.990 --> 00:24.170
In the logon script to log in the user were checking the username and password that they tapped into

00:24.170 --> 00:33.620
the far on Match hard coded values having hard coded values like this in a script isn't a good idea.

00:33.650 --> 00:37.190
As if we want to change them we need to change the code.

00:37.340 --> 00:40.090
Plus only one user can log in.

00:40.550 --> 00:47.330
Let's change this so that we check the username and password against user data in the database.

00:49.980 --> 00:54.800
First let's create a new class kalid User Doug P. H.

00:54.820 --> 01:02.430
P. where we can store all user related code in here.

01:02.430 --> 01:12.300
Will define a new class called a user and then let's add a method to our thing to cater user which will

01:12.310 --> 01:20.690
define as static as we don't have an instance of a user object in our luggin page.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.860
The user is supplying a username and password.

01:25.320 --> 01:30.570
So that's what we need to supply as arguments to the authenticate method.

01:31.910 --> 01:38.420
For now let's just copy what we're doing in the luggin script checking that the values of the user name

01:38.450 --> 01:47.450
and password arguments match some hard coded values so inside the method if the arguments match these

01:47.450 --> 01:51.410
values we return TRUE and FALSE.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.940
If they don't we'll replace these values later on.

01:56.630 --> 02:06.200
Let's not forget to add a p p duck comment block to the method and also to the class.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.730
Then in our luggin script.

02:10.190 --> 02:18.920
First let's require the class at the top and then replace this line with a call to the New our centre

02:19.010 --> 02:25.620
cake method in the User class passing in the values from the farm.

02:29.530 --> 02:36.000
And in the browser the logging still works as before.
