00:05.550 --> 00:11.580
Now that we can navigate through pages by passing the page number in the query string let's add some

00:11.580 --> 00:14.740
pagination links to the index page.

00:17.030 --> 00:25.490
First let's add a couple of properties to the paginate a class one for the previous page and one for

00:25.490 --> 00:26.390
the next.

00:28.380 --> 00:36.240
Then in the constructor after we filtered the page value let's assign values to these properties.

00:36.810 --> 00:46.690
The previous page is the current page minus one and the next page is the current page plus one.

00:47.490 --> 00:56.460
Then in the index page after the list of articles we'll add some pagination links as these will be navigation

00:56.460 --> 01:06.060
links will put them inside a nav element and inside that an own ardour list element we can add of the

01:06.060 --> 01:08.490
previous link like this.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.810
An anchor element inside a list item element passing in the value of the previous property of the paginate

01:16.810 --> 01:27.700
an object the same for the link to the next page we pass in the value of the next property of the paginate

01:27.720 --> 01:37.920
object in the query string as before we can omit indexed up HP from the link as it's the default file

01:38.130 --> 01:40.100
served from the server.

01:43.760 --> 01:50.020
Let's give that a try starting at the first page with no value in the query string.

01:50.450 --> 01:57.860
Here are the navigation links and if I click on Next it takes us to page 2 as we can see here in the

01:57.860 --> 01:59.630
query string.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.300
Another click on Next text was to page 3.

02:03.440 --> 02:11.380
If I click on previous We go back to page 2 and again back to PAGE 1.

02:11.450 --> 02:17.930
There is a slight problem however in that on the first page here the previous link is still available

02:18.230 --> 02:24.450
and it takes us to page 0 which the filter converts to page 1.

02:27.870 --> 02:35.420
We can also click next until we get to the last page here where the next link is still available.

02:35.520 --> 02:41.590
If I click it it takes us past the end of the Ricardos and doesn't show any think.

02:43.620 --> 02:45.820
To fix this in the paginate.

02:46.110 --> 02:53.510
Let's only set the value of the previous property if the current page is greater than 1.

02:53.730 --> 02:56.580
This way the previous property will be null.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.860
Its default value if we're on the first page.

03:01.860 --> 03:07.180
Then when we display the link on the index page we can check for this.

03:10.230 --> 03:19.070
And if it's null will just display the word previous without it being a link.

03:22.240 --> 03:30.670
So now when were on page 2 and we click the previous link it takes us to page 1 and the previous link

03:31.070 --> 03:32.920
is no longer there.
