00:05.410 --> 00:13.330
To show when articles categories on the individual article page we added a method that returns the data

00:13.360 --> 00:17.840
in an array instead of as an article object.

00:17.860 --> 00:24.290
We did this so that we could get the data from both tables in a single query to the database.

00:26.990 --> 00:33.950
However if we want to edit an article in the admin section and also have the categories in this form

00:34.070 --> 00:35.700
which will add shotley.

00:37.650 --> 00:43.710
We need an article object so that we can call the update method on it.

00:46.600 --> 00:53.710
So for the admin edit articles script instead of using this method we just created to get the article

00:53.710 --> 00:56.360
and its categories at the same time.

00:56.440 --> 01:01.950
Let's add a method to the article class to get an articles categories instead.

01:05.400 --> 01:13.530
Let's call it get categories and it won't be a static method as we'll call it on an article object.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.940
Let's add the Eskew L..

01:17.350 --> 01:24.580
Well we'll select all the category table columns joining the article category table using the category

01:24.580 --> 01:31.000
idae and using your where clase to restrict the results to this article only.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.270
We don't need to join to the article table.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.720
We only want category data.

01:36.850 --> 01:40.980
The idea of the article we want is present in the join table.

01:43.410 --> 01:53.100
Then as always with a prepared statement we'll prepare it bind the idees place holder to the I.D. property

01:53.100 --> 02:00.240
of the current object execute it and return an associative array of values.

02:02.410 --> 02:03.790
Let's add a p h.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.660
P duck comment.

02:07.690 --> 02:10.680
And then in the edit article script.

02:10.990 --> 02:20.850
Let's test this by Karl and get on the article object and dumping out the return value.

02:24.760 --> 02:31.730
Now if we edit an article that has categories the new function returns those in an array.

02:35.760 --> 02:40.900
So now we have two ways to get an article with its categories.

02:41.040 --> 02:50.520
The method we added previously which does it all in one query but doesn't return an object and the method

02:50.520 --> 02:54.610
we just added which requires two trips to the database.

02:56.020 --> 03:01.820
Generally speaking it's slightly faster to make a few trips to the database as possible.

03:02.080 --> 03:08.380
But sometimes if your code is clearer and easier to use by having multiple queries like now when we

03:08.380 --> 03:13.180
need an article object then there's no problem with doing this.
