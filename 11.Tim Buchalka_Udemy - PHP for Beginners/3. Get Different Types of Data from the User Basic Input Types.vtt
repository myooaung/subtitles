00:04.480 --> 00:13.510
A farm is made up of controls previously in this section we see in a basic text input and a password

00:13.510 --> 00:14.860
control.

00:17.500 --> 00:24.670
These controls are created using the input element an input element with no type specified is a simple

00:24.700 --> 00:32.980
text box but we can optionally specify a value for the type attribute to change what type of input control

00:32.980 --> 00:33.830
is shown.

00:37.080 --> 00:42.360
There are several different types of input control available.

00:42.870 --> 00:52.410
If you don't specify a Type A tahil are specify a type of text you get a single line text input field.

00:52.410 --> 00:59.800
We've also seen the password input field which you create by specifying the type as password.

01:00.420 --> 01:07.940
This looks the same as a regular text input but it input is masked so you can't see what you've typed.

01:07.950 --> 01:13.680
This is to stop someone else who could be looking at your screen seeing what password you typed

01:17.400 --> 01:19.690
as you can see from the documentation.

01:19.710 --> 01:28.860
Several of these for example the email input look exactly the same as a text input the email type is

01:28.860 --> 01:34.720
used when the data in the farm is validated which will look at later.

01:34.740 --> 01:41.280
Other types add to the input to make entering a different type of data easier.

01:41.400 --> 01:51.070
For example the number type adds some spinner controls so the user can easily enter a numeric value.

01:53.700 --> 01:59.930
In addition on a mobile device certain input types will change the onscreen keyboard.

02:00.750 --> 02:05.690
For example a basic text input type will show the default keyboard.

02:06.230 --> 02:15.060
But an email type will additionally show the at sign tell type for telephone numbers will show the numeric

02:15.060 --> 02:17.250
keypad and so on.

02:17.250 --> 02:20.360
All the differences are shown in detail here.

02:23.870 --> 02:34.720
Of all these text type inputs the text password and hidden types are universally supported.

02:34.730 --> 02:37.820
This means they work in all web browsers.

02:37.910 --> 02:46.940
The others like date time were introduced with version 5 of h.t. email each to email L5 which became

02:46.940 --> 02:49.110
a standard in 2011.

02:49.730 --> 02:56.360
Nowadays some of these newer types have a widespread browser support while some aren't supported in

02:56.420 --> 02:59.210
all browsers.

02:59.210 --> 03:05.130
There's information about browser compatibility in the documentation here.

03:12.770 --> 03:18.440
There are also sites like paint him and fight please.

03:19.490 --> 03:22.840
And can I use dot com.

03:25.320 --> 03:30.720
Which tell you the current level of browser support for a particular input type.

03:30.810 --> 03:36.810
We'll see later on how we can use javascript to fix browsers that don't support an input type that we

03:36.810 --> 03:38.180
want to use.

03:40.590 --> 03:47.820
If an input type isn't supported in a browser then the browser simply shows a regular text input.

03:51.100 --> 03:57.940
I've added an example of most of the basic input types to this farm so each one appears on a different

03:57.940 --> 03:58.970
line.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.010
I've put each one inside a diff element but we saw it earlier.

04:11.270 --> 04:13.700
In a browser they are look like this.

04:13.700 --> 04:19.030
And I encourage you to play around with the different input types to see how they work.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.250
This will look different depending on which browser you use.

04:23.390 --> 04:28.260
Depending on its level of support for the different input types for example.

04:28.370 --> 04:35.840
This is in one browser but if we look at the same in a different one we can see that the date and time

04:35.870 --> 04:39.010
types are supported here.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.760
Which they weren't in the other one and they work like this.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.610
Whereas here in the other browser they aren't supported at the at the moment.

04:51.620 --> 04:55.810
After all they just appear as a regular text controls.

04:55.810 --> 04:58.220
This is changing though as browsers develop.

04:58.300 --> 05:03.360
So it's worth checking the websites I mentioned earlier to check the current level of browser support.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.210
If you want to use a particular input type.
