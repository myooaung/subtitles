Now that we know how to compare one value to another we can learn another control structure.

00:13.120 --> 00:19.840
We already saw how far each loop can be used to leap around an array running the same code multiple

00:19.840 --> 00:24.240
times for each element of the array.

00:24.380 --> 00:33.040
There's a simpler form of loop in P HP called A Wild loop while loop can be used to any code not just

00:33.040 --> 00:41.960
to loop around and array a while loop simply runs code continuously while a condition is true.

00:42.340 --> 00:48.250
This means that at some point inside the loop you need to change the condition to false.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.980
Otherwise the loop would run forever.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.300
Let's look at an example.

00:55.470 --> 01:01.440
We'll start with a variable that contains an integer representing the month of the year.

01:01.470 --> 01:10.490
Then I'll add a while loop with a condition that says a month is less than equal to 12.

01:11.610 --> 01:20.730
Then in the while loops code block let's print out the value of the month followed by a comma as we

01:20.730 --> 01:21.730
saw earlier.

01:21.780 --> 01:28.460
Even though this variable contains an integer and when we try and can catinat it to a string.

01:28.470 --> 01:34.830
Using the dot operator its value will be converted automatically to a string.

01:35.520 --> 01:41.490
Finally will add one to the month variable like that.

01:41.490 --> 01:49.800
If we missed this bit out the while condition would always be true and we'd have an infinite loop.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.680
So let's see what happens when we run this code.

01:54.690 --> 01:59.530
We get all the month's printed out from 1 to 12.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.520
Let's go through what happened.

02:04.660 --> 02:10.020
We start by assigning the value of one to the month variable.

02:10.750 --> 02:17.440
Then the while loop starts by checking the value of the condition one is less than our equal to 12.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.470
So the condition is true.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.750
The while loops code book is executed.

02:22.750 --> 02:27.920
Printing out the value of the month then incrementing its value.

02:28.630 --> 02:33.550
Then the loop goes back to the top again checking the value of the condition.

02:33.820 --> 02:39.030
The condition is still true so the code block is executed again.

02:39.490 --> 02:46.060
This continues printing out the value and then incrementing it by one for each iteration of the loop

02:46.600 --> 02:50.160
until it's incremented to 13.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.980
When this happens the condition is false.

02:53.170 --> 03:00.240
So the while loop stops and the script continues with whatever code comes after the while loop if any.
