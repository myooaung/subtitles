00:05.820 --> 00:13.080
Now we have pagination on the main index page let's add it to the admin index too.

00:14.460 --> 00:21.510
First let's copy these two lines from the index page where we are creating a paginate to and getting

00:21.510 --> 00:23.930
the records from the database.

00:24.300 --> 00:30.560
Then in the abdomen index we can replace this line where we're getting all the records

00:33.540 --> 00:35.640
instead of four records per page.

00:35.650 --> 00:41.000
They'll just to demonstrate how it still works by just changing this argument.

00:41.190 --> 00:44.340
Let's have six per page instead.

00:46.870 --> 00:52.380
Then let's just copy the pagination links from the index page.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.520
And paste them at the bottom of the abdomen index

01:01.870 --> 01:03.710
for the previous link.

01:03.710 --> 01:12.120
We need to change the hsf from the roots index to the abdomen index and the same for the next link.

01:15.930 --> 01:16.900
In the browser.

01:16.920 --> 01:26.940
Now our admin index has pagination with fewer pages as we have more records per page.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.330
We've repeated ourselves again with the pagination links.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.650
So let's extract this out into an include file.

01:35.190 --> 01:41.550
We'll create a new file in the includes folder in the root kalid pagination Doug P. HP

01:44.940 --> 01:49.670
and we'll paste the pagination links in here.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.500
We can't have a hard coded link in here though.

01:53.730 --> 01:59.540
What we need to do is get the current address of whatever page including this file in.

02:02.830 --> 02:06.310
We can get the path of the current page using the request.

02:06.310 --> 02:11.110
You are right elements of the server super global.

02:12.700 --> 02:20.080
So let's add a variable that contains this and then replace the path in the previous link with this

02:20.080 --> 02:25.710
variable and also the next link.

02:27.390 --> 02:31.950
Next we need to replace the pagination links in the admin index.

02:31.950 --> 02:40.350
With this new include using two dots to go down to the includes folder in the root.

02:43.580 --> 02:50.810
On the first page of the admin index the next link works going to the next page including the admen

02:50.810 --> 02:52.040
folder.

02:52.820 --> 03:00.830
However if I click next again the page value in the query string has been repeated and if I click it

03:00.830 --> 03:04.670
again it's repeated again.

03:08.190 --> 03:13.180
This is because the request you value includes the query string.

03:13.440 --> 03:20.520
So when we create the previous r next link were pending this to a value that already contains the query

03:20.520 --> 03:28.210
string which is why it's repeated so we want this value without the query string.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.450
We can use this string tokenizer function for that.

03:33.540 --> 03:38.800
This function splits the string into smaller ones based on a delimiter.

03:39.030 --> 03:44.980
So if for example we pass in the request you are in value and a question mark as the delimiter.

03:45.030 --> 03:50.340
This function will return everything before the first question mark.

03:50.430 --> 03:56.610
The other parts can be obtained by subsequent calls of this function but we only need to call it once

03:56.940 --> 03:59.930
as we only need the first part.

04:00.240 --> 04:06.280
If the delimiter the question mark isn't found then it simply returns the entire string.

04:08.960 --> 04:13.250
So let's call this function passing in the request.

04:13.250 --> 04:21.150
You are a value and the question mark as the delimiter as the query string in a U R L is everything.

04:21.170 --> 04:24.070
After the first question mark character.

04:27.500 --> 04:33.370
So now when I click Next it works and subsequent clicks on the navigation links.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.330
I'll work as expected.

04:40.450 --> 04:43.300
Now in the main index page in The Root.

04:43.570 --> 04:46.570
We can replace these pagination links with the new.

04:46.570 --> 04:48.610
Include.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.900
And these work as before.
