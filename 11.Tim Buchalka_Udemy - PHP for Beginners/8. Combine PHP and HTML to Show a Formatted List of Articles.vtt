00:05.240 --> 00:12.260
At the start of this section we wrote code to display a nicely formatted list of articles based on this

00:12.260 --> 00:23.810
array using a mixture of p s p and h t AML the date in P P was hard coded in this array but now we know

00:23.810 --> 00:27.780
how to get an array of data from the database using this code.

00:27.800 --> 00:31.030
We just wrote We can use this code.

00:31.040 --> 00:38.280
Instead of having this hard coded array so we'll start by deleting this array.

00:40.930 --> 00:44.490
Then copying in the p-h P code we just written.

00:48.930 --> 00:51.280
And pasting it in its place.

00:57.590 --> 01:04.520
As mentioned before it's always a good idea to have your application code as separate from your presentation

01:04.520 --> 01:06.660
code as you can.

01:07.160 --> 01:14.240
So although we could mix this all together with the to AML It's cleaner to have it all up here before

01:14.240 --> 01:18.290
the next email begins before we test this.

01:18.320 --> 01:27.560
First we remove this var dump line as we no longer need it and that's it.

01:27.590 --> 01:34.490
The cold here that's looping around the array already uses the column names we defined in the database

01:35.510 --> 01:43.640
so when we view this in the browser we get the list of articles coming from the database.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.130
So we can make a change here in the database.

01:50.130 --> 01:53.560
For example let's add a new record.

01:59.170 --> 01:59.860
Like that

02:02.650 --> 02:06.770
and then won't we go back to our site in the browser.

02:07.690 --> 02:11.200
The page has been updated with the new record.

02:11.410 --> 02:18.340
So now we have a dynamic page that we can update without editing the code at all as the content is coming

02:18.490 --> 02:19.800
from the database.

02:22.930 --> 02:31.480
Let's make one more change for each loop here is inside a u l will not add a list element and loops

02:31.540 --> 02:33.050
around the array.

02:33.040 --> 02:38.200
Outputting a list item element for each array item.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.390
However if there is no data.

02:40.570 --> 02:42.720
In other words the array is empty.

02:42.850 --> 02:45.370
No list items will be printed.

02:45.580 --> 02:55.300
In that case we dont want an empty u l element either so let's add a check for an empty array here and

02:55.360 --> 02:58.810
if it is empty will output a message.

03:00.560 --> 03:05.480
Otherwise will print out the articles as before.

03:05.480 --> 03:11.540
And let's not forget to end the statement down here.

03:13.680 --> 03:20.180
If we look at that in the browser nothing has changed as we have some data.

03:22.610 --> 03:23.750
To test this.

03:23.750 --> 03:27.490
We could use p p madmen to delete all our data.

03:27.650 --> 03:29.480
But there is an easier way.

03:29.810 --> 03:38.960
We can just add a where clause to our esky well that results in an empty resultset like this.

03:38.960 --> 03:43.710
There are no records with an idea of zero as they start from 1.

03:44.150 --> 03:50.910
So now in the browser we get the message saying no articles found.

03:51.470 --> 03:57.140
This is equivalent to when you've just started using a content management system for example and you

03:57.140 --> 04:00.120
haven't created any articles yet.

04:01.280 --> 04:08.960
And now we've successfully tested it we'll remove this temporarily where clause like that and in the

04:08.960 --> 04:16.210
browser now a page is back to printing out the list of articles coming from the database.
