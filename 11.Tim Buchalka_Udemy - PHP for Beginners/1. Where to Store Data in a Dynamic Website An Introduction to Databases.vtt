Using what we've learned so far.

00:07.520 --> 00:18.650
We can create an array in HP that contains several items each one of those being an array itself containing

00:18.740 --> 00:27.750
two items a title and some content using strings as indexes like this.

00:29.800 --> 00:41.590
We can then end the p-h P and start an h e mail document give it a header and title then body section

00:43.210 --> 00:49.240
with a header and main section inside the main section.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.300
We can create the list and use p h.

00:53.300 --> 01:03.680
P to loop around the array of article data and display the details of each article like that.

01:06.670 --> 01:12.770
When we view this in a browser we get a list of articles just like you Max see on a blog.

01:16.210 --> 01:23.680
So without editing the h.t. EMAIL code down here we can add a new article to the erate up here

01:26.440 --> 01:30.290
and then in the browser we get updated.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.990
It's chamoun So we have a dynamic content on our website.

01:38.100 --> 01:45.470
However we've still got this data hard coded in this script so to update this page in the browser we'd

01:45.470 --> 01:47.700
need to edit this file.

01:50.810 --> 01:58.070
This is far from ideal as only one person could do it at once and whoever is editing the code would

01:58.070 --> 01:59.330
need to know.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.140
P.

02:02.310 --> 02:09.840
The better solution is to have the data stored separately from the script that's displaying it then

02:09.840 --> 02:16.670
the script can retrieve that data from storage process it and display it.

02:17.250 --> 02:24.120
If we want to update the website all we need to do is update the data and the website will be updated

02:24.300 --> 02:26.530
after Mattingly.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.000
So where do we store this data.

02:30.420 --> 02:33.310
We could store it in a text file for example.

02:33.390 --> 02:36.610
Then the script could read this file.

02:36.610 --> 02:42.190
However accessing files from scripts can be slow and we can have problems.

02:42.270 --> 02:50.460
If someone is trying to edit the file at the same time as the script is trying to read it much better

02:50.580 --> 02:52.980
to use a database.

02:53.280 --> 03:01.140
A database is a structured set of data Argan ised so that it can be easily accessed and updated.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.470
We administer databases using a database management system.

03:05.580 --> 03:12.330
These are designed to allow fast concurrent access to data in addition to giving us features like easy

03:12.330 --> 03:15.050
maintenance security and so on.

03:15.660 --> 03:21.550
So in this section will learn about how to create a database how to access it using P H.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.500
P and will change the script.

03:25.500 --> 03:31.910
We just wrote to get data from the database instead of being hard coded in the script.
