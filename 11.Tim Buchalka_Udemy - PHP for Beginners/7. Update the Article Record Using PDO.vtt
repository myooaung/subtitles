00:04.490 --> 00:12.800
We've changed the index and individual article pages to use pto and our new article class next.

00:12.800 --> 00:18.590
Let's change the edit article page first.

00:18.770 --> 00:25.300
We need to use the article class to get the article record being edited instead of this function.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.350
Just like in the article script.

00:29.390 --> 00:38.000
So first let's change the database require to load the Database class instead and will also additionally

00:38.000 --> 00:41.920
require the article class.

00:42.200 --> 00:48.010
Then we get the database connection and call the method.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.060
Then if the article is found we need to access its properties as an object instead of as an array.

00:59.100 --> 01:05.710
However instead of assigning the objects properties to variables like this let's just use them directly.

01:05.820 --> 01:14.820
These variables are used in the form to display values in the farm controls so we can get rid of these

01:14.820 --> 01:16.830
for variable assignments.

01:18.730 --> 01:29.670
And then in the farm replace these variables with the equivalent properties of the article object.

01:33.920 --> 01:40.970
Let's just check that that works and it does displaying the values in the farm directly from the article

01:41.020 --> 01:42.890
object's properties.

01:45.480 --> 01:55.740
We can remove this empty block now by negating the article variable and removing the ELSE next if the

01:55.740 --> 01:57.240
farm is submitted.

01:57.300 --> 02:01.760
We're getting the values from the farm into these variables.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.370
We just got rid of these variables above though.

02:04.470 --> 02:13.470
So instead that's assigned the values coming from the farm to the article object's properties.

02:13.470 --> 02:22.430
Then when we validate the article we'll pass these values in to the validate article function like that.

02:26.080 --> 02:32.460
If the values are valid we then update the rijkaard in the database.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.810
Let's add a method to our article class to do this.

02:35.830 --> 02:45.280
Instead we'll add a new method called Update which is a public method and it's not static because it

02:45.340 --> 02:49.000
acts on an instance of the class.

02:49.150 --> 02:59.380
Let's add the esky well including all the named parameters will prepare the statement for which we need

02:59.380 --> 03:05.360
the database connection so that's passed that as an argument to the method.

03:05.620 --> 03:13.810
Next we need to bind values to the place holders in the ESC you out we'll bind the values of the object's

03:13.810 --> 03:20.950
properties which we can access using the special this variable and were binding the idea as an integer

03:21.340 --> 03:24.490
and the title and content as strings.

03:24.970 --> 03:31.450
When you have several parameters in the esky Well this is where named parameters and paedos way of binding

03:31.450 --> 03:36.110
values to them with a separate method call for each one is clearer.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.360
Then my ESC U L.

03:37.360 --> 03:44.160
I's method the published at field can be empty so we need to insert null.

03:44.290 --> 03:55.210
If it is so let's add an if statement and if it is empty will bind NULL which has its own data type

03:55.210 --> 04:03.520
constants and if not will bind the value of the property.

04:03.520 --> 04:10.870
Then we execute the statement and as the execute method returns true are false depending on whether

04:10.870 --> 04:16.430
it worked or not will return its value directly.

04:16.450 --> 04:23.280
Finally we need to add a p p duck comment like that.

04:25.410 --> 04:30.310
Then in the edit article page we can replace this code.

04:36.990 --> 04:44.640
With a call to the new method we just added and we can get rid of this Else block too

04:48.750 --> 04:56.800
in the redirect we need to replace the idees variable with the article object property like that.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.710
Let's give that a try.

05:01.740 --> 05:05.990
If I edit this article and change the content.

05:10.070 --> 05:17.420
I can click save the changes are saved and we redirected back to the article page.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.000
If I enter an invalid value

05:24.090 --> 05:31.360
and submit the form the values we typed in I read displayed so the farm still works too.

05:31.640 --> 05:36.560
But now using the article object instead of individual variables.
