00:05.590 --> 00:14.070
If an error occurs in our code we're either showing the full details of the error or just a simple message.

00:14.110 --> 00:17.350
This information takes up the entire page.

00:17.410 --> 00:21.470
In other words the entire response sent back to the browser.

00:21.490 --> 00:25.900
If an area occurs consists of these echo statements.

00:28.530 --> 00:31.570
But what if it's an AJAX request.

00:31.860 --> 00:39.870
The publish button in the abdomen index sends an AJAX request to the server to publish an article and

00:39.870 --> 00:47.460
the H2 mail returned in the response is inserted directly into the astm Al on the page replacing the

00:47.460 --> 00:48.500
button.

00:51.450 --> 00:59.340
The Ajax request is sent to the publish articles script which is what updates the article and returns

00:59.340 --> 01:00.880
the response.

01:01.500 --> 01:07.680
Let's introduce an area in here by getting the name of the published method wrong.

01:12.740 --> 01:20.540
Now if I click the publish button we get the error details inserted into the astm Al.

01:25.560 --> 01:32.910
The Ajax Karl simply insert whatever the responses into the table cell where the button is.

01:32.910 --> 01:39.570
Instead of doing this we need the Ajax kalid to detect if an error has occurred on the server and handle

01:39.570 --> 01:40.730
it accordingly.

01:44.400 --> 01:51.360
When a web server returns a response to a browser it includes a status code for example.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.310
Two hundred is returned.

01:53.370 --> 01:56.540
If all is okay.

01:57.250 --> 02:03.870
3 or 4 is used for a file that has not been changed since it was last requested and I'm sure you're

02:03.870 --> 02:10.780
familiar with the 4 old 4 status code which means the requested file wasn't found.

02:13.230 --> 02:20.580
Five hundred is used for a generic error on the server by default.

02:20.590 --> 02:24.930
P HP always sends back a two hundred status code.

02:24.930 --> 02:29.900
However we can change this using the H T T P response code function.

02:34.420 --> 02:41.580
In the exception handler when an error occurs Let's send back the generic 500 server error status code.

02:45.010 --> 02:50.410
Then in the Ajax call we can detect the status code.

02:50.410 --> 02:56.620
If all is well and a 200 status code is returned the done handler is fired.

02:59.660 --> 03:06.110
If a request fails then we can add a fail handler that will run instead.

03:08.420 --> 03:11.250
So let's add that to the Ajax call.

03:12.690 --> 03:17.480
And in here will just display a message saying an error occurred.

03:22.400 --> 03:28.220
In the browser I've got the network monitor open so that we can see the requests.

03:28.220 --> 03:34.910
If I click on the Admin Link there we can see each request and the corresponding status code.

03:35.060 --> 03:38.170
Two hundred for the main page and so on.

03:39.710 --> 03:43.090
We still have the error in the published article script.

03:43.310 --> 03:49.900
So if I click the publish button now we get the error message in an alert box.

03:52.110 --> 03:57.280
And here's the Ajax request with hey 500 error code.

03:57.900 --> 04:04.430
If we look at this request and view the response we can see the full details of the error.

04:05.790 --> 04:11.280
So by returning the correct status code we can handle errors in Ajax too.

04:14.360 --> 04:20.910
And let's not forget to correct the error we introduced earlier into the publish article script.
