00:05.200 --> 00:11.590
Were deleting an article by clicking on the link from the article page which opens the delete artecoll

00:11.590 --> 00:12.590
script.

00:14.980 --> 00:21.370
In this script we're running the esky role that deletes the rijkaard from the database.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.570
However we learnt earlier that if we're changing data on the server.

00:27.710 --> 00:34.760
In other words inserting updating or deleting a record in the database we should be using the post farm

00:34.760 --> 00:37.230
method when we click on a link.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.920
Users get.

00:42.260 --> 00:47.490
This is the link in the article script to the Delete article script.

00:47.570 --> 00:50.460
However we can't make a hyperlink like this.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.710
Use the post method they always use get.

00:53.810 --> 01:02.480
We have to submit a farm so let's change this to use a farm instead of a link using the post method

01:03.350 --> 01:10.730
and specifying the action as a delete script in the delete script.

01:10.730 --> 01:16.260
Let's also make sure that this code isn't kalid Unless the post method is used.

01:16.700 --> 01:25.130
So before we call the esky Well we'll check the post request method is being used and let's not forget

01:25.130 --> 01:30.260
to close this code block at the end like that.

01:33.600 --> 01:40.860
Now if we view an article we see a button instead of a link and if we click it it submits the form and

01:40.860 --> 01:42.740
the record is deleted.

01:46.700 --> 01:49.130
Just to make sure we can't delete an article.

01:49.130 --> 01:51.000
If we're not using the post.

01:51.230 --> 01:56.460
If we view an article and change the U R L to the Delete script

01:59.840 --> 02:03.620
by passing in the same eidy when I press enter.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.380
Nothing happens.

02:05.570 --> 02:10.610
We can go back and the rijkaard hasn't been deleted.

02:10.820 --> 02:15.340
We can only delete it if we use the post method by submitting the farm.
