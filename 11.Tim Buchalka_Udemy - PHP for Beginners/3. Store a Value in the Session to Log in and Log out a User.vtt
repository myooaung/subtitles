00:05.240 --> 00:08.220
Soulfire in our cma s and our index page.

00:08.220 --> 00:16.100
We can give you a list of all the articles we can also add a new article and view and edit and delete

00:16.310 --> 00:18.950
existing ones.

00:18.960 --> 00:25.050
However we don't want just any user to be able to do all this as they could at the moment.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.150
We want our index page to be public.

00:28.340 --> 00:32.990
But access to all these other pages should be restricted.

00:32.990 --> 00:36.710
We'll do that by requiring a user to log in first.

00:40.850 --> 00:46.630
First let's create a script that will log the user in Cali luggin appear to be

00:49.370 --> 00:49.970
in here.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.390
Will start resume the session by calling session start.

00:55.400 --> 01:02.120
Then to set whether a user is logged in or not will set a variable in the session array that for now

01:02.150 --> 01:08.910
is just a simple billion that says whether the user is logged in are not.

01:08.960 --> 01:15.590
Lets also add a script that lug the user out and call it like out up here.

01:15.620 --> 01:18.460
Be in here.

01:18.470 --> 01:27.710
Were going to do exactly the same as the luggin script books will set the log in variable to false like

01:27.710 --> 01:29.930
that.

01:31.740 --> 01:37.380
Then in our index page in the body of the astm l..

01:37.650 --> 01:40.560
Lets just print out the contents of the session array.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.670
For now like that.

01:46.580 --> 01:53.800
In the browser we get an error saying that the session is an undefined variable.

01:53.810 --> 01:57.860
This is because we haven't called a session starts in this script.

01:58.370 --> 02:08.300
So if we call it up here like that when we go back to the browser the error has gone and we get an empty

02:08.300 --> 02:09.420
array.

02:11.870 --> 02:16.300
If we open the logon script.

02:19.010 --> 02:26.330
We don't see anything as there's no output on that page but when we go back and refresh the page there's

02:26.330 --> 02:29.050
now a value in the session.

02:29.630 --> 02:34.570
If we open the lock out script.

02:37.790 --> 02:41.310
And then go back.

02:41.330 --> 02:46.700
The value is still there but now it's set to false.

02:49.280 --> 02:54.990
Let's add links to the log in and log out pages here in the index page first.

02:55.010 --> 03:01.370
If a session variable is true then the user is logged in.

03:02.330 --> 03:08.980
If they're logged in then we can add a link to the log out page like that.

03:10.040 --> 03:20.280
If they're not logged in then we'll add a message and a link to the log in page like that.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.010
Let's give that a try.

03:26.030 --> 03:29.300
But note that first I've restarted the browser.

03:29.780 --> 03:34.850
This deletes the current session which will then go about later on.

03:35.030 --> 03:40.490
The first thing that happens when we open the script is we get an undefined index error.

03:43.400 --> 03:50.390
This is because the array exists but this element doesn't exist yet as we haven't called log in.

03:50.420 --> 03:51.740
I'll look out.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.700
So let's add a check here for that.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.010
Like that.

04:00.190 --> 04:07.210
Now we get a message saying were not logged in and the session array is empty but we can click on the

04:07.210 --> 04:09.130
logon link.

04:11.170 --> 04:18.450
And when we go back after being logged in we get the message saying so and we see the value of true

04:19.170 --> 04:21.270
in the session variable.

04:21.270 --> 04:28.500
If I click on the log out link were logged out and when I go back and refresh the page the session variable

04:28.530 --> 04:33.220
is false and it says were not logged in again were locked out.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.390
Now we can see what's happening.

04:38.390 --> 04:42.500
We can remove this vat dump line like that.

04:45.170 --> 04:52.070
So we're basing whether a user is logged in are not on a value in the session which is remembered between

04:52.070 --> 04:53.450
page requests.
