00:04.460 --> 00:12.860
In the index and article pages we're getting a list of all the articles and getting an individual article

00:13.310 --> 00:20.180
using this get article function here as we're writing code related to an article.

00:20.210 --> 00:24.870
It would make more sense to make this cold part of an article class.

00:25.160 --> 00:31.150
So let's create a new class in the classes folder called Article P. H.

00:31.150 --> 00:38.480
P in here will add the P E P opening tag and the class name.

00:40.310 --> 00:47.410
In our index page we're using this called to get all the articles from the database.

00:47.570 --> 00:49.090
So let's copy this.

00:49.280 --> 00:53.640
And in our new class let's create a method to do this.

00:54.140 --> 00:58.300
Let's add a new method called get RL.

00:58.460 --> 01:07.190
And as this method won't be acting upon an individual article object this needs to be a static method.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.680
Then let's paste the code we just copied from the index page.

01:13.920 --> 01:20.410
Instead of assigning these results to a variable we'll return them from the method like that.

01:22.800 --> 01:31.080
For this to work we need a connection to the database so let's pass this into the method as an argument.

01:32.160 --> 01:42.490
And finally let's add a p-h Peacock comment block for the method and also for the class.

01:42.600 --> 01:54.120
Then in our index page let's require this new class file and then we can replace this code with a call

01:54.150 --> 01:59.270
to the new method passing in the database connection object.

02:01.830 --> 02:07.480
And when we open the index page in the browser we see the list of articles as before.

02:10.920 --> 02:18.390
In the individual article script we're calling the get article function which is here in the includes

02:18.480 --> 02:20.250
article file.

02:20.460 --> 02:23.870
This function gets an article based on an idea.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.700
Let's add a method to our new article class that does this.

02:29.790 --> 02:34.180
Let's start by copying this entire function.

02:35.820 --> 02:44.520
Including the comment block and pasting it in the article class.

02:44.520 --> 02:53.880
Let's add the visibility of public and this is again a static method as it's not being called on an

02:53.910 --> 02:56.920
instance of this class.

02:56.980 --> 03:03.600
Let's also change the name of the method to get by eidy like that.

03:05.940 --> 03:08.560
In our individual article script.

03:08.820 --> 03:16.350
We're going to use the method in the new article class now so we can replace this line with a require

03:16.410 --> 03:19.810
of the new class instead.

03:20.250 --> 03:27.330
Then we can change this function call to call the new class method instead.

03:30.730 --> 03:36.730
Then in the browser if we view an individual article this works as before.
