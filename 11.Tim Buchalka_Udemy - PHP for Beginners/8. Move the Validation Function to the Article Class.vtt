When we're editing an article first we validate the values from the farm using the validate article

00:10.580 --> 00:13.670
function which is defined in the article.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.360
Include scripts in the includes folder.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.360
Now we have an article class though.

00:19.490 --> 00:22.430
It makes more sense for this to be in there.

00:22.610 --> 00:25.050
So let's take this out of here.

00:31.570 --> 00:36.890
And paste it at the bottom of our article class.

00:40.790 --> 00:46.760
When we call this function in the edit article script we passing the values you want to validate and

00:46.760 --> 00:49.010
we get a list of errors back.

00:49.490 --> 00:54.230
However we were assigning the values from the farm.

00:54.290 --> 00:59.670
In other words the values we want to validate to the object's properties.

00:59.720 --> 01:07.110
So instead of passing in these values to the function we can access them directly in the method.

01:08.660 --> 01:14.090
While we're here let's also rename the method like that.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.840
Let's take this.

01:15.860 --> 01:24.120
There is variable out of here and make it a property of the class.

01:27.650 --> 01:31.170
Placing it at the top after the other properties.

01:33.890 --> 01:40.500
Then back in the method instead of accessing variables we need to access properties.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.160
So everywhere we're accessing title

01:45.740 --> 01:58.040
content and published that we need to out of the current object variable this before it.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.770
The same with the errors variable.

02:00.800 --> 02:07.650
Now this is a property we need to do the same for each time we access it.

02:12.300 --> 02:16.730
Now that the array of areas is a property we can access it as such.

02:16.770 --> 02:20.090
So we no longer need to return it from this method.

02:20.250 --> 02:26.490
Instead let's return a billion value that denotes whether the properties are valid or not which we can

02:26.490 --> 02:30.160
do based on whether this array is empty or not.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.870
Like that.

02:35.130 --> 02:38.960
And let's not forget to change the comment to.

02:42.070 --> 02:51.270
Now we're currently calling this method from the edit articles script before we call the update method.

02:51.340 --> 02:53.440
Now we're in the same class though.

02:53.710 --> 02:57.880
We can just call this method directly from the update method.

02:57.880 --> 03:07.510
So as we know into call this method from outside the class will make it protected like that.

03:07.510 --> 03:16.300
Then inside the class in the Update method before we start the update cold we'll call the validated

03:16.300 --> 03:17.560
method.

03:18.190 --> 03:25.170
And if it returns true we can update as before if it returns FALSE.

03:28.090 --> 03:33.880
Then we just returned false from the update method.

03:35.660 --> 03:41.930
Then in our edit article script we can remove these two lines where we call the validation function

03:42.230 --> 03:45.680
and check the areas array.

03:46.460 --> 03:52.850
As you can see this also makes our Carlyn cold simpler and easier to read.

03:52.850 --> 04:01.160
We can also remove this require statements as were no longer using the functions in it.

04:01.700 --> 04:07.850
There's one more thing we need to do and that's in the article form when we're displaying errors.

04:07.850 --> 04:13.710
Now we need to access the areas property of the article object instead.

04:14.750 --> 04:18.510
In the if statement and in the follow up.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.990
Let's give that a try.

04:24.180 --> 04:34.300
If I edit this article and first enter some in data and submit the form the validation still works and

04:34.300 --> 04:36.570
the errors are displayed.

04:36.720 --> 04:46.100
If I correct these errors and submit the form validation passes and we can save the changes that's before.
