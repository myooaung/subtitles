In addition to storing data in a database one of the other things we can do with HP on the server is

00:11.770 --> 00:13.260
send emails.

00:13.690 --> 00:18.020
Let's add a contact page to our site to do just that.

00:20.720 --> 00:25.530
We'll create a new file in the route called contact DOC P. HP.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.950
Let's add the common header footer and a title.

00:39.770 --> 00:52.070
Then we need a farm and labels and inputs for an e-mail address a message subject and the content of

00:52.070 --> 00:53.540
the message.

00:54.080 --> 01:02.510
And finally the button to submit the farm now that we're using bootstrap let's also add the classes

01:02.690 --> 01:04.360
to style this farm.

01:09.790 --> 01:14.190
When we open this page in the browser we get an error.

01:15.630 --> 01:21.660
This is because the header include is using the arth class to display the navigation links.

01:21.660 --> 01:24.920
Depending on whether a user is logged in or not.

01:25.530 --> 01:30.350
We can fix this by requiring the initialization script at the top.

01:32.590 --> 01:35.220
And this includes the artle loader.

01:36.500 --> 01:43.250
While we're here in the header include Let's add a link to the new page in the navigation section.

01:48.760 --> 01:55.270
In the browser there's the new link in the navigation header and the error is no longer displayed when

01:55.270 --> 01:57.410
we view the new contact page.

01:58.630 --> 02:04.440
We do need the text area element were using for the message to be a bit larger though.

02:07.460 --> 02:13.890
We could do this by adding a value for the roles attribute to the text area element in the farm.

02:14.330 --> 02:19.710
But let's keep the hasty email as simple as we can and do it in C S S instead.

02:22.380 --> 02:28.590
This will set the height of the elements with the idea of message to 10 e Ms.

02:28.680 --> 02:32.840
E M is a unit relative to the current font size 1.

02:32.900 --> 02:39.180
I am being the current font size to be m being twice the size and so on.

02:43.290 --> 02:48.320
Now in the browser the text area for the message body is much larger.
