00:05.720 --> 00:10.580
P HP has a male function that will send an email.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.850
This might look simple to use.

00:12.890 --> 00:19.660
You just call the function and pass in the recipient's email address the subject and the message.

00:20.930 --> 00:28.070
However using this function requires the mail server settings to be configured in the P HP configuration

00:28.070 --> 00:31.340
file which you might not have access to.

00:31.790 --> 00:39.890
Plus formatting the message and headers so the message is sent properly can be quite complex.

00:42.350 --> 00:49.660
There's a simple alternative to using this function and that's to use a third party mail package.

00:49.660 --> 00:50.770
Like P H.

00:50.780 --> 00:51.560
P mailer.

00:51.830 --> 01:00.850
And this is what most p HP developers do pay HP Maila is basically a series of class files that you

01:00.850 --> 01:02.930
save with your code.

01:03.010 --> 01:09.240
Require those files and then you can create objects of those classes.

01:09.240 --> 01:17.350
P P Mailer provides an object to easily send an email using an S M T P server.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.880
Let's look at an example.

01:22.030 --> 01:26.290
We'll start with an empty P H P script in the root.

01:28.690 --> 01:36.880
To add P HP P mailer to this code will start by downloading it and extracting the downloaded zip file

01:37.120 --> 01:40.030
to a folder with our code.

01:42.100 --> 01:49.390
It's common practice to save third party packages in a folder called vendor which is where I've extracted

01:49.390 --> 01:51.660
the contents of the zip file too.

01:55.410 --> 01:57.560
To use the downloaded classes.

01:57.660 --> 02:01.020
First we need to include this code.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.200
Which I'll paste in the index.

02:05.210 --> 02:09.210
Doug P HP file the P HP mailer.

02:09.210 --> 02:16.950
Classes are inside names spaces which are basically like folders and sub folders for classes.

02:16.950 --> 02:20.810
These two use statements allow us to use the p h.

02:20.810 --> 02:25.400
P mail classes without prefixing them with their name spaces.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.520
Next we need to change.

02:29.530 --> 02:37.960
These require lines to the folder where we've saved the P H P Mailer package and this is the vendor

02:37.960 --> 02:40.620
folder we just created.

02:40.630 --> 02:43.760
Now we're ready to use P HP mailer.

02:44.470 --> 02:50.330
First we'll create an object of the P HP Maler class.

02:50.350 --> 02:57.230
Then we call methods and set properties of the object to tell it to use our mail server.

02:59.440 --> 03:04.010
This line tells P 8 p mailer to use S M T P.

03:04.360 --> 03:09.670
Then we have the host which is the address of your mail server for example.

03:09.670 --> 03:18.490
S M T P R G mail that come then we tell P P mailer that the server requires authentication and we set

03:18.490 --> 03:27.520
the username and the password reset the type of authentication and the port you can get these settings

03:27.610 --> 03:30.710
from your mail server service provider.

03:33.310 --> 03:44.160
Once we've configured the mail server we can add a sender a recipient a subject and a message.

03:45.830 --> 03:49.130
To send the message we call the send method.

03:50.590 --> 03:52.940
And just so we know it's worked.

03:52.990 --> 03:54.830
Let's print out a message.

03:57.050 --> 04:01.130
If a problem occurs then we want to know what it was.

04:01.130 --> 04:04.450
We can use exception handling for this.

04:04.550 --> 04:08.300
First we need to pass true to the constructor.

04:08.300 --> 04:14.980
When we create the P eight p Mailer object this then labels are exceptions.

04:16.170 --> 04:19.690
Then we can wrap this code in a tri block.

04:21.580 --> 04:29.810
And add a corresponding catch block where we can print out the details of the error.

04:34.950 --> 04:36.600
Let's give that a try.

04:36.870 --> 04:39.380
If I open the P 8 p script.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.870
We get a message saying the message has been sent.

04:49.210 --> 04:55.590
And in the recipient's inbox there's the message sent from HP.

04:59.170 --> 05:07.640
P HP Maila has excellent documentation and several cold examples on how to use its various features.

05:10.810 --> 05:15.640
One page to note is the one on S M T P E debugging.

05:15.640 --> 05:24.250
By setting the S N T P debug property of the P It p Mailer object you can get varying amounts of debugging

05:24.250 --> 05:30.070
data from the mail server which can be extremely helpful if you have any connection.

05:30.070 --> 05:31.530
Are sending problems.
