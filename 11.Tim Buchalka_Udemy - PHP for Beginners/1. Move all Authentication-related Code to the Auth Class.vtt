00:05.480 --> 00:11.430
Previously we restricted access to the new article page to logged in users ballylee.

00:12.110 --> 00:20.240
If we try and access to the page without being loved then we get this message.

00:20.420 --> 00:27.740
We also want to restrict access to the edit and delete pages too as we don't want someone who isn't

00:27.740 --> 00:31.690
logged in to be able to edit I'll delete an article.

00:35.120 --> 00:42.700
Before we restrict access to other pages Let's add a method to the arfe class that makes it easier.

00:42.770 --> 00:48.950
We don't want to be repeating this code in every page we want to restrict access to.

00:49.910 --> 00:58.820
So let's add a new static method called require logging in and in here if the use it isn't logged in

01:00.000 --> 01:05.300
will stop the script with the unauthorized message.

01:05.300 --> 01:10.550
And let's add a p-h P duck comment to this function too.

01:11.900 --> 01:20.490
Then in the new article script instead of this code we can call this new method like that.

01:23.070 --> 01:30.340
And if we try and access that page when we're not logged in.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.130
It restricts access as before.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.940
So now any page that we want to restrict access to.

01:41.160 --> 01:47.160
We can just add a Karl to this method at the top before we do that.

01:47.160 --> 01:53.490
Now we've got some cold in the log in and log out scripts that should really be in the authentication

01:53.490 --> 01:55.170
class.

01:55.350 --> 02:01.360
More specifically this code where we're dealing with this session to lug the user in.

02:01.590 --> 02:04.680
So let's copy these two lines.

02:05.670 --> 02:15.360
And then in the art class we'll create another new method called luggin in here will paste the code

02:15.360 --> 02:25.230
that we just copied from the log in script into the body of this method and add a comment block then

02:25.320 --> 02:34.650
we can replace these two lines in the log in script with a call to the new method having all the cold

02:34.650 --> 02:40.230
related to the session in here means that if we ever change the name of the elements we're storing in

02:40.230 --> 02:44.810
the session from is logged into something else for example.

02:44.970 --> 02:48.420
Then we only have to change it in this class.

02:51.780 --> 02:55.180
Let's do the same for the log out script.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.410
Will copy this code.

03:02.750 --> 03:13.700
And then in the art class create a new method called log out and paste the code in there will add a

03:13.700 --> 03:15.980
comment block.

03:17.580 --> 03:25.320
And then in the logout script we can replace this code with a call to the new method.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.760
Let's give that a try.

03:30.760 --> 03:31.660
We can log in

03:34.450 --> 03:42.280
and access the new article page and then log out successfully.

03:45.650 --> 03:52.430
Now we just need to add one line of code to any page to require a user to be logged in before they can

03:52.490 --> 03:53.630
access it.
