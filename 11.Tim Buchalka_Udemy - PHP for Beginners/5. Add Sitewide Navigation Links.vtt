00:05.510 --> 00:12.300
On the main index page here different links are shown depending on whether a user is logged in or not.

00:12.890 --> 00:14.520
If I log in.

00:17.130 --> 00:19.210
The link changes to log out.

00:19.260 --> 00:22.780
And we have a link to the new article page.

00:23.070 --> 00:24.960
If we go to the admin index

00:27.630 --> 00:31.210
these links are repeated.

00:32.910 --> 00:41.430
Let's move these links to a navigation section that's shown on every page before these links.

00:41.430 --> 00:47.480
We're including this header file which read including on every page.

00:50.040 --> 00:54.840
As we learnt earlier navigation links go inside a nav element.

00:54.840 --> 01:04.710
So let's add one of those after the header and then a u l element to contain the list of links.

01:04.710 --> 01:10.090
If the user is logged in we want the log out to link.

01:10.830 --> 01:16.330
Otherwise we want the log in link.

01:17.310 --> 01:21.960
Now in the main index page we can remove this block of code

01:25.590 --> 01:29.790
and we can do the same on the admin index page.

01:30.150 --> 01:38.090
However we want to keep this link to the new article page so we'll delete the rest of the block.

01:41.690 --> 01:44.030
But keep that link.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.070
Let's move it below the subheading.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.480
However like that.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.750
Let's give that a try were not logged in.

01:57.010 --> 01:59.140
So the log in link is shown.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.930
If we log in the log out think is shown.

02:04.930 --> 02:06.910
If we go to the admin index

02:09.640 --> 02:11.580
the same log out link is shown.

02:11.830 --> 02:18.410
But if I click it we get a formal four page not found error.

02:19.210 --> 02:20.480
Looking at the address bar.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.490
The link has gone to Adam in slash log out at P. H.

02:24.490 --> 02:26.520
P. which is incorrect.

02:26.620 --> 02:29.860
The log out script is in the root of the site.

02:32.970 --> 02:40.710
In an anchor tag if we specified the path of the file of a link like this then the link would be relative

02:40.770 --> 02:42.850
to this page.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.300
This page is included inside the admin folder.

02:46.500 --> 02:55.950
Then the link will point to Adam n slash logout up HP to make this link relative to the roots of the

02:55.950 --> 02:56.780
site.

02:57.030 --> 03:01.400
We need to start it with a slash like that.

03:01.470 --> 03:07.710
Now this will point to the logout script in the root folder of the site regardless of where we include

03:07.800 --> 03:09.230
this script.

03:09.870 --> 03:14.830
Likewise we need to prefix the luggin link with a slash too.

03:17.780 --> 03:24.260
Now in the admin index if we click on logout the link correctly takes us to the lock out script in the

03:24.260 --> 03:28.100
root of the site and we're locked out.

03:30.510 --> 03:35.290
At the moment to access the Admin Index we're typing in the U R L.

03:35.610 --> 03:40.460
Now that we have a navigation section let's add a link to the admin area.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.480
We want the link to appear.

03:42.480 --> 03:48.830
If the user is logged in so will add the link here before the log out link.

03:49.060 --> 03:54.690
We all started with a slash So it's always going to be relative to the root of the site and we don't

03:54.690 --> 03:59.950
need to include indexed up p as this is the default page.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.240
So on the main index page.

04:04.250 --> 04:08.150
If were not logged in that link isn't shown.

04:08.150 --> 04:18.590
If we do log in there's the link to the admin section which takes us to the admin index.

04:18.590 --> 04:26.720
We don't have a link to take us back to the root index though so let's add one at the top of the nav

04:26.750 --> 04:32.630
block so that it's shown whether the user is logged in are not.

04:32.630 --> 04:37.730
Again we don't need to specify index that p s p as this is the default.

04:37.730 --> 04:39.840
We can just put a slash.

04:42.770 --> 04:49.940
So now we have common navigation links that allow us to move around the site and the common on each

04:49.940 --> 04:50.930
page.

04:50.930 --> 04:57.830
For example here on the individual article page 2 and they also change depending on whether we are logged

04:57.860 --> 05:00.000
in are not.
