00:05.190 --> 00:09.220
Now that we know how to mark up some content using email.

00:09.360 --> 00:18.650
Let's see how we can use P P and e-mail together to create dynamic content as we just learned.

00:18.690 --> 00:19.020
H t.

00:19.050 --> 00:23.350
Email is a language used to tell a browser how to display a document.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.670
It is not a programming language.

00:27.010 --> 00:33.960
HDMI is sent from the server and is interpreted by the Web browser which is sometimes referred to as

00:33.960 --> 00:35.220
a client.

00:37.220 --> 00:46.630
P HP is a programming language and can be used to create manipulate and output data P2P code runs on

00:46.630 --> 00:53.400
the web server and the results of running a p-h prescript are sent to the browser.

00:53.590 --> 01:01.210
The browser doesn't know that it's HP code that has sent it some data it just receives whatever text

01:01.260 --> 01:08.860
P HP has outputted this text could of course contain sdm al but it's important to remember that no p

01:09.010 --> 01:11.420
p code goes to the browser.

01:12.890 --> 01:14.800
H to them all on its own is fine.

01:14.840 --> 01:19.530
If all you have is some static content that you want to display in a web browser.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.850
However if you want a dynamic website.

01:21.950 --> 01:28.460
For example a blog with new and updated articles are an e-commerce site with dynamic product data and

01:28.460 --> 01:32.630
so on that has content that changes after magically.

01:32.720 --> 01:39.880
Then you need to use a mixture of X to AML and pay HP for example.

01:39.950 --> 01:48.230
As we saw earlier the airco statement in P HP is used to write out text to the browser so you could

01:48.230 --> 01:53.810
use p p like this to write some astm Out to the browser.

01:53.810 --> 02:00.590
Remember that the PSP code here will run on the server and will send the output from this code to the

02:00.590 --> 02:01.830
browser.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.660
If we look at this script in the browser we see some extra yamal.

02:09.170 --> 02:17.850
If we view the source we see what the various echo statements in the P HP have written out.

02:18.650 --> 02:23.720
It's all on one line because we didn't explicitly insert any line breaks.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.610
The browser doesn't care about this.

02:25.610 --> 02:28.640
It renders the 8 p.m. hour the same way regardless.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.510
We'll see more on this later on.

02:33.960 --> 02:41.660
Note that the pate's piece script is called indexed at p s p a script file needs to have the dot P.

02:41.670 --> 02:41.890
H.

02:41.890 --> 02:47.610
P extension so that the server knows to pass it far p s p code.

02:47.610 --> 02:51.800
Also note that as we saw earlier a file called indexed.

02:51.890 --> 02:54.650
Tier mail is served after Mattingly.

02:54.690 --> 03:02.920
If no file is specified in the address the same is true for files called indexed up p HP.

03:03.360 --> 03:10.980
If we remove the file name then we still get the contents of index dumpy HP.

03:13.460 --> 03:18.900
Now although you can do this writing out here email using strings like this.

03:19.100 --> 03:24.270
It's rather inefficient to do so and can be very difficult to maintain.

03:24.290 --> 03:26.580
Plus it looks messy.

03:26.840 --> 03:33.260
It's much easier to keep it to email and p p separate wherever you can.

03:33.260 --> 03:39.050
So far with P HP we've been working with scripts that just contain p HP code.

03:39.410 --> 03:45.580
We start our p p scripts with the p p opening tack here.

03:45.890 --> 03:52.300
If you have a file that just has P S P in it then you only need the opening tag like this.

03:54.980 --> 04:03.860
There's also a closing tag in Pilates P2 which we use when we're mixing P 8 p and htl mouth together.

04:05.620 --> 04:10.870
For example let's start with this page of s t am owl fun now.

04:10.870 --> 04:12.800
This is just eight term owl.

04:12.940 --> 04:16.810
But note that the file name is indexed up p HP.

04:17.350 --> 04:20.080
We need the dot p p file name suffix.

04:20.170 --> 04:25.740
So the web server now was to run this p HP code before it sends it to the browser.

04:26.380 --> 04:39.010
Let's insert some p-h P code here wrapping the p p code in the p p opening and closing tax.

04:39.160 --> 04:46.590
If we look at this in the browser we get the result of what came from P H P.

04:46.810 --> 04:54.130
If we view the source there's the simple text that came from the HP eco statement.

04:57.160 --> 05:05.140
Before the web server sends this file to the browser it executes this cold and replaces it with the

05:05.140 --> 05:09.410
results including the opening and closing tax.

05:10.180 --> 05:19.220
So in this case the browser just gets the string Dave instead of all this let's look at another example.

05:19.450 --> 05:24.760
Let's add some p HP at the top that are signs of value to a variable.

05:25.990 --> 05:29.790
Note that this code doesn't output anything here.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.500
In other words there's no echo statement.

05:33.070 --> 05:34.600
Then lower down in the cold.

05:34.690 --> 05:36.970
Let's print out the value of that variable

05:39.730 --> 05:45.390
like that in the browser we get the result.

05:45.490 --> 05:54.880
And again the p h p code has gone including the part at the top that didn't output anything.

05:57.610 --> 06:02.410
One more thing I want to mention is the P HP shot open tag.

06:02.950 --> 06:06.610
You might see this mentioned are used in other people's code.

06:06.940 --> 06:10.510
Basically it's a shorter version of the opening tag.

06:10.780 --> 06:18.220
Its usage is discouraged though as it has to be explicitly enabled and doesn't really offer any advantages.

06:18.220 --> 06:24.670
Apart from slightly more concise p s p code so I don't recommend you use it.

06:26.710 --> 06:29.710
There is however a sharp tag that you can use.

06:29.890 --> 06:36.490
If all you're doing inside some p-h Peter because he's using airco then you can safely change it to

06:36.490 --> 06:39.790
use the schadt Ã©cole tag.

06:40.270 --> 06:44.720
This will print out whatever you put between the tax.

06:48.350 --> 06:51.590
And in the browser nothing has changed.

06:57.050 --> 07:03.080
So if you prefer you can safely use this schadt ECHO tag to eke out a value.
