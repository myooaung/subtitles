00:04.400 --> 00:14.030
Currently we've got two files indexed up p HP and Article doppie HP both accessing the database by first

00:14.030 --> 00:18.410
connecting to it using this code at the top.

00:18.410 --> 00:23.750
You might have noticed that we've duplicated this code in both files.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.400
This is a bad idea.

00:25.520 --> 00:32.870
Having repeated cold like this what if we change the database password for example we'd have to make

00:32.870 --> 00:39.560
sure we changed it in both of these files and if we continue to repeat this code we'd have to change

00:39.560 --> 00:41.330
it all over our website.

00:41.420 --> 00:50.680
Potentially in many more files in addition to being time consuming if we forgot one we'd break our website.

00:53.420 --> 01:00.820
The solution to this is to extract this repeated cold out into a separate file and then include this

01:00.820 --> 01:04.360
separate file in any script that needs it.

01:07.950 --> 01:10.990
To include one file in another MP HP.

01:11.040 --> 01:15.440
There are actually four functions available when our cold calls.

01:15.450 --> 01:22.470
They include statement we pass in the path and file name of the file we want to include and that file

01:22.470 --> 01:26.700
is evaluated and included in our script.

01:26.700 --> 01:33.780
This means that any code inside the included file is executed immediately just as though the code it

01:33.780 --> 01:39.610
contains was inserted directly at that point in the first script.

01:41.840 --> 01:48.920
Require is the same as include except that if the file to be included is not found the script stops

01:50.030 --> 01:52.790
with include if the file doesn't exist.

01:52.850 --> 01:56.150
A warning will be shown but the script will keep going

01:58.790 --> 02:06.470
require once and include Once the same but these will check to see if the file has already been included

02:06.470 --> 02:07.180
before.

02:07.400 --> 02:14.600
So it won't do it again depending on what the included file contains including a file more than once

02:14.870 --> 02:23.990
could cast an error using require once and include once are slightly slower as HP needs to keep track

02:24.080 --> 02:27.920
of how many times a file has been included.

02:27.920 --> 02:33.440
I've never really found a need for these two as if you need to include a file more than once.

02:33.470 --> 02:39.950
Then it would probably be more advantageous to argue nasia code better using functions are classes which

02:39.950 --> 02:41.960
will learn about later on.

02:45.170 --> 02:50.390
So let's remove this repeated cold at the top of these two files.

02:50.900 --> 02:57.790
First let's create a file containing this cold and Carl it databased up here.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.740
P.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.920
Remember it still has to have the p h.

03:02.910 --> 03:04.790
P ext as it's p h.

03:04.790 --> 03:10.590
P code will cut this code from both files.

03:17.730 --> 03:21.540
And paste it in the new one.

03:21.660 --> 03:26.800
Don't forget to include the p p opening tag at the top.

03:26.940 --> 03:30.830
Now we can include this file in the other two.

03:30.840 --> 03:38.170
Let's start with include passing in the name of the new file we just created.

03:40.850 --> 03:45.340
In the browser our index page still works as before.

03:48.310 --> 03:54.070
Let's see what happens when we try and include a file that doesn't exist by making a mistake in the

03:54.070 --> 03:56.900
final that M..

03:59.650 --> 04:05.740
Now in the browser we get lots of error messages but the script has continued after the include line

04:06.040 --> 04:08.430
even though the include failed.

04:10.970 --> 04:13.210
Let's change this to require.

04:13.670 --> 04:17.770
But still with the wrong file name.

04:18.020 --> 04:25.760
And now in the browser we get what's called a fatal error which stops the script the Require has failed

04:25.790 --> 04:30.040
because it couldn't find the file and the script stops executing.

04:30.410 --> 04:36.140
That's the difference between include and require if the file to be included isn't found include.

04:36.140 --> 04:39.150
We'll keep going but require will stop.

04:41.690 --> 04:45.980
For this reason I almost always prefer to use require.

04:45.980 --> 04:52.070
I can't think of an instance when it would be o k for my code to continue if the file I was trying to

04:52.070 --> 04:54.100
include wasn't found.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.940
So let's leave it with the choir.

04:56.060 --> 05:06.140
But correct the error and also put this in the article doppie it p script like that.

05:08.980 --> 05:11.510
Now our index page is working again.

05:11.680 --> 05:21.580
And also the article page but we've removed the repeated database code and were including it from this

05:21.580 --> 05:23.250
separate file.

05:26.150 --> 05:30.750
You might have noticed that this isn't the only repeated code that we've got.

05:30.980 --> 05:37.180
Were also repeating ourselves at the top and at the bottom of the x t AML.

05:37.280 --> 05:44.710
So let's create a new file for the top of our hvm out and call it header copy it p

05:48.020 --> 05:56.840
in here will put the repeated h t l code then another file for the bottom of the X Team L which we'll

05:56.840 --> 05:59.040
call footer appear.

05:59.060 --> 06:02.510
P.

06:02.570 --> 06:06.980
And in here we'll put the repeated h.t. email code from the bottom.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.090
Now even though these just contain S T L.

06:12.110 --> 06:16.870
For now we might want to add some common p h Pico to them later.

06:17.020 --> 06:21.100
So it's best to keep the P HP file extension.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.300
Now in our indexed up p h.

06:26.310 --> 06:29.220
P we can replace this code.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.580
By including the header.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.590
P P file instead.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.950
Not forgetting the p h.

06:37.950 --> 06:41.650
P tags in here because we're inside it's team out.

06:42.240 --> 06:50.350
The same with this code from the footer like that and will do the same for this cold.

06:50.640 --> 06:57.180
In the article file first the header s email here.

06:59.780 --> 07:06.820
And again at the bottom for the footer to email like that.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.100
And in the browser nothing has changed.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.640
It all works as before.

07:18.300 --> 07:24.630
Now however we're not repeating ourselves and we have the added advantage of our code being a little

07:24.630 --> 07:27.710
bit clearer and easier to understand.
