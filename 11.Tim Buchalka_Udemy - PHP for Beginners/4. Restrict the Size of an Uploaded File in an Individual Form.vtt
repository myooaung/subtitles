If we upload a file that's within the limits of the configuration settings then the files array contains

00:13.290 --> 00:22.320
data about the uploaded file including the size in bytes so we can also use this to restrict the size

00:22.320 --> 00:26.390
of uploads in individual farms.

00:27.750 --> 00:31.960
Let's restrict the size of article images to one megabyte.

00:32.070 --> 00:40.350
So when the form is submitted if the size of the uploaded file is greater than 1 megabyte in bytes we'll

00:40.350 --> 00:43.380
throw an exception.

00:43.510 --> 00:50.200
Note I've put 1 million bytes exactly for one megabyte.

00:50.490 --> 00:57.990
If you want to get in to whether one megabyte is exactly a million are one of these other two values.

00:57.990 --> 01:03.640
There's a question here that goes into that in much more detail.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.570
We'll keep it simple and put one million.

01:11.480 --> 01:18.700
So if I try and upload a file that's less than the server limit but greater than 1 megabytes.

01:19.010 --> 01:22.230
Then we get the error message coming from the exception.

01:22.310 --> 01:25.370
We just added.

01:27.630 --> 01:34.620
I picked a one megabyte limit as it's a nice round number but obviously if you want to be able to upload

01:34.620 --> 01:39.550
larger images than this then all you need to do is change this limit.
