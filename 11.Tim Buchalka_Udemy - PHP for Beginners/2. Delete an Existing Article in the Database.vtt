So far we've developed scripts to list articles view individual ones edit them and add new ones.

00:15.410 --> 00:19.690
What's missing is the ability to delete existing articles.

00:22.220 --> 00:33.440
Let's add a script to do that and call it delete Article doppie HP unlike adding new articles are editing

00:33.440 --> 00:34.870
existing ones.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.480
We don't need a farm with input controls where we supply data to be inserted are dated.

00:41.570 --> 00:47.120
Instead we're just going to run the required esky well to delete their rijkaard.

00:47.120 --> 00:53.870
We do need to identify the record though which we can do in the same way we do it here in the edit article

00:53.870 --> 00:54.990
script.

00:55.340 --> 00:57.080
So let's copy this code.

01:00.220 --> 01:03.160
And paste it in a new script.

01:05.390 --> 01:11.270
So at this point we know the article exists with the idae coming from the query string.

01:11.510 --> 01:15.630
So here we can run the esky well to delete it.

01:16.500 --> 01:23.180
Unlike when we're editing an article we don't have any validation to do but we are inserting the idea

01:23.240 --> 01:27.150
into the esky well so we'll use a prepared statement.

01:27.410 --> 01:29.260
So let's copy this code.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.030
And paste it in a new script.

01:44.990 --> 01:46.760
Let's change the esky well.

01:46.760 --> 01:54.770
From an update statement to a delete statement with a place holder for the idea.

01:55.340 --> 02:00.670
We dont need to do anything with the published at variable so we can delete these lines.

02:03.050 --> 02:10.010
And the only parameter we need to bind is the idae which we bind as an integer.

02:10.070 --> 02:13.850
Just like when we're using the escudo update statement.

02:14.510 --> 02:21.140
If executing the statement is successful we can't redirect to show the individual article because we

02:21.140 --> 02:22.350
just deleted it.

02:22.610 --> 02:29.390
So let's redirect back to the index page like that.

02:29.390 --> 02:33.890
Let's add a link to this new page to the article page.

02:36.660 --> 02:39.960
Like that passing in the I.D. of the article.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.830
We went to the late in the query string.

02:47.220 --> 02:48.760
Let's give that a try.

02:48.930 --> 02:54.690
Here in the database we can see all the records in the article table.

02:55.950 --> 03:03.840
If we select an article and click delete We are redirected back to the index page and the article we

03:03.840 --> 03:04.660
just clicked.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.020
Isn't there.

03:09.470 --> 03:13.380
And in the database table we can see it's been deleted.
