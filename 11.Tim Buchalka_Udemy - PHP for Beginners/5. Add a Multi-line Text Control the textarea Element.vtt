00:04.460 --> 00:12.270
For entering text in a from the default text input type gives us a single line text input field.

00:12.750 --> 00:18.570
If we want the user to be able to enter more than one line of text however we need to use a textarea

00:18.600 --> 00:19.490
element.

00:19.860 --> 00:23.710
This gives us a multi line text input field.

00:25.660 --> 00:29.490
In this form we've got a single text input field.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.970
Let's add a text area like that.

00:35.740 --> 00:38.350
Which looks like this in the browser.

00:38.860 --> 00:43.750
You can enter several lines of text instead of just one.

00:44.520 --> 00:49.720
And note that pressing Enter no longer submits the form inside the text area.

00:49.810 --> 00:53.420
Pressing Enter goes on to a new line.

00:56.460 --> 01:02.880
Note how this is different to an input element an input element is an empty element that doesn't wrap

01:02.910 --> 01:09.520
any content whereas a text area has an opening tag and a closing tag.

01:10.050 --> 01:17.010
The text area still needs a name attribute so that its contents will be submitted with the farm.

01:17.550 --> 01:24.000
But instead of the value attribute to insert some text into a text element in the code we simply place

01:24.000 --> 01:30.240
this text between the opening and closing tax like that.

01:30.240 --> 01:33.090
We can also include several lines of text here.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.590
If you want.

01:37.090 --> 01:39.500
This text is what appears in the control.

01:39.580 --> 01:48.070
When the farm is first displayed by default the text is quite small but in some browsers this resize

01:48.070 --> 01:53.210
handle appears to allow you to resize the text area like that.

01:58.070 --> 02:05.630
You can control the initial size of the text area using the rows and columns attributes to specify the

02:05.630 --> 02:13.400
initial number of rows of text and columns of characters which looks like this in the browser.

02:13.790 --> 02:19.490
However it's better to control the size of a text area along with the rest of the farm lay out using

02:19.600 --> 02:26.750
stylesheets which we'll see later on textarea controls are supported in all browsers.
