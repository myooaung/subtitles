00:05.280 --> 00:12.390
In addition to completely destroying the session and we log out we can also increase the security of

00:12.390 --> 00:14.550
the log in process.

00:17.820 --> 00:22.740
By using sessions to remember they are indications status of a user.

00:22.740 --> 00:28.890
In other words if that use is logged in or not we've opened up our site to what's known as a session

00:28.890 --> 00:31.230
fixation attack.

00:31.230 --> 00:36.890
Basically this allows an attacker to steal the session of a logged in user.

00:36.900 --> 00:41.880
If our site is vulnerable to cross-site scripting as we saw earlier.

00:42.540 --> 00:48.760
So if we forgotten to use the h.t. EMAIL special Charles function somewhere we could be vulnerable.

00:48.780 --> 00:54.280
You can read more about how this attack works in full detail here on this web page.

00:58.660 --> 01:05.370
We can help to prevent an attack like this by changing the session eidy after the user has logged in.

01:05.650 --> 01:09.740
For that we use the session regenerate idea function.

01:12.910 --> 01:20.830
So here in the luggin script as soon as the user has authenticated successfully we call this function

01:20.830 --> 01:24.100
to generate a new session idae passing in.

01:24.100 --> 01:29.080
True as the argument deletes the old session when we do this.

01:29.110 --> 01:34.860
The session idea is changed to a new one but any session data is maintained.

01:38.490 --> 01:41.580
So now when we log in.

01:41.580 --> 01:49.410
It works as before we don't notice anything but the session I.D. has been regenerated helping to prevent

01:49.470 --> 01:51.540
sessions fixation attacks.
