We learnt earlier how h.t. email is used to mark-up text the browser decides how that text should be

00:13.250 --> 00:14.290
displayed.

00:14.390 --> 00:22.310
For example A heading is bold and in a larger front one click links are blue and underlined and so on

00:23.360 --> 00:24.110
to change.

00:24.110 --> 00:26.740
How will the browser show was a page of HDMI L..

00:26.840 --> 00:30.910
We use cascading style sheets Ah SS.

00:33.090 --> 00:40.820
See SS is a language for describing how web pages should be presented while 8 mail is used to define

00:40.820 --> 00:43.940
the structure and semantics of your content.

00:43.950 --> 00:48.070
C S S is used to style it and lay it out.

00:48.380 --> 00:54.390
For example C Ss can be used to change the font colour spacing.

00:54.650 --> 00:58.590
Add animations and other decorative features and so on.

01:01.910 --> 01:03.680
Let's look at an example.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.670
Starting with this basic HS team Al with a title and a couple of paragraphs.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.200
In the browser it looks like this.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.630
Just like javascript.

01:18.630 --> 01:23.410
There are three ways to add C S S to an H team document.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.940
The first is to use in line styles.

01:27.120 --> 01:32.420
For example let's add a style attribute to the first paragraph element.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.870
And in here we can add some C Ss that will affect this element.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.490
For example changing its colour to red.

01:46.720 --> 01:47.640
In the browser.

01:47.680 --> 01:51.910
The contents of that paragraph element are now read.

01:54.710 --> 02:00.150
Most elements in the body of an h t e document support the style attribute.

02:00.590 --> 02:09.670
However as with javascript using in line C S S like this is a bad idea as it makes it difficult to maintain.

02:09.890 --> 02:19.250
The second way of adding success is using a style element which has to go inside the head element in

02:19.250 --> 02:19.750
here.

02:19.850 --> 02:26.150
Let's add some styles to the H one element to make it a tallack.

02:26.510 --> 02:29.990
And let's also make the background colour pink.

02:34.860 --> 02:38.380
In the browser the header element now looks like this.

02:42.470 --> 02:48.440
The third way to add styles to a page is to use an external style sheet.

02:48.440 --> 02:52.010
Let's add a new file called styles that C Ss

02:57.800 --> 03:08.060
and in here let's add some styles to paragraph elements to change the font to a sans the civi one and

03:08.120 --> 03:11.100
change the size to 26.

03:13.970 --> 03:20.760
Then in the S T L to reference an external style sheet we use a link tag.

03:22.540 --> 03:28.050
The link tag is used to link an external resource to an eight team elf file.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.050
So to link to a style sheet.

03:32.090 --> 03:39.610
We use the link tag like this putting the U R L of the file in the h referer attribute.

03:39.960 --> 03:46.380
This tag always needs to go in the head section and you can link to as many external stylesheets as

03:46.380 --> 03:47.430
you like.

03:48.370 --> 03:54.370
The advantage of having all the styles in an external file is that you can easily apply common styles

03:54.370 --> 03:58.280
to any page just by including the style sheet file.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.370
In the browser it now looks like this.

04:07.790 --> 04:13.190
Let's also change the colour of the paragraphs to blue in the external stylesheet.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.680
Now in the browser one paragraph is blue but the other one is still red.

04:26.820 --> 04:34.300
This is because the style with this paragraph is defined after the style in the external stylesheet.

04:34.470 --> 04:41.520
The style used by the browser is the latest one it finds either in an external stylesheets in embedded

04:41.610 --> 04:47.380
are in line styles so it's possible to override styles in this way.

04:50.570 --> 04:53.790
When defining a C S S rule the first.

04:53.810 --> 04:58.530
We put a C Ss selector and then the list of styles.

05:01.580 --> 05:07.440
C Ss selectors can be simple element names as we've been using are.

05:07.550 --> 05:12.300
You can identify elements using the I.D. and class attributes too.

05:16.710 --> 05:24.330
For example let's add a class to this paragraph and then in the style sheet.

05:24.630 --> 05:33.360
Change the selector so that the styles only apply to paragraphs with this class.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.390
And in the browser it looks like this.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.980
This being a p h.

05:45.980 --> 05:52.500
P cause I won't get into C S S in a lot of detail but this site is an excellent reference.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.580
If you want more information.
