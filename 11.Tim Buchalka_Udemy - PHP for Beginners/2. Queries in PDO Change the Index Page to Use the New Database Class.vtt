00:04.450 --> 00:06.480
Now we have our database class.

00:06.490 --> 00:09.770
Let's use it here in the index page.

00:09.790 --> 00:17.250
We're using the my esky Well I procedural code we developed earlier to select the list of articles.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.420
Let's change this step by step.

00:19.480 --> 00:29.830
To use pto first will require the Database class file replacing the database include that contains the

00:29.830 --> 00:31.960
my Eskew elhai connection function

00:35.260 --> 00:45.160
then we'll create a new database object and then change this Carl to get the connection by calling the

00:45.160 --> 00:48.530
method in the class instead.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.630
The equivalent of the my esky Well I'd query function is to call the query method on the pto object

00:59.490 --> 01:01.580
so let's change that.

01:02.010 --> 01:04.810
Passing in this key well.

01:08.210 --> 01:12.310
As with the my Eskew a function this returns false.

01:12.320 --> 01:20.590
If there's an error to get to every detail we call the error info method which returns an array.

01:20.870 --> 01:24.480
So we'll just dump out the whole thing for now.

01:25.220 --> 01:29.190
Then the PD or equivalent of the my esky Well I fetch.

01:29.210 --> 01:30.170
I'll function

01:32.680 --> 01:39.210
is the fetch method on the resultset ASC within my escudo life function.

01:39.410 --> 01:47.710
If we want just an associative array returned we have to pass in the fetch SAQ constant like that.

01:51.810 --> 01:58.440
The code that processes the associative array is exactly the same looping around the array and printing

01:58.440 --> 02:00.010
out the values.

02:02.800 --> 02:09.730
And when we run this code in the browser nothing has changed except that now we're using pto instead

02:09.730 --> 02:11.310
of my desk ally.
