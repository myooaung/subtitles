00:05.180 --> 00:10.460
The validation we just introduced stops us from inserting a record into the database.

00:10.520 --> 00:16.820
If we don't enter valid values for the title and content we'll get to validating the publication date

00:17.090 --> 00:18.330
later on.

00:18.620 --> 00:21.640
The farm is redisplay aid with error messages.

00:21.890 --> 00:29.660
But if we happen to have supplied a value in one of the fields but one of the others is invalid and

00:29.660 --> 00:35.270
we submit the farm the data that we originally typed in is lost.

00:35.270 --> 00:41.270
It will be much more user friendly if the redisplay farm maintains the data that we originally typed

00:41.270 --> 00:43.370
in.

00:45.010 --> 00:53.230
So let's try setting the value attribute of the title input to the value from the post array like that.

00:56.290 --> 01:02.140
As you might have guessed when we first load the farm the post to raise empty so are trying to access

01:02.140 --> 01:08.950
an array element that doesn't exist gives us an error the error appears inside the title input.

01:09.190 --> 01:12.190
That's what we set the value of the control to.

01:14.500 --> 01:20.830
We could put an F statement in here to check if the arraignment exists but we'd have to repeat that

01:21.010 --> 01:27.190
for every single control and our 8 p.m. hour would start to get messy with lots of P HP embedded in

01:27.190 --> 01:28.010
it.

01:28.120 --> 01:35.080
Plus we are already checking to see if the farm has been submitted up here so we can take advantage

01:35.080 --> 01:36.590
of that.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.720
So let's replace this post to rate element.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.580
With a variable called Title.

01:46.650 --> 01:49.980
Then if the form is submitted.

01:51.530 --> 01:55.530
That's a sign the value from the farm to this variable.

01:58.220 --> 02:02.770
If the form isn't submitted we still need this variable to exist.

02:02.810 --> 02:06.670
Otherwise we're back to the same error we're trying to fix.

02:06.740 --> 02:14.240
We could add an else block to this if but seeing as we are ready initializing a variable here that we

02:14.240 --> 02:16.210
later use in the farm.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.070
This is a good place to do it.

02:18.500 --> 02:23.430
So let's initialize the title variable here like that.

02:26.550 --> 02:33.240
Now when we first load the farm there's no error and if we supply a value for the title but not the

02:33.240 --> 02:34.020
content.

02:34.020 --> 02:38.430
So the farm is invalid when we submit the farm.

02:38.430 --> 02:43.980
The farm is redisplay displayed with the validation error and the value we typed into the title field

02:44.160 --> 02:45.920
has been maintained.

02:48.970 --> 02:56.860
Let's do the same for the other two controls with initialize some variables at the top then set the

02:56.860 --> 03:07.360
values to the data coming from the farm when it's submitted and then in the next term I'll use these

03:07.360 --> 03:11.860
variables to redisplay the data for the other two farm controls.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.440
Like that.

03:18.590 --> 03:23.720
So now if we leave the title blank would enter values for the other two fields.

03:24.230 --> 03:31.560
When we submit the farm and it's re displayed the values of the other two fields are maintained.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.770
There's one more thing we can do to improve our code slightly.

03:38.210 --> 03:43.400
When the farm is submitted we're assigning the values coming from the farm in the post super global

03:43.580 --> 03:45.230
to these variables.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.890
However we're still using this post to Ray when we're validating the data.

03:50.180 --> 03:56.640
And also when we insert it into the esky Well our code will be easier to maintain.

03:56.660 --> 04:01.120
If we reduce the amount of times we use a global variable like this.

04:01.850 --> 04:07.530
So let's change the validation to use our new variables instead.

04:08.420 --> 04:16.510
And also where we're binding these values to our Prepared Eskew our statement like that.

04:19.530 --> 04:27.450
So now our farm values are maintained when we submit an invalid form making it much easier to correct

04:27.480 --> 04:33.520
any validation errors and resubmit the form.

04:34.050 --> 04:38.580
And if all the data are valid a new rijkaard is inserted as before.
