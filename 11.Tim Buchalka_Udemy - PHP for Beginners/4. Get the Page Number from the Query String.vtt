00:05.640 --> 00:10.520
We can now show pages of records based on the page number.

00:10.560 --> 00:15.420
However we obviously don't want the page number hard coded in this script.

00:15.420 --> 00:19.520
Instead let's get it from the query string.

00:20.910 --> 00:27.170
If I add a question mark to the you r l followed by a page variable.

00:30.190 --> 00:37.990
We can access the value of this variable in the global get an array like this.

00:40.820 --> 00:51.130
So then if I change the value in the query string the page of results changes.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.510
However if I remove the query string

00:57.560 --> 00:59.480
we get an error.

01:02.200 --> 01:10.570
This is B Carson elements with the index of page doesn't appear in the get array to fix this.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.160
First we need to check if it's set.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.090
And if it is we can use it.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.460
If not we default to page 1.

01:26.170 --> 01:32.840
So now in the browser if we don't put the page we get page one and if we do.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.650
We get the page specified.

01:40.650 --> 01:43.230
We can improve this code though.

01:46.410 --> 01:54.360
The ternary operator allows us to return a value based on a boolean condition.

01:54.360 --> 02:00.600
So instead of this entire IF statement we can use the ternary operator directly.

02:00.750 --> 02:13.710
When we create a new object what the ternary operator does here is if this is true use this value and

02:13.710 --> 02:15.610
if it's false.

02:15.750 --> 02:17.500
Use this one.

02:21.610 --> 02:27.260
So without a query string this defaults to page 1 as before.

02:27.460 --> 02:34.680
If I add a query string with the page number then it uses that value for the page.

02:37.860 --> 02:40.830
We can improve this even further though.

02:43.360 --> 02:49.570
A new feature that was added in p-h P7 was the null coalescing operator.

02:49.570 --> 02:56.460
This was added specifically for when we're using is set with the ternary operator.

02:57.070 --> 03:02.170
So now we can replace this with this.

03:04.030 --> 03:09.760
If this value exists then this value will be used.

03:09.760 --> 03:16.520
If not then what follows the double question mark will be used instead.

03:19.220 --> 03:23.600
So without a query string this still defaults to page 1 as before.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.660
And if I add a query string.

03:27.380 --> 03:31.170
Then again it uses that value for the page.
