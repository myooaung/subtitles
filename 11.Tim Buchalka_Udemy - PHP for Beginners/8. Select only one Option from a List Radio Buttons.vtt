00:04.460 --> 00:10.820
If we want to give the user a list of options where only one answer can be chosen then we use radio

00:10.820 --> 00:11.830
buttons.

00:14.720 --> 00:21.800
Let's use the example of a question again only this time only one answer can be chosen to create a radio

00:21.830 --> 00:22.400
button.

00:22.430 --> 00:26.750
We add an input element with the type of radio.

00:28.640 --> 00:35.550
Let's add two more including some text next to them to describe each answer.

00:35.690 --> 00:37.280
Now the end of each line.

00:37.490 --> 00:43.800
I'm adding a B hour break element which just inserts and line break our carriage return.

00:43.850 --> 00:48.290
Normally you do this in another way using styles which we'll see later on.

00:48.410 --> 00:51.020
But for now I will use this to keep it simple

00:54.020 --> 00:54.860
in the browser.

00:54.890 --> 00:59.080
Radio buttons are normally rendered as circles that you can click on.

00:59.600 --> 01:06.080
However unlike checkboxes you can't toggle them on and off by repeatedly clicking them.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.610
If we click on some of the other answers they get checked to

01:13.960 --> 01:16.540
to make radio buttons work as they should.

01:16.550 --> 01:23.130
We need to give each input the same value for the name attributes like that.

01:25.640 --> 01:36.500
Now in the browser we can select one but when we select another one it one checks the first one so we

01:36.500 --> 01:43.520
can only select one answer for all the radio buttons with the same name.

01:43.550 --> 01:48.390
We can only select one of them if we submit this.

01:49.010 --> 01:55.760
We get the name of the control with the value of on but this doesn't tell us which one was checked when

01:55.760 --> 01:56.930
the farm was submitted

02:00.110 --> 02:00.980
to fix this.

02:00.980 --> 02:06.500
We need to add a value to each radio inputs like that.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.550
This value is what will be submitted if this input is selected.

02:10.550 --> 02:12.660
When the farm is submitted.

02:15.140 --> 02:22.490
So now if we select one of the radio buttons and submit the farm that's the value that we get on the

02:22.490 --> 02:24.050
server.

02:24.050 --> 02:30.110
Note that unlike a select element for example when the farm is first loaded no value is selected

02:32.780 --> 02:38.670
to select one of the radio buttons we add the checked attribute like that.

02:41.210 --> 02:47.890
So now when we first load the farm that radio button is our Will it be selected at the moment.

02:47.900 --> 02:54.320
We have to click on the radio what in itself to select it we can't click on the text next to it will

02:54.350 --> 02:57.260
look and how we can do that next.
