00:05.210 --> 00:14.750
A lot of content on the web is lists of things lists of contents lists of articles and so on.

00:14.750 --> 00:19.000
We've got two elements in each team out for describing lists.

00:19.160 --> 00:26.540
The U L are on OD'd list element is used to describe a list where the ardour of the items in the list

00:26.720 --> 00:28.110
is unimportant.

00:28.310 --> 00:34.370
For example a shopping list I will list of ingredients in a recipe.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.310
To create an unguarded list.

00:37.350 --> 00:48.630
First we add a u l element then nested inside this element we add the list items each list item is wrapped

00:48.630 --> 00:49.390
in L..

00:49.470 --> 00:53.440
Tags like this.

00:53.850 --> 01:00.960
Each item is placed inside its own elhai tags like this.

01:04.260 --> 01:11.130
In the browser an ordered list is typically displayed with a booklet before each item and each item

01:11.160 --> 01:12.900
on a new line.

01:13.110 --> 01:18.690
You can of course change this default styling as we'll see later on.

01:20.710 --> 01:23.880
The other type of list is an ordered list.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.620
The order of items in an ordered list does matter.

01:27.670 --> 01:32.870
For example a list of contents are a list of steps in a recipe.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.020
To create an ordered list.

01:37.030 --> 01:40.010
First we add an O L element.

01:41.080 --> 01:47.160
Then as with the unaided list we add to the list items nested inside.

01:49.090 --> 01:49.480
Each.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.150
Inside an L I element.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.140
In the browser.

01:56.160 --> 02:03.360
An ordered list is typically displayed numbered with a number before each item and each item on a new

02:03.360 --> 02:04.540
line.

02:05.430 --> 02:13.980
The numbers start at 1 by default but you can change this if you like by adding the start attribute

02:15.360 --> 02:18.880
to the opening tag of the O L element.

02:21.310 --> 02:22.510
This makes the list.

02:22.540 --> 02:25.560
Start with the number that you specify.

02:29.570 --> 02:32.870
List Items don't have to just be text.

02:32.900 --> 02:37.970
They can include all that 80 email elements to even other lists.

02:38.330 --> 02:40.980
For example let's nest another list.

02:41.000 --> 02:50.330
Our sublist inside of the second item of our Are did list and then add some list items.

02:52.630 --> 03:00.300
Will indent them like this so it's easier to see the structure of the two lists.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.450
In the browser it looks like this.

03:05.610 --> 03:09.680
The sublist is indented by default.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.630
Note that this has nothing to do with the spaces we put in our code.

03:13.670 --> 03:18.880
Rather the browser are somatically indents sublists.

03:18.920 --> 03:27.630
Note also that the sublist has its own numbering unrelated to the numbers of the parents list.

03:27.650 --> 03:35.690
As for styling by default an unguarded list uses solid bullets and an ordered list uses integers like

03:35.690 --> 03:36.500
this.

03:40.250 --> 03:46.940
We can change these however to use different styles of bullets and numbers for example square bullets

03:47.240 --> 03:52.310
Roman numerals and so on will learn how to do this later on.

03:52.310 --> 03:54.180
When we look at styling.
