00:04.370 --> 00:07.000
To provide a user with a binary choice.

00:07.010 --> 00:09.120
In other words an option that is yes.

00:09.190 --> 00:17.990
Well now we use a checkbox a checkbox is an input element with the type of checkbox.

00:20.950 --> 00:27.960
In the browser it's normally rendered as a square box that you can click to toggle on and off again.

00:30.840 --> 00:39.180
If we add a value for the name attribute so that we can get it's value when it's submitted when we check

00:39.210 --> 00:41.580
the box and submit the farm.

00:41.580 --> 00:45.280
We get the name we supplied with the value of on.

00:48.650 --> 00:54.830
If we go back and uncheck the box and then submit the farm there's nothing in the array.

00:54.830 --> 00:58.930
Browsers don't send anything for empty check boxes.

01:01.450 --> 01:06.010
By default the control has the value of on as we just saw.

01:06.430 --> 01:14.330
You can change this however if you like by specifying a value for the value attribute.

01:14.350 --> 01:20.250
Now if we check the box and submit the farm this is the value that is submitted.

01:22.660 --> 01:29.290
Also by default a checkbox isn't checked when the farm is first loaded but we can change this by adding

01:29.290 --> 01:40.370
the checked attribute similar to the selected attribute used in the select control we saw earlier.

01:40.450 --> 01:45.170
Now when the pharmacy first loaded the check box is already checked.

01:47.180 --> 01:50.350
The control doesn't include a label of any kind.

01:50.510 --> 01:59.330
So to label a checkbox we just add some text or whatever content you like next to the control like that.

02:02.090 --> 02:06.540
Note that you can't click on this text to toggle the checkbox.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.260
You have to click directly on the checkbox itself.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.370
We'll see how we can use the label element to achieve this next.

02:18.020 --> 02:24.710
We can use checkboxes to give the user a list of options where they can choose as few are as many answers

02:24.950 --> 02:26.130
as is necessary.

02:26.150 --> 02:28.580
For example in answer to a question.

02:29.300 --> 02:37.330
So let's add a question and several checkbox answers like that.

02:37.400 --> 02:42.130
Now there are two ways we could get the values from these checkboxes.

02:42.140 --> 02:48.480
The first is to give each checkbox a different name and not specify a value.

02:51.360 --> 02:59.850
So if I select a couple of these and submit the farm we get the names of the checkboxes that I checked

03:00.360 --> 03:03.640
as the indexes of the array with the values of.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.060
On.

03:09.280 --> 03:16.330
The other way we could do it is to give all the checkbox is the same value for the name attribute with

03:16.330 --> 03:18.470
the empty square brackets at the end.

03:19.300 --> 03:25.300
If we do this then we also have to provide values for the value attribute.

03:25.300 --> 03:28.860
Different for each checkbox like this.

03:31.430 --> 03:39.860
Now if I select a couple of boxes and submit the farm we get one element in the post array that contains

03:39.860 --> 03:44.320
an array with each value that was checked.

03:46.650 --> 03:53.050
Either method is a valid way to access the selected checkboxes Whichever method you choose.

03:53.130 --> 03:59.160
Having multiple check boxes like this is more user friendly than the multiple select element that we

03:59.160 --> 04:00.200
saw earlier.
