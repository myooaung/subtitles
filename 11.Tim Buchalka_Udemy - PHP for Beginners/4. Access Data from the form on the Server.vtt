00:04.420 --> 00:11.140
We just created this farm with several different types of input in it in the farm.

00:11.170 --> 00:16.430
Were using the post method and were not specifying of value for the action attribute.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.070
So when this farm is submitted it'll be submitted to itself.

00:21.100 --> 00:27.940
So here at the top if the post method was used we're dumping out the contents of the post to be ready.

00:30.080 --> 00:40.350
In a browser if we supply some values for some of these fields and submit the farm the array is empty.

00:42.830 --> 00:47.280
This is because none of the inputs have any name attributes.

00:47.480 --> 00:55.670
When a farm is submitted the value in the name attribute is used as the index in the get our post to.

00:56.420 --> 01:01.370
The value for the name can be anything you'd like as long as it doesn't contain the space.

01:01.430 --> 01:05.240
And of course it makes sense to give it a meaningful name.

01:05.480 --> 01:09.300
So now that this input has a value for the name attribute.

01:10.230 --> 01:20.300
If we supply a value in this control and submit the farm we see the value in the array with the index

01:21.020 --> 01:23.110
coming from the name attribute.

01:26.290 --> 01:32.770
If an input doesn't have a value in the name attribute we can't access its value when the form is submitted

01:33.130 --> 01:36.970
as the browser doesn't send anything for that input.

01:37.180 --> 01:42.990
So let's add a name value for the rest of these inputs like that.

01:46.270 --> 01:52.060
Then in the browser we can supply values for some of these controls.

01:57.700 --> 02:03.980
And when we submit the farm we can access all these values in the post array.

02:04.480 --> 02:11.770
Even if we didn't type something in an input control an empty strongest submitted notes that everything

02:11.800 --> 02:13.920
is submitted as a string.

02:14.110 --> 02:17.490
Even now some of these values might be numbers.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.060
Everything in the post are getter Ray.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.980
It's always a string.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.130
Each name needs to be unique.

02:28.230 --> 02:36.180
Inside the farm if a name is repeated then only the latest value will be accessible.

02:36.180 --> 02:40.740
One type of input that we can't enter a value in is the hidden field.

02:41.220 --> 02:46.040
This type of input is for when you want some data to be sent on the farm is submitted.

02:46.290 --> 02:48.720
But the use it doesn't need to see it.

02:49.320 --> 02:54.150
If we can't type anything into this field then how do we supply a value.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.260
We do that using the value attribute.

03:01.570 --> 03:10.480
So when we submit the farm now we can't see this hidden field but when it's submitted the hidden field

03:10.480 --> 03:15.950
value is sent along with the rest of the values in the farm.

03:15.940 --> 03:24.370
Note that as we saw earlier with comments in extra email this value can be viewed if you view the page

03:24.370 --> 03:25.920
source.

03:26.740 --> 03:30.610
So don't use the hidden field for anything sensitive.

03:33.720 --> 03:37.560
We can also use the value attributes for any other input.

03:37.560 --> 03:41.770
This value will be shown in the input control when the farm is loaded.

03:41.850 --> 03:47.490
For example if we add a value attribute to the first input like that.

03:49.550 --> 03:54.070
When we first opened the form the field already contains that value.

03:54.410 --> 04:00.740
And of course unless we change it this value is what's submitted when we submit the form.

04:00.740 --> 04:06.770
This can be used to display fields when editing some data for example are to provide a default value

04:06.890 --> 04:08.170
for a field.

04:10.960 --> 04:16.480
Finally in this video there are three types of input that don't give us a control where we can enter

04:16.480 --> 04:27.370
a value these out image button and submit using inputs of these types gives us buttons that will submit

04:27.370 --> 04:28.430
the farm.

04:28.930 --> 04:36.040
However the button element is now the preferred way of creating a submit button as it's more flexible

04:36.250 --> 04:44.410
and has several advantages like being able to include x t mail inside the clickable area of the button.

04:44.410 --> 04:48.210
We have a simple button at the end of our farm here.

04:51.010 --> 04:53.730
When we click this button the farm is admitted.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.930
But there's also a shortcut to submitting a farm.

04:57.190 --> 05:03.880
If one of the input controls has the focus which means the text cursor is inside one of the controls

05:03.910 --> 05:05.620
and you can type in it.

05:05.620 --> 05:10.490
If you press enter the far Miss submit it.

05:10.540 --> 05:14.610
This only works however if there is a submit button on the farm.
