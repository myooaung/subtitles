00:04.290 --> 00:08.060
To provide a user with a fixed list of options like a menu.

00:08.190 --> 00:10.690
We use a Select control.

00:12.460 --> 00:22.800
This consists of a select element that wraps a series of option elements as with other controls.

00:22.810 --> 00:31.960
The select element needs a value for the name attribute and each option element needs a value.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.970
This value is what is submitted.

00:33.970 --> 00:36.080
If this is the chosen element.

00:39.700 --> 00:46.420
In the browser the select control looks like this and you can choose from the various options.

00:46.420 --> 00:52.600
If we choose the second one for example when the form is submitted the value of this option is the value

00:52.600 --> 00:55.820
that submitted far the mark element.

01:00.070 --> 01:04.700
By default you can only choose one option in a select control.

01:04.870 --> 01:12.980
But if we add the multiple attribute which is an attribute we can add just like that without a value.

01:13.000 --> 01:22.420
If you like in the browser we can now select more than one option by holding down the control our command

01:22.420 --> 01:23.030
key.

01:23.290 --> 01:24.860
When we click.

01:25.330 --> 01:27.460
However if we submit this.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.050
We can only access one value.

01:36.430 --> 01:42.310
In order to be able to access multiple values we need to add some empty square brackets to the end of

01:42.310 --> 01:45.220
the control's name like that.

01:48.200 --> 01:56.960
Now in the browser if we select multiple values and submit the farm we can access all the values that

01:56.960 --> 01:59.280
were submitted.

02:02.770 --> 02:08.380
Multiple select control is useful when you want the user to be able to select multiple values from a

02:08.380 --> 02:09.400
list.

02:09.400 --> 02:14.330
But it's not clear that the control or command key has to be used to do this.

02:14.620 --> 02:20.260
For this reason it's more user friendly to use a series of check boxes for something like this which

02:20.260 --> 02:21.740
will see you next.

02:24.930 --> 02:31.030
If you have lots of options inside a selects like this then you can group these together if you like.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.590
So it's easier for the user.

02:33.720 --> 02:38.320
We do this by wrapping the groups of options inside up to group tags.

02:40.430 --> 02:47.120
The label shown in the select control for each group is specified in the label attribute of each upt

02:47.120 --> 02:49.900
group like that.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.690
In the browser the select control.

02:55.690 --> 03:06.310
Looks like this with the options in groups you can't select the group label only the individual options.

03:06.310 --> 03:12.150
Note that the default value of a select control is always the first option.

03:14.370 --> 03:20.700
In a text control we use the value attribute to set a value to be displayed when the farm is loaded.

03:20.970 --> 03:24.940
The select element however doesn't have a value attribute.

03:24.990 --> 03:30.540
Instead to select an option that will be selected when the farm is first loaded we add the selected

03:30.570 --> 03:31.600
attributes.

03:33.610 --> 03:36.450
To one of the option elements like this.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.520
Now in the browser.

03:41.720 --> 03:48.270
This option is selected by default instead of the first one for a multiple select box.

03:48.290 --> 03:54.350
You can put the selected attribute on more than one option element and all these will be selected when

03:54.350 --> 03:56.050
the farm is first loaded.
