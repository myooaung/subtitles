00:05.470 --> 00:11.500
Now that we can upload images and save the file name of the uploaded image with the article rijkaard

00:11.950 --> 00:14.940
we can display the image in the browser.

00:17.360 --> 00:21.960
First let's do this in the individual article page in The Root.

00:22.580 --> 00:28.820
After we display the title we can check to see if the article object has the image file attributes set

00:30.470 --> 00:35.150
and if the value of this attribute is null it will evaluate to false.

00:35.630 --> 00:43.820
If it isn't NULL let's add an image tag with the soss attribute set to the Web accessible part of the

00:43.820 --> 00:44.680
image.

00:44.810 --> 00:52.140
The upload folder followed by the name of the image file from the attribute of the article object.

00:52.430 --> 00:59.390
We don't need to use h.t. htl special chars around this value as we sanitize the file name when we uploaded

00:59.390 --> 01:00.210
it.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.950
Let's give that a try.

01:05.080 --> 01:12.340
If I view an article that has an image there's the image that we uploaded for this article.

01:12.370 --> 01:15.270
Let's try an article that doesn't have an image.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.580
And of course no image is displayed.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.930
We can repeat this in the admen article page.

01:23.990 --> 01:32.220
So let's copy this new code and paste it in the same place in the admen article script.

01:34.910 --> 01:41.520
Let's also do the same in the edit article image script so we can see what image we're editing.

01:47.050 --> 01:51.960
If we access the same article in the admin area there we see the image.

01:52.160 --> 01:56.900
And if I click on EDIT article the image it's there as well.
