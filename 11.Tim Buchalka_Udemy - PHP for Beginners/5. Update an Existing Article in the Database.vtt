00:05.120 --> 00:15.770
When editing an existing article if we submit valid values the validation passes.

00:15.770 --> 00:18.830
Now we know how to up day to record using ESC.

00:18.830 --> 00:27.830
Well we can use these values to update the article in the database so we avoid Escuela injection as

00:27.830 --> 00:28.680
before.

00:28.790 --> 00:33.600
We'll use a prepared statement in the new article script here.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.670
We're using it prepared statement to insert a new record.

00:37.670 --> 00:42.500
We'll be doing something similar so we can copy this code.

00:48.620 --> 00:53.540
And paste it here in our edit script.

00:57.430 --> 01:02.920
We don't need to call the Get dbe method to get the database connection as we are ready.

01:02.920 --> 01:10.390
Doing it at the top here so we can delete this line.

01:10.390 --> 01:18.840
Next let's change the insert statement into an update one with place holders for the fields were updating

01:19.360 --> 01:23.320
and also for the eidy in the WHERE clause.

01:23.530 --> 01:26.580
Then we prepare the statement output.

01:26.620 --> 01:35.050
Any error if there is one and if all is well we set the publish date to know if it's empty and then

01:35.050 --> 01:39.040
we bind the parameter so the values we've got from the farm.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.140
However in addition to the fields we were updating.

01:45.420 --> 01:53.260
We've also got a place holder for the idea of the article we want to update in our esky well.

01:55.840 --> 02:01.420
At the top of the script we're setting the variables for the article we're editing from the data we

02:01.420 --> 02:03.540
get back from the database.

02:03.700 --> 02:13.120
So let's add another one for the idae then back down here where we're binding the parameters we can

02:13.210 --> 02:21.400
add this to that function call making sure we bind it as an integer just as we did when selecting a

02:21.400 --> 02:23.440
record.

02:23.500 --> 02:29.350
If this executes successfully we dont need to call this function to get the I.D. of the inserted rijkaard

02:30.700 --> 02:34.030
as we're updating that other than inserting.

02:34.450 --> 02:42.490
Then we redirect to the article page as before passing in the idees variable which we just set at the

02:42.490 --> 02:43.230
top.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.610
Let's give that a try.

02:48.890 --> 02:58.730
Let's change some of the articles current values and submit the farm we're redirected back to the article

02:58.730 --> 03:00.140
page and the.

03:00.170 --> 03:08.240
Data has been changed so we've successfully updated the data using the update statement.

03:09.770 --> 03:16.910
Finally let's add a link from the article page here to the edit page we just added Let's add it here

03:16.970 --> 03:21.510
just after the articles data has been displayed.

03:21.890 --> 03:27.770
We need to pass in the idea of the article in the query string which we can get from the article rijkaard

03:27.800 --> 03:32.170
in the same way that we're getting the title and the content.

03:32.450 --> 03:38.400
We dont need to use the h.t. EMAIL special chars function though as this will always be a number.

03:42.630 --> 03:48.780
In the browser if we click on an article we have a link to edit it.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.920
We can make some changes.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.740
And save those changes to the database.
