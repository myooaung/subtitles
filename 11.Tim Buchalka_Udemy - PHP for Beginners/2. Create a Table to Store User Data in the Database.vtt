00:04.480 --> 00:10.690
We just created this user class with an authentic Cape method where we compare the username and password

00:10.960 --> 00:13.530
to hard coded values.

00:13.540 --> 00:18.500
Let's change this so that the user data is in the database instead.

00:21.500 --> 00:30.010
Here in P HP madmen let's create a user table with three columns.

00:34.010 --> 00:40.250
The first column will be the idae which is an integer.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.320
It's also the primary key.

00:47.190 --> 00:55.130
And will check the arto increment box so that when we insert a value the idea is assigned aftermath.

00:56.460 --> 01:07.200
Then we have the user name which will make a varchar of 20 characters but you can make this longer if

01:07.200 --> 01:09.150
you like.

01:09.150 --> 01:18.600
Let's also add a unique index to this column as we don't want more than one user to have the same username

01:18.960 --> 01:22.090
we want them to be unique.

01:23.820 --> 01:32.670
Next we'll add the password which is also a string varchar and will make this two hundred and fifty

01:32.670 --> 01:34.710
five characters long.

01:35.520 --> 01:40.580
This isn't so that users can have 255 character lunk passwords.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.780
There's another reason for making this field this long.

01:43.950 --> 01:46.140
Which we'll see shortly.

01:47.010 --> 01:47.980
And that's it.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.410
If we click save There's our user table.

01:58.110 --> 02:06.330
Let's add these columns as public properties of the new user class just like we did previously with

02:06.330 --> 02:11.960
the article class will also add p s p duck comments for each one.

02:12.120 --> 02:18.890
The idae user name and password.
