In this video we're going to install the atom text editor on urban to Linux.

00:11.510 --> 00:18.490
We'll start by going to the atom website in a browser and clicking on the link to download the dot Deb

00:18.510 --> 00:19.830
file.

00:23.120 --> 00:27.650
Once we saved this file we're going to install it from the command line.

00:28.160 --> 00:38.990
So we'll open a terminal window and there's the file We've downloaded to install type pseudo D package

00:39.110 --> 00:41.820
minus I for install.

00:42.110 --> 00:49.050
And then the name of the file when I run this it will prompt me for my password.

00:50.040 --> 00:54.060
And when I enter it the installation process begins.

00:54.140 --> 01:01.450
There aren't any installation options so the installation process will run until it is installed.

01:04.430 --> 01:09.370
Once installed we can run the editor by clicking on the icon.

01:12.090 --> 01:14.810
And this is what the editor looks like.

01:15.300 --> 01:22.980
First we're going to make a change to the configuration so we'll go to the edit menu select the preferences

01:23.070 --> 01:23.970
option.

01:24.570 --> 01:32.700
And in here select packages and were going to look far for the art of complete plus package will click

01:32.730 --> 01:40.860
on the settings button here and were going to gone check the box that says show suggestions on keystroke

01:42.580 --> 01:47.290
will re-enable this later to see how it can help us code.

01:48.740 --> 01:58.070
Finally we're going to open the folder that we created earlier for our code so we'll click on view and

01:58.070 --> 02:04.630
make sure treeview is visible and we're going to open the folder.

02:05.150 --> 02:10.350
I created it in the documents folder and called it w w w.

02:12.570 --> 02:17.180
And then we can close all these windows that have been opened.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.620
And now we're ready to start coding with p s p.
