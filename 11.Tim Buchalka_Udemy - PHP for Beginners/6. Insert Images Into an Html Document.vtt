So far we've just got text content in our s t email which we created by enclosing plain text in various

00:13.380 --> 00:17.050
hvm out elements like headers and paragraphs.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.720
To add an image to our Web page.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.410
We use the image element.

00:28.180 --> 00:36.510
I've added an image file a photo to the same folder where our term elf file is.

00:36.520 --> 00:46.310
So in our eight Tim L. let's add an image tag here and we specify the path to the image file using the

00:46.330 --> 00:48.140
soss attribute.

00:50.470 --> 00:58.000
We saw at the start of this section that unlike a heading our paragraph element there are some elements

00:58.000 --> 01:01.500
like image that don't have a closing tag.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.890
So this is all we need to insert an image into our page

01:08.530 --> 01:12.200
and in the browser we can see the image displayed here.

01:15.610 --> 01:22.960
It's not generally a good idea to mix h t email and images together in the same folder so to organize

01:22.990 --> 01:24.140
this a bit better.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.320
Let's create an image is folder

01:32.320 --> 01:37.060
and then move the image into that folder.

01:43.310 --> 01:51.500
Now that we've done that however we've broken out a web page and the image is no longer displayed.

01:51.770 --> 01:58.820
When you have an invalid source address for an image this broken image icon is what's displayed in the

01:58.820 --> 02:01.010
browser.

02:02.750 --> 02:10.900
To fix this we need to add the images folder to the source attribute like that.

02:11.060 --> 02:16.570
Now in the browser the image is displayed correctly again.

02:20.330 --> 02:24.770
Note how an image isn't part of the astm Owl.

02:24.830 --> 02:31.800
It's a separate file that is referenced using the image tag and uploaded by the browser.

02:33.970 --> 02:36.210
Just like the astm Al page.

02:36.310 --> 02:45.130
An image has its own address and can be viewed on its own like this.

02:47.070 --> 02:53.160
This is one of the ways that creating a web page is different to creating a document in a word processor

02:53.170 --> 02:58.000
for example if I copy this address.

03:00.870 --> 03:08.270
We can even use this directly in the source attribute of the image tag like this.

03:08.340 --> 03:17.250
And then in the browser the image is displayed as before will look at addresses like this in more detail

03:17.310 --> 03:18.630
later on.

03:21.810 --> 03:27.180
This means that you can insert an image from another website into your web page.

03:27.420 --> 03:32.250
For example we can get the address of this image like this.

03:38.510 --> 03:45.730
Then insert this address into the soss attribute of our image elements like that.

03:46.190 --> 03:52.410
And then in the browser This image is displayed on our site.

03:52.550 --> 03:55.700
Even though it's hosted on another server.

03:58.130 --> 04:00.150
This is called Hot linking.

04:00.350 --> 04:04.980
And unless you're using a service are server that explicitly allows it.

04:05.210 --> 04:12.320
I don't recommend that you do it firstly because you using somebody else's bandwidth and the image is

04:12.320 --> 04:18.860
coming from their web server and also because there's nothing to stop them from changing are deleting

04:18.860 --> 04:21.900
the image breaking your web page.

04:25.620 --> 04:32.720
Finally there's an optional out attribute that is used to describe the image.

04:33.180 --> 04:39.240
If the image source is wrong for example the image is in a format that the browser doesn't support.

04:39.450 --> 04:43.800
Then this alternative text is displayed instead.

04:43.830 --> 04:46.960
This is also helpful for non graphical browsers.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.290
For example those used by people with visual impairment.

04:53.850 --> 05:01.830
Let's add some alternative text to our original image using the art attribute.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.200
We don't see this text.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.560
If the image is displayed but if I disable the images.

05:17.430 --> 05:20.290
We do see the alternative text.

05:22.250 --> 05:25.610
You don't have to do this for all images in your document.

05:25.790 --> 05:30.850
But if the image is essential to the content then it's generally a good idea.
