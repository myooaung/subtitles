00:05.560 --> 00:14.680
There are places in our cmw code where we are handling errors for example here in the contact page.

00:14.680 --> 00:20.920
There are several other places in our cold though where errors and exceptions are though unlikely could

00:20.920 --> 00:21.770
occur.

00:22.150 --> 00:25.310
It's not a good idea to leave these unhandled.

00:25.390 --> 00:30.950
So let's add area and exception handlers that will deal with these if they occur.

00:32.530 --> 00:39.210
As we were including this initial script on each page this is a good place to put them.

00:39.220 --> 00:41.910
We'll start by adding an error handler.

00:43.940 --> 00:52.610
Which as we saw in the previous video just throws an error exception to past the handling ones the exception

00:52.610 --> 00:58.820
handler function will add some code in here in a moment.

00:59.900 --> 01:05.360
Then we set the error handler an exception handler to use these functions.

01:08.770 --> 01:14.870
Inside the exception handler function we have access to an exception object.

01:19.250 --> 01:26.960
The exception object has several methods to get more details about the exception the message the code

01:26.960 --> 01:33.790
number the name of the script where it occurred and the line it occurred on and so on.

01:37.380 --> 01:42.070
So we can fix the error we want as many details as possible.

01:42.360 --> 01:52.050
So let's print out a header then paragraphs with the class of the exception using the get class function

01:52.290 --> 01:55.130
to get the class of the Exception object.

01:56.130 --> 01:57.590
The message.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.580
The stack trace.

02:01.110 --> 02:07.440
Which is a list of the function calls made inside the script up to where the error occurred.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.370
Which will print out inside price tags so their formative correctly.

02:12.750 --> 02:16.400
And finally the file and line number.

02:18.620 --> 02:23.780
Finally it's always a good idea to terminate the script execution in the handler.

02:23.930 --> 02:28.300
At this point to test this.

02:28.400 --> 02:35.290
Let's break our code temporarily here in the Get page method of the article class.

02:35.510 --> 02:38.100
Let's make an error in the ask you well.

02:41.860 --> 02:46.140
This function is called on the index page of our site.

02:50.450 --> 02:57.740
When we visit the index page we get the full details of the error that's occurred the class the message

02:58.190 --> 03:03.710
the stack trace and the file and line number where it occurred.

03:04.600 --> 03:11.650
This information is extremely useful to us when debugging our code so that we can fix the error.

03:12.180 --> 03:17.770
However we don't want these details to be shown when the site is in production on the life server on

03:17.770 --> 03:19.120
the Internet.

03:19.180 --> 03:26.960
Apart from looking unprofessional revealing all these data about your site and code is a security issue.

03:30.880 --> 03:31.900
To fix this.

03:31.930 --> 03:40.180
First let's add a config setting to the configuration file called show error detail that can be true

03:40.240 --> 03:41.280
or false.

03:43.130 --> 03:53.260
Then in the exception handler if this constant is true we'll display the detail as we're doing now.

03:54.170 --> 04:00.150
If it's false we'll just display a message with no details.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.770
With this set to true.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.530
The Aero details are shown as before.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.440
If I change this to false.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.150
Then the error details aren't shown.

04:24.300 --> 04:30.610
So in addition to the database and S M T P server credentials we can change this setting.

04:30.690 --> 04:36.560
Depending on the environment while we are developing we'll set it to true.

04:38.190 --> 04:45.030
And let's not forget to fix the temporary error in the article class code.

04:47.950 --> 04:50.250
And now all is working again.
