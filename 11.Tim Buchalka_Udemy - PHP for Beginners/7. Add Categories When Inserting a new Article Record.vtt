00:05.350 --> 00:11.060
We just added inputs for categories to the farm for editing an existing article.

00:12.590 --> 00:17.210
This farm is also used in the new article page.

00:17.420 --> 00:21.090
But if we view that page now we get an error.

00:24.250 --> 00:31.150
In the farm we added a loop that displays the available categories from the categories array and showing

00:31.150 --> 00:36.310
them as selected based on the contents of the category I.D. already.

00:37.860 --> 00:42.640
In the edit script we're creating these two variables here.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.040
So that's copy these.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.280
And paste them into the new article script.

00:53.050 --> 01:00.670
For a new article there won't be any existing category I.D. So instead of this we can just initialize

01:00.670 --> 01:03.120
this to an empty array.

01:05.610 --> 01:09.330
This method requires the database connection.

01:09.330 --> 01:18.020
So let's move it from inside this block to up here before the method call.

01:20.560 --> 01:27.340
When the edit farm is submitted we're getting the category I.D. values from the farm here.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.640
So that's Cuppy this line too.

01:32.850 --> 01:36.420
And paste it in the new script here.

01:40.750 --> 01:48.420
Now the errors in the new article page have gone and were shown the list of available categories.

01:48.430 --> 01:55.540
What's more if I select a category or two when I submit the form and its readers splayed because of

01:55.540 --> 02:01.170
validation errors the categories I selected remain checked.

02:04.610 --> 02:11.360
In the edit farm when the article is updated we call this set categories method on the article object

02:11.600 --> 02:13.370
to assign the categories.

02:13.970 --> 02:15.530
Let's copy this line to

02:18.830 --> 02:21.670
and paste it in the new article script.

02:21.950 --> 02:26.760
Once the article rijkaard has been successfully created.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.930
Let's give that a try.

02:32.930 --> 02:41.480
If I enter some valid data for the article fields and select some categories when I submit the form

02:42.350 --> 02:50.780
the new article is created and if I edit it we can see the categories have been assigned successfully.

02:55.090 --> 03:01.510
Previously we changed the individual article script in the root so that the assigned categories are

03:01.510 --> 03:03.430
displayed too.

03:03.460 --> 03:08.430
Let's make this change to the equivalent page in the admin area too.

03:08.750 --> 03:13.170
First let's copy the line where we get the article data.

03:20.770 --> 03:24.860
And replace this line in the admin article script.

03:27.430 --> 03:32.960
Then will copy the entire contents of the article element in the astm l..

03:37.700 --> 03:40.800
And replace the code in the admin scripts.

03:50.550 --> 03:58.290
Finally we need to change these links so that were getting the article idae from the array.

03:59.890 --> 04:01.650
Instead of the object.

04:06.470 --> 04:09.050
Now when we create a new article.

04:13.260 --> 04:18.040
We can see which categories we've assigned and if we edit them.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.160
We can see the changes straight away.
