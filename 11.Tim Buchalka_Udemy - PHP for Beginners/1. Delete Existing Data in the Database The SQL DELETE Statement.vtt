00:05.220 --> 00:08.260
To delete data that are already in the database.

00:08.340 --> 00:11.510
We use the Eskew L. delete statement.

00:13.940 --> 00:19.910
We start a delete statement in esky well with they delete from key words followed by the name of the

00:19.910 --> 00:23.750
table that contains the red cards we want to delete.

00:23.900 --> 00:30.510
Then we optionally add a weather condition to only delete records that match this condition.

00:30.560 --> 00:36.790
This condition is specified in the same way we add conditions to select or update statement.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.900
Let's give this a try.

00:42.170 --> 00:45.400
These other current mercado's in our articles table.

00:48.390 --> 00:52.740
Let's delete the article rijkaard with an idea of eight.

00:59.440 --> 01:06.370
One roll was affected and there we can see the rijkaard has been deleted.

01:08.350 --> 01:14.740
Dont forget as with this select and insert statements any columns that you use in the WHERE clause should

01:14.740 --> 01:16.120
have an index.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.460
Otherwise they could take a longer time to execute.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.580
As with the update statement.

01:24.600 --> 01:31.060
If you don't include where clase every single row in the table will be deleted.

01:31.200 --> 01:37.920
So unless you actually want to do this make sure you always include aware class to only delete the cards

01:38.100 --> 01:39.530
that you want to delete.
