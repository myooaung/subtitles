Once you've developed your sight locally to make it available to your users you need to put it life

00:11.630 --> 00:18.920
onto a server that's accessible on the Internet putting your cold life basically involves copying all

00:18.920 --> 00:23.280
this code to a production web server along with the database.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.640
Let's look at an example.

00:29.050 --> 00:32.430
I've got a live site here that's currently empty.

00:32.800 --> 00:40.510
We'll deploy our current code base to this site we'll start by creating the database on the production

00:40.510 --> 00:41.800
server.

00:41.800 --> 00:47.690
First we need to export the structure and data of the current local database.

00:48.100 --> 00:58.090
So in PE HP my admin on local host will start by clicking export change the method to custom.

00:58.090 --> 01:05.080
We want all the table structures but only the data for categories and users.

01:05.290 --> 01:11.510
You can export data for the articles if you like but I want to start with an empty blog on the life

01:11.510 --> 01:12.550
server.

01:14.710 --> 01:18.550
We want to view the output as text.

01:18.550 --> 01:21.570
We don't need comments on a transaction.

01:21.850 --> 01:29.230
Are the aalto increment option and the rest of the options will accept the defaults.

01:29.230 --> 01:37.080
When I click go we get lots of esky well far creating tables inserting data and so on.

01:37.150 --> 01:45.250
Let's copy all of this up and then on the live web server.

01:45.620 --> 01:48.800
I've already got an empty database set up.

01:49.270 --> 01:50.990
If I click on s q L..

01:52.280 --> 01:58.410
And then paste in the code we just copied from the local database.

01:58.940 --> 02:00.350
When I run this.

02:01.900 --> 02:08.420
It creates the database and inserts the data on the life server.

02:08.860 --> 02:15.770
And here we have the tables and the data for the tables that we exported data from.

02:17.710 --> 02:19.180
Copying and pasting.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.540
ESKEW L is one way to do this.

02:21.550 --> 02:26.730
You can also export this Eskew L2 a file and then import this file.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.080
If you prefer.

02:32.050 --> 02:37.280
Now that we've put the database live next we need to copy the code alive.

02:39.130 --> 02:43.720
The easiest way to do this is to use F T P for this.

02:43.720 --> 02:51.760
You'll need an F T P client and I recommend file ziller which is free open source and available on all

02:51.760 --> 02:53.120
platforms.

02:53.140 --> 02:57.940
You'll also of course need EFT P access to your life server.

03:00.260 --> 03:08.000
In files over here on the left we have the local files and this is the latest version of our code on

03:08.000 --> 03:08.640
the right.

03:08.660 --> 03:12.460
We have the live server which is currently empty.

03:12.470 --> 03:20.620
Let's start by selecting all the local files and copying them across to the live server.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.190
This will take a few moments.

03:24.210 --> 03:28.170
How long depends on how much data you're transferring.

03:28.170 --> 03:31.500
The speed of the connection and so on.

03:36.490 --> 03:42.700
Once all the files are transferred there's one more thing to do before we can access our site and that's

03:42.700 --> 03:45.340
to edit the config file.

03:45.340 --> 03:52.030
We can do this directly into files either by right clicking the config dumpy HP file on the remote server

03:52.510 --> 03:54.980
and selecting view edit.

04:12.180 --> 04:19.890
In here we need to enter the details of the live database server and mail server and also change the

04:19.920 --> 04:27.960
show area detail setting to falls when we save and close this file.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.410
The file on the remote server is updated.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.440
Let's take a look at the life site.

04:39.640 --> 04:43.540
Here it is with no articles as we didn't transfer those.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.070
But we can log in and add a new article.

04:51.290 --> 04:57.500
If we give it a publish date then this article appears on the home page.

05:02.590 --> 05:09.700
As we make changes to the code we can upload the updated files to the life server replacing the old

05:09.700 --> 05:11.170
ones.

05:11.170 --> 05:17.790
Make sure though that you don't overwrite the config file on the remote server are the uploads folder

05:17.830 --> 05:24.560
either as the upload folder will contain any files uploaded to the lives server only.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.560
Using F T P is the simplest way to put your site live.

05:33.640 --> 05:38.750
There's also a protocol called S sgp that can be used in a similar way.

05:38.940 --> 05:41.780
I'll be it from the command line.

05:41.820 --> 05:48.120
There are many ways to put a site leive are deploying it from doing it are to magically when you store

05:48.120 --> 05:56.520
your code in a source code control repository like get hold of advanced tools like deployer and fink's

05:56.790 --> 05:58.230
for databases.
