There are some attributes that are common to most farm inputs that we can apply to change how our farms

00:10.600 --> 00:15.460
work first we can make a control read only.

00:15.460 --> 00:17.960
This means that the input is shown in a farm.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.960
But the user can't change its value.

00:23.230 --> 00:30.500
We make a control read only by adding the read only attribute to the input like that.

00:33.310 --> 00:42.430
In the browser the input doesn't look any different but now we can't change the value when the Far be

00:42.430 --> 00:46.420
submitted the value of the control is sent.

00:46.420 --> 00:50.850
However we can apply this attribute to most controls.

00:50.860 --> 00:52.940
Apart from the select control.

00:57.320 --> 01:02.390
We can also disable a control by adding the disabled attribute.

01:02.720 --> 01:08.870
For example we can disable an individual option in a select control like that

01:11.540 --> 01:16.030
and in the browser we can no longer select this option.

01:20.910 --> 01:26.470
Are we can disable the entire control like that.

01:29.630 --> 01:34.500
As they read only control we can't edit this control the all.

01:34.550 --> 01:39.530
But unlike a read only control when the farmer is submitted.

01:39.530 --> 01:44.020
The value of a disabled control is not sent to the server.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.340
Disabled controls I use this show on grade doubts like this.

01:48.470 --> 01:52.490
Although you can change that if you want to.

01:55.310 --> 02:03.890
Finally we can add the autofocus attributes to a control so that this control has the focus when the

02:03.890 --> 02:06.350
farm is first loaded.

02:09.250 --> 02:16.450
So now when we first visit this page the cursor is inside this input that has the autofocus attribute

02:16.450 --> 02:21.480
on it and we can start entering data straightaway.

02:21.730 --> 02:27.340
As with the rest of the team all we've seen so far on this course we haven't applied any styling to

02:27.340 --> 02:35.110
it yet with styles we can do things like line all these controls up at space between them and so on

02:35.810 --> 02:39.490
will look at how to do that later on in the course.
