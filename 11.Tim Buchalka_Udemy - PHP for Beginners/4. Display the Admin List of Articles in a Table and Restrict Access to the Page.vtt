Here in the abdomen index instead of showing the list of articles like this for reading.

00:11.870 --> 00:18.080
We want to display them in a list more suitable for administering them.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.840
So let's change this list to a table.

00:21.890 --> 00:27.920
We're still going to leap around a list of articles so we don't need to change the code or the tup that's

00:27.920 --> 00:35.710
retrieving this data from the database so we can keep this for each loop instead of the UN ardith list.

00:35.730 --> 00:48.860
So let's start a table then add a T head section with one column for now the article title far which

00:48.860 --> 00:51.870
will use a t h element.

00:52.820 --> 01:03.770
Then before the loop will start the T body element and after the loop will close that body element and

01:03.870 --> 01:06.440
also the table.

01:06.980 --> 01:11.870
We don't need 80 foot element so we can leave that out.

01:12.080 --> 01:19.850
Then inside the loop for each article we'll create a table row so we'll change this list element to

01:19.850 --> 01:21.510
a T R.

01:25.530 --> 01:31.880
Inside the Veau we needed t d element.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.690
We can remove the subheading element here and also this paragraph element and its contents as we don't

01:42.690 --> 01:45.270
want to display the article content.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.780
Only the title.

01:50.890 --> 01:53.050
In the browser it looks like this.

01:53.080 --> 02:01.390
A table containing the titles of all the articles will add some styling to the table later as we can

02:01.390 --> 02:02.910
see from this message.

02:02.980 --> 02:06.390
We're not currently logged in.

02:07.510 --> 02:15.070
Let's restrict access to this page as we did with the new article page by simply calling the require

02:15.100 --> 02:18.420
luggin method on the arth class at the top.

02:21.830 --> 02:27.530
Now when we're not logged in we can't access this page.

02:27.530 --> 02:30.320
If we do log in.

02:37.440 --> 02:42.150
Then we can access the page.

02:42.570 --> 02:48.790
Finally let's add a subheading before the data is displayed like that.

02:51.680 --> 02:56.070
And there we have our list of articles for administrators.
