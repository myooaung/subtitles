00:05.480 --> 00:08.750
We can now add categories to an article.

00:09.020 --> 00:17.240
But if we uncheck one of these boxes to remove an existing category from an article the categories aren't

00:17.240 --> 00:20.350
removed only new ones added.

00:24.710 --> 00:31.550
When we set the categories related to an article in addition to inserting new records into the article

00:31.550 --> 00:35.630
category table we also need to delete existing ones.

00:35.780 --> 00:43.550
If a category is removed from an article let's do this once we've inserted the new Ricardos in the set

00:43.550 --> 00:45.130
categories method.

00:47.450 --> 00:55.160
Let's start with some Eskew well containing a delete statements with the WHERE clause that matches the

00:55.220 --> 00:57.910
article idae to the current article.

00:59.370 --> 01:03.930
If the idees array passed into this function is empty.

01:03.930 --> 01:08.920
In other words the farm was submitted and no categories were selected.

01:09.360 --> 01:16.580
Then this esky well is enough to delete all the records in the article category table for this article

01:17.310 --> 01:18.880
so we can prepare it.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.820
And execute it.

01:23.600 --> 01:31.100
If the I.D. array isn't empty then we need to just delete any records where the category I.D. isn't

01:31.340 --> 01:33.220
in the array of I.D..

01:36.220 --> 01:44.190
We can use the not in operator for this so we need a list of the category I.D. separated by commas.

01:46.610 --> 01:49.420
So if the I.D. array isn't empty.

01:50.690 --> 01:56.890
First let's create an array of question mark characters which will be the place holders.

01:59.590 --> 02:07.360
The array fail method returns an array filled with a specified number of elements we need as many place

02:07.360 --> 02:14.650
holders as there are I.D. So we use the count method to get the number of elements in the idees array.

02:17.610 --> 02:26.280
So we can get an array of question marks like this assigning this array to the place holders variable.

02:26.790 --> 02:31.520
Then let's spend an additional condition to the you well.

02:32.900 --> 02:38.120
And we can add the question marks by calling implode as we did earlier.

02:39.380 --> 02:44.600
Which will join the question marks into a string separated by commas.

02:47.700 --> 02:54.400
Before we continue let's print out the ESC u l string so we can see what it looks like.

02:57.370 --> 03:05.860
If now I uncheck an existing category and submit the form there's the ESC U L statement with a condition

03:05.890 --> 03:12.090
on the article I do e and the not then operator followed by the place holders.

03:17.030 --> 03:23.610
Now we can delete this and once we've prepared the statement we need to bind the parameters.

03:27.080 --> 03:32.650
We can use the same method we're doing up here fa the insert statement.

03:37.580 --> 03:43.810
Looping around the category I.D. and binding the values based on the position in the string.

03:49.290 --> 03:51.130
Let's try that out.

03:51.150 --> 03:55.630
This article currently has three associated categories.

03:55.680 --> 04:00.040
If I uncheck some of them and submit the farm.

04:02.410 --> 04:10.750
The records in the join table are deleted so we can add and delete categories for an article and the

04:10.750 --> 04:16.240
set categories method will insert and delete records in the join table accordingly.
