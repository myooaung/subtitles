00:05.700 --> 00:13.350
When a file is uploaded the server saves the file to a temporary location on the server which is returned

00:13.380 --> 00:17.290
in the temp name elements of the array.

00:17.460 --> 00:23.490
This folder will be different depending on your operating system but which ever folder it is.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.030
It's not accessible through a browser.

00:27.030 --> 00:33.680
Additionally the operating systems temporary folders tend to be automatically emptied on a regular basis

00:33.850 --> 00:36.450
are when the server is rebooted.

00:36.450 --> 00:42.720
So once we have a file uploaded to the server we need to move it from this temporary folder and file

00:42.720 --> 00:46.290
name to a more permanent location.

00:49.100 --> 00:53.270
First let's create a folder in the web Root called uploads

00:56.510 --> 00:59.730
where we're going to store any upload it files.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.940
Then to move the uploaded file to this folder.

01:06.120 --> 01:12.580
We can use the move uploaded file function which exists specifically for this purpose.

01:15.800 --> 01:22.220
When we upload a file in addition to the path of the temporary file we also have the name of the original

01:22.220 --> 01:25.860
file in the name elements of the array.

01:28.850 --> 01:35.150
Let's create a variable with the path to the File we're going to move the uploaded file to.

01:35.390 --> 01:42.770
This is the uploads folder we just created which is one level up so we need the two dots followed by

01:42.770 --> 01:47.280
the name of the original file from the files array.

01:47.280 --> 01:56.690
Then we can call the move uploaded file function passing in the path of the temporary file and the destination

01:56.690 --> 01:57.830
path.

01:58.490 --> 02:00.990
This function returns a boolean result.

02:01.010 --> 02:04.890
So let's check that and print out a message.

02:04.940 --> 02:11.720
Now if it returns FALSE we'll throw an exception.

02:14.170 --> 02:17.470
Let's try uploading a valid image file.

02:20.990 --> 02:22.500
We get an error.

02:22.940 --> 02:29.440
Depending on the configuration of your computer this might have worked for you with no further changes.

02:29.630 --> 02:33.410
If you are using Windows for example this probably worked.

02:33.410 --> 02:37.600
If so then you can safely move on to the next video.

02:38.120 --> 02:43.330
The area we're getting here is to deal with permissions on the uploads folder.

02:43.790 --> 02:48.860
If you using Mac or Linux you might have got an error message like this.

02:48.860 --> 02:54.240
This is because the web server user doesn't have a right permission to the upload folder

02:57.530 --> 02:58.640
to fix this.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.670
First let's find out which user the web server is using.

03:03.020 --> 03:07.050
We can do that in the Apache configuration file.

03:11.140 --> 03:16.140
And here we can see that the web server runs as the demon user.

03:20.130 --> 03:25.770
In Linux you can change the group owner of the upload folder using this command.

03:28.470 --> 03:33.530
And then the web server user will have permission to write a file to that folder.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.960
On OS X on a Mac.

03:37.970 --> 03:40.520
Something similar might work are.

03:40.550 --> 03:45.890
You might need to grant read and write permissions on the parent folder of wherever you have your web

03:45.890 --> 03:47.530
route.

03:47.540 --> 03:53.460
It all depends on how your computer is configured and which web server you are using and so on.

03:53.540 --> 03:57.330
But if you do need help please don't hesitate to ask.

04:01.630 --> 04:05.530
Once the permissions are fixed if we got to load a valid file

04:08.230 --> 04:12.390
we get the message that the file was uploaded successfully.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.920
And there's the file in the uploads folder.
