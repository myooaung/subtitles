00:04.500 --> 00:09.300
In the article class in the get by idees method we just created.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.860
We're returning the rijkaard as an associative array.

00:13.380 --> 00:19.260
However now that we have an article class we can return an object of this class instead.

00:19.470 --> 00:26.520
We'll see next how this is useful when we're editing are deleting an article before we change this method

00:26.530 --> 00:28.030
to return an object.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.740
First let's add the articles properties to the class

00:34.800 --> 00:35.680
at the moment.

00:35.700 --> 00:42.720
Each article has four properties that come from the database table idae title content and published

00:42.720 --> 00:45.170
at.

00:45.510 --> 00:52.950
So let's add these as public properties of the class at the top and let's also add a p h.

00:52.950 --> 00:55.080
P duck comments for each one.

00:55.200 --> 01:04.500
The idae the title content and published at.

01:04.920 --> 01:13.510
Then let's change the get by idees method to return an object instead of an array.

01:13.860 --> 01:21.060
To do that we set the fetch mould of this statement object to fetch class using this set fetch mode

01:21.060 --> 01:22.030
method.

01:24.570 --> 01:32.140
So let's call this method on the statement object passing in the name of the class we want to be returned.

01:32.760 --> 01:39.650
Then we can remove the fetch a succ flag from the fetch method call.

01:39.730 --> 01:46.490
Now if the rijkaard with this idea is found an object of this article class will be returned.

01:47.100 --> 01:54.080
Let's not forget to change the comment to to reflect the change we just made.

01:56.010 --> 01:57.360
Let's give that a try.

01:57.390 --> 02:04.200
If I click on a link to go to the individual article page we now get an error saying we can't use an

02:04.290 --> 02:06.580
object as an array.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.460
They get by idees method.

02:11.470 --> 02:17.830
Now returns an object so we can't access it like an array like this.

02:17.830 --> 02:27.580
We need to access the object property instead like this will do the same for the other three lines where

02:27.580 --> 02:31.610
we're assessing the rijkaard to like that.

02:34.400 --> 02:40.670
Now when we run the code the error is gone and were accessing the articles properties as an object as

02:40.670 --> 02:42.040
opposed to an array.
