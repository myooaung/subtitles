00:05.560 --> 00:10.670
The settings in the configuration file our data that we need to keep private.

00:13.270 --> 00:16.760
If we try and view this file in a browser.

00:20.580 --> 00:28.050
All we see is a blank page as the P H P is executed before the file is sent to the browser and nothing

00:28.050 --> 00:31.290
is output.

00:31.590 --> 00:37.920
If there is a server misconfiguration though this file could in theory be downloaded by opening the

00:37.920 --> 00:40.820
u r l as I just did.

00:40.830 --> 00:48.060
Ideally we should put this file outside of the web root so it's not accessible in a browser at all.

00:48.210 --> 00:54.720
If you can do that and pass the path of the file into where it's required here then that's enough to

00:54.720 --> 00:56.620
secure the file.

00:56.730 --> 01:03.450
Sometimes this isn't possible though especially if you put your site life on a shared hosting account.

01:06.230 --> 01:13.310
With other files like all the files in the includes folder for example we restricted access to those

01:13.520 --> 01:21.810
using an HP access file containing this directive to deny all access to every file in the folder.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.100
To do the same for a single file.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.780
We need to use the files directive.

01:32.960 --> 01:39.530
Let's create a new file in the Root called ADT access.

01:43.270 --> 01:51.400
In here we add a files directive passing in the name of the config file.

01:51.850 --> 01:56.520
Then inside this we put the Deny from all instruction.

02:01.170 --> 02:04.200
Now if we try and access the conflict file.

02:06.910 --> 02:09.260
Access to that file is forbidden.

02:13.610 --> 02:21.410
In addition to specifying a single file name you can also put wildcards and file name patterns using

02:21.410 --> 02:28.980
regular expressions so you can use this to restrict access to as many different files as you need.
