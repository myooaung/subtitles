00:05.600 --> 00:12.740
When we assign more than one category to an article we execute a separate esky well insert statements

00:12.950 --> 00:17.060
for each rijkaard in the article category table.

00:17.450 --> 00:24.770
If we're inserting many Ricardos this would mean many trips to the database which could affect performance.

00:27.420 --> 00:35.070
As we learnt earlier on you can insert multiple records at once with one insert statement specifying

00:35.100 --> 00:38.950
multiple sets of values separated by commas.

00:41.800 --> 00:49.590
So let's change this method to insert all the records at once using a single insert statement.

00:49.600 --> 00:54.480
Let's start by removing the values from the Escuela statement.

00:55.400 --> 01:03.910
Then let's create an array for each set of values and add a loop for the cat to give each I.D. array.

01:05.730 --> 01:13.480
Inside this loop will create a string with each set of values just as before with the article.

01:13.490 --> 01:18.620
I'd first followed by a place holder for the category Heidi.

01:19.140 --> 01:24.960
I'll use a question mark instead of a name to place holder as we don't know how many place holders will

01:24.960 --> 01:30.680
need and with a pend this string to the array of values.

01:34.160 --> 01:41.900
Next we need to append each set of values to the ask you l string with each set of values separated

01:41.930 --> 01:43.020
by a comma.

01:45.960 --> 01:52.380
We can use the implode function for this to join the elements of the array together separating them

01:52.590 --> 01:53.750
with a comma.

01:55.530 --> 02:03.420
So let's call this function passing in a string with a comma to separate each set of values and the

02:03.420 --> 02:06.130
array of values strings.

02:07.430 --> 02:11.230
With append this to the existing contents of the esky Well string.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.150
Before we continue let's dump out the ASK U L string.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.800
So we can see what it looks like.

02:23.770 --> 02:28.370
If I select several categories and submit the farm.

02:29.140 --> 02:36.340
This is the esky Well string that we've generated a single insert statement with several sets of values

02:36.670 --> 02:38.750
separated by commas.

02:42.580 --> 02:48.410
Now we can delete this line and prepare the statement as before.

02:49.640 --> 02:55.070
Next we need to bind the category I.D. values to the place holders.

02:59.070 --> 03:05.910
As we using question marks instead of name to place holders when we bind the values instead of the place

03:05.910 --> 03:07.470
holder name.

03:07.470 --> 03:13.180
We can identify the place holder by the one indexed position of the parameter.

03:13.350 --> 03:16.100
That is the first parameter is one.

03:16.140 --> 03:19.120
The second is to and so on.

03:22.310 --> 03:29.690
In this for each loop we can also get the index of the array elements like that.

03:29.690 --> 03:32.200
This index will start from zero.

03:32.390 --> 03:34.890
The first array element is zero.

03:34.910 --> 03:38.100
The second one is 1 and so on.

03:38.630 --> 03:43.660
So when we bind the value we bind it to the index plus one.

03:45.490 --> 03:54.800
Then we can move the execute method to outside of the loop as we only have one statement to execute.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.050
Let's give that a try.

04:01.310 --> 04:05.280
If I select multiple categories and submit the farm.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.860
We can see that multiple records have been added.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.210
But in a single query set the database.
