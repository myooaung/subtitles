00:05.260 --> 00:07.370
Now we have our log in farm.

00:07.510 --> 00:08.780
We can log in.

00:09.850 --> 00:15.260
And we're redirected back to the index page when we log out though.

00:15.610 --> 00:17.690
No redirect occurs.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.260
To redirect.

00:21.280 --> 00:29.560
First will include the file where the redirect function is and then call the redirect function.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.220
After we've set the value in the session to false.

00:36.110 --> 00:45.360
So now we can log in when we enter the correct credentials and we redirected to the index page.

00:45.410 --> 00:52.200
Then when we log out we're logged out and redirected back to the index page as well.

00:56.190 --> 01:03.570
However although we set this value in the session to files the same session still exists during the

01:03.570 --> 01:05.350
time that the user was logged in.

01:05.460 --> 01:09.540
We could have stood by other values in the session which will still exist.

01:09.840 --> 01:20.340
So it's better when logging out to remove all sesshin values and completely destroy the current session.

01:20.340 --> 01:23.760
We can do this using the session destroy function.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.140
This destroys all the data in a session.

01:28.710 --> 01:35.490
So instead of setting this value to false Lets call the session destroy function instead.

01:35.580 --> 01:41.810
We still need to call session start so that the script knows we're working with the current session.

01:44.690 --> 01:54.410
So if we try that by first logging in then when we click log out all the values in the session our destroyed

01:54.800 --> 01:59.200
which includes the is logged in value so were locked out.

02:01.930 --> 02:06.060
We can improve this however in the documentation for the session.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.380
Destroy function.

02:08.380 --> 02:14.770
It tells us that just calling the session destroy function on its own just destroys the data it doesn't

02:14.770 --> 02:19.120
destroy the session itself to completely destroy the session.

02:19.360 --> 02:25.600
You need to set of the session variables and also unset the session cookie.

02:25.630 --> 02:28.820
You can do all that using this cold here.

02:32.890 --> 02:38.270
So let's add this code to our logout script like that.

02:38.830 --> 02:46.280
Basically what this does is first clear the sesshin global variable by setting it to a new array.

02:46.900 --> 02:51.700
Then we check to see if the session is using cookies which it does by default.

02:51.700 --> 02:56.670
And if so we use this code to remove the sesshin cookie in the browser.

02:56.950 --> 02:59.710
We'll learn more about cookies later on.

03:03.290 --> 03:04.850
So now if we log in again

03:07.640 --> 03:14.670
when we log out we redirected back to the index page and the session has been completely destroyed.
