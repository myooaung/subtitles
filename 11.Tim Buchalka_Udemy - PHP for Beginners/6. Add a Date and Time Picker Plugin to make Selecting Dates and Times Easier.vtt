00:05.470 --> 00:12.610
In addition to the Jake Query javascript framework and the bootstrap UI framework we can also add other

00:12.610 --> 00:17.340
client side code libraries that give us added functionality.

00:17.440 --> 00:25.390
For example when adding or editing an article in the published at date and time field even though it's

00:25.390 --> 00:32.040
a date time local input type in this browser we don't get any help.

00:32.200 --> 00:41.290
We have to specify it in the far months expected by the database year month day separated by hyphens

00:41.650 --> 00:46.280
and our minutes second separated by Colon's.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.500
This isn't very user friendly.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.240
You'll get many results.

00:52.260 --> 00:57.080
If you search for javascript date time pickers for example.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.550
Let's try this one.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.630
The files aren't available on a CDMA at the moment so to use this plug in.

01:04.630 --> 01:06.750
First we need to download it.

01:12.810 --> 01:21.390
Open the zip file and then in the build folder in here extract the minimized javascript file to our

01:21.390 --> 01:26.590
J s folder and the C Ss file to our SS folder.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.950
Then in the header.

01:30.950 --> 01:34.750
Include will add a reference to this SS file.

01:36.050 --> 01:41.110
And in the footer include a reference to the gess file.

01:43.530 --> 01:49.840
In the article form the published at input is a date time local type.

01:51.220 --> 01:58.450
In some browsers this gives you a date time picker but it's not supported in all browsers as were now

01:58.450 --> 02:01.120
going to use a date time plug in instead.

02:01.210 --> 02:06.410
Will remove this type to avoid conflicts with the plugin.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.400
The field already has an idea.

02:11.490 --> 02:16.430
So in our javascript file we can get the field using J query.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.230
And Karl the date time.

02:19.240 --> 02:26.080
Pick a method on it which is a new method that we made available when we added the plugins javascript

02:26.080 --> 02:27.910
file to our code.

02:31.860 --> 02:39.240
Now when we view the article from when I click on the publish stat field we get a selector where we

02:39.240 --> 02:44.670
can select the date and time instead of having to type them in.

02:44.680 --> 02:51.990
However when I submit the form we get a message from the server side validation saying the date and

02:51.990 --> 02:54.630
time is invalid.

02:54.660 --> 02:57.750
That's because this isn't quite the format we need.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.740
It has slushes instead of hyphens.

03:04.490 --> 03:09.090
One of the plugins many options is the date and time format.

03:13.060 --> 03:19.630
So when we call the date time pick a method on the input we can pass in the farm that we want which

03:19.630 --> 03:22.050
is the one expected on the server.

03:26.290 --> 03:34.360
So now when I click on the field and select a date and time there in the correct format and when I submit

03:34.390 --> 03:38.630
the form the server side validation passes.

03:42.530 --> 03:47.300
The plugin has many options for displaying the date and time in different formats.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.540
Hiding certain dates and so on.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.110
So I encourage you to explore them in the plugins documentation here.
