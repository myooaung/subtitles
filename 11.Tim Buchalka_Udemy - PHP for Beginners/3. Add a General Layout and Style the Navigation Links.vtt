WEBVTT

00:05.580 --> 00:07.620
Just by adding the beach traps.

00:07.660 --> 00:13.110
Yes we get some default styling to get the most out of bootstraps though.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.370
We need to change our asml.

00:17.520 --> 00:24.540
First we need to make sure we have the right dock type at the top of our it's mail and also these two

00:24.540 --> 00:26.830
metter elements in the head section.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.510
We've already got the doctype and the characters set metter element.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.560
We just need to add the viewport one.

00:38.870 --> 00:45.560
And this basically sets up the site to behave responsibly which means it will adapt to different browsers

00:45.800 --> 00:48.890
based on the screen size automatically.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.340
Next we need to add a container around our content.

00:56.440 --> 01:02.470
This adds some standard padding around the body content and is also necessary for some other elements

01:02.470 --> 01:04.620
to work.

01:04.630 --> 01:11.500
You can also divide up content into different columns using the powerful grid system if you like.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.660
We'll just add a container element for now.

01:17.060 --> 01:24.000
To add a container we just add a div element with the class of container at the start of the body.

01:25.500 --> 01:29.240
And we close this div at the end in the footer.

01:34.890 --> 01:38.800
In the browser the content is now in a now column.

01:39.090 --> 01:42.170
Next let's change these navigation links.

01:47.330 --> 01:53.750
We can style navigation elements by adding various classes to the unordered elements where we have our

01:53.750 --> 01:54.670
links.

01:57.640 --> 02:03.300
The list item elements and the links themselves.

02:07.310 --> 02:10.880
So here in our navigation links in the header.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.120
If we add all those crosses.

02:18.020 --> 02:24.290
Now the navigation links are shown horizontally and without the bullet point from the list.

02:29.470 --> 02:34.900
Pagination links are styled in much the same way by adding classes to the list.

02:35.020 --> 02:39.600
List Items and anchor elements in the pagination navigation.

02:43.930 --> 02:51.130
We've got our pagination links in the pagination script in the includes folder so if I add the classes

02:51.250 --> 02:53.580
as per the bootstrap documentation.

02:58.680 --> 03:07.410
Then the pagination links now have much nicer styling both in the main index and in the admin index

03:07.410 --> 03:08.460
too.
