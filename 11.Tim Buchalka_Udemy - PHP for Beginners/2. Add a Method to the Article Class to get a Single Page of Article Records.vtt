00:05.590 --> 00:12.730
In the index of our site and also in the abdomen index were currently displaying are all the articles

00:12.760 --> 00:16.120
in the database as we just saw.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.790
This isn't a good idea if we have a lot of articles in the database.

00:20.950 --> 00:23.810
So let's split them into pages instead.

00:27.270 --> 00:35.400
In the index page were calling the get all method on the article class which returns an array of all

00:35.400 --> 00:39.270
the article records in the database.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.990
We might need this method at some point.

00:42.060 --> 00:45.360
So instead of editing this one let's add a new method

00:48.210 --> 00:55.260
which we'll call the Get page that will return a single page of articles instead in here.

00:55.290 --> 00:56.670
We'll start with the same.

00:56.810 --> 01:04.860
Q L but will add limit and offset clauses to it with corresponding.

01:04.860 --> 01:13.890
Place holders for the values then as this is a prepared statement we'll prepare it then bind values

01:13.890 --> 01:22.570
father place holders and these two values will pass in as arguments to the method.

01:24.370 --> 01:32.940
Then will execute the statement and return an associative array of all the records.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.320
And finally will add a p-h p doc.

01:36.340 --> 01:39.240
Comments block to the method.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.050
Then in the index page instead of calling.

01:45.050 --> 01:49.180
Get are all lets call the Get page method.

01:49.700 --> 01:55.300
Passing in values for the limit and offset this argument.

01:55.310 --> 02:00.900
The limit is the number of articles per page which will set to 4.

02:01.160 --> 02:08.310
The second argument is the offset which will start at zero to get the first page.

02:11.690 --> 02:12.630
In the browser.

02:12.650 --> 02:17.670
Now were shown only the first four records instead of all of them.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.650
If we change the offset to four.

02:26.130 --> 02:29.790
Then we see the second page of Ricardos.

02:31.740 --> 02:34.580
Changing the offset to date.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.330
We see page 3 and so on.
