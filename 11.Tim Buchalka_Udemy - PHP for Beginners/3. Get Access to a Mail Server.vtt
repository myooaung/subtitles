00:05.550 --> 00:08.390
In order to send email from HP.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.350
First you need access to a mail server.

00:13.140 --> 00:21.570
As we learnt early on in this course a web server sends our service web pages so to have a website you

00:21.570 --> 00:24.540
need a web server to serve the pages.

00:25.970 --> 00:34.320
A mail server sends emails an email message is sent to the server and the server sends that message

00:34.470 --> 00:38.320
to the recipient's inbox so to send an email.

00:38.370 --> 00:40.310
You need a mail server.

00:44.840 --> 00:56.930
Mail servers are also referred to as S M T P servers S M T P is to mail servers what H T T P is to websites.

00:56.930 --> 00:58.200
S m p r.

00:58.220 --> 01:04.330
Simple mail transfer protocol is the protocol used to send emails.

01:06.730 --> 01:10.530
So how do we get access to a mail server.

01:10.600 --> 01:17.810
You can configure axe samp for example with a mail server so that you can send email using local host.

01:18.010 --> 01:22.120
But I wouldn't recommend it as it can be difficult to set up.

01:22.980 --> 01:29.430
If you have a web mail account like g mail for example then you can use the mail server provided with

01:29.430 --> 01:30.080
that.

01:31.180 --> 01:32.080
With G mail.

01:32.170 --> 01:34.900
The address of the mail server is s empty.

01:34.910 --> 01:37.640
P g mail dot com.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.060
Be aware though that with g mail.

01:45.220 --> 01:52.280
In order to send email from a script you need to allow less secure apps to access your account by following

01:52.280 --> 01:53.700
the instructions here.

01:57.360 --> 02:06.030
Alternatively you can sign up for an account on an email service like mail go in mail trap.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.180
Amazon for example.

02:08.580 --> 02:16.200
There are many services available if you have a web hosting accounts then that probably includes access

02:16.410 --> 02:18.020
to email server too.

02:22.870 --> 02:27.930
To use a mail server you need three basic pieces of data.

02:28.330 --> 02:35.830
The address of the server or the host which is normally the mail or assignment P subdomain of the main

02:35.830 --> 02:37.430
domain.

02:38.020 --> 02:45.010
The user name which is most often the email address of the account you are going to use and the password

02:45.790 --> 02:48.490
you'll get these from your service provider.
