We've currently got one page index up HP and this is showing a list of all the articles in the database.

00:13.040 --> 00:19.090
Let's add another page so that we can view a single article in more detail.

00:21.430 --> 00:25.890
We'll start by making a copy of a duplicate of the index stuck P. H.

00:25.990 --> 00:30.430
Page and calling it Article duckpin HP.

00:33.010 --> 00:40.120
So for a single article instead of selecting all of them like this we want just one.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.390
How do we select just one rijkaard.

00:45.570 --> 00:50.600
We use the primary key that we added earlier to each record.

00:54.710 --> 01:01.370
So here in the esky well instead of selecting all the records like this we need to add a where clause

01:01.670 --> 01:07.200
so that we restrict the resultset to just one record.

01:07.390 --> 01:14.990
Well hard cold in ideas in here for now just to get it working without doing anything else.

01:14.990 --> 01:23.870
If we look at this in a browser we get one record and note we're looking at the article doppie HP page

01:23.870 --> 01:25.890
here in the address bar.

01:29.540 --> 01:32.520
We're only expecting one record though.

01:32.600 --> 01:40.730
So instead of using my escudo life fetch all and then looping around the resultset in a loop we want

01:40.730 --> 01:42.950
to get just one row.

01:46.360 --> 01:54.520
My esky Well I fetch a sock function fetches a single roll from the resultset as an associative array

01:54.940 --> 01:58.590
so that the indexes of the array will be the column names.

02:01.660 --> 02:06.540
So let's change this call here to get a single article instead.

02:08.390 --> 02:17.840
Passing in the result set up jet and changing the variable to a singular name then will have a single

02:17.840 --> 02:27.400
array in this variable so we can remove this loop and the list elements here like that.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.820
If there are no rows in the result set.

02:35.140 --> 02:42.040
In other words there is no record with the idea that we supplied then this function returns no.

02:45.350 --> 02:53.480
So let's change this if statement so that if the article variable is null we can say that the article

02:53.660 --> 02:58.470
wasn't found like that.

02:58.550 --> 03:03.730
So now in the browser we see the individual article.

03:07.910 --> 03:19.460
If we change the idae in the web class to one that doesn't exist like that then in the browser we get

03:19.460 --> 03:22.570
the article not found message as expected.
