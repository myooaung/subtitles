00:04.360 --> 00:11.260
We just removed some repeated code by extracting it out into three separate files one for the database

00:11.260 --> 00:17.100
connection code one for the start of the astm Owl and one for the end.

00:17.170 --> 00:21.350
Right now these files are all in the root folder of our site.

00:21.550 --> 00:28.850
So let's start arguing using our code a bit better by putting these files in their own folder.

00:28.900 --> 00:33.430
It's common to put included files in a folder called includes.

00:33.580 --> 00:35.690
So that's what we'll call it.

00:36.190 --> 00:40.610
Then we can simply move the files including into this folder.

00:44.550 --> 00:45.570
Like that.

00:48.340 --> 00:56.830
Next we need to change our required statements to include this new folder here for the database.

00:56.830 --> 01:03.110
Include here for the header include.

01:03.400 --> 01:10.200
And down here for the footer in articles up here.

01:10.230 --> 01:18.040
P will do the same thing here at the top and the same for the header.

01:20.530 --> 01:22.530
And the footer.

01:26.850 --> 01:31.400
In a browser nothing has changed and it works just as before.

01:35.360 --> 01:41.510
Now that we've got these files in a separate folder we can add some security to our site.

01:41.930 --> 01:47.900
These files just like files in the route are accessible in a web browser.

01:50.590 --> 01:55.730
If I try to go to includes slashed databased up P 8 p.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.760
I get an empty page.

02:02.490 --> 02:09.540
This is because the file contains nothing but P HP and therefore this is executed before it's sent to

02:09.540 --> 02:10.690
the browser.

02:11.190 --> 02:19.060
However it's possible that a server misconfiguration could stop HP from working if this happened.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.790
The cold would be sent to the browser.

02:21.930 --> 02:24.130
Let me show you what I mean.

02:26.560 --> 02:32.170
I've just gone and replicated a problem with the server which could result from someone not managing

02:32.170 --> 02:36.210
the server properly and I've turned HP off.

02:36.220 --> 02:41.830
Now this is an unlikely scenario but it doesn't hurt to be aware of it and protect yourself against

02:41.830 --> 02:42.290
it.

02:42.360 --> 02:47.270
You can if I try and access the database file again.

02:48.840 --> 02:53.380
Instead of a blank page the browser downloads it.

02:57.120 --> 03:03.870
And when I open it we can see the entire contents of the script including our database password.

03:07.480 --> 03:14.270
To fix this we can deny access to this directory as we using the Apache Web Server.

03:14.380 --> 03:21.340
We can create a special file called an 8 access file which allows us to configure the web server on

03:21.340 --> 03:23.860
a per directory basis.

03:26.330 --> 03:33.920
So let's create an H to access file in the includes folder and it has to be called exactly that dot

03:34.390 --> 03:41.360
h.t. Access and then in here will enter the configuration setting.

03:41.930 --> 03:49.240
Denied from all which basically says denied access to files in this folder from any computer.

03:52.630 --> 03:59.800
Now if we try and access the database file in a browser we get an access forbidden message.

03:59.860 --> 04:06.900
This is an optional step but it doesn't hurt to have a little bit of extra security just in case.

04:09.130 --> 04:11.440
And this doesn't affect our website.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.630
It works as before.

04:16.460 --> 04:21.100
This solution is based on the Apache Web server which is what you are using.

04:21.110 --> 04:27.710
If you installed X amp but if you're using a different web server and want to know how to do this please

04:27.800 --> 04:28.650
let me know.
