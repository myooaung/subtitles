00:05.590 --> 00:12.220
Now that we can successfully upload a file for an individual article we can associate the file name

00:12.280 --> 00:15.030
with the article rijkaard in the database.

00:17.820 --> 00:21.060
Let's add a new column to the article table.

00:21.060 --> 00:27.460
After they published at column at the end we'll call it image file.

00:28.080 --> 00:36.090
And as the file name is a string We'll set the type as varchar with a length of two hundred characters.

00:36.090 --> 00:40.000
File names could be longer than this but it's unlikely.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.780
And later on will restrict the length of the file name in the code.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.450
We want the default to be NULL which means the null attribute needs to be checked.

00:50.550 --> 00:55.450
Our click save and there is the new column.

00:59.050 --> 01:00.950
Then in the article class.

01:00.970 --> 01:06.390
First let's add a property for this new field.

01:06.400 --> 01:14.170
Then at the end of the script Let's add a method to update this field.

01:14.530 --> 01:21.160
This won't be a static method as it's a method will call on an article object and will pass in the database

01:21.160 --> 01:26.690
connection and the file name first let's add the s keywell.

01:28.670 --> 01:33.440
Containing place holders file the image file and I columns.

01:34.100 --> 01:45.890
Then we'll prepare it bind the values for the I.D. and image file and finally execute it returning the

01:45.950 --> 01:49.990
execute methods boolean return value.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.780
Let's add a p p Doug comment.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.200
And then in the admen edit article image script.

01:59.340 --> 02:05.440
First let's restrict the length of the file name to two hundred characters just in case it's longer.

02:05.610 --> 02:08.980
Will do this after we've sanitized the file name.

02:11.180 --> 02:18.290
The substring function returns part of a string but as the file name could contain utf Eight characters

02:18.680 --> 02:23.250
will use the M.B substring function instead which does the same thing.

02:23.330 --> 02:26.170
But it's safe for utf Eight strings.

02:28.680 --> 02:32.940
So we'll call this method on the base variable.

02:32.940 --> 02:40.260
Getting the part of the string from start which is character 0 to 200 characters.

02:42.230 --> 02:51.530
Then when we've uploaded the file successfully we can call the new method in the article class passing

02:51.530 --> 02:54.160
in the file name that we saved it with.

02:54.710 --> 03:02.040
Then if this returns true we'll redirect to the admin articles show page.

03:07.010 --> 03:08.920
Let's give that a try.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.430
I'll not load an image.

03:14.040 --> 03:18.180
And were redirected back to the admin article show page.

03:20.930 --> 03:26.760
And in the rijkaard in the database the file name has been saved to the image file column.
