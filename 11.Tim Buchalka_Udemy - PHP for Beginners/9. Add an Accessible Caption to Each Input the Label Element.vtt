00:04.460 --> 00:07.500
Here we have a farm with several controls.

00:07.810 --> 00:16.820
A single line text input text area a check box and some radio buttons and there's a simple piece of

00:16.820 --> 00:19.780
text describing each one.

00:23.410 --> 00:25.370
In the browser it looks like this.

00:25.480 --> 00:31.370
And we can enter values and select options as expected.

00:35.210 --> 00:41.810
At the moment the text describing each control is just that same text.

00:42.230 --> 00:50.000
There's a better way to do this however using a label element label elements are used to describe form

00:50.060 --> 00:52.250
input controls.

00:54.120 --> 00:59.520
So let's wrap this text in a label element like that.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.630
In the browser nothing has changed.

01:07.980 --> 01:14.620
To use a label element properly we need to associate it with a form control.

01:14.700 --> 01:22.200
We do this by first assigning of value to the attribute of the input elements the I.D. attribute is

01:22.200 --> 01:30.450
used to uniquely identify an element in an estimate document any elements can have an IP attribute.

01:30.630 --> 01:34.860
But it has to have a unique value within the page.

01:35.430 --> 01:41.690
Then we add a value for the FA attributes to the label that matches this idae.

01:42.060 --> 01:48.810
So the FA attribute on the label links the label to the input element that has the same value for the

01:48.810 --> 01:49.900
idea.

01:52.970 --> 01:56.100
So let's do that with the first input on our farm.

01:56.210 --> 02:05.630
First add an I.D. to the input then a FA attribute to the label that matches it.

02:08.240 --> 02:15.680
In the browser it doesn't look any different but if I click on the label it puts the focus on the associated

02:15.680 --> 02:21.160
control so the cursor is there and I can enter text into the control.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.970
So this is better for usability.

02:24.380 --> 02:30.530
There's also a bigger advantage the assistive technologies like screen reader software will use the

02:30.530 --> 02:33.170
label to describe the control.

02:33.260 --> 02:40.770
So it's much better for accessibility to use labels on your farms.

02:40.880 --> 02:48.230
It's particularly important to use labels for radio buttons and check boxes as we saw previously the

02:48.230 --> 02:57.150
clickable area of a check box our radio button is really small and therefore hard to select.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.090
We can fix this with a label.

03:02.540 --> 03:14.210
Let's give this checkbox element an idea then wrap this text in a label that has a matching four attribute.

03:17.620 --> 03:23.740
Now in the browser in addition to being able to click on the checkbox itself we can click on the label

03:24.460 --> 03:27.720
and it will toggle the checkbox on and off.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.100
Much easier to use.

03:32.620 --> 03:35.210
Let's do the same for the radio buttons.

03:35.330 --> 03:40.600
First let's add a unique I.D. to each input element.

03:40.600 --> 03:45.100
Remembering that this value has to be unique within the page.

03:45.250 --> 03:53.850
Then we'll wrap the text in label elements with far attributes that match these idees.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.520
Now in the browser we can click the text next to each radio button to select that option.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.760
Far check boxes and radio buttons.

04:10.770 --> 04:20.260
There's an alternative way to use labels instead of having the input element and label elements separate.

04:20.310 --> 04:27.150
You can wrap the input and the label text inside the label tag like this.

04:27.150 --> 04:33.930
Doing it this way means you dont need an I.D. attribute on the check box and a far attributes on the

04:33.930 --> 04:35.370
label.

04:35.430 --> 04:41.850
This is a perfectly valid way of using the label element and it does save you from having to add a unique

04:41.850 --> 04:44.910
I.D. to each checkbox.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.800
In the browser.

04:48.990 --> 04:51.730
It works in exactly the same way.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.140
We can do the same.

04:57.150 --> 05:06.060
Father radio buttons change the label to wrap the inputs and doing it this way we can get rid of the

05:06.060 --> 05:09.110
idea that you buttes the input elements.

05:12.880 --> 05:20.610
Again in the browser it works in the same way.

05:21.390 --> 05:25.200
Either method is valid whichever you prefer.

05:25.200 --> 05:31.430
Note however that including the inputs inside a label like this is only a valid technique for check

05:31.430 --> 05:33.650
boxes and radio buttons.
