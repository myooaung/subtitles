00:05.230 --> 00:06.290
In this video.

00:06.290 --> 00:09.930
I'll introduce you to variables in pig HP.

00:10.390 --> 00:14.970
First let's make a change to our code at the moment.

00:14.980 --> 00:18.850
We just have one line of code that's printing out this message.

00:19.300 --> 00:24.910
So above this line let's add another line that says message

00:27.220 --> 00:30.070
equals.

00:30.590 --> 00:33.430
Again.

00:35.290 --> 00:38.610
We just created a variable called message.

00:38.890 --> 00:42.430
I'll explain this in more detail in a moment.

00:42.430 --> 00:50.930
Then let's change our echo instruction to use this variable instead of the message we had earlier.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.100
We'll save this file.

00:58.490 --> 01:04.290
Now if we open the file in a browser by going to a local host slash hell out up here.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.350
P we see the message has changed.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.360
It now says hello again.

01:14.110 --> 01:16.270
So what did we just do.

01:16.330 --> 01:19.460
We just added a variable variables.

01:19.480 --> 01:27.790
I used to store information for the program to use think of variables simply as containers that hold

01:27.850 --> 01:29.740
some information.

01:29.740 --> 01:36.700
Once you create a variable in your code you can use the data contained in that variable throughout the

01:36.700 --> 01:43.690
rest of your program variables also allow us to label data with a descriptive name sir.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.000
Our code is easier to understand.

01:49.850 --> 01:52.570
To create a variable in p p.

01:52.580 --> 02:02.020
You just need to write its name followed by a space in equals sign another space and then its value.

02:02.030 --> 02:10.760
So here we've created a variable called message and assigned the value of helo again to it.

02:10.910 --> 02:16.830
And don't forget the semicolon that we have to use at the end of each instruction.

02:17.090 --> 02:20.950
We then use that variable in the echo statement.

02:21.770 --> 02:28.210
When this line of code is executed on the web server the echo statement takes the value of this variable.

02:28.250 --> 02:32.350
Hello again and prints it out to the web browser.

02:36.040 --> 02:43.540
Variables in P HP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable.

02:43.980 --> 02:52.120
You can use a mixture of lower case and upper case letters numbers and underscores father name.

02:53.130 --> 02:58.190
So these are valid examples of variables.

02:58.200 --> 03:03.970
This one however is invalid as it contains a hyphen which isn't allowed.

03:06.370 --> 03:09.350
You can call variables whatever you want.

03:09.350 --> 03:16.580
However it's a good idea to always call them something meaningful so it makes your code easier to understand.

03:17.110 --> 03:23.740
So for example let's say you have a variable in your code that contains an error message instead of

03:23.740 --> 03:26.890
a variable called X like this.

03:26.890 --> 03:32.850
Your code is easier to understand if you call the variable error message like this.

03:33.220 --> 03:39.490
If you use this variable later on in your code it's more obvious to whoever is reading the code which

03:39.490 --> 03:40.610
could be you.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.350
What the variable contains.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.240
P HP is also case sensitive.

03:49.660 --> 03:58.270
So this variable which begins with a lower case M is a different variable to this one which begins with

03:58.270 --> 04:00.430
an upper case.

04:02.350 --> 04:08.530
Although you can name your variables whatever you want based on these rules I recommend always using

04:08.530 --> 04:14.540
all lower case and separating words with underscores like these.
