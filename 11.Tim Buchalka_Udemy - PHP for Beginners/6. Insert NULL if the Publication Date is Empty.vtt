00:05.100 --> 00:09.370
Both the title and content fields in our article table are required.

00:09.590 --> 00:15.230
And because of the validation we just added We can't answer to New rijkaard Unless we supply a value

00:15.230 --> 00:17.180
for these fields.

00:17.220 --> 00:25.790
However if we leave the publication date blank when we submit the farm a rijkaard is inserted into the

00:25.790 --> 00:26.960
database.

00:29.210 --> 00:35.690
The publication date however is set to all zeros which is not what we want as this field can be.

00:35.690 --> 00:38.200
No we want this to be set to know.

00:38.210 --> 00:41.130
If we dont supply a value in the farm.

00:44.440 --> 00:50.350
Its at this point here when we call the bind Paran function that the values are being bound into the

00:50.350 --> 00:53.330
place holders in the rescue L statement.

00:53.440 --> 01:02.590
So before we do this let's check to see that the published at variable is empty and if it is we'll set

01:02.590 --> 01:03.690
it to null.

01:05.570 --> 01:09.290
There isn't a type for nold when we bind this value to the ESC.

01:09.290 --> 01:16.820
Well the database server handles this are to magically So it's safe to leave this as an S flustering.

01:19.810 --> 01:25.890
Let's try inserting a rijkaard again leaving the publication date blank.

01:30.410 --> 01:36.250
And the rijkaard has been successfully inserted with the publication date set to NULL.
