After inserting a new article we redirect to the individual article page using this cold here.

00:13.340 --> 00:15.770
We're doing exactly the same thing here.

00:15.980 --> 00:22.750
When we update an existing article as we know repeating ourselves in code isn't a good idea.

00:22.970 --> 00:30.680
So let's extract this out into a function let's create a new file in the includes folder and Kallet

00:31.000 --> 00:32.570
u r l e p h.

00:32.570 --> 00:33.750
P.

00:34.430 --> 00:42.460
Let's create a new function called redirect that takes an argument of the path we're redirecting to.

00:45.590 --> 00:48.960
Let's copy the code were using to redirect.

00:51.740 --> 00:54.940
And paste this inside out a new function.

00:58.050 --> 01:06.430
Let's take the hard coded path out of here and replace it with the value of the argument.

01:06.450 --> 01:13.540
Finally let's add a p-h pickup comment block to describe the function.

01:13.590 --> 01:16.660
It's argument and its return value.

01:17.040 --> 01:24.910
If a function doesn't return anything like this one then we put void as its return value in the comment.

01:28.280 --> 01:33.880
Now in the new article script we can require this new file.

01:36.290 --> 01:43.750
Then we can replace this redirect code here with a call to the new function.

01:48.360 --> 01:55.400
Passing in the path of the file we want to redirect to including the query string containing the idae.

01:57.420 --> 02:04.280
Let's do the same in the edit article script first requiring the new file.

02:05.040 --> 02:10.010
Here at the top and then replacing the redirect code.

02:13.310 --> 02:17.260
With a call to the new function like that.

02:19.330 --> 02:20.770
Let's give that a try.

02:20.980 --> 02:28.370
If I enter some data and submit the farm to create a new article will it be directed as before.

02:28.660 --> 02:38.500
If we edit this article and change it field when we submit the farm will also redirected as expected

02:39.520 --> 02:45.400
redirecting to another u r l is something that we need to do quite often when working with the database

02:45.700 --> 02:49.620
so it's useful to have a generic function we can call to do that.
