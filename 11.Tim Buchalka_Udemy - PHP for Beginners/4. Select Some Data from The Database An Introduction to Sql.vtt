00:05.250 --> 00:11.040
Now that we've got some data in our database how do we access this data.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.030
The standard way to do it is to use structured query language.

00:15.080 --> 00:15.510
S.

00:15.580 --> 00:23.220
Well we can write statements in ask you l that will allow us to perform various operations on the data

00:23.280 --> 00:33.440
in the database from selecting data inserting new records are updating existing ones.

00:33.570 --> 00:40.470
Let's begin with selecting some data for that we use the select statement.

00:40.470 --> 00:47.820
First we start with the word select followed by the names of the columns we want then from followed

00:47.850 --> 00:49.660
by the table name.

00:49.890 --> 00:56.550
If you want to select all the columns then you can say select asterisk are select star.

00:56.550 --> 01:02.700
Instead we end the ESC U L statement with a semicolon.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.060
Note that ESC U L is case insensitive.

01:06.150 --> 01:14.190
But it's common practice to write kumail key words like select and from using uppercase and names of

01:14.190 --> 01:15.870
tables and columns.

01:15.870 --> 01:23.980
In lower case using the select statement is commonly referred to as an S Q L query.

01:27.270 --> 01:29.320
Let's try this out.

01:29.430 --> 01:34.010
Here we have our articles table and I have added several rijkaard to it.

01:34.110 --> 01:36.580
So we've got some data to play with.

01:37.230 --> 01:45.180
If we click on the esky well Tab we can enter some ESC U L statement.

01:45.210 --> 01:51.700
Let's start by selecting all the fields from our article table.

01:51.810 --> 01:57.860
If we run this by clicking the go button we get all the records.

01:58.260 --> 02:01.730
This is known as the result set.

02:01.780 --> 02:05.360
Let's change it to just select the title.

02:12.910 --> 02:20.370
And when we run this now in our resultset we just have the titles.

02:23.660 --> 02:31.070
Instead of selecting the entire table we can use the where clause to filter the Ricardos passing in

02:31.070 --> 02:34.520
a condition that records have to match.

02:37.490 --> 02:47.330
Let's try selecting the rijkaard where the idea is to note the comparison operator is different to the

02:47.330 --> 02:49.440
one we used in p p.

02:49.850 --> 02:50.740
Remember in P.

02:50.810 --> 02:59.820
P to compare two values we used to equal signs in s q L we use just one like this.

03:00.320 --> 03:07.550
When we run this the resultset contains just one record.

03:07.550 --> 03:14.450
This is why we added a primary key using this where clause on the idees column like this means that

03:14.450 --> 03:18.490
we can select one individual record from the database.

03:20.040 --> 03:26.700
It's also possible to have an empty resultset for example if we use a where clause that doesn't match

03:26.730 --> 03:30.810
any records.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.740
We don't get any data.

03:41.170 --> 03:44.880
We can also compare columns that contain strings.

03:45.070 --> 03:56.650
If we look at the data in our table we can see that there are two records with the same title.

03:58.200 --> 04:06.750
If we query the database for all records that contain this title using this where clause then when we

04:06.750 --> 04:11.670
run this we get those two roles.

04:11.670 --> 04:19.140
Note that if we're comparing to a string we need to close it in single quotes like this.

04:19.290 --> 04:26.070
Incidentally this is where the database colation that we set when we created the database is used when

04:26.070 --> 04:29.230
strings are being compared.

04:32.980 --> 04:38.440
In addition to equals there are other comparison operators we can use just like in P H.

04:38.440 --> 04:38.820
P

04:41.590 --> 04:47.650
For example we can change the query we just wrote to get all the roles where the title doesn't equal

04:47.650 --> 04:51.120
this by using the not equal operator.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.380
Like that.

04:58.420 --> 05:07.000
We can also combined where clase is using and and are just like we can combine comparison operators

05:07.270 --> 05:08.200
in P HP

05:11.290 --> 05:19.320
so we can add aware class to this query to get all the roles where the title is this are.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.560
The title is this.

05:25.560 --> 05:29.840
One more thing I want to mention is whitespace.

05:32.850 --> 05:40.630
You well like P HP and H to email doesn't care about whitespace so you can have the query all on one

05:40.630 --> 05:42.440
line like this.

05:42.850 --> 05:48.130
Or you could put it on different lines like this.

05:52.790 --> 05:58.350
It's quite common to do this with more complex queries as they're easier to understand.
