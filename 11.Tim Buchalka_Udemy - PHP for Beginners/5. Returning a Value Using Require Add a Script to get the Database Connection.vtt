We were just able to remove lots of required statements by adding an artful loader.

00:11.770 --> 00:18.190
Another place where we're repeating ourselves is with the database in several scripts we're creating

00:18.190 --> 00:26.740
a database object and then calling the get com method on that object to get the database connection.

00:26.860 --> 00:34.240
However we don't want to put this in the init script which we're calling on every page as we don't always

00:34.240 --> 00:42.520
want to connect to the database unless a farm has been submitted like here in the luggin script and

00:42.520 --> 00:50.500
in some scripts like the logout script we don't need the database connection at all.

00:50.500 --> 01:03.820
So instead let's copy this code and create a new file in the includes folder called dbe up HP and place

01:03.820 --> 01:08.960
this code in there as we saw earlier though.

01:08.980 --> 01:15.820
We don't want to create a variable in an include file that were later going to use in a script that

01:15.820 --> 01:21.010
we include this file in as our coalwood will be difficult to follow.

01:23.920 --> 01:31.430
What we can do though is return a value from a required file when it's loaded using the require include

01:31.450 --> 01:36.310
statement just like we do in a function.

01:36.520 --> 01:44.650
So instead of assigning this connection object to a variable Let's return it like that.

01:44.650 --> 01:52.990
Then in the index page we can replace these two lines with it require of the new file we just created.

01:53.650 --> 02:02.440
And as we returning the connection object from this require we can assign it to a variable like that.

02:05.240 --> 02:10.220
And when we look at the index page in the browser it still works as before.

02:12.470 --> 02:17.960
Let's do the same in the other scripts where we're using the database first.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.610
In the article script.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.380
The edit articles script

02:29.930 --> 02:34.400
and the delete articles script.

02:36.110 --> 02:43.620
Then in the new article script we don't need the database connection until the farm is submitted.

02:43.760 --> 02:48.620
So the database connection lines we need to replace our inside this big block

02:52.760 --> 02:57.040
and it's the same for the logon script here.

03:01.980 --> 03:04.870
Let's make sure everything still works.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.940
Let's log in.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.960
Then we'll create a new article.

03:15.770 --> 03:19.360
We'll edit it.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.220
Delete it.

03:24.890 --> 03:35.180
And finally lock out everything is working as before but now we've removed some repeated code by creating

03:35.180 --> 03:39.950
the database connection in a separate file.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.100
We'll see later on.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.560
How's this helps us when deploying our code to a live web server.
