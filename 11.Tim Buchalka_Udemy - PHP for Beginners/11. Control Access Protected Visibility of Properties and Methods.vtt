00:04.480 --> 00:09.610
Nearly a year on we learnt about visibility of properties and methods.

00:09.610 --> 00:16.150
We can make them public which means we can access them from outside the class are private which means

00:16.150 --> 00:17.320
we can't.

00:17.770 --> 00:26.080
As an example let's add a new public property to the Item class called cold that has a value of one

00:26.080 --> 00:37.060
two three four for instance as it's a public property we can access it's value when we have an object

00:37.150 --> 00:38.690
of this class.

00:41.140 --> 00:44.520
And when we run this cold we get the value of the property.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.870
Print it out.

00:48.170 --> 00:52.260
If I make this property privat like that.

00:54.700 --> 01:01.530
When we in the cold again we get an error message saying we can't access the private property as expected.

01:04.050 --> 01:08.900
Let's change this property back to public for now.

01:09.450 --> 01:17.660
In addition to this item class we've also got the book class which is a child of the Item class.

01:17.670 --> 01:24.280
Let's add a new method to this class that simply returns the value of the property.

01:24.300 --> 01:34.040
We just added this property will be inherited from the parent Item class in our test script.

01:34.570 --> 01:37.790
Let's comment out this line for now.

01:38.550 --> 01:46.170
Then create a book object and Carl the new method like that.

01:48.500 --> 01:52.460
When we run this we see the results of the method call printed out

01:55.550 --> 01:56.900
in the Item class.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.920
Let's make this property private again.

02:03.970 --> 02:09.840
And now when we run the code we get an error saying the property is undefined.

02:12.130 --> 02:18.940
This is because private properties and methods are only accessible inside this class.

02:19.060 --> 02:22.860
They are not accessible in child classes.

02:23.350 --> 02:31.210
But what if we want to do that make this property inaccessible from outside the class but also be able

02:31.210 --> 02:33.540
to access it inside methods.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.820
In child classes.

02:38.320 --> 02:46.010
In addition to public and private there's a third type of visibility called protected.

02:48.860 --> 02:54.110
If we change this property of the Item class to be protected like that

02:56.780 --> 03:01.190
now when we run the code we don't get an error.

03:02.630 --> 03:11.150
What's more if I remove the comments from this line where we're accessing the property directly when

03:11.150 --> 03:20.360
we run this code we get an error saying we can't access a protected property so a protected property

03:20.420 --> 03:23.870
isn't accessible from outside the class.

03:23.870 --> 03:30.300
But it is accessible inside methods in subclasses.

03:33.630 --> 03:39.540
So public visibility is used to make a property our method available from anywhere.

03:39.540 --> 03:44.220
The current class any subclasses and instances of the object

03:46.830 --> 03:53.490
private visibility is used to make a property a method available in its own class only and protected

03:53.490 --> 04:01.100
visibility is used to make a property method available only from inside the class and any child classes.
