Creating the success for an entire site could be quite time consuming.

00:11.160 --> 00:17.700
It would also require a lot of testing out different browsers and indeed different versions of the same

00:17.700 --> 00:18.590
browser.

00:18.630 --> 00:23.820
I'll have slight differences in how age to email and see assess our rendered.

00:26.660 --> 00:35.630
An alternative is to use a C S s framework a framework is a library of prebuilt C S S stylesheets by

00:35.630 --> 00:42.540
including the stylesheets in the next to email page and adding relevant classes to the HDMI elements.

00:42.590 --> 00:49.030
You can style an entire site without writing any C S S at all if you don't want to.

00:49.550 --> 00:54.970
Plus many of these frameworks come with easy to use user interface are you.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.020
Elements that can make your site easier to use.

01:02.070 --> 01:09.690
Frameworks of note include a semantic UI and you like it and if you want something with a small file

01:09.690 --> 01:13.520
size there are lightweight frameworks like mg.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.070
The most popular client side UI framework though is bootstrap.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.960
So that's what we'll be using.

01:22.140 --> 01:27.300
As with Jake Query there are two ways to add bootstrap to your code.

01:27.300 --> 01:35.310
The first is to download it save the SS With you it's temel files and add a link element that refers

01:35.310 --> 01:36.440
to that file.

01:40.070 --> 01:43.020
The second is to load it from a C N.

01:44.490 --> 01:47.550
We just need to copy this stylesheets link.

01:50.480 --> 01:58.810
And paste it in the head section of amrit's to amelle which is in the includes header doppie HP file.

02:02.030 --> 02:05.240
Now as they're improving the library all the time.

02:05.240 --> 02:11.150
The version you see when you copy this link might be slightly different to this one but they generally

02:11.150 --> 02:14.950
maintain backwards compatibility with previous versions.

02:15.110 --> 02:18.250
So I would recommend using the latest version.

02:20.630 --> 02:26.760
Now when we visit our site in the browser by simply including the bootstraps the SS file.

02:26.960 --> 02:32.390
The site has been changed a sansui font has been used.

02:32.390 --> 02:41.450
The font sizes and colours are slightly different and things like borders around text boxes look slightly

02:41.450 --> 02:42.540
different too.

02:43.650 --> 02:50.730
And at this point we can be sure that this now looks the same in all browsers to take advantage of the

02:50.730 --> 02:57.600
various components and options we need to add some extra elements and styles to our astm email which

02:57.810 --> 02:58.940
we'll do next.
