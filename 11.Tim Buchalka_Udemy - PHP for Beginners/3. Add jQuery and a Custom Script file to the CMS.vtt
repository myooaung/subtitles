Let's add some javascript to our cims code for Jay Query will use A C D n select the many find version

00:15.490 --> 00:18.100
and copy the script tag.

00:21.170 --> 00:27.520
We'll paste it in the footer include just before the closing body tag.

00:28.070 --> 00:33.340
Let's also add a file where we can put our own javascript code.

00:33.380 --> 00:39.440
It's common practice to put javascript files in a J s folder.

00:42.090 --> 00:46.550
And in here let's create a new file called script.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.410
J s.

00:55.390 --> 00:57.650
We'll display a message from here.

00:59.210 --> 01:02.350
Just so that we can check it's working.

01:02.960 --> 01:09.240
Let's add a reference to this file in the footer after the J query one.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.570
If we go to our site in a browser.

01:18.800 --> 01:27.280
We see the message on the home page and if we view an individual article we see it also.

01:27.470 --> 01:34.020
So we know the script file is being loaded on all pages because it's in the footer.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.920
If I go to the admin index However we don't see the message.

01:42.320 --> 01:48.590
When I added the reference to the script file in the footer I started with the name of the folder then

01:48.590 --> 01:50.140
the file name.

01:50.660 --> 01:54.400
You are Ell's like this are relative to the current page.

01:54.620 --> 01:56.690
So in scripts in the root.

01:56.750 --> 02:02.120
This works as the JS folder is also in the root.

02:02.270 --> 02:10.070
However for pages in a subdirectory for example the admin index as we just saw the browser tries to

02:10.070 --> 02:17.330
load the script from a J s folder inside the admin folder which it doesn't find and therefore the page

02:17.360 --> 02:19.340
isn't loaded.

02:19.340 --> 02:25.420
To fix this we simply need to start the eurail with a slash.

02:25.430 --> 02:31.440
This means that the file will always be loaded relative to the root of the site.

02:34.950 --> 02:43.470
Now if we go to the admin index we see the message and also if we view an individual article in the

02:43.470 --> 02:44.630
admin section.

02:48.590 --> 02:53.500
So now we're loading our custom javascript file correctly on every page.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.660
We can remove this message.
