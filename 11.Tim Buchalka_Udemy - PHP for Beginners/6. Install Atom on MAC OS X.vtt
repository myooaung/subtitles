00:04.710 --> 00:09.960
In this video we are going to install atom which is the text editor we we're going to be using in this

00:09.960 --> 00:11.760
course for the Mac.

00:12.120 --> 00:19.140
So firstly we want to go to the atom DOT website in a browser and it should automatically detect that

00:19.140 --> 00:22.230
you're on a Mac in qbe the download option for a Mac.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.310
If by chance doesn't click on other platforms.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.950
But in my case Neko Case is selected.

00:27.990 --> 00:30.210
So I can click on Download.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.480
Download that file to my computer.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.630
Once the download is complete I'm going to show in Finder.

00:46.020 --> 00:49.080
I'm going to double click to unzip the file.

00:53.250 --> 00:56.040
And that's the atom text editor.

00:56.070 --> 00:58.080
Note that this isn't an installer.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.450
It's the actual text editor.

01:00.690 --> 01:06.170
So therefore we just need to drag that atom icon the application into the Applications folder.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.890
An installation is now complete.

01:09.240 --> 01:16.500
So at this point I can close down the Finder window press command spikes and type out.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.350
To start the text editor.

01:22.060 --> 01:24.670
It gets verified by mac OSX.

01:26.650 --> 01:30.550
So this dialogue option may appear if it does click on Open.

01:32.690 --> 01:37.510
The text editor has now been installed.

01:37.510 --> 01:40.180
I'm going to close some of these windows.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.060
You got this option here to select.

01:45.060 --> 01:49.870
Yes if you want to help improve atom by sending data to atom I'm going to choose.

01:49.870 --> 01:53.650
No I don't want to help but you can choose either option.

01:53.890 --> 02:02.260
They closed down this last window and then going to go to the at a menu and click on preferences.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.570
Come over here and click on packages.

02:06.990 --> 02:09.670
I'm going to scroll down until I can see the auto complete.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.470
Plus option.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.630
I'm going to click on settings.

02:15.710 --> 02:19.550
I'm going to turn off shows suggestions on keystroke.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.720
But we will see that in use later on in the course.

02:24.800 --> 02:29.510
I'm going to close this down and we've saved those sittings.

02:31.610 --> 02:37.940
We know what to choose the folder that we selected when we installed exit ramp for our scripts file

02:38.540 --> 02:39.370
open.

02:41.530 --> 02:42.220
I'm ready to go.

02:42.220 --> 02:49.690
In my case the documents w w w folder POTO you can select whichever folder you chose in that except

02:49.690 --> 02:52.370
installation video click on Open.

02:53.060 --> 02:58.030
And lastly you want to make sure that you're in the treeview and you can see that I am in that view

02:58.360 --> 02:59.510
where we get the list.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.390
Then the left hand side and the actual files on the right.

03:02.740 --> 03:06.500
If you don't see that thing from over to the View menu and toggle treeview.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.720
That's what it looks like with an off.

03:10.470 --> 03:16.890
But leaving it on is the best solution and you can also size the window as appropriate for your system

03:17.080 --> 03:18.350
so that it's not readable.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.730
And are you ready to go.

03:20.070 --> 03:22.770
So that's the installation of the atom text editor.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.660
Now complete.
