At the beginning of this section we added some e m r emphasis tags around this word

00:14.410 --> 00:15.650
in the browser.

00:15.670 --> 00:19.120
This word is shown in italics.

00:21.400 --> 00:28.630
The emphasis tag is used to mark up a text that has emphasis are words that you might stress when you

00:28.630 --> 00:29.260
speak them.

00:29.260 --> 00:37.530
For example we also have this strong tag team L. to add strong emphasis to some text.

00:41.110 --> 00:49.160
Let's add some strong emphasis to some text in our code in the browser.

00:50.290 --> 00:54.350
This is rendered as bold text.

00:56.810 --> 00:58.580
So what's the difference.

00:58.640 --> 01:03.690
The e m r emphasis tag is used to change the meaning of a sentence.

01:03.920 --> 01:11.090
For example I really love biscuits this is I really love biscuits.

01:11.090 --> 01:17.570
The strong tag is used to give parts of a sentence added importance for example.

01:17.570 --> 01:20.250
This is very dangerous vs..

01:20.270 --> 01:23.380
This is very dangerous.

01:27.130 --> 01:35.370
In the browser emphasized text is rendered as italic and strongly emphasize text is rendered as bold.

01:35.440 --> 01:42.610
You might be thinking that using these tags is how we make text bold italic and although these tags

01:42.640 --> 01:44.150
do indeed do that.

01:44.260 --> 01:48.220
This is not what they're for.

01:48.550 --> 01:49.170
Remember.

01:49.170 --> 01:55.990
Fine now we're just semantically marking up the document telling the browser that this is emphasized

01:55.990 --> 01:57.010
text.

01:57.220 --> 02:01.300
And this is strongly emphasized text.

02:01.360 --> 02:08.150
The browser decides how to display this which by default is using italic and bold.

02:08.770 --> 02:15.460
However a browser that's converting this text to audio and reading it out loud for example will want

02:15.460 --> 02:15.950
to know.

02:15.970 --> 02:23.200
It's emphasized so it can say it differently and you might want to emphasize text to be highlighted

02:23.200 --> 02:25.870
differently instead of italic and bold.

02:25.870 --> 02:32.320
For example read and underlined so it fits in with the design of your website.

02:32.350 --> 02:35.210
We'll see later on how to do this.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.950
There are bold and italic tags in next year mail which used to be just presentational elements used

02:45.950 --> 02:49.380
to display text as bold and italic.

02:49.430 --> 02:56.100
Nowadays you can still use them and they have a similar function so the E M and strong attacks.

02:56.120 --> 03:04.010
But personally I prefer to use the E M and strung tags as them or semantic.

03:04.010 --> 03:11.600
Finally in this video note that tags like this can not be used in the title tag in the head section

03:11.820 --> 03:17.310
that we saw earlier were only allowed to put text in the pages title.
