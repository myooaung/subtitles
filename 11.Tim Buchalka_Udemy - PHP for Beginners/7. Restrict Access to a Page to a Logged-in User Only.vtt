00:05.220 --> 00:11.210
Now a user can log in we can use this to restrict access to a page.

00:13.800 --> 00:20.850
Here in the index page we're detecting if a user is logged in by checking the is logged in value exists

00:20.850 --> 00:23.070
in the session and if it's set.

00:23.070 --> 00:23.970
True.

00:24.480 --> 00:29.910
Let's extract this line out into a function so we can use it.

00:29.910 --> 00:37.920
First let's create a new file in the includes folder called Path dot p s p for our fanti case and related

00:37.920 --> 00:47.760
functions in here we'll create a new function kalid is logged in and in here will add the code we just

00:47.760 --> 00:56.910
saw from the index script returning the boolean value that results from this expression and will add

00:56.940 --> 01:01.970
a p p doc comment at the top like that.

01:05.030 --> 01:14.120
Then in our new article script first we require this new file and as we are using the session First

01:14.120 --> 01:16.870
we need to call session start.

01:17.270 --> 01:25.960
Then we can call the is logged in method which returns true if a user is logged in we want to take action.

01:25.970 --> 01:30.050
If they use isn't logged in so we'll use the negation operator

01:32.600 --> 01:36.530
which negates the result returned from this function.

01:36.530 --> 01:42.350
This means the f block will be executed if this function returns false.

01:42.890 --> 01:49.650
In this block lets just print out a message and stop the script for now.

01:52.910 --> 01:54.410
Let's try that out.

01:54.410 --> 02:00.950
We're not currently logged in and if I click on the new article link were shown the message and we can't

02:00.950 --> 02:04.040
view the form to add a new article.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.680
If I go back and log in

02:10.590 --> 02:14.980
then I click the new article link we can access it.

02:19.040 --> 02:24.050
Now we've extracted this code here in the index page out into a function.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.940
Let's use it.

02:25.940 --> 02:29.580
First we need to require the file where the function is.

02:31.920 --> 02:39.110
Then we can replace this line with a call to the new function like that.

02:42.220 --> 02:43.210
And in the browser.

02:43.240 --> 02:47.040
This still works as before.

02:47.230 --> 02:51.300
One more thing we can improve is to not show this link to users.

02:51.310 --> 02:56.770
If they're not logged in as all that's going to happen when they click it is they're going to get an

02:56.860 --> 02:58.780
unauthorized message.

03:01.110 --> 03:06.560
So let's move this link to inside the f block here.

03:06.600 --> 03:11.110
And while we're at it wrap it inside a paragraph element too.

03:13.770 --> 03:19.450
So now when we're not logged in the link to the new article page isn't shown.

03:19.650 --> 03:21.980
If I log in.

03:24.820 --> 03:31.840
There's the link which we can click on and add a new article if we want.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.940
When I log out the link is no longer displayed.

03:39.230 --> 03:49.190
So by adding this code to a page access can be restricted to logged in users only before we develop

03:49.190 --> 03:52.300
this further and restrict access to other pages.

03:52.310 --> 03:55.740
First let's learn about classes and objects.
