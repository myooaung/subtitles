To delete an article.

00:06.700 --> 00:12.310
We can select it and simply click the delete button to delete it.

00:12.310 --> 00:20.130
Very easy perhaps too easy and you could click this button by mistake once a rijkaard is deleted it's

00:20.140 --> 00:22.320
gone to get it back.

00:22.330 --> 00:26.120
You'd have to retrieve it from a backup of your database.

00:26.140 --> 00:30.040
You do keep regular backup copies of your database don't you.

00:32.230 --> 00:39.280
To make it less easy to delete an article that's add another step in the deletion process here in the

00:39.280 --> 00:45.870
delete articles script as we saw previously if we don't use the post method we don't show anything.

00:46.180 --> 00:50.260
So let's add some content down here.

00:50.530 --> 00:56.240
Our standard header a subtitle and a standard footer.

00:57.100 --> 01:02.120
Then in our article script let's copy this form.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.840
And paste it in the delete script.

01:11.500 --> 01:17.380
Like that we can remove the action attribute from the farm tag.

01:17.650 --> 01:21.280
So the farm is submitted to itself.

01:21.970 --> 01:29.530
Then back in the article script we can replace this farm with a link to the Delete script that we originally

01:29.530 --> 01:35.770
had passing in the day of the article in the query string.

01:38.800 --> 01:46.360
Now when we click on an article we see a link to delete it but when we click on it the article isn't

01:46.360 --> 01:48.340
deleted straight away.

01:48.340 --> 01:52.350
We can go back and we haven't deleted it.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.420
We can make this a bit more user friendly however.

01:58.600 --> 02:05.460
Instead of having just a delete button let's add a message that says Are you sure.

02:05.470 --> 02:12.730
And let's also add a cancel link that goes back to the article page.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.890
So now when we view an article then we click on delete.

02:20.370 --> 02:27.930
We get prompted with the confirmation message which we can cancel are we can click the delete button

02:28.830 --> 02:31.920
and the article is deleted later on.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.820
We'll see how we can add a confirmation message like this using javascript.
