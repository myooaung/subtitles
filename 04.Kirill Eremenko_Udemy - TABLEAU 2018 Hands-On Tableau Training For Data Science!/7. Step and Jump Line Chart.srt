00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,320
Hello and welcome back to our course on tabbouleh in today's tutorial we will look at our brand new

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,900
business challenge as well as learn how to create a step and jump on charts.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,940
First let's start off by having a look at our business challenge.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,600
So we are looking at the New York state salary analysis.

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:31,150
Now you are required to build a visualization within tabla doing an analysis of average salary across

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,330
industries for the state of New York.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,580
The analysis needs to have the following.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,640
Firstly an average annual salary by county which needs to be displayed on a map.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,460
We need to show the top five highest earning industries by county and last include a time series analysis

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,170
of the average annual salary per county.

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,780
Now the client has some specific requirements and they do not.

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,400
They've mentioned that they do not want to see separate graphs on different sheets and also don't want

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,890
to work with a dashboard.

14
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,700
So some limitations they not.

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,400
They mentioned that they would like all information contained within a single sheet with pop up charts

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,320
while the map is being explored so it will have to be innovative here let's have a look at the data

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,590
that we are working with.

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,970
So if we have a look we can see that the Foglio school the quarterly census of employment and wages

19
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,750
annual data beginning 2000 and this is a C as V fall.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,230
If we have a look at it in Excel we can see that it's got quite a number of rows if we scroll down and

21
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,690
we have information relating to on different levels of granularity.

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,510
We are obviously only interested in the average annual salary so we'll be ignoring the the the establishment.

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,360
The average employment and total wage we've got Yeah that is for.

24
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,100
So that will help us to build our time series analysis.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,900
And then we have in two fields called the icy Asen in Essie's title.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,440
Now those are the North American industry classification system titles.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,050
So what that means is that it has different levels so for one character is your highest level two characters

28
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,610
like a one and or one would be second level three characters or third level and so forth.

29
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,730
So something that has three characters and starting with one one would be related to agriculture.

30
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,860
These are crop production.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,930
These four or five would be related to that.

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,520
So we need to factor this into account when we work with our data to ensure that we work with the right

33
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,700
level.

34
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,850
Another complexity with this data is we've got different area types.

35
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,100
We've got state.

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,570
We know we are looking for county we found County and there is a whole bunch of different levels of

37
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,050
granularity that to be worked with.

38
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,200
So we've got our area.

39
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,020
And then the area that that translates to.

40
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,770
So we will have to do a bit of data cleaning once we import this into tabla.

41
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,090
So talking about that let's open Tablo we will connect to this quite easily Luckily this time by just

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:02,190
using the text file because we Noticias V and we will just open it and we can see it Brading properly.

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,430
There is nothing strange happening in this fall but now the clean up needs to happen.

44
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,790
Now we know the area outside.

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,230
We're looking for is only county so we can just add a data source format by looking at the area top

46
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,910
and saying we only want the county to be included in there.

47
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,700
All right.

48
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,860
And we can just change our area now to be called County and we also know that this is a geographic and

49
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:34,030
also we can just change it right now and change it to a county not a country but a county.

50
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,640
All right then let's look at the icy roads or the industry.

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,610
So I'll just read and there's the industry because that's what we all want in the end of the preparation

52
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,300
of our data.

53
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,470
But we will need to make sure to exclude everything on specific levels.

54
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,680
And for this specific one level two will be more than sufficient so that will be everything with two

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,730
numbers.

56
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,230
And actually this change the strings.

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,420
It's not really a number.

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,860
We want to use this as a number.

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,980
So when these two characters in the string we would like to see that level that's agriculture for instance

60
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,390
and utilities and construction we don't really care about the lower levels and we don't want to go up

61
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,190
one level.

62
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,480
But how do we tell to blow to only look at this level.

63
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,070
So we can easily do that by creating a calculated field and that new vehicle just school this level

64
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,560
and then we will use the lane function.

65
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,750
So the main function is for string functions and that's also why we change that to a string.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,050
And if we just look at what Lean does it returns the number of characters in the given string.

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,150
So it just basically counts the number that's there.

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,970
So for instance that is level 2.

69
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,020
Because it's two characters that's level three because of the three characters.

70
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:49,570
And that's exactly what we wanted to add another yet another deciles full to one level way we just want

71
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,250
to see level 2 so we can exclude one and we can exclude three.

72
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,470
So just.

73
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,610
And that reduces our information significantly in terms of the number of records.

74
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,900
And we did mention we don't really want these fields we won't really work with him so we can just hide

75
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,370
them and that is what we'll work with.

76
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:14,870
So we've got our area up which we know is county we've got the county name then also the actual level

77
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,470
of the code which we're not going to use in the visualization but is needed for the data cleanup.

78
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,700
And then also the industry and the average annual salary.

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,280
Now let's actually create our first chart as well without further ado.

80
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:33,650
So if we go into our first sheet we'll be looking at firstly creating the time series analysis.

81
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,110
So for that we know we need to put a year into columns because that we want our time series to run from

82
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:46,880
left to right and we know we want to have the average annual salary we can put that in rows but not

83
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,520
aggregated to some but aggregate to average.

84
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,540
And we know that we can now see that what the average is over all counties and we will break this down

85
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,870
later on into each specific county.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,910
But for now this is our chart.

87
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,360
But what we know that the client wants is positive detail.

88
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,970
Is this trend over yet and is not it's nice to see the overall trend but it's not easy to distinguish.

89
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,880
You know what exactly the jump has been or the amount of increase or decrease has been or even any decrease

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,170
as well.

91
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,420
You know there's one over there.

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,690
So in that case we could obviously go into our both and change the line.

93
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,250
And this is where we found our step and our job charts.

94
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,780
So if we look at step for instance you can see it literally creates a resemblance of steps of a building.

95
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,400
So where it's easy to see that where there was an increase in both these years there was a big increase

96
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,430
in 2003.

97
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,900
They was in 2000.

98
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,590
So this works really well for four discrete measures where you want to see the impact and even they

99
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,920
look interesting that is there was a decline and we would not have seen that if I just undo that to

100
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,570
our previous job.

101
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,400
That almost looks like a straight line doesn't look like decreased and the same we can do obviously

102
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,890
with the jump lines.

103
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,730
But in this case I think this will look better for visualization and then we can just call this our

104
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,990
step line chart.

105
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,260
As simple as that.

106
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:18,200
And in the next to Tauriel we will be building the rest of the visualizations and combining these and

107
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,430
see how we can use to alter IPs to our advantage in answering this brief.

108
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,510
I look forward to seeing you next time.

109
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,390
Until then happy analyzing.
