Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.530
And in today's tutorial we're talking about data blending.

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.400
It's a very exciting and at the same time controversial topic and Tablo.

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.370
And that's because data blending is often very underestimated.

5
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.390
It is a feature that is not often used but at the same time it is very powerful and should be used more

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.380
and more over at the beginning it might be a bit difficult to distinguish between joining data and blending

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.750
data.

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.200
But don't worry today we will clarify all of that and we'll put everything back in its place so that

9
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.580
you can comfortably use and take full advantage of these powerful features both joining and blending

10
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.290
data.

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.370
So to start off with we're going to need a browser.

12
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.930
If you go to superdog assigns dot com slash Tablo and then you scroll down to section number five joining

13
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.800
and blending data just download the very first file which is airline comparison.

14
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.670
So we'll just say that.

15
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.310
There we go.

16
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:11.000
And now just bring this file up airline comparison hand as you can see here.

17
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.350
We've got two tabs.

18
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.820
The first tab has revenue for our airline number one and it's split by period financial year 2015 and

19
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.490
financial year 2016 and is split by multiple regions.

20
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.060
And the second tab has revenue for airline number 2.

21
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.960
It is also split by year and region as you can see airline number two operates in less regions.

22
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.460
And another thing to note is that in the first tab the year's cold period and then the second tab the

23
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.460
year is called the year.

24
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.140
So you'll see why that's important in a few minutes.

25
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.810
So I'm just going to close that and we're going to open up a new tablet workbook.

26
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.480
Okay.

27
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.090
And now we're going to connect our Excel file airline comparison.

28
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.000
There it is.

29
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.890
We're going to connect to the first tab here.

30
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.620
So that's done now.

31
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.160
We're going to create another connection and it'll be the same Excel file but now we will connect to

32
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.430
the second tab.

33
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.020
Now if we go to our sheet one you will see here two daughter connections and they represent the two

34
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.540
different tabs in our Excel workbook.

35
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.190
So what we're going to do now is we'll start visualizing airline number one.

36
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.200
We want to see how the revenue is split by region for instance.

37
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.500
So we'll ignore year for now we'll just some of the revenue for the two years.

38
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.900
And as you can see here it's broken down by region now and we can see how the revenue changes from region

39
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.200
to region.

40
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.460
Now what we want to do is we want to add airline number two to this viz..

41
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.640
So if we go to the second data source right away here you can see this orange line on the left and you

42
00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.670
can see this link ikan which tells us that Tablo is prepared to blend the data for us now.

43
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.960
So this is where we get to the topic of blending what is a blend.

44
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.090
Well remember how previously in one of the tutorials before this we created a joint for our daughter

45
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.240
so here in the data source we connected some different sources of data.

46
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.680
Like for instance like that we put in another element of data here and we created an inner join.

47
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.820
And then so we prepared all of the data before we actually worked with it in our workbooks.

48
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.790
Well now we haven't done that but at the same time Tablo allows us to do that on the fly while we're

49
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.280
working with workbooks.

50
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.910
And that is called data blending and blending is kind of like a smart choice.

51
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.250
So let's have a bit more of a play around with it and see how it works what we're going to do now is

52
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.470
going to drag revenue for the second airline also into our homes right away.

53
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.720
Now you can see that we have two elements in our Brazil Zeshan.

54
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.880
We've got the first set of bars and the second set of bars which represents the second airline.

55
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:13.160
And also it's important to note that here in our control panel we've got two main elements so this these

56
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.270
controls are for this airline and these controls are for this airline and these bars.

57
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.930
And also you can control all of them through this feature here so let me just show you an example if

58
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.490
I want to change the color for instance I can change the call for everything.

59
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.460
Or if I want to change something for this other bar charts so just one of them for instance I want to

60
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.750
make it a line chart instead of Bartsch and I can do that and then I can go into the second bar chart

61
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.200
I can change something else as well I can change the color here if I want.

62
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.290
And things like that so we'll just cancel those changes because we don't really need them.

63
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.490
But keep that in mind that you can control these separately if you need to.

64
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.600
And if you need to control them together then you just need to click this all feature here.

65
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.850
So what happened here.

66
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.000
Well Tablo knows that it can.

67
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.600
It needs to join the two data sets in order to visualize them because as you can see here we're using

68
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.250
a region from airline number one and the revenue from airline number one.

69
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.670
But revenue this revenue comes from airline battue.

70
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.410
And that's why it's marked with this little database with a orange I can with on it.

71
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:30.830
And so Tablo needs to somehow aggregate revenue from airline to at the level of region of airline number

72
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.160
one.

73
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.450
So how does it do it.

74
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.570
Well tabel knows that it needs to blend the data.

75
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.620
Meaning that it needs to join the two data sources and how does it do it.

76
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.720
It goes through the region Berbel here and that's shown using this link.

77
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.250
So it's basically telling us that Tablo has performed a left join from between the data sets airline

78
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.470
number one an airline number two on the field which is called region.

79
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.200
So it's kind of unjoin on the fly.

80
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.680
So that's that's great.

81
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.700
And the way the region was picked up is because the name is the same so region.

82
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.930
Here is the same as region here and that's how Tablo understood that it needs to join on the region

83
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.290
feel.

84
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:18.050
But what we actually want to do is we want to visualize not only by region but also by period.

85
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:27.470
So by year so if we go back to airline number one and we take a period here and we dragged into our

86
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.830
rows you'll see here financial year 2015 financial year 2016.

87
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.260
So now one more thing we're going to do is for this chart on the left we will take some revenue we'll

88
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:48.380
hold control and we'll take it into labels and we will just format that quickly so that it's not it's

89
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.260
not in millions.

90
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.710
So there's less numbers currency just won millions.

91
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.360
There we go.

92
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.450
And then we will take this revenue and drag it onto the label for this chart.

93
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.180
And now we will format it here as well.

94
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:15.810
Currency just in millions and now for the whole dashboard we will format it and tell it to be ten and

95
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.580
bold.

96
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.340
OK.

97
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.370
So hopefully you can see that a bit better now.

98
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.200
Now what's happened is after we drag it out period so I'll just perform that again so I'll take peered

99
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.590
out and I'll drag period into rows.

100
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:39.700
You can see also drag period intro's the first airlines daughter was split into two periods so here

101
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.160
you can see Africa 10 million and Africa 8 million.

102
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.660
Asia 20 ages 16 so it is working here.

103
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:52.100
But at the same time the second airline it's not been affected by the period bearable.

104
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.870
It's basically what it did is just duplicated the data for the full data set instead of splitting it

105
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.590
into two separate periods.

106
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.700
Why did that happen.

107
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:07.790
Well because Tablo does not know how to connect how to connect to this period Berbel hooked to connect

108
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.830
the second data set to the period variable.

109
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:17.840
Because we haven't established that connection so we can fix that very easily if we go to Dahdah EDID

110
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.050
relationships.

111
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.800
Remember how we talked about joining are multiple fields Well here we've only joined on region.

112
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.940
You can see that that was picked up automatically.

113
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.320
What are we going to do now is we going to join on multiple fields and now instead of going just joining

114
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.160
a region we're going to join on period and year here.

115
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.390
So if we do that click OK.

116
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:48.820
You can see right away this has been adjusted so what that did is now Tablo is joining these two data

117
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.430
sets on two fields.

118
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:56.490
And this is exactly what we talked about in that example of joining when you need to join multiple fields

119
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.520
if you don't join in multiple fields when it is required then you will duplicate values and you will

120
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.180
over inflate the observations.

121
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:11.930
So in this case what happened is Tablo joined on to fields and there was a period or region and year.

122
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.640
Now the reason why Tablo didn't pick it up originally was because year has a different name.

123
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.600
So what we'll do now is I'll show you how else you could fix that problem.

124
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.690
So if we go to relationships and we take period out so we'll just put it back to Automattic quick.

125
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.310
Okay.

126
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.450
You see we have that problem where the values of some tier and the bells are some tears sort of being

127
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.530
split.

128
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.690
Now what we can do is we can just go to one of these data sets so here we've got period.

129
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:46.380
So how about we go to the second data set and we will here change the name so we'll rename it in sort

130
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.580
of year we'll call it also period.

131
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:56.430
And what you will see is that Tablo automatically right away picks up that this should be a connection.

132
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.320
So now Tablo knows that the names are the same.

133
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:05.390
So therefore it is joining the data on those two fields.

134
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:13.110
Oh one more thing you should know is that if you take a period out of your visualization right away

135
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.780
tabel no longer needs to join on that field.

136
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.690
It doesn't know that there is a connection here but it won't be joining on that field.

137
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.750
And that is because that field is no longer part of your visualization.

138
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.790
So you can manually switch it on if you want or switch it off but it doesn't really affect the solution

139
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.460
in this case because it isn't participating in this visual.

140
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:41.350
And so what that does is that Tablo actually creates this joint on the fly.

141
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:48.630
And the way it does it is bit different to the way we were doing it manually back here in data sources

142
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:53.730
when we were creating our own joint the way Tablo does these blends.

143
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.910
Is it actually instead of joining the dots at roll level.

144
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:05.790
It will first send queries to each of the data assets it will aggregate them so here you've got airline

145
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.860
one an airline too.

146
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:14.520
It will aggregate them to the level that is required at the level of granularity of the bezels action.

147
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.420
And then it will only join them.

148
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:24.600
So in our case for instance before joining the dots it goes into airline into the airline 1.0 set and

149
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:30.120
it looks at the data it aggregates it to the right level so in our case it's the regional level and

150
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.670
then it goes to the airline 2.00 said.

151
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.270
It aggregates the data to the region level as well.

152
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:42.280
And then it brings back the aggregated values and joins them and that is what data blending does so

153
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:49.890
it is a very very smart lift joint and you can also see that it is a live joint because here one table

154
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.130
is the primary table the blue one and the Oria the airline to table is actually the secondary table

155
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.440
which is marked with an orange mark.

156
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:04.800
And from there you can see that it's a left joint because here you can see all of the regions which

157
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.810
are present in airline in the airline one database.

158
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:14.160
And here you can and they're joined to the airline to database and therefore these two are blank because

159
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.650
they're not present in line to do so.

160
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:25.650
And finally joining blending blending is actually done on a per sheet basis.

161
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:32.100
So if I create a new sheet here you can see right away there is no more blue or primary and secondary

162
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:37.350
secondary data source which means you can create a brand new blend and let's have a look an example

163
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.230
here if we started creating the blend with airline too you will see that it will become the primary

164
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.110
data source.

165
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:54.630
So if we drag region into rows and now we drag revenue into columns and also revenue into label and

166
00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:01.720
make this a bit smaller what you will see is that when we go to Arlynn one it has become now secondary

167
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.430
for this.

168
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:09.630
It is the secondary data source and if we take revenue and dragged into columns here what you will notice

169
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:17.600
is that there is no longer six rows actually before we do that.

170
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:25.860
We have to fix something up because some revenue is this revenue has been copied for both of the sheets

171
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.790
and thats not correct.

172
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.380
So that can be a mistake.

173
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:35.160
We need to take out revenue from here and drag using CON-TROLL revenue the correct revenue.

174
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.280
And so you can see that is not the database.

175
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:44.700
And so what you can see here now is the important thing is that there is not 6 rows but only 4 and that

176
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:52.450
is because there is only four regions present in the airline one data set and its a left join sorry

177
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.330
in the airline two daughters said because airline 2 is our primary table and this is a left join.

178
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:03.240
So theres only four regions present in the airline two data set and if you recall when we talked about

179
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.220
Joines when you do a left join everything that doesn't match gets discarded.

180
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:16.440
So in this case North and South America got discarded from the final resulting table and that is because

181
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.610
blending is a very smart but it is a left join.

182
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.950
So that's pretty much it.

183
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:32.640
That is how blending works and Tablo I realize that this has been a rather lengthy tutorial but it is

184
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.470
important to understand how blending works.

185
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:43.920
And we went through everything that is included in a blend so we talked about the primary the secondary

186
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:52.050
tables we talked about how to add our own elements to the joints or in this case period and region.

187
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:58.230
We talked about how the the blend actually works that it first aggregates a data and then it only joins

188
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.370
the data in your final result.

189
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:09.690
And we also looked at why the blend is actually left join and how you should be cautious of that when

190
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.830
you are creating your visit Alsatians.

191
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.500
So thats all for today.

192
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.160
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

193
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.570
Until then happy analyzing.
