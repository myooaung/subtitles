Hello and welcome back to the course and Tablo.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.010
And in today's tutorial we will download and connect to the data there will be working within this section

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.490
and we will also learn how to do a join in Tablo.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.310
So very interesting to troll ahead let's get straight to it.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.780
First of all we'll need a browser.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.380
And as usual we will go to super size dot com slash Tablo.

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.840
And here if you scroll down to Section 4 you will see maps and scatterplot And let's just download this

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.540
file which is amazing Mark.

9
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.490
You so I'm going to save that file to my Tablo folder now.

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.950
And once the file is saved.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.790
I can open up the folder here you see the file and let's open it up and have a look what's inside.

12
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.280
So there is my file and I'll just zoom in a little bit so we can see a bit better what's going on.

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.810
And here you can see first thing that pops into our attention is that there's three tabs list of orders

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.010
order breakdown and self-starters.

15
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.190
So right now we're looking at the very first step.

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.640
What is it showing us.

17
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.690
Well this tab is showing us a list of orders so these orders this column the values in this column are

18
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.450
unique and every single order it has its details here on the right.

19
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.680
So when the order was placed who the customer is a customer is what's the name of the customer place

20
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.070
to order which region of Europe the order was placed in which country in this region which state in

21
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.510
the country which city in the state and it also has information on whether this customer is shopping

22
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.350
as a consumer or a corporate customer or home or for a home office it's got the shipping date and the

23
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.580
shipping mode.

24
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.210
So basically every single order is described here in detail and every single order is only featured

25
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.170
once in this tab and that's an important observation.

26
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.830
Now if we move onto the second tab we will see order breakdown.

27
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.490
So this tab is different now.

28
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.150
Here we can see that some orders are duplicated for instance these two orders are duplicated.

29
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.190
So it's the same order but it's shown twice.

30
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.050
Well why is that.

31
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.390
And that is because the customer that placed this order actually ordered several items he ordered Boston

32
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.820
markers and Eldin folders.

33
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.290
And then for each item there is a discount the value that was discounted off the order the sales the

34
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.570
profit flow for that specific item the quantity and what category it falls under or whether it's office

35
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.170
supplies furniture or technology and the subcategory.

36
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.750
So here we can see that every single order is broken down it is itemized into what exactly constitutes

37
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.230
that order.

38
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.480
So we don't we no longer have information on where when the order was placed we as was shipped in to.

39
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.250
But we know what was inside this order.

40
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.060
And so if we go back to the first tab here we will see that in total at the bottom so if I just highlight

41
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.780
the score column you'll see here that there is a count of 4000 118 cells.

42
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.540
So basically because the first cell is the hitter is 4000 117 orders and in order breakdown as we can

43
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.470
expect there's more cells.

44
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.680
There's actually eight thousand and forty eight cells so that means eight thousand forty seven items

45
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.040
in total.

46
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.320
We're well constituted these orders that were made.

47
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.530
And so that's important to remember that in this tab order ID is unique in this Tab Order ID is not

48
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.400
unique anymore.

49
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.220
And finally there's another tab called sales targets.

50
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.730
Now in this section of the course you won't focus on the sales targets tab.

51
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.750
We'll talk about it in the next section.

52
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.460
So let's leave it for now.

53
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.050
What we will need in our data is we will need to somehow join these two towers because for us it's not

54
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.110
sufficient to only know where the order went and when it was made and what kind of and who the customer

55
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.830
is.

56
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.100
We also need to know what constituted that specific order.

57
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.130
So the information from this step.

58
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.590
And likewise it's not enough for us to know just what constituted an order because we also need to know

59
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.160
who the customer was where it went and when it was placed.

60
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.950
So inevitably we're going to have to work with both these tabs and we need to find a way to combine

61
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.330
them or join them.

62
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.870
So let's see how we can do that and tabel.

63
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.270
I'm just going to close this Excel file for now and on each side of changes and what we're going to

64
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.100
do is we're going to help open up a Tablo.

65
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.200
And we will connect to this data source.

66
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.840
So we're going to connect to an excel file and here we've got the amazing.

67
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:59.210
You open it up and here right away we can see something different to what we're normally used to on

68
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.720
the left.

69
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.230
There's actually three sub items that we can choose from.

70
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.290
And these are the tabs that we just looked at list of orders order breakdown and sales targets.

71
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.620
So let's have a look at list of orders if we drag it into here as we normally do.

72
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.160
We will have a preview of the tab that is list of orders which is fair enough.

73
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.750
Now let's close that and drag order breakdown into this section.

74
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.960
Now we have a preview of the order breakdown tab the same thing as we saw just now.

75
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.430
So now what are we going to do how are we going to connect them.

76
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:40.130
Well tabel has a very convenient functionality that allows you to join these two files and that's exactly

77
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.570
what we're going to be doing.

78
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.110
We're going to be joining these two tabs.

79
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.440
So let's first do it and then we'll discuss what we did.

80
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.840
First we're going to take a list of orders and we'll drag it into this part of the data connection manager.

81
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.130
And now we're going to take order break down and we'll also drag it in there but we'll put it to the

82
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.840
right of list of orders.

83
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.000
And once you let go you will see automatically that table has come up with some sort of.

84
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.290
I can hear which is signaling to us that these two file two tabs are now connected and if we look at

85
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.740
the preview there is many more homes now.

86
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.340
So these columns here come from the first file that come from list of orders and then these columns

87
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.320
and they're right here.

88
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.940
They come from the second file.

89
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.020
They come from the order breakdown and if you click on this connection over here you will see what Tablo

90
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.720
did Tablo did an inner join.

91
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.510
So now if you're not familiar with the term inner join Don't worry because in the next section of the

92
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.220
course we will talk in detail about inner joins left joins right joins full outer joins.

93
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.260
And so on because it is quite an important topic in Tablo and connecting 2.0.

94
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.360
But for now we'll will just try to understand what exactly did Tablo do based on this description or

95
00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.830
here you can kind of guess that Tablo looked at order the order ID field in this tab and then it looks

96
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.900
at the Order ID field in this tab and it matched the two tabs based on this field.

97
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:14.690
So basically what that means is for whenever there was an order ID of X table looks for the same order

98
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:22.970
ID in this file and attached it to the rows in this file so now that we know that the call the Order

99
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.650
ID field in the first tab is unique and it's not unique in the second.

100
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.530
What that means is that for every order ID in the first tab there were they might have been several

101
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.010
order IDs in the second tab.

102
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.710
Well in that case what happens is Tablo will duplicate the rows from the first tab.

103
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.680
So let's have a look an example of that if you scroll down here to the very bottom.

104
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:51.590
I notice there's a few here so as you can see here these rows are duplicated so you can see and all

105
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.630
the information in these columns is identical so Tablo did duplicate these rows and then connect them

106
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:05.030
to the Associated rows in the second tab and here the rest of the information is unique of course because

107
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.090
these are different items in that second full second tab.

108
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:16.820
So what we did basically is we've created a new structure and new table based on those two daughters

109
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.710
sources and going forward from here tabel we'll be working with this table rather than with either of

110
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.180
these.

111
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.790
And that is a very very powerful feature that means that we've actually modified the daughter that Tabeau

112
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.480
will be working.

113
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.110
Not that we've changed the data.

114
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.090
We've modified the structure.

115
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:39.770
It's no longer two separate tables it's one table that has been joined and two acknowledges here we'll

116
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:46.310
just change the name from list of orders to plus order breakdown.

117
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.460
So if we click just click anywhere here.

118
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:59.030
Now the connection has been created and if we go to shoot one you'll see our connection here and now

119
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:09.560
also you can see that Tablo has gone to all the comb's as was featured in the dotter connection but

120
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.510
it's also separated them here to show you which file they are coming from whether it's kind of from

121
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.800
the list of orders or from the order breakdown file.

122
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.530
So that is how we join in Tablo and once again don't worry if you're not entirely sure or comfortable

123
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.540
What would we just did.

124
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.840
Because they'll be a whole section on this stuff very soon in the course.

125
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:39.050
So just follow along with what we did today and we'll get along with the Tablo part of the course so

126
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:45.770
the visualization part in the section and then we will recap again on joining enjoins our joins and

127
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.990
so on and even We'll talk about blending in the next section of the course.

128
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.920
So hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I'll look for you next time.

129
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.520
Until then happy analyzing.
