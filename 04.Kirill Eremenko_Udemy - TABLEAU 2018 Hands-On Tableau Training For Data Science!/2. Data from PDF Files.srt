00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,940
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tobler.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,150
In today's the Tauriel we'll just take a quick look at PDAF documents and ensure that we are all on

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,320
the same page with what they are before we continue any further.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,030
This will just be a quick and short tutorial for us to touch on the basics.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,790
Now we all might be very familiar with PTF and it's icon now pedia of documents nobody can contain a

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,290
number of different elements.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,250
The most common would be images text and it we know know that it's quite a static document as well.

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:45,590
Not the PTF format was actually conceived in 1990 and the acronym PTF actually refers to a portable

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,370
document format.

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,580
Now it's called like that.

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:55,520
Seeing as each records or formatting the font and images and also it's independent of the hardware or

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,140
OS.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,530
So you are able to open it on any operating system.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,300
Anything you need to have is a PDA reader so it's also a very nice bridge or a way for us to access

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,720
data from systems that would not have been able for us to be accessing if we didn't have the required

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,740
software installed to read such information so really handy indeed.

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,870
But enough talking.

18
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,160
Have a look an example.

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,590
So we've got two examples Elvia.

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,890
The first is quite a very portable matter.

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,330
So this is from the New Zealand water authority and what you'll see is this quite a lot of images and

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,020
text in there.

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,400
This is typical to a report format that you can expect.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,930
As you can see is also signature's a table of contents a whole lot of information and text.

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,940
Not that much of data but also some graphs.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,420
And as you can see even some tables in there.

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,700
So this is typical what you might find in a report type format.

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,650
All right.

29
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:58,100
Another top for example would be perhaps a bit more simple one way we've got some tables graphs and

30
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,370
then just tables worth of data to some of the characteristics of PTF documents or that these are not

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,910
idiots.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,430
Obviously we can only read the information from here as well as that it concedes that it stores all

33
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:16,220
of the rich content as we saw in the specific example in them and it's quite helpful because we have

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,450
no idea what way in which type of system or application this graph was generated.

35
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,490
And if it wasn't for PTF we would not have been able to see it all in such a nice instance all grouped

36
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,540
together in a very nicely presented format.

37
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:36,570
Now typically you don't associate PDA with storing data for machine readable information but sometimes

38
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:42,990
they might be some cases way that like the way that happens for instance in this case over here we might

39
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,540
have to analyze this data and we don't have access to the source that hasn't been published in a different

40
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,430
format.

41
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,500
Furthermore you might also face instances way the delegate supply in a PDA format to ensure the data

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,200
is secured and not altered with during the process.

43
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,960
And that's yet another instance of when you might encounter this not tableaus been very kind.

44
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:11,340
They've added a connector in the ten point three version of tabbouleh and this allows us to easily connect

45
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,400
to the PTF documents as we would have done with any other fault up that we are used to like an Excel

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,700
or a C is before.

47
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,040
One important note however is that the document doesn't contain any meta data as we might be used to

48
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,100
in connecting to a sequel database.

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,710
Or we might have to do some clean up during this process.

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,200
And that's also a very important part in working with bidi of documents.

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,820
But let's have a look at our fall that will be working with in this section.

52
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,730
So it's the New York Boch crime statistics and we can see that if we just scroll through it it's basically

53
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,410
a table that the format stays the same so it shouldn't be too difficult to read in.

54
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,740
But we have a couple of different columns.

55
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,000
We've got some headers at the top and we've got some footers and some page numbers so hopefully using

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,610
Tablo will be able to import this without too much hassle and be careful also off the total line at

57
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,410
the bottom of the fall.

58
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,960
And that is of follow will be working with the next section in the next to Tauriel will actually look

59
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,360
at how to connect to the PTF documents herad from with into bloat and also look at some clean up procedures.

60
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,970
I'm looking forward to seeing you next time.

61
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,830
Until then happy analyzing.
