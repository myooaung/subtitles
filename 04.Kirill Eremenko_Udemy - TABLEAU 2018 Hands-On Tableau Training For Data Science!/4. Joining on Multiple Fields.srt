00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,170
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,510
Today we'll be talking about joining in multiple fields to start off of this tutorial.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,400
I will show you an example when it is necessary to join on multiple fields and I will show you what

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,240
happens when you accidentally forget about joining on multiple fields.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,720
And finally we will look at how we can rectify this situation and actually in fact join on several fields

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,910
to get the right result.

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,370
So let's get straight into it.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,220
Here we've got two tables table and table B Table A lists the orders that were conducted in our two

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,060
stores which are north and south.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,300
As you can see we had two orders in the north store order number one and Order Number two.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,430
And in the south store we had only order number one.

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,710
And also it lists the customers Mike Jack and Susan.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,130
Table B lists the itemized description of those orders.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,980
So we've also got the store location we've got the order number and we've got the item within that order

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,050
and the sale made on that item.

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,810
So here you can see right away that order number one in the north Norton the store had two items sold

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,660
a laptop and a month's order number two had one item which was the monitor and Order Number one in the

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,680
salad and store had only one item which was a camera.

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:29,800
So now we want to connect the two tables and basically what we're after is we want to see how the sales

20
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,760
that were made for each of the customers the total sales for each of the customers.

21
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,030
So visually you can see right away how that works.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,260
But let's see how we can do it through joint.

23
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,840
So if we were to go ahead and do a left join.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,980
So basically we wanted to attach the table in the right to the table the left and if we were to just

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,800
do a normal left join using one field we would try to join on order number.

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,000
So here if we want to match order number in the lift table to the right table it all looks something

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,260
like this order number one will be matched to order number one in the first draw of the right table

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,520
in the second row and in the fourth row.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,530
And as we can see that's already incorrect because we're matching order number one from the northern

30
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,230
store to order number one from the south and store.

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,350
By this third match but let's let's see what happens further down.

32
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:26,590
So now if now Order Number two from the northern store will be matched toward Number two that's because

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,330
there's only one order number two in both of those tables.

34
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:37,030
And then order number one from the south and will actually be matched to three rows in the second table

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,380
which are Order Number one Ordon from the northern store.

36
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,160
Then the second item from Order Number one unknown store.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,570
And finally the only item from or number one in the south and store.

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,480
So in total the resultant table will look like this.

39
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:01,900
We will have three rows for North or Number one one row for North order number two and three rows for

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,580
south.

41
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,110
Order number one.

42
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,420
And as you can see this is a mistake there's an error because this highly inflates our sales.

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,480
It looks like we've sold two laptops it looks like we're sold to mice and two cameras whereas in fact

44
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,670
that's not true.

45
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,720
So joining on a single field here can lead to incorrect results.

46
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,130
So let's see how we can fix that.

47
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:32,110
What we need to do and this you can see naturally from these tables is we have to include information

48
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:39,260
about the store in our joint so we know that the order numbers are unique for each store.

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,620
And so therefore if we include the store now join then we will avoid this whole problem.

50
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,020
So let's see how that works.

51
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,310
At the on the top left here in circled in red you can see that we're joining on order number from table

52
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,610
a Eco's order number from table beat and store from Table 8 Eco's store from table B.

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,650
Let's see how this works.

54
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:09,170
In fact here we've got the North order number one being matched to two rows in the second table.

55
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,470
So North order number one which is the laptop and north or to number 1 which is the mass and that's

56
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:21,700
correct next door to number two from the northern store is matched to only one row in the second table

57
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,860
which is the monitor for the North End order number two which is also correct.

58
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,440
And finally the solid number one order is matched to only one row in the second table because there's

59
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,510
only one row that contains both the words South and the number one for the order.

60
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,470
And that is the camera for that Susan.

61
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:48,320
So now if we perform that join then the final resulting table will look like this.

62
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:56,050
And as you can see here the one row in the table on the left was duplicated to match the quantity of

63
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,540
items which was two items bought by Mike.

64
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:07,050
And so in total you can see that this you've got the correct result we can also assess how much each

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,180
customer has bought.

66
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,020
And there are no mistakes because of an incorrect turn.

67
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,560
So that was a good example of how to use joins in multiple fields.

68
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,010
And more importantly why you need to do that in certain cases to avoid errors.

69
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,110
I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.
