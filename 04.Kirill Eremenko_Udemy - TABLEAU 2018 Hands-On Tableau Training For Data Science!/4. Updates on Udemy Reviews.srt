00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,950
Forms long see a lot.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,730
Hey guys welcome back to the Tablo ADAs course.

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,480
Hope you're enjoying the turtle so far.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:22,210
And in this video we're going on a walk through Africa now now while we're on this quick walk I also

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,450
wanted to give you a heads up.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,890
You to me will very soon ask you to leave early for this course.

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,400
Now I know it can be difficult to judge the quality and value of a course this early on.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:40,240
However the review system has simply changed and they are asking you to leave review earlier and earlier

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,220
on in the course.

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,920
Now if that don't mind we're not going to ask you to leave a five sort of view.

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,420
But what I would like to ask is that if you're not yet familiar enough with the contents of the course

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,200
of the tutorials then please scroll through the different topics.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,910
Have a look at all of the different case studies that will have all of the different interesting and

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,580
exciting things that you will learn inside the course and hopefully that will give you the confidence

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,090
to rate this course of course.

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,250
If on the other hand you feel something is wrong with the course if you're unsatisfied about something

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,040
then please do let us know before you rate the course.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,710
You can contact the super and support team directly or you can leave a message a short message in the

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,930
course Q&amp;A.

20
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,430
Your feedback is very valuable to us and we will get back to you or we will fix up whatever the issue

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,150
is and then get back to you.

22
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,570
And hopefully that will give you the confidence to rate this course of course.

23
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,170
So now having said that if something's wrong please do let us know.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,960
But if you're satisfied about everything if you feel that you're excited about upcoming Charles about

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,430
