00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,590
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,030
And today we're downloading and connecting to the data set that we require for this section.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,930
So let's go ahead and get started with that.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,260
We're going to need a browser and we're going to go to superdog assigns dot com slash Tablo And if you

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,830
scroll down to the bottom here there's Section 6 Tablo calculations more dashboards and storytelling.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,100
And this is where adalah data set sits.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,470
It's called The UK bank customers that's three That's right.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,490
We're back to see as file because it's always good to know how to connect to different data sets and

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,170
practice different types of files.

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,990
And before we download the file I just wanted to say that there's a small caveat here that today's data

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,270
set is dummy data for an imaginary bank operating in the UK.

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,780
So you don't have to worry.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,490
This is not real customer data.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,300
This is all mockup data created specifically for the purposes of this exercise.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,810
So let's go ahead and download that save link as I'll just put it into my folder.

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,450
And now if I open up the folder.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,250
So I actually already had one so I didn't really need to download.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,140
So there is a file and let's open that up and have a look at what is inside.

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,060
So there is Excel.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,540
I'm going to copy the file into their annals just zooming in a bit I don't need the browser anymore.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,620
I'll just zoom in a bit here and make space for these columns.

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:31,970
OK.

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,760
So we've got customer id the idea of the customer the name of the customer the surname the gender of

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,130
the customer.

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,010
Age of the customer or the region in the UK where they're from or where the branch is located.

26
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,170
So it's either England Northern Ireland or Wales or Scotland.

27
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,980
The job classification whether they're white collar blue collar or other the date they joined the bank.

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,360
So this is a relatively new bank.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,190
It's only been operating for a year for the year of 2015 from January to December.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,790
So that's when all of these customers joined and the balance on the account of the customer in dollars

31
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,010
or pounds doesn't really matter.

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,380
Just some sort of currency.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,390
And now if we go down to the very bottom here you'll see that there's 4000 and 15000 actually 4000 14

34
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,100
because one rose a header.

35
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,980
So not a lot of customers relatively new bank.

36
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:36,180
And what they want us to do is they want us to analyze how the different regions are presented in this

37
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,870
customer base so basically what the customers look like in the different regions so they can assess

38
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,820
who's interested in the bank in these different areas of the U.K. and how to better service their customers.

39
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:58,290
So we need to create some visuals a dashboard A and a storyline to actually portray what we want to

40
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:05,530
tell the executives and explain about the user base so basically all of the findings that we uncover.

41
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,160
So that's our data set.

42
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,390
Let's close this file.

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,620
And no we don't want to save changes and we will go ahead and connect Tablo to this file.

44
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,800
So this is no longer an Excel file it's a text file because cxxviii files are deemed text files and

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,120
we're going to open up UK bank customers and there we go.

46
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,890
So there is a file at the bottom.

47
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:36,210
Scroll down will see just to check that everything is OK and the total number of rows is correct.

48
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,900
That's good.

49
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,830
And now we can proceed to creating our visualizations that we will require for our own Alliss.

50
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,090
So that was all for today.

51
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,790
I look forward to seeing you next time when we will start analyzing the customers and creating some

52
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,490
cool charts and maps and stuff like that.

53
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,790
So until next time happy analyzing.
