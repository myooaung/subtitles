Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo in today's tutorial we will look at what special falls

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.290
are and how we are able to connect to them.

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.290
In Tabula Jones is all that you are not an expert if you are.

4
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.070
Feel free to take a short break sit back and enjoy the presentation not the audio of his tutorial is

5
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.800
not to make you an expert on special falls but at least to be able to know your way around the different

6
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.790
types and how to use them now.

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.050
Tablo allows us to connect to four different types the first being shaped falls.

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.100
We also have map info tables keyhole markup language or camel and the Jason fault.

9
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.690
Let's have a closer look at sheepfolds However now sheepfolds was developed by the environmental System

10
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.480
Resource Institute and is one of the more widely used types with in-shape falls.

11
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.210
We have a few Menary falls that needs to be included in the package.

12
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.270
Firstly we've got the SH pre-fall which is the shape format the SH X your shape index format and your

13
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.120
D-B for that which is your attribute format.

14
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.520
Now we don't need to know the details of these fields or these files but at least be aware that all

15
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.820
three of these needs to be present in our structure are in our folder to be able to use it with in tabular.

16
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.810
Now they might also be some additional information that is supplied with the fall.

17
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.330
And it can be any of these fall types.

18
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.720
But as a minimum be sure that all three of those files are required to be used with entablature.

19
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.530
Now we have a similar pattern on the map tables where we have four different fall types which are required.

20
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.670
There are also a couple of alternative falls and before came out and Jason we just have one required

21
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.980
follow up to be able to use this with Tobler.

22
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.190
Now working with Matt since we know they are three different types and some of the these might seem

23
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.860
familiar from earlier on in the course.

24
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.190
The first top is the polygon map which is also referred to as the fold map where we have polygons depicting

25
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.000
the shape and the outline of a specific area on the map.

26
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.490
And then we can use our Minchin's images to color those the whole polygon.

27
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.610
Then we also have a point map where we actually use the latitude and longitude points within a map to

28
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.030
point out where certain things are located.

29
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.780
And we can reach that obviously with our dimensioned as measures in terms of color and sizing and a

30
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.730
few other attributes.

31
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.620
Lastly we have the line map which connects different points on your map to be able to show direction

32
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.220
or actual distances between points on your map.

33
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.470
Now we also know that Tablo has some built in geographic roles that we can work with the things are

34
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.480
below and we can define these as Sydie country or state zip codes as well.

35
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.810
We even have airports and some other area codes that we can use.

36
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.770
But these are also quite limiting.

37
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.640
And they might also be the occasional time when you might need to use Geographic roles outside of what's

38
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.320
available with Tablo.

39
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.180
Examples of these might be school districts dams or parks where we need that spatial data now from Tablo

40
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.420
ten point two onwards.

41
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.290
Tablo has made it possible for us to connect directly to custom spatial falls to draw the shapes out

42
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.130
on the maps but these are obviously limited to the Four Tops which we have just referred to.

43
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.180
So how does this work.

44
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.400
Now it's very easy.

45
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.500
You just need to obtain the spatial falls from an authority or an open data platform.

46
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.730
And this could also be from some of your cities or local government institutions that generally supply

47
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.210
a vast number of these different shaped falls and what we need to ensure the is that we do have the

48
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.530
required fields for the tops that are being supplied.

49
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.230
So once we have we are connecting to those Tablo we'll then analyze the falls and make the files available

50
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.470
to be used with intaglio Tablo basically transform the Falls using the latitude and longitude information

51
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.430
and creates a very important new field which we haven't seen before is the geometry field and the geometry

52
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.090
field basically acts as an alias for the underlying data that is able to draw the lines or points or

53
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.560
polygons even on maps.

54
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.700
So generally the ashfall that are supplied by these institutions also contain additional information.

55
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.650
So when you are looking for specific data we'll have a look when you connect to the special falls.

56
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.930
What else is available in there for analysis before searching for it on any other platform.

57
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.110
Now the data that we are looking at for this specific case was obtained from the New York City open

58
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.220
door to our platform.

59
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.980
And if I just open up the folder you'll see that we have four falls in there.

60
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.620
Firstly we have the D-B a fall the shape fall and the Ice Age fall.

61
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.170
Lastly we also have the DOJ which has additional information.

62
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.580
But as we know we at least have the three mandatory falls that we need to use the special files or other

63
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.950
the shape falls for the specific format.

64
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.300
But this opens up and see how it works in practice.

65
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.310
So we'll start off by adding a your data source.

66
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.690
And again we just look at our data source types and we can just select the special fall when we go to

67
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.440
or when we navigate to or follow up.

68
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.070
You'll see that tableaus and looking what it looks for the couple of times.

69
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.450
But we have the Scheifele and that's what we'll select to connect there and immediately Tablo connect

70
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.780
to it.

71
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.030
And trawls through all of the information that's within these contained within these falls.

72
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.450
So what's important for us is in this specific case will be the name field or the name 3:01 one which

73
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.880
you will remember but later the barrer in which it is getting back to the case study we need to do something

74
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.800
with the bar and lastly that geometry.

75
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.400
There will be some cleanup necessary here but this is the important field that we spoke about that contains

76
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.020
And we know what kind of shape or what kind of point will be drawn.

77
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.580
And we know that this is the alias that connects it to the information in the background to know how

78
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.510
to draw this the latitude and longitude because you'll do you'll notice that that all that information

79
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.010
is not captured in here.

80
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.040
All right.

81
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.170
Just to see what it looks like will just open up a new sheet and go look for the geometry measure over

82
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.620
there.

83
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.620
Once you drag that into your map immediately it draws all of the different parts as one object.

84
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.710
By the way so let's quickly put in that name into detail to make them individual bigger.

85
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.690
And you can see all of the different parks and public spaces within New York.

86
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.630
It will be drawing and you can see the Central Park which we need to exclude for our case study and

87
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.640
all of them.

88
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.070
And if you scroll in as well you can see how the shapes are exactly the same as the actual parks within

89
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.810
the city.

90
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.230
So quite a lot of public spaces and public parks with in New York City.

91
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.370
And that was it for this lecture in the next the Tauriel will be connecting this special falls to our

92
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:58.090
PTF data in preparation to solve the business challenge inching our way forward to the final result.

93
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.000
I look forward to seeing you the next time.

94
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.810
Until then happy analyzing.
