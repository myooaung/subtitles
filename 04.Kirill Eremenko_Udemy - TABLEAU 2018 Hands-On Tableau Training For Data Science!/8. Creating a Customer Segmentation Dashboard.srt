00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:11,590
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo and in the previous tutorials we prepared all the worksheets

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,410
for our segmentation dashboard.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,320
So we've got a map we've got gender split in a pie chart.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,960
We've got two distributions one by age and one by balance and we've got a tree map of job because vacations.

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:32,250
And today we're going to put all of this into one dashboard one powerful awesome looking dashboard.

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,800
And now that we've got them all prepared it's going to be quite quick and easy to put them all together

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,810
into one dashboard.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,990
So let's go ahead and get started on it.

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,350
We're going to click this button here.

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,110
And new dashboard which brings up a new blank dashboard for us to work with.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,190
Now if we wanted to we could change the size because it is a bit big and we could change to a different

12
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,720
size over here or select our own size.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,080
But instead what I'm going to do is I'm just going to expand this window.

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,300
And now we will work with this full space and fill it up with colors.

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,310
All right so we'll start by dragging our worksheets into this blank space so I'll take the map we'll

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,870
drag it in here then it'll take distribution by let's take balance and put it in here.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,680
The solution by age will put in here as well.

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,340
Now as you can see some things that are appearing on the right here are some controls.

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,690
Obviously we don't need this one as we discussed we're not going to visually compare the different shades

20
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,790
of green.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,490
Same thing for the blue.

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,020
The parameters appeared for us here as well.

23
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,300
Now we're going to take the gender will drag it in underneath this box over here.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,550
Once again we don't need male female because it is very intuitive.

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,480
We made it intuitive.

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:53,160
Blue is a male pink is female and we'll get rid of the number of records this color size legend completely

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,910
not adding any value here and we'll take a job classification we'll try to get underneath here as well

28
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,430
because we don't need this legend because it is spelt out in our tree map.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,320
OK.

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,500
So that's our raw information in our dashboard which we can start working with now.

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,460
We're going to quickly make it look much better.

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,000
So that's a format that a little bit.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:25,700
Let's give these guys some more room maybe up to here with the map a bit more room OK.

34
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,840
What else.

35
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,270
The tree map is a bit big.

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,250
The pie charts a bit small so if something is a bit smaller it's easy to fix it up here and then you

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,900
just go for pie charts specifically you just go to the pie chart and you change the size so it just

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,170
fits in your box.

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,980
Now we'll go to the tree map job classification and we will make this one small or so that we can work

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,860
with it further in Dashboard.

41
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,590
So you just generally always make something smaller first and then you make it bigger.

42
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,410
OK so there we go.

43
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,130
So sometimes you will get these elements that you can't reduce.

44
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,350
You can just go past that and what you need to do is nudge this chart down with the chart above for

45
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:24,080
instance like this or just kind of reset everything to fit your needs at the bottom over here.

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,550
So Also what do we need to do before we format this part of the chart.

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,480
Is change the formatting here because you can see it's not in line with everything else it's smaller.

48
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:43,480
So we're going to format legends and the title we're going to make it 12 and bold and perhaps the font

49
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,290
of the legend doesn't really have to be 12 but at least 10 and also bold.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,810
And now if we do that there we go and you can see these parameters they collapse into this new format

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
which is good either.

52
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,360
Either way works for us.

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:09,190
So basically if we have the space if we can move our chart a bit down let's say all pie chart.

54
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,520
There we go.

55
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:16,660
Now we probably need to make the size a little bit smaller so that the percentages are out of the chart

56
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,610
itself.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,070
And now perhaps we can make this one a bit bigger.

58
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:30,940
There is a bit of like tedious clicking around but eventually you will get there.

59
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,630
There we go.

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,510
So that could work.

61
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:43,270
Probably in this case we need to make these charts a bit smaller again or the other option is fix this

62
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,600
up like this as it was just now.

63
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,090
So there we go probably that's that's a better option because we don't need that much space for our

64
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,920
parameter controls.

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,090
So that's how our dashboard looks at the moment.

66
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,980
We just have to look around and see if there's any anything that would like to change perhaps maybe

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
rotate these labels.

68
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:13,930
And also you can see that the parameters do control your charts and at the same time the chart shrinks

69
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,980
to fit inside the dashboard which is good.

70
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,570
One more thing is that if your parameter for some reason hasn't been added to the dashboard or you deleted

71
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,400
it it's very easy to bring it back.

72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:33,100
So just cancel that and just as you would do for filter you go not quick filter's but go parameters

73
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,960
and you add the parameter back in.

74
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:43,630
So there we go and your parameters here Sibyls groups is above because submission by balances at the

75
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,640
top age groups is at the bottom.

76
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,170
So put that at the bottom.

77
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:55,660
That's pretty much it for the first part of the dashboard process in the next tutorial we will make

78
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,410
this dashboard interactive and adjust the colors a little bit for the dashboard to look awesome.

79
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,410
I look forward to seeing you then and until next time I'll be analyzing.
