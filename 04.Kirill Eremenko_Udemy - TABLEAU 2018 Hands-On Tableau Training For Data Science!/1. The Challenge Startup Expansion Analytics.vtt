00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.540
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo into this Tauriel we're starting a brand new challenge

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.530
which will be solving in this section of the course.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.590
All right so let's look at the brief.

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.290
All right.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.530
You are a daughter a scientist working for a laundry pick up services start up called we watch you sleep.

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.350
This is a relatively small company and they cannot compete with the big players in major cities.

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.030
The company's strategy is to build a vast network in the smaller cities.

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.960
So we wash you sleep already had a strong presence in 140 locations and recently opened stores in 10

9
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.890
new cities.

10
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.110
Additionally the company has two separate sales regions.

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.160
Some just some additional information on top of everything else you have been assigned to analytics

12
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.180
tasks.

13
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.070
Number one identify which of the two cells regions is performing better.

14
00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.920
IEEE outperforms the other in two of the three metrics average revenue per city average marketing spend

15
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.310
per serialist is better obviously an average of Romey Romey says for return on marketing investment

16
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.510
per CD and that is revenue divided by marketing spend and Challenge number two or analytics task number

17
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.510
to identify which of the 10 locations have the best potential for the company to invest more funds into

18
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.590
marketing.

19
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.160
All right so let's talk about this for a second before we proceed to the data sets.

20
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.920
So this company we watch you sleep is a startup one of those startups where or companies where they

21
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.080
come to your house you give them the laundry they take away they wash it and they come back on the next

22
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.670
day.

23
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.390
So basically it's all done.

24
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.900
It can even be done in the morning if you need very urgently.

25
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.460
It takes like a day or two.

26
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.710
And they bring back your laundry and that's it.

27
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.520
So you don't even have to have a washing machine don't have to have a dryer.

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.740
It's it's convenient service so I've used one of those when I was in the U.S. traveling.

29
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.680
Very convenient.

30
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.670
And I know there's some in large cities like I use one in San Francisco.

31
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.400
I don't know about the smaller cities.

32
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.980
So what this company is doing is obviously is a start up you can't compete with big companies like that

33
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.070
that are established in the mall where you can.

34
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.800
But it's tough.

35
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.170
What their strategy is a bit different.

36
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.320
So speaking of strategies this strategy what they could be aiming towards is they would create this

37
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.620
network in the smaller cities and the cities aren't that small.

38
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.720
They're like hundred thousand 200000 300000 people in population.

39
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.290
So they will create a network in those cities.

40
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.970
And then when the bigger companies because it is kind of a new industry where the bigger companies expand

41
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.690
into the smaller cities what this company could do is they could potentially look to be acquired some.

42
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.400
So that is a valid strategy for a company as well to create a network in smaller cities where the big

43
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.470
company comes there is sort of doing everything from scratch they can just buy this smaller company

44
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.850
and rebranded.

45
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.430
And so that could be the reason while that why they're doing this or maybe they could be other reasons.

46
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.070
So basically this is what's happening there in 104 locations are expanding to 10 new cities and now

47
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.380
they have two separate sales what they call two separate sales regions and they're competing with each

48
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.680
other.

49
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.700
So that's also not strategy where you split your company to two and two geographies and then they have

50
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.330
to compete.

51
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.380
So which one outperforms the other guests like bonuses and stuff like that.

52
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.640
So that's an important thing.

53
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.540
So that's they want to find out some metrics there.

54
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.330
And number two is this is probably the more important part of the challenge in the 10 new series.

55
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.330
They want to know which ones are best positioned to get that additional marketing funding.

56
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.920
So if you put that market funding into marketing then you get more water in your investments so that's

57
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.000
what we're going to be researching.

58
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.030
In part 2.

59
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.680
All right.

60
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.010
So that's the challenge.

61
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.140
Hopefully all makes sense.

62
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.310
Pretty exciting.

63
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.900
And where do you get the data set.

64
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.460
Well to get the data set we need a browser.

65
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.520
And as usual we need to go to that super dollar signs dot com slash Tablo scroll down here you'll find

66
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.930
Section 8.

67
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.540
So in this section we've got a startup expansion excel file and U.S. cities population CXXVI file.

68
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.010
Let's have a look at them.

69
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.230
So here's the startup expansion file.

70
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.750
And in this file what we have is the store Id or you should probably say location ID or city ID.

71
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.270
This is where the 150 stores or 150 cities where the company works.

72
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.940
That's those are.

73
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.120
They're just basically abro I.D. in this data set city is the actual city where the company is operating.

74
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.200
State of that city is actually quite important column because for many reasons but also because sometimes

75
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.550
you might get cities that you don't know which state they're in because there might be a city or several

76
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.920
cities with that name in the U.S. So it's also always important to city and state it's like kind of

77
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.590
like Month and Year right.

78
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.430
So you might know which month but you don't know each year so that might be a problem.

79
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.380
So it's always important to know the exact geography or be specific and we'll see an example of that

80
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.520
in the section.

81
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.690
Then the sales region so as you can see they're divided by regions.

82
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.450
So they basically divided by states some states are in the region too.

83
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.800
Some states are in region one right now it's called quite ambiguous.

84
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.410
You can't really tell how it looks on the map but once we create the map it'll seem pretty interesting

85
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.460
how they've divided into two cells regions.

86
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.470
Next we've got a new expansion.

87
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.430
So is this a new city or not.

88
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.260
Basically they're all old except for the bottom 10 which makes sense right.

89
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.140
So they got added at the bottom and then we've got the marketing spend how much wasn't missing to market

90
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.530
and revenue.

91
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.510
And so by the way in in this specific challenge it's interesting how or something to note is that Romey

92
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.180
a return marketing investment is called good revenue divide marketing spend sometimes Romey this metric

93
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.020
is Calcott as profit divided by marketing spend so be careful.

94
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.690
Like it depends on the situation or it depends on the definition.

95
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:18.470
In this case it's revenue to my liking spend and then we've got another file you as city's population.

96
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.860
So basically it's a file with half the population of the top 300 U.S. cities.

97
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.350
They're actually more than 300 U.S. cities up to here.

98
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.570
A quick hint.

99
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:36.560
All of our cities the ones we're looking at these ones here they're actually part of this top 300 So

100
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.710
they're there in here and we will have the population information on those cities from here so that

101
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.510
you don't need to worry about that as long as we have.

102
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:50.810
This file will have the population will be using column 215 estimates so there's a 2010 actual census

103
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.110
data.

104
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.010
2015 is an estimate but we'll be working with this because it's more recent.

105
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.330
And then there's some additional information but that's just an example of when you have additional

106
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.260
information that you won't be using in your analysis although based on the things you learn in this

107
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.430
section of the course you can definitely experiment with this additional information and see if that

108
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.890
might somehow affect your cluster analysis and stuff like that so that's also just to get some extra

109
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.810
data in case you want to play around.

110
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.160
All right so there you go.

111
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.650
That's what we have for the section.

112
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:29.540
We've got two data files and we have our challenge for this part of the Course is going to be a very

113
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.470
exciting Tauriel we're going to talk about some cool analytics So this first part is going to be all

114
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.860
about geographies and mapping.

115
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.490
The second part is going to delve into some more advanced stuff.

116
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.190
You talk about clustering and we're also going to talk about trends or building forecasts or actually

117
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.450
like models or regression models.

118
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.010
On top of clustering and then we'll also talk about cross data said Joines and a few other things so

119
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.170
exciting challenge ahead exciting section ahead.

120
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:05.000
I look forward to seeing you on the tutorials throughout this section and until next time have analyzing.
