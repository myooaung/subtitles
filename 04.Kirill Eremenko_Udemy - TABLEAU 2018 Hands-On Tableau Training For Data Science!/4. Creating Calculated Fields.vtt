00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.720
Hello this is Carol and welcome back to the course and Tablo.

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.640
And today we will get to start solving the problem that we have at hand who gets a bonus.

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.030
So we're left off here last time we're just playing it out of Tablo.

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.990
I hope you had a chance to explore further the different buttons and tools the table has to offer because

5
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.150
the more you play around with it the better you get at it.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.960
And it happens very quickly because Tablo is very very intuitive and that's just we're talking just

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.890
about the navigation.

8
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.890
So you know basically where to look for what Rhyno I'll share.

9
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.020
Another cool feature is clear the dashboard so we don't want any of this.

10
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.890
And so there's a button over here.

11
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.550
The red one clear sheet.

12
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.800
And so we're just going to click that and voila everything is gone.

13
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.960
By the way if you're using the Mac or a Mac book some of these layouts might be a bit different.

14
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.620
So just kind of follow along and you will be able to find where they are.

15
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.210
But just bear in mind that there might not be in the same exact place as I'm showing.

16
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.760
OK so let's start answering the question.

17
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.290
We know that we can create Bartsch does this create a bar chart for their representatives and see what

18
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.680
they've sold.

19
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.660
So we want representatives to be kind of in the columns.

20
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.280
So there they are our salespeople and let's see how many units each one of these are present.

21
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.750
So has sold.

22
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.790
There we go.

23
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.550
So we can see that Richard has sold the most units which is great.

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.170
And how about we break it down by region.

25
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.720
So we know that we have three bonus's one for every single one of 1 for the best representative in each

26
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.480
region.

27
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.810
And like this we can't really tell who's the best in each of the regions we can just tell who's the

28
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.790
best overall.

29
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.570
So what we're going to do is we're going to take region and we're going to drag it into columns but

30
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.190
we're going to put it before representative.

31
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.690
So as you can see I'm doing here and I'm just going to let go and what does that do.

32
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:17.100
Well it gives us a kind of another level on top of our presenter.

33
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.020
So first the chart is broken down by regions so that you can see that here I'm just going to make this

34
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.250
a bit smaller so I can zoom in.

35
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.540
So here you can see that the chart is broken down central east and west and then inside every region

36
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.780
is broken down into by Representative.

37
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.880
And so that way we can easily tell who's the best in sales in each of the regions.

38
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.330
So here it's Alex here it's Richard here's James.

39
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.830
And so now share another co-feature.

40
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.910
You can order these bars by their size so if you see this little one here so if you come roll over the

41
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.640
axis this is little bun here so if you click that automatically they're sorted by size you can see how

42
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.580
it drops off.

43
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.320
And you'd think that this answers our question but in reality no it doesn't because units is actually

44
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.640
the number of items that has been sold.

45
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:25.020
But as we know our representatives are actually measured based on the dollar value of their sales.

46
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.780
And so we need to find out the dollar value.

47
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.840
But as you can see here there's no actual dollar value.

48
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.110
Total dollar value of sales we know that.

49
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.760
And it's really really easy to find it to see that because all of our numbers are kept in measures so

50
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.860
we don't even have to look here.

51
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.840
We can see here that we only have units and we only have unit price and we have some of these other

52
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.070
fields which we will talk about further down the course.

53
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.370
But like the ones from our daughter our units and unit price and there's no total dollar value and that

54
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.850
means that we have to create that total dollar value.

55
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.630
How do we do that.

56
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.000
Well it's quite easy you just have to multiply the number of units that are present and have her presented

57
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.070
if had sold by the total unit price for those units.

58
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.600
So if I click our daughter here and go to view data you can see here that when for instance Nick sold

59
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.640
binders he's sold 29 binders at the price of one dollar and 99 cents each.

60
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:35.750
So the total revenue from that sale will be 29 times one dog ninety nine dollars making it somewhere

61
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.620
around $50 for that sale.

62
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.700
So we need to calculate that multiplied value.

63
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.830
And apparently it's not present in our database or in our data set.

64
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.160
So let's go ahead and do that.

65
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.370
Do this in Tablo.

66
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.530
And this is where we talk about creating a calculated field.

67
00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:01.980
So you have to do is right click on measures create calculated field and we'll call it total sales.

68
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.760
And here we will call.

69
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:11.860
We will take unit price or units and we will multiply units by unit price it will click OK.

70
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.660
So now we have a total sales value.

71
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.690
And as you can see there's a little equal sign before the hashtag that means it's a calculated field.

72
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.190
So what we're going to do now is we're going to take total sales and we will drag it onto a chair to

73
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.090
replace the units.

74
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.230
So I'll just drag it exactly on top and as you can see table picks it up and aggregates it just as it

75
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.980
did with units.

76
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.110
The other way to do it is you can take this one off remove it and then take total cells and put it on

77
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.770
where you need to be.

78
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.000
And so now we have some total sales.

79
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.760
And now if we order by this value you will see that we have a different picture.

80
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.590
Now Richard is no longer the best seller overall.

81
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.050
Susan beat him in the East region.

82
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.660
Mathews the best in the central region and James James is still the best in the West.

83
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.210
So now we know who has to serve the bonuses.

84
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.980
Matthew Susan and James.

85
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.900
And that was an example of how to create a calculated field in Tablo.

86
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.070
Hope you enjoyed that.

87
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.420
And I look forward to see you next time when we will be talking about colors.

88
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.280
Until then happy analyzing.
