Hi guys I hope you enjoy that section.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.660
And in this tutorial I just want to show you that you can download all of the videos that we create

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.630
in this course in order to get access to these videos.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.220
All you have to do is bring up a browser and go to my Tablo public profile.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.800
So go to w w w dot public dot Tablo dot com slash profiles slash curial dot Eremenko.

6
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.380
And here you can see that you can download all of the visuals that we create in this course and not

7
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.560
just the pictures but the actual workbooks So we have to do is like this download icon over here and

8
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.920
you download the workbook to your computer and you can open up in tabel.

9
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.580
So hopefully they'll be useful you can use these visuals to either check your work after you've completed

10
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.530
a section or you can just download them before section and follow along if you like.

11
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.740
It's up to you how you'd like to structure this learning process.

12
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.720
But these resources are there to help you if you need them.

13
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.500
And I hope they'll be helpful.
