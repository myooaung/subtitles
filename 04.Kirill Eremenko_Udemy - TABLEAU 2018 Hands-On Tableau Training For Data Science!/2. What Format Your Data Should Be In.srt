00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,920
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,750
And in today's tutorial we will discuss how your daughter should look like when you're importing it

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,890
into Tablo.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,450
Now we've already touched on this topic briefly before but I think it'll be a worthwhile exercise for

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,510
us to discuss this once again and recap on the conclusions that we came up with that time.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,320
So to start off with I'm going to bring up a spreadsheet.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,290
Move some data.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,840
So here you have a spreadsheet that might look familiar because we did talk about it previously in the

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,280
course but this is a spreadsheet that tells us about unemployment rates or long term unemployment rates

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:50,310
for different months of the years since 2005 and so on with different genders so for men and for women

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,810
and for the different age groups so 16 to 19 years old 20:24 and so on.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,920
And so this started does look like visually appealing to the human eye.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,700
And here we can quickly derive insights if we need to we can scroll further along and find the right

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,250
year that we or urin motard we're looking at and we right away know that the left column is meant men

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,730
the right columns women and we know which how to select the right age group just because they're nicely

16
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,620
highlighted here.

17
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,890
Also the history has some header information up at the top.

18
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,890
It's got some additional information on the bottom.

19
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,880
Sometimes you might find the species like this will have totals at the bottom as well like we can either

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,600
right now.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:41,120
So here you've got the total and let's just drag got along so well we'll call that total.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,830
So this is not uncommon when there's a total at the bottom of the spreadsheet might be highlighted in

23
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:55,750
a different color as well so or maybe like light blue or something like that and to as humans we can

24
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,960
understand and comprehend this information quite easily.

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,710
But on the other hand it's not the best format for machines so let's have a look at another format that

26
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,800
might be might be used to.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,930
So here is another spreadsheet with the same information and it's got the age groups that period and

28
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,620
here the men and women are split into two separate columns.

29
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,090
And so for that period for that age group you can understand right away what was unemployment for men

30
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,300
or at some point for women.

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,960
And once again they might be a total here as well.

32
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,040
So just copy that down.

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:37,590
And as you can see this information is presented in an appealing way to the human eye.

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,620
But it is not what machines are used.

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,180
It's not what Tablo is used to when you were importing this information.

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,800
And for instance this information is best presented in the following way if you are to put it into table

37
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,620
and that format.

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:00,460
Is this where you've got separate columns for every type of dimension that you have for instance the

39
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,900
age which is split into some bags here.

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,550
The gender is a separate dimension.

41
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:12,210
And then you've got the period so period of time the month that you're looking at.

42
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:19,660
And then finally you've got the measure for which is aggregated at the lowest level of granularity that

43
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:19,990
you have.

44
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:25,900
So when you take the age the gender and the period into account you've got that value over here so it's

45
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:34,600
basically just columns of data rather than some visually appealing formatted data which we had here

46
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,320
and here.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,570
So what you need to make sure when you're putting got into Tablo is that it is formatted as close to

48
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,940
this as possible ideally has to look like this.

49
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,910
And that means that you need to take out all these headers any possible margins that your daughter has.

50
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:56,110
You have to kind of unpick it the views and put all of these these months into a column and give that

51
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:03,250
column a name called Month or time period and put the genders into court and to call them also to get

52
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,290
rid of the totals because you don't need the totals and tablet you can get them in trouble if you need

53
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,200
them.

54
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,630
And here what they're only.

55
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:17,370
All they're doing is they're good for visual analysis but they will confuse you if you bring them into

56
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,400
Tablo that might cause discrepancies in your daughter.

57
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:27,880
Also sometimes you might find that dot is structured in a way that if a value becomes repeated then

58
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,350
there is no value there.

59
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,810
So for instance it could be like this.

60
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,940
And so that basically means that all of these are January all of these February febrile of these are

61
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,530
March.

62
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:44,440
Well for Tabeau to understand the data you also need to once again fill in the blank spaces of your

63
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,300
data and you can all do all this in Excel if you need to.

64
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:56,890
However the good news is Tablo has some advanced features in its daughter import functionality which

65
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,350
will help you do a lot of these things and and actually allow you to do a lot of these automatically.

66
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,130
And so that's what we will be looking at in the next tutorial will be talking about the dot interpreter.

67
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,630
And I look forward to seeing you next.

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,000
Until then happy idolising.
