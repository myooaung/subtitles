00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.420
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:15.020
And today we will continue with the analysis of the demographical segmentation of our member base or

3
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.550
customer base for this bank.

4
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.260
So here we've got the gender chart that we created previously.

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.060
It's a pie chart.

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.860
And by the way with pie charts people don't really like them.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.690
In analytics and musicians and that is the case when you have like more than three or four elements

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.730
to a pie chart gets very clever.

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.370
In this case we only have two male and female so I think it's OK to create a pie chart but it's up to

10
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.740
you.

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.370
You're more than welcome to substitute with this.

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.270
This for different visualization.

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.380
If you think a pie chart pie charts not the best way to go here.

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.580
So we're going to change the name here to gender and we're going to create a new tab and this time we're

15
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.690
looking at Age.

16
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.890
So this is going to be interesting because we have age here and we want we want to see how many people

17
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.290
there how our member base is distributed across this age across the different.

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.450
So if we take age and get dragged into columns and you see take some of age right away but if we change

19
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.970
this from a measure to a dimension so whoops not an attribute or dimension.

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.360
So basically disaggregated and take a number of records and drag it into Rose.

21
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.710
You'll see this curved line here.

22
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.130
So it's basically telling us how many people they are in for each individual age.

23
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.570
So for 35 years old there's 163 people for 36 years old is 183 people and so on.

24
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.910
And but this is not exactly what we want and even if we changed.

25
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.970
Not really what we're looking for we don't want every single age demonstrated here Imagine if our ages

26
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.170
weren't given in integers soak in whole numbers what if they were given in floats or doubles.

27
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.180
So basically if we had in our database in our data sets.

28
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.300
I'll just go here today said if our daughter said we didn't have twenty one twenty one point five and

29
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.250
thirty four point three and thirty point four and so on this it wouldn't work.

30
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.580
This doesn't look as good but it wouldn't work even as good as this so we need to do something about

31
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.700
it.

32
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.710
And this is where we talk about creating bins and basically breaking up our ages into different groups

33
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.140
so five.

34
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.800
Let's say for instance five year bans from 15 to 20 from 20 to 25 and so on and seen how all membership

35
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.810
is distributed across those bands.

36
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.950
So let's go ahead and do that.

37
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.190
Very it's very simple to create beings or groups for a variable in Tablo.

38
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.690
So as long as it's a measure basically it's a numerical variable.

39
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.390
All we have to do is you have to right click on the variable that you want to create bins for and then

40
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.740
you go to create.

41
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.660
And Ukraine builds.

42
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.620
Simple as that and size of bins in our case it's going to be five because we want five year bans and

43
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.780
we'll leave it as age been.

44
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.820
Click OK and as you can imagine age bin goes into dimensions because now it's no longer a numerical

45
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.130
variable it is a categorical variable.

46
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.460
We've broken up our data into categories and now we take age bin and drag it into columns and we take

47
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:36.290
total number of records or number records and Dragon rows we get a beautiful distribution which tells

48
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.320
us how a member base is distributed across five year bands.

49
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.640
So in 15 to 20 so 15 is inclusive 20 is not inclusive in 15 to 20.

50
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.840
There's 54 pick up 50 for me.

51
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.480
50 for customers 20 to 25.

52
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.730
There's 108 to customers and 400 to one and so on.

53
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.330
If you want to you can add the if you press and hold control and you drag some number Records label

54
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.110
you'll get the number at the top.

55
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.560
But we don't want the number at the top right now.

56
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:18.260
What we want is we want to change this to a table calculation and it is useful sometimes in a distribution

57
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.510
to know the total.

58
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.740
So how many in total people there were in a certain age band.

59
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.650
But what we want right now is we want a percentage and why we want a percentage Why did we not curious

60
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.010
about the total is because this chart is going to work together with our map in a dashboard and I'll

61
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.130
map already has a totals so I'll map already has the absolute number and that's why we changed gender

62
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.660
to a percentage and that's why we're going to change this to a percentage as well because we don't really

63
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.600
need to know the total twice.

64
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.280
We don't need to know it in the map and in the breakdown that's more useful here to know the percentage.

65
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.880
So we're going to click this drop down as we did previously.

66
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.480
Quick table calculations and here will do percentage of total.

67
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.670
And boy right away it has changed from a absolute figure to the percentage of total.

68
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.400
So what we want now is we want to hide this label at the top edge.

69
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.190
We don't need this.

70
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:31.240
We want to change the name of the chart to age distribution or distribution by age probably better by

71
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.960
age and now in our worksheet we want to format it so free right.

72
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:46.730
Oh actually first we're going to change this edit access and here percentage of total number of records.

73
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.900
Percentage of customers.

74
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.220
And now we want to right click on anywhere in the chart click Format and we will change this to keep

75
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:05.680
it consistent 12 and black or dark bold and to finish off what we're going to do is we will take some

76
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.890
number of records which is a percentage and drag it into color.

77
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.890
So now we can see the dark blue.

78
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.090
And there you go we've got a beautiful distribution here.

79
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.550
Ready to go into our dashboard which will create very very soon.

80
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.180
That's all for today.

81
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.770
I look forward to seeing you next time when we will continue with our analysis of the segmentation.

82
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.320
And until next time happy idolising.
