00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,660
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,370
And today we're looking at filter's important lecture today.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,520
But before we get to it I want to talk to you for a favor.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,660
So I know we're not finished over the course yet but I would really appreciate if you could leave a

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,080
review for this course.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:26,250
We're we've done a few modules so far and if you like the materials please go ahead and click the button

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,560
at the top of the course which looks like this and just choose the number of stars that you think the

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,470
course deserves and leave a review if you like if you don't want to write it you think just choose the

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,890
number of stars and click submit.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,310
The reason I'm asking now is because a lot of students don't finish the course to the end for whatever

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,870
reason.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,380
And I definitely hope it's not.

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,030
You're not going to be that student.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,190
I hope you get to the end but at the same time I would really appreciate a review because it helps me

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,800
understand whether you like the course or not.

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,290
And also it helps other students who are considering taking this course undecided whether it's worth

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:58,790
their while.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,550
So I would be very happy if you could do that for me today.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,520
And now let's get back to the show.

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,860
So we're talking about filter's today.

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,640
We've got this area chart that we created last time which if you ask me looks pretty amazing already.

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,930
We're just going to add a bit of formatting to it at the end of the lecture.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,990
But how can we add a filter.

24
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,090
So what's information is missing currently on this chart.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,930
The information that's missing is gender.

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,510
We've got the age groups and we've got the unemployment rate split by months but we can't see gender

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,040
here.

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,830
So one way to add gender is by putting gender into a filter.

29
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,220
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:47,070
So to do that you have to take gender or the variable that you want to add as a filter and put it into

31
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,660
the filter shelf.

32
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,760
And it's as simple as that.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,300
There we go.

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:02:00,210
So now you've got this filter menu pop up and you can specify the kind of settings or set up your filter.

35
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,730
So here we go into select food.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,910
We are allowing this filter to work by selecting from a list and there's only two values men and women

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,440
custom value lists.

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,900
I don't normally use that you could add like your own types of values use all.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,500
So normally you stick with this select from list and this is for like dimensions.

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,220
We'll see.

41
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,570
We'll look at a filter for measures in a second so wild card usually I don't use any of these these

42
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:34,950
are more advanced kind of things that you use in very specific cases so we won't stop on them right

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,660
now because if you really need them you can understand them.

44
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,660
But to be honest with you I very rarely.

45
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,460
I don't think I've ever used the wildcards in my filters.

46
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,270
That's when you have huge lists that you're filtering from.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,290
So we'll just stick with general and for now we'll just select all and the other thing that you need

48
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,120
to know here is you can select exclude and what that will do is it will allow you to filter what you

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,370
don't want to see.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,420
So if you had like 10 values then you could click exclude and not allow you to cancel out a few rallies.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,090
But right now we're just going to select what we do want to see.

52
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,740
So we'll click.

53
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,840
All will click OK.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,250
And now you can see the chart and change because we selected both genders but now we have gender is

55
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,040
a filter.

56
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,060
And so if I want to change the filter I click filter and say I want to see the chart only for me and

57
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,710
then I click OK.

58
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,380
Then you can see the chart change because now it's only unplumbed for men and the access is much the

59
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,500
top value or the Maximillian X is much smaller because there is less unemployed people because we're

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,160
only looking at a subset.

61
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,850
Now for one to change it for women you check that and check that you could apply the Chara's changing

62
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,020
in the back there.

63
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,900
So that's all great but that is quite tedious Don't you find like you have to click the filter every

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,900
time and then change it and then close it again.

65
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:58,440
So that's when Tablo there is a solution there's a quick filter and we're going to learn that right

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,300
now as well.

67
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:07,260
So in order to bring up a quick filter you need to right click on the filter and select Schalkwyk filter

68
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,740
and just click that and you will see this quick filter pop up over here so it's quite far away.

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,330
How about I just put it there.

70
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,480
So I'll put it there for now.

71
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,990
But usually you keep them on the left.

72
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,490
I'll put it there just for our convenience so I can zoom in a bit.

73
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,860
And so here if I uncheck men you can see the chart is changing right away.

74
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,290
And check women Chartists changing so I can take all of them are the child disappears.

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,810
Very handy thing to have this quick filter because it helps you quickly analyze your data.

76
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:48,570
You can change it to type of quick filter you want to see and you can look you can see these different

77
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,820
types or it can be a drop down single slide.

78
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,240
So what we're going to do is we're going to actually put this one back here and now I'll bring up a

79
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,320
quick filter.

80
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,410
So actually what I'll do is I'll make my table a workbook smaller so we can zoom in like that.

81
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,180
There we go.

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,760
So now what we're going to do is we're going to add a filter for H because there's a lot more value

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,780
as we have an age and will be a bit handy.

84
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,850
So let's just do that.

85
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:23,570
Well put Asian to filter will select often I'll apply and will also create a quick filter for age.

86
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,940
There we go so that's a quick filter for age.

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,080
And now you can see how we can customize this filter.

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,300
So first of all we can uncheck certain values and as you can see they will disappear from the chart.

89
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:43,640
So this is not the best thing to have for this chart because we do want all groups of ages in unemployment

90
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,810
in this chart but we're just looking at it like this for now because it's a good example.

91
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,820
So you see we can uncheck the values we don't want to see and the chart changes right away dynamically

92
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,780
right in front of us.

93
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,180
So then we can just select separate ones.

94
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,270
But once again there's that option to highlight.

95
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,870
So you wouldn't need to do that ever if you have this highlighting option and then next what we're going

96
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,760
to do is we're going to look at the types of filters you can have so say you can have a single value

97
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,330
list if you only want to see one at a time.

98
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,430
Then you can just do these radio boxes.

99
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:24,920
And also you have this option also with filters you have the option to remove this all values so I can

100
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,410
check and then there's no old values so you have to select an option from the list.

101
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,150
But in our case we actually need the whole the whole year.

102
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,100
So how about we can also have like a single value dropdown.

103
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,750
So it's like a radio box but it's a drop it's a bit more convenient.

104
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,870
What else you can do like multiple values drop down so you can check that.

105
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:56,240
So it just kind of makes compact you can do a wildcard match where you type in 20 to 24.

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,350
Let's see that pick up the value that you're looking for.

107
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,070
So there's a lot of different options for filters and the more for convenience.

108
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,820
So that's that's pretty much that's I'm just going to get rid of this one because we don't need age

109
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,750
as a filter.

110
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:19,640
The other one I wanted to show you is we'll probably have a look more at measures as filters in the

111
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,370
next section because it will be more relevant there.

112
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,000
So we'll definitely have we'll definitely look at that in a bit more detail.

113
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,970
But just so that you know you can add filters and they are very easy to use so in this case if somebody

114
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,420
wants to analyze only men or women he can select from here so actually I mean is going to change this

115
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,690
to single value from list.

116
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,010
And that makes more sense so you either looking at everybody looking and just men or just women and

117
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,750
the chart adjusts dynamically and you can just look at exactly what you want to see.

118
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:01,400
So as promised we're just going to quickly fix up the formatting here so we'll just go format and make

119
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,420
it like a 12 and be unemployed and then we'll take a format here as well.

120
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,590
Make it a 12 and a B and make this a bit bigger.

121
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,860
So there you go.

122
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,750
There's a chart it's ready for export.

123
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:24,050
If you really want you can add some text it here just to replace this label that's missing.

124
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,770
But otherwise I think it looks probably quite good.

125
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,440
And yeah.

126
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,770
So that's all for the section.

127
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,600
Hope you enjoyed creating this chart.

128
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,330
We learned quite a lot of new things and make sure to do the quiz because that will help you solidify

129
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,010
your knowledge and to finish off.

130
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,720
I just wanted to remind you I would really appreciate if you could leave a review that would mean so

131
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,370
much to me.

132
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,040
Thanks a lot for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next section.

133
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,210
Until next I'm happy analyzing.
