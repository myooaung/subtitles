00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.450
Hello and welcome to their course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm so glad to see you inside.

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.670
We're going to have fun along the way and I promise you that you learn a ton.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.220
And in this short tutorial what I wanted to do is give you a quick overview of what Tablo is and what

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.140
it is for.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.270
And then we will go through the section of the course and I will show you what to expect in each section

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.400
so you can navigate your way through the course much easier.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.660
So let's get straight into it.

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.070
Tablo is a very simple yet powerful tool for everything to do with data.

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.570
The company's mission is to help people see and understand data.

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.280
And as you can see here Tablo is a completely drag and drop software and using Tablo you can create

12
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.760
visuals sometimes 10 times faster than you would have created them in other programs and overall travel

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.100
is a new and innovative approach to business intelligence in terms of structure.

14
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.320
The course has a spiral structure and what that means is that with every new section you move up a level

15
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.560
in the spiral learning new skills and techniques while still repeating and cementing in the older ones

16
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.120
that you picked up earlier.

17
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.680
And so let's have a look and see what we have here in the first section that's the one we're in right

18
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.210
now.

19
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.300
You will install Tablo and then a radio lecture 3 you will see how you can create a powerful visual.

20
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.520
And moreover you will create it in under five minutes and it's the same visual would've taken hours

21
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.360
to create using other tools.

22
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.840
Then in section 2 we will talk about the basics of tablets so I'll show you how to connect to different

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.430
data sources.

24
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.410
We will navigate Tablo we will learn how to create Calcott fields so it's an important topic.

25
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.620
And I specifically included early on in the course so that we can play around of calculated fields along

26
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.430
the way as we learn new techniques.

27
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.380
We'll talk about collar's formatting and exporting your results.

28
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.650
So all the basics will be covered off in this first section and after that you can already started applying

29
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.250
Tablo.

30
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.560
So applying the basic level of tabel in your work if you required to do so then in section 3 we will

31
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.250
go into a bit more depth.

32
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.610
We will start talking about time series which is an important part of working with Tablo so visualizing

33
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.250
trends and how things change over time.

34
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.160
We will talk about filters but most importantly in this section we will talk about aggregation aggregation

35
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.820
and granularity.

36
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.830
So is this lecture here and there you will see how tablet operates and what concepts are behind the

37
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.720
tool was happening in the background when you're dragging and dropping things into the charts.

38
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.230
It's important lecture because it's important to understand how the tool works to take full advantage

39
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.030
of it going forward.

40
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.630
Next in Section 4 you will already create your first dashboard.

41
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.420
That is how quickly will get tougher as dashboards.

42
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.940
So we will create maps.

43
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.720
A map will create a scatterplot and then we will combine them into a powerful dashboard depicting sales

44
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.840
of a certain store.

45
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.670
And also we will add interaction interactivity dashboard so will add an action which to filter and highlighting

46
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.140
and you'll also see the difference between filtering and highlighting.

47
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.250
Then in section 5 we will kind of take a step to the side and we will talk about joining and blending

48
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.030
so I will give you a full introduction into what joining is so left or right.

49
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.720
Inner outer joins what happens when Joines move duplicate values and what happens when you joining in

50
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.650
multiple fields.

51
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.980
So I do understand that perhaps you are not coming from an obscure background you might not know everything

52
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.560
about Joines.

53
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.470
So that's why we covered off in the first three lectures.

54
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.060
And then we will talk about data blending and Tablo.

55
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.580
And finally a lot of people are after this topic.

56
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.020
What is the difference between joining and blending data and when to use what we will definitely cover

57
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.350
that off.

58
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.280
So you are a pro in knowing when to use a joint and when to use a blend.

59
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.730
Also in this section we will cover of a dual axis charge which is important and will have an advanced

60
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.670
topic here creating Colcord fields in a blend so I've included it here.

61
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.040
You don't have to do it.

62
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.430
If you feel that you are not ready or you don't really need this information but whenever you do see

63
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.310
that you need this specific skill and trouble you can always come back to the course and watch this

64
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.760
lecture again.

65
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.040
Then after that we move on to the big guns.

66
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.950
We're talking here about creating and a customer segmentation dashboard.

67
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.820
We're introducing lots of new skills like table calculations creating bins using parameters set in geographic

68
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.400
geographical roles at the same time we're creating lots and lots of new charts and then we're putting

69
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.940
them all to a segmentation dashboard which will be very powerful.

70
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:55.130
Then we will analyze this dashboard and you will see how businesses can take advantage of this and serve

71
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.290
the customers better by looking at data and then we will create a storyline.

72
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.200
So storyline's a new feature that was introduced in Tablo 8.2.

73
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.830
And here you will learn how to take full advantage of it and present to audience in the best possible

74
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.250
way.

75
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.300
And finally at the end of the course we'll talk about advanced daughter preparation's this is kind of

76
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.090
a bonus section that I've thrown into the scores because daughter preparation is important.

77
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.640
A lot of new features were introduced that allow you to simplify the process of data cleaning and preparation

78
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.010
for urinalysis.

79
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.700
So definitely an advance section or Moreover important section because this is something that has to

80
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.920
be done every single time but it will get you going through your analysis much faster.

81
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.450
And then in Section 8 we'll be looking and Klosters custom territories and design features.

82
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.790
So here we're going to have a brand new challenge.

83
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.960
It's going to be an exciting challenge where we're going to be helping a start up with some of their

84
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.350
expansion analytics in the section we're going to cover quite a lot of interesting topics such as custom

85
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:06.060
territories we'll learn how to do clustering analytics and Tablo and even a cross database join.

86
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.640
We'll learn two ways to perform custom territories by groups and by geographic Crawl's and then we'll

87
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.520
talk more about these features and specifically will also devote a lot of time and attention to clustering

88
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.050
and tabel because that's an ultra powerful feature.

89
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.410
And also we'll talk about other features such as highlighter and then some new design features and some

90
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.600
mobile features.

91
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.410
And all in all in this section we're going to have a very fun and exciting business challenge for this

92
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.540
startup.

93
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.770
And then finally it will wrap up the course of Section 9.

94
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.200
This section will be presented by Zhanna.

95
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.480
Who is the tablet structure here at superdense size and he'll be presenting the new and exciting features

96
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.300
available within Tablo 2018.

97
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.430
I will hand over to John Pierre to walk you through this section now.

98
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.270
Thank you for the introduction curial.

99
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.930
I am super excited to be presenting this part of the section and cannot wait to get started.

100
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.570
We will be looking at two business challenges within this specific section.

101
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.330
Now fisty will start off by looking at what happens when the only available data we have is from a PDA.

102
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.960
We will be connecting to the PDAF and extracting the data right from inside Tablo.

103
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:24.310
Yes who knew it was possible right from they will be looking at using special falls which will be required

104
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:31.570
when the Tablo built in state of geographical rolls are not sufficient for this specific business challenge.

105
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.340
Talking about the challenge we will then dive right into solving it and we will be looking at the safest

106
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:42.700
box with in New York City using real life data after the business challenge we will be looking at.

107
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.470
One of the excellent features and one of my favorite features with the tablet the is in tooltip.

108
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:54.340
This is a new way to build and interact with your visualization to progressively reveal additional details

109
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.680
about your data really really handy.

110
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.700
We'll finish this section off by looking at useful improvements that tableau has made in the last couple

111
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.350
of versions.

112
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.330
Firstly by looking at the upgrades on how to blow Stow's data and what the benefits are of that.

113
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.610
We've been looking at downgrading the workbook's when you are working in an environment where different

114
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.050
visions of Tablo is being implemented.

115
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:23.950
And last year we'll be looking at some improvements to the way stories are being used in temblor.

116
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.680
I am super excited cannot wait for the section and I will see you then.
