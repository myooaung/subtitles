00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.710
Hello and welcome back to the of today's hands of course.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.870
And today we're finally going to start visualizing.

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.760
All right let's do it this time.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.890
Let's get into it straight away.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.200
So we've got our data set here.

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.650
We discussed what we're doing already how we're looking for correlation between variables and seeing

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.450
which variables can perhaps predict that a person will take up a term deposit.

8
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:36.090
And today we need to go to our sheet sheet 1 we here let's click this button and this takes it to a

9
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.840
completely different workspace.

10
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.270
So this workspace the data workspace is where you load the data.

11
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.800
This workspace is where we actually create zation in Tablo.

12
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.150
So I know it might be a bit confusing but don't worry you'll get used to it.

13
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.570
It's very intuitive it's all drag and drop and very straightforward as well.

14
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:04.090
So without too much preamble we're just going to start visualizing and you will get the hang of what

15
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.570
we're doing as we move along.

16
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.010
All right.

17
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.230
So we're going to take over HBOS which you can see here on the left dimensions and measures and by the

18
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.550
way you also notice that some things you will get a hang of some things you probably won't because Tablo

19
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.710
is even though it's a very intuitive tool a simple tool.

20
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.680
It does require a bit of learning and but that's like that's a topic for a separate course like we have

21
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.060
a course on Tablo your work work and to explore that or there's tons of materials free materials online

22
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.830
where you can learn Tablo bits and pieces of how to do things in Tablo.

23
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.430
You can also take other courses.

24
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.490
There are lots of courses available to help you.

25
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.950
So let's have a look and see how we go and take this variable Y which is the variable we're trying to

26
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.860
predict and we'll put it in color.

27
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.690
And next what we're going to do is we're going to look at.

28
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.680
We're going to build a like a way for us to position and allow us to compare how a certain variable

29
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.620
works I'm just going to check here we're going to start with a variable called contact whereas contact

30
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.290
there is contact.

31
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.420
If we go back here is that until there is contact communication type.

32
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.070
We call them by cell cellular.

33
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.980
Do we call them on their mobile or on their land line.

34
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.050
In the last context of the current campaign.

35
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.610
All right.

36
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.780
So let's have a look.

37
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.790
We're going to take a contact and we're going to put it.

38
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.170
We're going to put contact in to just drag contex into columns so you can see here cellular telephone

39
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200
and then we're going to just take a number of records.

40
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.120
So that's the number of rows in each of those categories.

41
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.230
We're going to drag it into rows over here.

42
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.000
As you can see it's telling us right away it's very smart.

43
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.490
It's already built a bar chart for us.

44
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.860
Let's make some space here and telling us how many people were contacted.

45
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.320
So we're going to take this on a Windows hold down control on a Mac hold down command to copy it.

46
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.770
So if I just drag the whole thing down you'll see that right next to the modeless is just like a little

47
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.570
square or rectangle if but if you hold down command on a Mac or control the windows there's a plus meaning

48
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.500
that you're copying this and copy it into a label.

49
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.830
Drag it into a label.

50
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.400
Now all of a sudden we have a label which tells us all right how many people did we actually contact.

51
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.950
By the way if you want to change the colors you can click Edit colors and you can change them more here.

52
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.500
So just click now and you can change it to a bowl or whatever but I'm just going to keep our color current

53
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.510
color.

54
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.520
All right so it tells us that we contacted on cellular and contacted about 26000 people of them.

55
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.550
Three thousand eight hundred fifty three said yes to the term deposit.

56
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.460
Eventually did subscribe to the term deposit.

57
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.060
And then 20 2291 said no.

58
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.390
And out of the landline 787 said yes and $14000 rediscount said no.

59
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.070
OK.

60
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.420
So that doesn't tell us much because we can't really compare them.

61
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.370
So which one is better is it better to call in mobile or is it better to call it a lot like who who

62
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.960
is more likely to say yes.

63
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.690
So we currently compared them right here because they are different in size right.

64
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.930
Because this this bar is generally bigger so we can really tell what the percentage of people we called

65
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.070
here is greater than the percentage of people we called here or not.

66
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.580
So that's exactly what we're going to do.

67
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.230
We're going to introduce the percentages so we're going to convert this from just a sound to a percentage

68
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.360
so click the dropdown and click quick table calculation percentage of total.

69
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.680
And then you go to we're going to click this dropdown again and we're going so I compute using table

70
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.830
down instead of table across is now calculating the percentage several down.

71
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.550
And to illustrate what it's calculated we're going to and I'll take this again and again move it to

72
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.810
label holding down command and control so we copying it into here.

73
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.630
And this time it's going to the label because it's different because we've already made modifications

74
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.890
and so this one is the one for modifications.

75
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.710
Absolute value is the percentage.

76
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:23.440
And here we're going to click Format when you go to our numbers we get to that percentage and we're

77
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.290
going to change the decimal places too.

78
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.620
Yeah let's just do zero decimal places for now we'll change it back if we need to.

79
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.710
So there we go.

80
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.760
So that should be a bit better now bit better formatted.

81
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.310
And so now we can see that the total in both cases is 100 percent right.

82
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:51.040
And for for our reference we still have our previous label here which says how many people we actually

83
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.530
contacted.

84
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.020
Absolute values are referenced here in the 22000 or 91 three thousand three hundred fifty three.

85
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.250
But now we've converted this table into percentage table.

86
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.990
And so this is what we're we going to be doing we're going to be just comparing visually what is better.

87
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:15.420
You know what percentage is the high percentage or what percentage which which would approach Celera

88
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.020
or a mobile or landline has a higher conversion rate.

89
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:27.210
So in the case of mobile 15 percent of people out of their respective absolute value here 15 percent

90
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.590
of people said yes eventually and out of the landline only 5 percent people said yes eventually out

91
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.530
of the absolute number here.

92
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.930
And that way we can compare them side by side because they are not there they are no longer relative

93
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.620
there they're no longer absolute value they're in percentage terms so we can make this comparison.

94
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.310
And so next time when we contact someone it's pretty obvious that if we have an opportunity to call

95
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.070
on mobile we should call mobile because it looks like people are more likely to respond.

96
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.320
Yes it might be like the reason for it might be you know maybe people are more friendly on mobile or

97
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.740
maybe just the people who still use landline are not that interested in our product and the people who

98
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.110
were contacted by mobile maybe they just don't have a landline.

99
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.950
And that way we'll just pick out those people that have mobile on their college rather than landline.

100
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:28.590
So the underlying fact the underlying real world reason for it can vary.

101
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.790
But what we can see from the data is disputable.

102
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.360
We can see that this percentage is higher than this one an's numbers are quite high.

103
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.280
Also it doesn't look like just a random error it doesn't feel like this happened randomly It looks like

104
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.070
a trend pattern.

105
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.990
That's what we're looking for patterns.

106
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:55.300
So there you go that's our first analysis of age one variable.

107
00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.730
How do you feel this is this is what I call what I personally call visual data mining.

108
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:10.060
We're using a visual tool to extract insights from data through through site through our eyes rather

109
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.410
like through images rather than performing analysis.

110
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.990
And this is like performing complex machine learning type of analysis.

111
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.070
And this is what I mentioned at the very start that the way we're going to approach this problem like

112
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.540
this problem is this problem here is a classic problem for data sets.

113
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:36.910
And usually the way it's solved is through machine learning through applying some sort of machine learning

114
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.110
algorithm to predict this variable.

115
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.130
And that's what you will do and learn in the Python part of the course and the next part of the course

116
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.560
which is dedicated to introducing you to machine learning.

117
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:57.060
What I wanted to show you here is that even complex problems like this we can still solve not or not

118
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:03.520
as perfectly or as amazingly as you could do with machine learning but we can still get the insights

119
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.880
into these problems with very simple tools.

120
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.600
It took us it took us like five or 10 minutes to set this resolution up.

121
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:18.040
And as you'll see in the next tutorials we will punch out like another five at least of these very very

122
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.040
quickly based on what we already have.

123
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:26.470
But the underlying point is that machine learning is great and it's always good to go down that path

124
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:32.650
but also the whole just idea of data science is much broader than just machine learning and you can

125
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:38.950
use visualization tools like Tablo not just to create beautiful visuals but also to perform data mining

126
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.090
and get insights very very quickly.

127
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:48.060
And you know act on them and make recommendations based on those insights.

128
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.760
So there we go.

129
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:55.900
That's our start into the world of data mining and congressional making your first step in the next

130
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.220
tutorial will continue.

131
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.240
I will quote you there and until then enjoy Davison's.
