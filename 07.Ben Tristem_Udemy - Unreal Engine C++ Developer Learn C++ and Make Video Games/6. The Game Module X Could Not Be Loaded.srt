Hello everybody and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,270
In this lecture I want to show you an error and potentially how to fix it.
2

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:17,530
So occasionally when you launch an Unreal project especially like this you may end up with an error
3

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,240
message like this in the game module whatever it is you're working on could not be loaded.
4

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,540
There may be an issue.
5

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,020
Now if this does happen one of the solutions to solving such an issue is this will crash now is going to
6

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,810
your binaries folder within your project and deleting it.
7

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,450
What that will enable us to do now is Unreal.
8

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,610
will rebuild those binaries so it will take a little bit longer for Bull Cow Games to open as we can see
9

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:42,970
here.
10

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,740
We got this message again.
11

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,480
We click on yes and it will start to build the projects again for us.
12

13
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,220
So that's a quick tip for you.
13

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,990
I've had this issue a couple of times as I've been moving about machines perhaps something got corrupted
14

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:01,390
during the transfer but you can rebuild that binaries file and as we say it doesn't take that long at
15

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:01,780
all.
16

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:07,450
And we're back into the game so as a quick tip for you if you ever come across that error message.
17

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,730
That's one of the ways of how to solve it.
18

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,730
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
