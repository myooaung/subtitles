If you are using Visual Studio Code with Unreal 4.5, you are going to notice some errors with auto

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,310
complete.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,730
You may notice that includes have red squiggles under them.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:17,100
If you hover over them, they say something undecipherable about cannot open source, file UBC, compile

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,060
platform, blah, blah, blah.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,860
Or you might just have noticed it when you're trying to auto complete an arrow, something like MASH

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,370
arrow here, do an auto complete and there is no suggestions.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,090
Now what's going on here is that there's a bit of a bug in the Unreal Generation code that generates

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,050
this project file.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,880
So if you go and find the file in your project, that will be under the product folder, under DOT V.S.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,350
Code and then see Peepee underscore CVP properties, dot Jason.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,690
Then this is auto generated by unreal to give you auto complete, unfortunately.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,730
At the moment it's not doing a particularly good job.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,140
And if we just closed down this include parts which is very long and that's okay.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,810
The problem is there are no defines in this line here, 238 in my file.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,020
We need to replace that with the defines that I'm providing as a download against this lecture.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,310
And what it's basically saying here is that you need to have a bunch of defined values here that would

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,460
usually be defined for you when you're building a game but aren't being done.

19
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,560
So what we have to do here is just go ahead and replace the whole lines.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,420
Like the whole line and just paste over it.

21
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,880
Because I've got all the defines that you need around there.

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,560
And then we need to just change out a couple of things here, namely where it says, my project, you

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,120
need to change that to the name of your project, which will be the same as the name of the folder.

24
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,060
All of this is in.

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,850
So in my case, it will be simple shooter use the same capitalization here and then uppercase for this

26
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,120
one here where it says, my project is gonna be simple shooter.

27
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,860
And the API version is also going to be simple shooter.

28
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:07,620
And if you save your file, the CCP properties dot Jason safe that you can now go over to the other

29
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,810
files and hopefully your autocomplete will work.

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,840
It may take a little while of rebuilding Intellisense down here.

31
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,140
You can see this little flame icon saying that it's rebuilding Intellisense.

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,230
Often things will change in color after it's done that.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,270
And now you also complete should be working, as you can see here is now given me the auto complete

34
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,090
for the mesh component.

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,660
One thing to note about this fix is that every time you regenerate the product file, you're going to

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,220
have to reapply this fix.

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,100
So you might want to keep your defines dot text handy, but hopefully this will tide you over until

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,270
the next unreal update that I'm in, which I'm sure they will be fixing this issue.
