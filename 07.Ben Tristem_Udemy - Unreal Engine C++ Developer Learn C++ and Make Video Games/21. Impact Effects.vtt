00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.020
Hello and welcome in this lecture, we're gonna be adding an impact particle effect to wherever we hit

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.510
with our rifle.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.860
So let's dive in and see how it's done.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.760
So it's gonna be a quick one because we want to do something that we've already done before, which

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.510
is spawn particle effects that aren't attached.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.790
Now we know this is going to be using the game play static's again.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.370
And let's go ahead and open up that head a file.

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.250
So gameplay static's dot h.

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.840
And we want to search for the spawn emitter within here.

10
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.380
This simple search isn't always reliable, so I'm going to just do a search spawn emitter.

11
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.390
And we are looking for the other versions of this spawner meter at location, that's the one we want,

12
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:03.270
and what we're gonna do is it's going to need the world, the particle system, a location and a rotation.

13
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.070
You could go with a zero rotation, but we actually want a rotation.

14
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.850
So let's go over to the game, to the gun, C++, rather.

15
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.200
And we're gonna use the spawn emitter at location to get world.

16
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.990
In here, and then we are going to give it a particle system.

17
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.960
So we need to go ahead and set one up, I'm gonna leave that blank as a to do for using as we already

18
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.370
had set up particle systems.

19
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.910
And then what we're gonna do, we gonna get the location.

20
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.580
That's fairly straightforward.

21
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.210
That's gonna be the hit location, isn't it.

22
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.610
And then the next thing.

23
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.250
Let me get my spacing right there.

24
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.460
Then the next thing is going to be the rotation.

25
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.200
This is slightly more complicated.

26
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.340
Now, the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna create a vector for the shot direction, which is

27
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.530
going to show us where the shot was coming from.

28
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.390
And this one's fairly straightforward because we've already got the direction it's going in.

29
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.080
So where it's coming from is just going to be the negative of this.

30
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.780
So minus rotation, dot vector is gonna give us the shot direction where it was that shot coming from.

31
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.780
And that's gonna be useful when we're applying damage later as well.

32
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.390
So what direction?

33
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.910
Cool.

34
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.450
Great.

35
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.510
And what we want in here is a rotator.

36
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.270
So you can get a rotator from a vector in C++ just by doing Dott rotation like so.

37
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.780
And that should be enough so we can put a semicolon on the end of the line.

38
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:40.720
So all that remains is a mini challenge for you to fill out this particle system with something that

39
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.640
we can configure in blueprint's.

40
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.640
OK, welcome back.

41
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.620
So we're going to essentially do what we did with the muzzle flash, so I'm going to copy that you property

42
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.610
here instead of the muzzle flash, we're going to have the impact effect.

43
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.840
Like, so and we're going to use that in your game, play static's porn image at location.

44
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.260
Cool.

45
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.500
We're going to remove the draw debug point and we're going to have a go at compiling and playing.

46
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.160
Once you've got that's compile successfully.

47
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.920
We are going to go over to the content browser, open up our BP rifle.

48
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.820
So we need to attach a impact's effect.

49
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.770
Let's open up the book, Full Blueprint editor.

50
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.900
Go to class defaults.

51
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.480
Details impact effect.

52
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.100
Let's look.

53
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.840
See what we can find.

54
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.660
Impacts.

55
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.150
See if you've got something there.

56
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.950
I am.

57
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.210
Nope, no.

58
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.440
I am either.

59
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.270
Maybe it's going to be called hit.

60
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.800
I go got a DrÃ© Wraith drone hits world.

61
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.010
We've got and a few different things down here.

62
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.670
And I think we can also choose some stuff from the shooter game.

63
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.340
Asset packs.

64
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.210
So if we go back to the content browser asset packs, shoot game weapons and not weapons sorry, the

65
00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.640
effects and then particle systems and then weapons, salt rifle impacts.

66
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.510
Who got the.

67
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.760
H impact hate or something.

68
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.370
So we can I think I'm gonna be using that one.

69
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.240
So I h swung our search for assault rifle.

70
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.620
That'll be my impact.

71
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.890
Effect.

72
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.750
I quite liked that one in testing.

73
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.210
So we're gonna go out p but you can try out the other impact effects and try and hit a wall A..

74
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.840
When I hit the wall you can see the impact effect being spawned off of it.

75
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.850
So I'm very happy with that result.

76
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.140
The next lecture we're gonna be dealing damage to actors that we place around the world are exciting.

77
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.250
So I will see you there.
