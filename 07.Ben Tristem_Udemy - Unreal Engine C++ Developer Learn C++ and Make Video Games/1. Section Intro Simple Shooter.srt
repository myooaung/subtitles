00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,870
Hello and welcome to a new section in this simple chute's section, we are going to be making this the

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:15,860
simple through to game and we're going to learn about movement, movements, animation.

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,790
As you can see here, our character is a fully animated third person character.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,540
We are going to be adding all sorts of enterprises to add movement system and the aiming system, an

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,300
animation on top of all of this.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,920
We're gonna be adding a shooting mechanic.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,150
Shooting with possible effects, et cetera, shooting.

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,260
And we're gonna have death.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:44,370
I said we're going to kill off a guy with shooting mechanics and also have health for ourselves.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
Finally, we're gonna have a win lose condition.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:54,150
So if I get shot to pieces, the game's gonna notice that and it's going to restart the mental for and

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,000
display this handy message telling us what's going on.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,490
The same happens if we managed to kill off all the enemies in the level we win and get a similar message.

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,380
Except it's greed.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,930
So to recap, the project plan for the next series of 50 lectures also is going to be, first of all,

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,210
sorting out our player movement, then taking a bit of a deep dive into animation to make our third

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,340
person character look really cool.

18
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,800
We're going to then have some short sorts of shooting architecture and gun architecture discussions

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,500
to allow us to do that shooting.

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,800
Then we're going to have health and death happen for both us and the A.I. We're going to implement an

21
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,470
enemy A.I. using behavior trees and teach you how to make your own behavior tree nodes in C++.

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,710
And then we're going to implement a win lose condition using the game mode and access to the level to

23
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,240
detect whether all the enemies are dead and whether we are dead as well.

24
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,220
So that's a rough outline of the section where in some things we're going to be looping back to multiple

25
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,610
times.

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,160
But this is the main stuff we're aiming to cover.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,900
So let's dive in and get our project set up.
