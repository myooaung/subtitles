00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,580
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,140
In this lecture, we are going to be covering lots of cool things, but most importantly, we're going

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,070
to be looking at how we can child a actor to another actor.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,290
As you can see here, the rifle is a child of the character and how we can make it such that the mesh

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,480
there is actually attached to the hand of this skeletal mesh.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,170
As you can see, that gun is moving around with that player's hand.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,910
Let's dive in and see how it's done.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,830
So the first thing I want to do before putting a gun in the hands of this mash is we want to remove

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,280
or hide the gun that is currently there.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,910
Now, I find that the easiest way of doing this is to hide the bone that has the gun mash.

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,520
Let's have a look.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,940
So if we go over to the shooter character, BP would be a good entry point for this.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,930
And then I want to fine.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,180
Go to the actual MASH.

15
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,890
Hey, we got skeletal mesh.

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,090
And if I go to the skeleton, then we can find that there's a gun here.

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,800
If I click on the gun has got a bone leading up to it called the weapon bone and weapon underscore.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,160
Ah.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,500
And basically want to hide this.

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,070
But the easiest way to hide this across the board is going to be to do it in code and we're going to

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,010
do it in C++.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,310
So the first thing is to get hold of the mesh components.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,120
The way to do this when you're on a character subclass is to call to get mesh cool.

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,500
So we've got to get mesh.

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,250
Then with the mesh, we want to hide the bone.

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,080
There is hardly a hide bone by name methods.

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:46,460
And this actually exists on the parents of these skeletal mesh component, the skin, the mesh components.

28
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,910
Have a look at the head of file briefly.

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,130
Skin mesh component dot h.

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,190
There is a couple of functions here.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,230
The one we're looking for is hyd bone by name.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,020
So you can see the signature here.

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,580
We've got the bone name comes in and F name.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,690
And then the second thing is this e fiers body up.

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,340
Now, as far as I can tell, this isn't used in the code base, but we've got to provide it because

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,490
it's there in the signature.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,470
So let's go ahead and use it.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,950
So Arrow going to do the hide bone by name for Shamai Autocomplete is not working.

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,250
That's a bug in four point two five at the moment.

40
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,280
And V.S. Code Autocomplete doesn't 100 percent want to work.

41
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,570
But that's okay.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,610
We can learn to do the manual way instead.

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,070
Then we're gonna want the name of the bone and I'll leave that up to you as an exercise to fill that

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,970
out in a second.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,060
And then the second thing is we wanted that fiz up body thing.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,420
We're just going to go for that.

47
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,390
That's an enum.

48
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,970
So we're going to need to fill it out.

49
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,320
Got to use f twelve's go to the definition and see what we have got.

50
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,580
MPB o none.

51
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,270
Don't do anything.

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,010
That sounds like a sensible defo.

53
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,330
Let's go with that and then we'll use the semicolon to finish off our line right there.

54
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,740
So let's compile lists and see if we've got all the includes we need code.

55
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,050
Looks like it's working.

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,820
So we must have all the includes we need.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,740
Now let's.

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,860
What's your challenge is to put in the Bowen name.

59
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,030
Give that a quick go mini challenge and come coming back.

60
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,650
The boat name is Weapon Unschool.

61
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,730
Ah, it was hinted that a little bit before weapon underscore.

62
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,270
Ah should do the trick.

63
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,380
If we go ahead and recompile with that now and we hit play, you can see that he's no longer holding

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,130
a gun.

65
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,790
Fantastic.

66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,990
So the next thing is to put a different gun in his hand.

67
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,740
The axe, the gun.

68
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,120
So we need to go over to our skeleton and what we want to do here is add in a new socket.

69
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,710
So we're going to add in a socket in place of our weapon.

70
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,940
And what is the socket?

71
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,170
A socket.

72
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,560
What as it sounds like a plug socket is something that you can plug in.

73
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,530
It's a point at which you can plug in other things.

74
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:04,740
So you might want to be able to plug in, for example, a gun and you want it to be child ID, not to

75
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:11,940
the mesh as a whole, but to a specific bone of that mesh, which means that it will move correctly

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,420
with the character's arms when he's doing an animation, when he's jogging around.

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,320
It's going to look like it's attached to his hand rather than somewhere on it.

78
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,200
You know, not rigidly fixed to his torso.

79
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,670
So we're going to add a child socket to a weapon.

80
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:26,840
OK.

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,480
Do this.

82
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,610
You go to the skeleton, you right.

83
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,420
Click on the bone that you want to attach this socket to.

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,310
And you click add socket.

85
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,580
And we're just gonna call this one the weapon.

86
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,160
Socket, I'm using Camil case here as my convention.

87
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,800
And that's what we're going to want to attach to now.

88
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,740
You'll see where this comes in handy when we go to actually do the attachment for our gun.

89
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,950
Now, the thing to note here is that we don't want to do a set up attachment, as we would do in the

90
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,990
constructor at runtime.

91
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,220
When we do attachment, we have to use a different set of functions rather than the ones we use in the

92
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,760
constructor.

93
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,670
And remember when I said that's the only hierarchy here really is between Sene components.

94
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,410
Now, fortunately, we don't have to go in and get the root components of the gun and attach it.

95
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:24,770
There is a helper method on the actor that allows us to do attachment and that is attach to components.

96
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,050
So let's see where that's defined.

97
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,060
If we go to look at the actor Dot H.

98
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,160
Had a file and there's a couple of these.

99
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,880
We want the one that lives under game framework and we're gonna go and search in here for attach to

100
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,150
component open brackets and find the actual declaration.

101
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,560
Here it is.

102
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,630
So what's this gonna take in?

103
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,940
It's gonna take in a UCM component.

104
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,920
The parent that we want to attach to in this case, it's gonna be our skeletal mesh of the character.

105
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,920
The transform rules will get to this in just a second.

106
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,750
And then they go the socket name.

107
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,800
That's where on a skeletal mesh should we attach to?

108
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,880
If it's a skeletal mesh, it'll attach to the socket if it is not a skeletal mesh in the leg, nor the

109
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,060
socket argument and just attach if it's a static mesh, for example.

110
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,840
So we want to attach to get mesh.

111
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,560
We have these transform rules.

112
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,150
What are those?

113
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,670
Let's click through F 12.

114
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,840
So click through to that.

115
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,280
The different rules that are available.

116
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,380
There's these are the preset rules.

117
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,310
You can define your own, but you might as well use these preset ones.

118
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,860
We've got keep relative transform, keep world transform, snap to target and including Sky.

119
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,470
We'll ignore these.

120
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,630
Lastly, the main two to look out for.

121
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,670
Are these first two.

122
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,190
And it basically means when we're attaching should it stay the same place it was in the world, or should

123
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,520
we use that world position as the new local position?

124
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:51,960
In our case, because we want that gun to essentially be at zero zero, which would be its location

125
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,660
in the world, we want to keep the relative transform.

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,530
So let's do that.

127
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,640
We're going to have the F transform rules, keep relative transform.

128
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,040
So I have transformed rooms.

129
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,130
Rules come on, code on.

130
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,460
And then it should be.

131
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:04,940
Let me see.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,860
Just copy over the keep relative transforms like so.

133
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,910
And then we want the socket.

134
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,620
So again, text macro here.

135
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,060
And then the socket name which was within socket.

136
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,900
And finish off the line, that's going to set up the attachment and now the final point is going to

137
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,820
be to we want to set up.

138
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,780
The gun to have this class as its owner.

139
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,670
This is a bit of a subtle point.

140
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,960
Why do we have an owner?

141
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,020
I just said that there wasn't any hierarchy between actors.

142
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,350
Well, there isn't in the sense of transforms.

143
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,160
But they do have ownership.

144
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,070
And where this ownership really comes into play is in multiplayer and in damage.

145
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,150
So we'll see later on how we will need to know about the owner.

146
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,460
It also allows the gun to know what is the owning character.

147
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,870
And it can use that to get references to the owning character later on.

148
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,920
This will be useful.

149
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,870
The moment we don't particularly care, but we're just going to do it for completeness sake.

150
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,400
Now, I should name this wrong.

151
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,860
It shouldn't be set up owner, but set owner to this because it's the actor that is the owner of the

152
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,050
gun.

153
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,490
Cobain's let's compile and see if this is working.

154
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,210
Compiled, successful, let's dive in and play the game.

155
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,820
Awesome, we have got a weapon in our hands.

156
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,080
Is it in the right place?

157
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,830
Let's have a look.

158
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,460
That's F eight out of here and have a look at the hand.

159
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,630
Not quite.

160
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,060
You can see that we could do a little bit of adjusting here.

161
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,400
So that's what we're gonna do.

162
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,390
And this is a challenge for you.

163
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:46,800
Basically, what you're gonna try and do is find what the offsets should be on the mesh such that this

164
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:54,300
handle is actually inside and meshes Raith character's hand, pulls a video and have a go at that.

165
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,530
Welcome back.

166
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,120
So I'm going to do this by selecting that mesh and trying to move it.

167
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,760
I'm gonna have to set the grid snap size in the viewport to a little bit less.

168
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,910
And I'm going to try and zoom in as best I can on that hand.

169
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,030
OK, bring that down a little bit.

170
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,070
I think that's a good shout.

171
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:24,510
Now, let's go ahead and copy the location and open up to the content browser and open up the BP rifle.

172
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,490
Open the full blueprint, Ed.

173
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:34,140
Go to the MASH and stop simulating and paste the location that we had copied in there.

174
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,190
OK, cool.

175
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,060
Copy that.

176
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,910
And let's go and hit play.

177
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,180
And let's see that it's actually brought across the right thing.

178
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,030
F eight out.

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,390
And zoom in.

180
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,980
By the way, you can use the scroll wheel to slow down your movement when you're moving in this in this

181
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,490
kind of way.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,540
Fantastic.

183
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,740
Looks like he has got his hands directly on the handle.

184
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,330
Awesome stuff, so we have learnt how we can.

185
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:09,060
Child actors to other actors and how we can attach sene components to sockets of skeletal meshes in

186
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,750
the next lecture, we're gonna be looking a little bit at shooting and how the gun architecture basically

187
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,220
dovetails into a shooting architecture.

188
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,340
So I'll see you then.
