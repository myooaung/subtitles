00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.960
OK everybody welcome back.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.540
In this lecture we're going to focus on adding actors to our scene.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.940
So first of all let's have a look at adding more assets to the scene.

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.780
So you've got some trees in the background.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.700
Perhaps we want a thicker forest here are a couple of ways that we could go about doing this.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.910
The first one would be to add these things in manually when we can go into the content browser.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.740
I'm going to pull this handle up here.

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.110
We can go into the environment.

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.440
We can go into the meshes and then we've got a series of objects we can just drag straight into our

10
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.310
scene and we have a tree cluster here that we could do that with.

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.410
The alternative is there are already tree clusters present.

12
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.860
So how about we go to there and copy what's already there.

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.570
This hole down the right mouse button and fly all the way to the set of trees here.

14
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.950
I'm going to select them and then we've got a couple of options.

15
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.280
I can go control sea control V and paste in another set.

16
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.610
It's difficult to sometimes see that that's actually happened.

17
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.480
The other thing that you can do is hold down the old key as you perform the actual translation and that

18
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.280
will automatically copy.

19
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.160
Now one thing to bear in mind when you do that is that you have to hold down ALT for each instance you

20
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.790
can't just keep holding down ALT it won't produce new ones every time you'll have to repress the key

21
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.150
for each new drag.

22
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.380
You can see there we've got a forest appearing in the background so the duplicate key is really awesome

23
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.920
especially when it comes to creating multiple of the same object.

24
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.360
Now of course here we've got an issue with these trees floating in the sky.

25
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.660
I can just highlight them press the delete key and they will disappear.

26
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.070
Now no doubt at some point you will end up deleting the player starts.

27
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.150
This particular actor is really important because when we go ahead and press play it's where we're going

28
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.590
to start in the game.

29
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.870
Now we've deliberately placed it right up against the terminal that we're going to be interfacing with

30
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.150
because it'd be silly every time if we press play we'd have to move to the terminal first.

31
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.960
That's right.

32
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.570
Front and center however you may want to once you've finished off your game to place it elsewhere in

33
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.770
the levels so the player has to move to the terminal first.

34
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.060
That's entirely up to you.

35
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.950
But if he did happen to delete this watch we can go and do now is actively delete it.

36
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.610
So there you go.

37
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.550
Gone if you've noticed.

38
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.180
Then of course you can undo.

39
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.000
But if not what we can do is over on the mode tab so let's make this a bit larger again.

40
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.550
We have a series of options here under basic.

41
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.170
We have the player starts.

42
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.450
You can also of course search up the top here for player and we will find the player starts then it's

43
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.880
a simple action of clicking and dragging the actor into our scene.

44
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.500
Now you see here when we press play once again let's move this.

45
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.700
Make it a bit smaller again there we go when we press play we're a bit too close.

46
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.080
So once again we can come in stop the play selects the player actor.

47
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.460
I'm just going to move around here and pull us back and then press play again.

48
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.120
That looks about right so those press escapes come out of that.

49
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.630
Finally we have the landscape itself.

50
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.690
Now what I'm going to do is give you a small challenge right now to add some additional assets to your

51
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.710
scene to get happy with the process of doing that.

52
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.100
Remember you've got the content browser where you can have a look through the assets that are available

53
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.500
to you within the game we can add a little flower patch if you wanted or perhaps a new paddock for some

54
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.730
additional animals.

55
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.010
It's entirely up to you.

56
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.670
Of course these are just the main environmental measures that you can add in if we go back one level.

57
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.340
We've got the unreal cow in here as well as its own separate entity and then we can go into the meshes

58
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.990
here and we can drag an additional cow in if we wanted to.

59
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.430
And you can see here that it's come in really really small the press the FCC to focus in on our micro

60
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.910
cow.

61
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.840
Very sweet.

62
00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.950
So remember that you can focus on any object that you've got by even pressing the FCC to focus in on

63
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.830
it.

64
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.550
You'll notice that the world out lineup also reflects that we've now got that selected the other way

65
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.760
that we could do this is if we select an object in the world outline.

66
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.110
Let's say this Tree Cluster if we double click on it it will fill up the view.

67
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.760
And once again if I go and try and find my toy cow free we can select it like that as well.

68
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.690
So there are multiple ways of getting to things as there always is with this type of program.

69
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.640
So challenge yourself now to play with the program add some additional mesh objects.

70
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.390
But not too many just so you get the hang of playing with your level because in the next lecture we'll

71
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.160
be editing the landscape itself and what you will end up doing if you're not careful is pushing the

72
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.060
landscape through some of the mesh objects you've already placed there.

73
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.020
So it pulls really.

74
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.220
Now give that a quick go to get used to it and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
