Hello everybody and welcome to this lecture where I get to introduce myself to you bit nerve wracking
1

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,470
because what I'll be doing is taking over the unreal remaster from Gavin who has sadly left us now.
2

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,150
My name is Michael some of you will recognize me already as part of game dev team especially if you've
3

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,590
taken any of the blender courses we've got.
4

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:30,420
However I'm slipping over to the unreal course now to help you guys really master the Unreal Engine
5

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,740
and C++.
6

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,630
So what I've been doing over the last couple of weeks is making sure I'm up to speed with where Gavin
7

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,970
was in the course.
8

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,100
I've been liaising with Daniel student instructor primarily to make sure that any questions that get
9

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,130
repeatedly asked are rancid in the remastered content nothing that's vital to make sure you guys have
10

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,290
a great learning journey and from that we've already decided to add some additional content that was
11

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:02,400
later in the course a bit earlier but in a more basic form now I'll be introducing myself again at the
12

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,160
Bull Cow game so I'll see you over in there and I'm really looking forward to seeing what you guys
13

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,750
end up making with Unreal and I really hope you enjoy the journey as you go.
14

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,690
Take care and I'll see you in one of those future lectures.
