00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,350
Hello, welcome.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,310
In this lecture, we are going to get our foot sliding in order.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,050
As you can see now, if I am walking.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,940
My feet are no longer sliding.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,460
And if I'm running the same, I'm also not sliding.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,620
So let's dive in and see how we can do this by calculating the speed of our animation's.

7
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:28,930
So let's try and fix this foot sliding issue, if I'm movings, especially visible at a slow walking

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,960
speed, you can see he's basically running across the ground.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,670
Now, why is this happening?

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:41,800
The reason this is happening is that in at Blende Space Locomotion, we have got some speeds set up

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,700
here and these don't actually correspond to the speeds of our animations.

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,890
So what we're saying is that in gameplay we're moving at 100 centimeters.

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,740
A second is going to be playing this running animation.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,600
And if this running animation is faster than 100 centimeters per second, you're going to get foot sliding.

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,720
Also, if it's slower, you're going to get foot sliding in both cases.

16
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,620
You'll get foot sliding.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,610
So what we want to do is match up these axes to actually play the correct animation at the correct speed.

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,490
And then interpolate when we're at a different speed.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,520
Obviously, this is going to mean that there is a limitation on our gameplay.

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:25,360
We can't go faster than our maximum animation will allow because we are unable to display that.

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,150
But if you did want to do that and you did once go faster, then you would have to get more animations

22
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,570
and so on.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,780
But as I said, that allows our designer to change up the gameplay first and then we can go and hunt

24
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,250
for animations if it works.

25
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,210
So let's have a look at this run animation.

26
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,220
How can we calculate the speed of this run?

27
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,510
Animation is not automatically told to us by unreeled.

28
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,150
So there's a little bit of maths involved to get there.

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,860
Let's go and find the jog forward animation.

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,310
And we want the jog forward combat in particular.

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,630
Here it is.

32
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,850
And how do we go ahead and get this?

33
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,340
Let's just pause the playing at the animation.

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,970
What we want to see essentially is how fast one of these feet moves across the floor.

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,960
So from the point, it touches down to the point that is starting to leave the floor.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,320
We want to know how fast it moved across the ground.

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,250
And that is the speed of animation to do that.

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,090
We are going to track the speed of the ankle bone.

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:37,270
So if I click into the world, you can see I should be able to select the foot underscore.

40
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,180
Ah, and that is our ankle bone.

41
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,350
And as we move across, you can see that it is moving the rotation.

42
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,210
But notice is not changing the location.

43
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,810
Why is that?

44
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,580
Because of the location shown here is a local rotation, that local location rather.

45
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,420
And that location is relative to the knee.

46
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,270
And it's not actually moving relative to the knee.

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,380
It's only rotating relative to the knee.

48
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,510
So that's why we are getting that.

49
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:09,340
If we switch over to the world location and go ahead a move now, you can definitely see that we are

50
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,070
getting movements in our location.

51
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,370
So we need to switch over to world for this calculation to work.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,910
And then we wants to find two points.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,420
The point at which we land, we are going to want to find out the Y value y the Y value, because that

54
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,500
is this axis here that we're looking at from left to right is the Y axis.

55
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,980
You can see it in the widget at the bottom left of your viewport.

56
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,120
So we're going to want to find the Y value when we hit the floor.

57
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,400
We're also gonna want to find the time at which we hit the floor, which is this second number in brackets

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,140
on our timeline.

59
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,670
The point one nine.

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,640
And we're going to then go and look and find the second time, which is where we're going to leave the

61
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,060
floor.

62
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,230
Find that time.

63
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,180
Find the Y value, and then we're going to apply this formula here.

64
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,150
Let me break it down.

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,660
The first thing is to calculate the foot speed.

66
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,200
We need to calculate the Y at the finish minus the Y at the start.

67
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,060
We want to divide that by the time at the finish divided by the time at the start.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,280
So I'm going to work through this calculation with you or you're going to need is somewhere to capture

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,850
the numbers, such as a new notepad or I'm going to use a new text documents in Visual Studio Code,

70
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,720
just an untitled one.

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,010
I don't need to save it or anything.

72
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,790
And I'm going to open up a calculator on Windows.

73
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,620
It's just easier to do it on your computer because you can copy and paste into it.

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,150
And we're going to start finding some values.

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,370
First of all, we want to find where do we hit the floor about here, which is going to be a time nought

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,530
point one six.

77
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,110
That's type that in to our text documents, one point one six.

78
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,300
Go one six.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,870
Like that.

80
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,180
And what's the Y value?

81
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,000
Best to capture it now because it's gonna be hard to find later.

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,140
It is.

83
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,600
Let's just go ahead and copy it.

84
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,800
It's hard to see my screen resolution.

85
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,690
Points something cool.

86
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,460
Now, that's the start.

87
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,200
Where is the finish?

88
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,540
Let's go and drag the foot across.

89
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:18,910
Around here is probably where we're leaving the ground and is conveniently point three note and the

90
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,720
Y is going to be a negative number now minus two eight point they get.

91
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,750
So let's apply our formula.

92
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,950
First of all, it's the finish that we want in there first, not the start.

93
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,280
Counterintuitively, we're going to subtract the start.

94
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,040
Like, that's gonna give us a negative number of.

95
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,860
That's how far we moved, 45 centimeters is how far that foot moved in one now.

96
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,490
Now, how long did it take for that to happen?

97
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,470
First of all, let's let's get that number down in our file and our text file and see how long it took.

98
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,310
Let's clear and start with the finish.

99
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:02,180
And then subtract the start gives us this number.

100
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,580
I don't get a copy which just control C on Windows without selecting anything, it just automatically

101
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,650
copies a number that slam.

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,870
And then we're going to want to work out what this is equal to.

103
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,830
So let's clear and start with the minus 45.

104
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,840
And divide.

105
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,650
By the point one for.

106
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,070
And that gives us this number right here.

107
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,660
Like that.

108
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,440
So this is telling us that ad jog speed is giving us a negative number because that's kind of going

109
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,160
backwards.

110
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:41,620
But the jog speed forwards essentially is going to be 325 approximately centimeters per second.

111
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,640
So that's what we're going to want to have in our BLENDE space.

112
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,930
So we now need to do the same thing for our walking animation.

113
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,460
So that's gonna be a challenge for you to calculate the walk speed as well as the run speed.

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,680
Find the walking animation that's relevant, probably the forward one, and apply the formula and do

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,150
it the same as we just did.

116
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:08,090
Finding the foot speed is why finish minus why start divided by T finish minus t start.

117
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,320
So pause the video and have a go and see what speed you come up with.

118
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,000
Kay, welcome back.

119
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:21,770
So let's go and find what is the correct thing here, we're going to want to find festival at Blende

120
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,510
Space and see what animation we were using just to jog our memories.

121
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,880
The Valley here is the r m b walk forward.

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,080
So let's find that R and B, walk forward.

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,810
Open that animation up and we should see that it's gonna be a much slower animation than the other one

124
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,320
and we're going to find our values.

125
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,630
So first of all, let's find the foot plant that's about here after the foot start moving is probably

126
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,460
the best place like that.

127
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,080
So that is let's go and add some new lines in here.

128
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:05,360
It's going to be points three, four like so and go and find the details of this foot bones, left foot

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,230
bone world.

130
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,460
We've already got selected and we're going to find its location.

131
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:10,750
That's it.

132
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,270
Why?

133
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,360
Then we go and move the foot back until we're almost leaving the ground, which is going to be at point.

134
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,410
Six, seven.

135
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,970
And the Y is going to be a negative 22 thing.

136
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:30,980
Hey, guys, moving the same distance sort of, but you can see that the time taken is much longer,

137
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,460
so it's going to be much slower.

138
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,560
Says Open up our calculator again.

139
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:43,290
And first of all, calculate the finish minus the starts, so finish, minus start.

140
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,390
Gives us this.

141
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,950
So, as you see, very similar distance, and probably if I'd select a different timestamps, it would

142
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,000
have been the same distance.

143
00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:00,800
Then we're going to get the finished time so clear this finish time minus the start time.

144
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,200
Gives us a much longer time, almost twice as long.

145
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,470
So I'm assuming it's going to be almost twice as slow.

146
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,960
So let's clear and get.

147
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,910
At 42.

148
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,080
Divided by point three three.

149
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,390
Gives us, indeed, something that's more like minus.

150
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,840
Well, basically one hundred and thirty.

151
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,040
So copy that.

152
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,240
Interestingly, when it's the bigger form, it doesn't copy as easily.

153
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,230
They go.

154
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,450
So this is basically ass beat.

155
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,630
One hundred and thirty and three to five.

156
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,620
Now, how do we get this in to our BLENDE space?

157
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,760
That wasn't part of your challenge.

158
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,130
But we're going to do this now.

159
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,500
Let's open up our space location because these divisions aren't so easy for us to do that.

160
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,010
Well, the first thing is that we don't need to get things exactly 100 percent right.

161
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:05,350
But the second thing is that we can change the divisions or the number of divisions on our speed access.

162
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,220
So the way I'm going to do this is I'm going to have round these two values to approximately the nearest

163
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,460
50 and use 50 divisions.

164
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,530
So what we'd have here is this one's going to round up to 350.

165
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,040
This one's going to round up to 150.

166
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,710
And then what we can do is figure out how many divisions we need.

167
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,420
So 350 divided by 50 is going to give us seven.

168
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,850
So let's go to our speed.

169
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,980
Add in seven divisions.

170
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,030
Add the maximum axis value to be 350.

171
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,290
Like so.

172
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,760
And now what we should get is at the 350 mark.

173
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,960
We are going to be running when we're down at 150.

174
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,820
We are going to be walking.

175
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,200
So if we save and then anywhere in between, obviously it's going to interpolate as best it can.

176
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,750
Now, let's go ahead and play and see if that's helped fix our foot sliding.

177
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,310
Issueless.

178
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,240
Look down at the ground so we can see our feet.

179
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,870
As I am walking, you can see we've got far less if no foot sliding whatsoever as we run.

180
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,720
It's certainly no noticeable foot sliding now.

181
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:21,700
So I'm quite happy that we've successfully calculated a decent approximation for the speed of our animations.

182
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,650
And hopefully you can apply this to any animations that you use in the future if you're trying to put

183
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,580
them in a blend space or match them up to a foot movement.

184
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,560
So that concludes our little foray into animation for now.

185
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,890
I think we've got a good starting point for animation with a third person character.

186
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,480
The next thing that's really missing here is some gun architecture.

187
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:52,050
So we're going to look at how you architect guns for third person and first person shooters in the next

188
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,470
lecture.

189
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,120
See their.
