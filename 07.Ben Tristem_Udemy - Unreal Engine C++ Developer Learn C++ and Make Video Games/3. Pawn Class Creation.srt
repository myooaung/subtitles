1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,820
In this lecture, then we'll be converting our blueprint project into a C++ project.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,740
And this is something which is super simple to do.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,880
And we even have a few different approaches that we can take depending on your preference.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:22,510
So the first would be to click the add new button in the content browser and select new C++ class.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,180
We can also just right click anywhere inside of the content browser window and again select new C++

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:35,090
class, or we can just navigate to the file dropdown and again select new C++ class.

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,500
So any of these options work and will open up the class creation options.

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,850
We're going to start by creating our base class for the player to control so that we can get the tank

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,970
moving around and interacting with the world as soon as possible.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,710
This is gonna be the perfect time to take a quick pause and consider which would be the best type of

11
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,990
parent class to fit our requirements.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,140
So from the example of the finished project that I've shown at the start of this section, we can really

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,480
see that we're creating a type of vehicle class, which means we probably won't need the complexity

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,370
which is included with the character class, such as running and jumping and things like that as we

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,290
go for a very Arcady feel to the game.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,480
I also know that we're not going to need to take into consideration things like acceleration gear changes

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,380
and suspension.

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,510
So that means that the vehicle class would once again be slightly overkill for the requirements.

19
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,900
So for those of you unfamiliar with the class structures in the Unreal Engine, from reading the descriptions

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,330
just here, it might suggest that either a pawn or an actor could work for the base class, as both

21
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,790
of these can be placed or spawned in the world.

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,040
The main important detail between the two of these, though, is captured just here, and that is that

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,620
the pawn is a type of actor that can be possessed and receive input from a controller.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,940
And a controller in this situation is essentially saying player.

25
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,290
So to get a better understanding of what this means, if we take the show, all classes option at the

26
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,000
top of the window will see all of the classes in the engine in order of their hierarchy.

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,980
So again, I know this has been covered in the previous action in the inheritance topics.

28
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,630
I won't go into too much detail here.

29
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,290
What we can see, though, is that everything derives from the object class.

30
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,940
And then if we drop down the actor class, we can find that below that we have the pawn class.

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,830
If we then drop down the PWN class, we can see all of the other types of controllable classes.

32
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,960
What's most important here is that the actor is going to be the lowest level of object that can be placed

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,440
in the world.

34
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,020
And then the pawn is the lowest level of control, all actor that you can either possess as a player

35
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,180
or an A.I. controller.

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,970
So for our project, we want as much kind of control and brains over the controllable class as possible

37
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,290
while still allowing it to be possessed by a controller, which means that we're going to want to choose

38
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,400
the pawn class.

39
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,460
So the final thing will just be the naming of our class.

40
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,710
And remember that I said that this will be our base class, meaning that in a similar way that we've

41
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:01,790
seen that the pawn derives from an actor will be driving our tank pawn and our turret pawn from this

42
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,260
pawn based class.

43
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,750
So go ahead and name the new class.

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,250
I would recommend Pawn Base and at the end of the path that string that you can see just here, type

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,030
in porns.

46
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,420
This is going to automatically give us a file structure when this is created and it's going to put the

47
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,270
pawn based class into a new folder called Porns.

48
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:26,360
And as our project is going to be using a lot of different classes, it's gonna be useful to start putting

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,400
them into their own folder structures.

50
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,530
This is definitely to help a lot more later.

51
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,770
Now, also worth noting is that in recent versions of Unreal, at least version four point twenty four

52
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,170
and four point twenty five, there's a current issue in the system which is gonna cause us some errors

53
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,790
in the future classes that we create.

54
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,630
So this is gonna give us a great opportunity to look at how we can fix those issues as well.

55
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,210
I'd recommend leaving everything else as it is, specifically making sure not to click the public or

56
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,540
private buttons and then just select the create class button.

57
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:02,040
So I let that compile and open that up in Vegas code, which will set us up nicely for the next lecture.
