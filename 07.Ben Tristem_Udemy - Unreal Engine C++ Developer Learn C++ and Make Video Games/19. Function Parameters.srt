00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,500
Hey and welcome to this lesson where we are going to learn about function parameters.
1

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,770
So in the previous lesson we declared a boolean variable inside our while loop to store if the player
2

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,700
has successfully completed the level or not when they play the game.
3

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,080
Now why are we doing this.
4

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,120
What's the benefit here.
5

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,900
Well let's take a look.
6

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,450
Let's add a couple of new lines at the bottom of the while loop and let's write an if statement and I want
7

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,800
to show you a little trick here.
8

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:32,190
If you type if and press tab Visual Studio code will insert the rest of the statement for you ready
9

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,680
for you to enter the condition right away.
10

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,190
So remember a boolean is a true or false value so we can actually use our blevelComplete variable here
11

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,770
as the condition so we can just write the variable name which is blevelComplete and we can hit TAB
12

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,350
to start writing our code.
13

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,670
So just to refresh this here our while loop will now execute play game and store.
14

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,360
If the player completed the level inside our level complete variable we then fix any errors in regards
15

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,120
to input but now of this if statement we can check to see if the player completed the level if they
16

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,530
did we will want to increase the level difficulty before all the code loops again in the while loop.
17

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,630
So for now let's just leave a comment here to remind ourselves that we want to increase the level difficulty.
18

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,250
Now there's different ways that we can write some of our code and it will still have the same effect.
19

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,530
We can see that the code block for our if statement has its curly brace { starting next to the condition
20

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,900
that still works and sometimes you will see code written this way but most of the time in Unreal you'll
21

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,430
see it the way that we've been writing our code so far with the code block directly below this line.
22

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:45,180
And one thing to remember is that we don't need to put a semicolon ; after we provide the condition which
23

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,310
is usually a common mistake.
24

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,660
Okay.
25

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,990
Now we're going to go ahead and declare a variable that we can use as the level difficulty.
26

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,250
We're going to do this outside the while loop because we don't want to declare and initialize the variable
27

28
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,560
for each iteration of the while loop.
28

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,020
So let's insert a new line at the start of our main function and let's declare a new int variable
29

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,590
named LevelDifficulty and let's initialize it with the value of 1 okay so now we have a variable
30

31
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,990
that we can use for our level difficulty.
31

32
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,500
We want Triple X to become more difficult with each level.
32

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,470
If the player completes the level we then want to increase the level difficulty so let's remove this
33

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,980
comment.
34

35
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,150
And let's take a look at how we can increase our level difficulty variable to increase the difficulty
35

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,670
we can increment the variable by typing the plus symbol twice ++ and then we can type the variable name
36

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,160
LevelDiffculty and we can finish the line with a semicolon ;
37

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,430
So this is simply the same as saying take the value of level difficulty and increase it by 1.
38

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,620
So if we were playing the game and we were on level 4 and we completed the level we would increase it
39

40
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,210
by 1.
40

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,770
To state that we've made it to Level 5.
41

42
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,530
Okay so now if the player completes the level our level difficulty will increase.
42

43
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,550
So wouldn't it be cool if we printed the level difficulty in our introduction messages.
43

44
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,970
Well let's take a look at doing this.
44

45
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,240
Now I want to insert the level difficulty into my message just here.
45

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,490
So I'm just going to move the rest of my string here into the next string below just to give us a bit
46

47
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:24,290
more space on this line here and then we can output the value of our variable LevelDifficulty
47

48
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,240
Now let's save our work and let's compile our code.
48

49
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,450
Notice that we now get an error.
49

50
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,110
The compiler tells us that it doesn't know what level difficulty is even though we've declared it inside
50

51
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,030
our main function here.
51

52
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,160
This is because our level difficulty variable only has scope within the main function.
52

53
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,100
A variable declared inside a code block has scope.
53

54
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,400
So this could be applied to a variable inside a function or inside a code block for an if statement
54

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,480
or a while loop
55

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,930
For example a variable declared in a code block is local to where it's declared.
56

57
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,740
And this means that it cannot be accessed or used outside of its scope.
57

58
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,040
This is what I mean when I say this variable has scoped the main function.
58

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,260
It can't be used in any of our other functions.
59

60
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:17,090
So we need a way to pass our level difficulty variable from our main function into our print introduction
60

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,260
function.
61

62
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,570
So in order to do this we're going to be taking our first look at using parameters in our functions
62

63
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,290
creating parameters allows us to pass values into our functions.
63

64
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,070
We can create parameters within the parentheses ( ) of where we've defined our function so to create a parameter
64

65
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,080
for print introduction we first need to provide that data type which is going to be an int and we
65

66
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,110
can also name the parameter lessening the parameter difficulty so we can see here that is kind of similar
66

67
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,780
to declaring a variable and it kind of works like a local variable too instead of trying to print the
67

68
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,700
level difficulty variable from our main function to the terminal which we can't access.
68

69
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,140
We can now print the value of the parameter for our print introduction function.
69

70
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,670
We just need to type the name of the parameter just like we do with a variable.
70

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,230
So we're just gonna type <<Difficulty;
71

72
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,560
And I've just noticed that this should say you are a secret agent.
72

73
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,940
Breaking into a level and then a space then we print the difficulty.
73

74
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,190
So I'm just gonna type in level here and a space and we should also start the rest of a message with
74

75
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,110
a space to so now when we tried to compile our code.
75

76
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:31,720
The compiler is telling us that there is an error on line eleven print introduction does not take zero
76

77
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,660
arguments so this is telling us that we now need to pass a value into our PrintIntroduction( ); function
77

78
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,620
also known as passing an argument.
78

79
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,120
We do this within the parentheses so the value is an integer and we could just hard code any number
79

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,160
in here for now.
80

81
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm just gonna use seven and now if we compile our code we no longer get an error.
81

82
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,670
And if we run our program now it now says you are a secret agent breaking into a level seven secure
82

83
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,430
server room cool so we're getting somewhere now but we want this to print the value of our level difficulty
83

84
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,470
variable from our main function.
84

85
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,240
So to do this we need to pass the variable into the PlayGame( ) function as an argument and then from
85

86
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,480
the PlayGame( ) function into our prints.
86

87
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,450
Introduction just where we've provided the seven here.
87

88
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,350
So I want you to do this next step.
88

89
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,250
Pause here and create a parameter for your PlayGame( ) function that is also an integer with the name
89

90
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,260
of difficulty.
90

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,700
Just like how we've done with print introduction
91

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,360
okay see your prints.
92

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,860
Introduction function should now have a parameter that is an int named Difficulty.
93

94
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,930
And your PlayGame function should have one too.
94

95
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,890
Now instead of passing the value of seven as an argument into your print introduction function we can
95

96
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,790
now pass the value of the play game difficulty parameter.
96

97
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,540
We can just remove 7 and replace it with the name of Difficulty.
97

98
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:03,640
So we're now feeding our Difficulty parameter from PlayGame( ) in as an argument into print introduction
98

99
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,280
and we can even see this when we click on Difficulty because it's highlighted.
99

100
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:14,660
Now let's try compiling and we could see that we get an error again and this time is telling us that
100

101
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,240
there's an error on line 51 and it is telling us that we need to pass an argument into PlayGame( ).
101

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,580
So remember we need to pass an int into here but instead of just passing a random value we can now
102

103
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,870
pass our LevelDifficulty variables straight into this.
103

104
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,590
So let's just type.
104

105
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,370
LevelDifficulty.
105

106
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,150
So just to clear up what's going on here we've declared LevelDifficulty.
106

107
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:43,710
We pass it into play game and then play game passes it into print introduction and then print introduction
107

108
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,820
prints the value out okay.
108

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,510
So now if we save our work and compile our code
109

110
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,780
and run our program we can now see it says you are a secret agent.
110

111
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,250
Breaking into a level one secure server room because the value of our LevelDifficulty is one.
111

112
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,940
Now if we enter the correct answer notice it now says we are breaking into a level two secure server
112

113
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,470
room.
113

114
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,630
This is because we increment the level difficulty if we complete the level.
114

115
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,870
So if we don't completely level the level doesn't change and it restarts and if we complete it again
115

116
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,580
it increases.
116

117
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,110
So if the player completes a level then we increase the level difficulty or service so we're almost
117

118
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,910
there with our TripleX game now.
118

119
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,790
We need to start looking into actually randomizing our code and making it harder with each level.
119

120
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,910
We also might want to add a maximum number of levels.
120

121
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,610
So we're good to start covering this over the next couple of lessons.
121

122
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,800
So when you're ready I'll see you in the next one.
