00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.660
Hello, everybody, and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.840
In this next year, we're going to talk about actors and their components.

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.720
So an actor can be seen as a container that can have many components attached to it.

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.080
There are many different types of components as well.

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.290
Now we will see that we have a special component called the bull cow cartridge, which is going to enable

6
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.360
the use of that in-game terminal.

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.230
When we start typing in code for it's to reflect that code.

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.140
Let's have a look at components over an unreal.

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.380
OK.

10
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.680
So over an unreal if we have a look around our level, we have many, many different types of objects.

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.890
However, the predominant type here are Meche objects.

12
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.770
And if we go ahead and select one of those mass objects like our cow and have a look at the details

13
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.230
tab, let's make this area a little larger as well.

14
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.260
And we will see here we've got components.

15
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.210
And if I drag down this area, we can see we have a static mesh component.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.010
This is just one type of component that an object within your world can have.

17
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:10.670
If we go over to the Mode's tap on the left hand side here, we can see we've got a series of actors.

18
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.290
So what we can do here?

19
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.970
Let's say we grab a light and grab a point light, which is just like a regular bulb you'd have in your

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.300
room.

21
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.200
We go ahead.

22
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.590
Grab that and drop it in over the components.

23
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.700
We can see that we can have a child actor component, which is really useful if we start nesting objects

24
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.180
together.

25
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.260
However, if we go down to this drop down, adding components, we can see we've got many, many different

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.200
types of components that we can add to our actors.

27
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.170
And for example, here, a point lights as well.

28
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.980
And we can even create our own types of components as well, depending on what we want to use them for.

29
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.990
So there are lots and lots of different components that we can attach to an actor from lighting effects

30
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.420
or the oh, particles physics.

31
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.760
It really helps bring an actor alive and gives them presence within our level.

32
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.240
Now you can search for the component up at the top here.

33
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.100
If you know exactly what you're looking for.

34
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.770
So for instance, a light.

35
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.540
We can just search if we go and add another point.

36
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.520
Lights who are up to our actor here.

37
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.910
We can see is automatically appended the number two.

38
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.160
Now, as alluded to at the very beginning of the section, we've got our own component that we're going

39
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.350
to add to the terminal to make sure that we can use the code that we write within the game.

40
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.590
Now, you cannot see it over in the content browser.

41
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.140
By default, what we will have to do is on the left hand side, show or hide the sources panel.

42
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.240
Then we can come down to C++ classes, go into the ball cal game folder.

43
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.490
And we've got the bull cow cartridge component that we can add to our terminal.

44
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.800
So, Sam, here from the future, just to give you a little bit more information about that terminal

45
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.120
that Mikey mentioned.

46
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.960
Now, the idea here in the analogy that we are using in this project is that of a old school terminal

47
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.550
that you type in two and it characters appear on the screen and then the game responds with different

48
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.970
things.

49
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.820
Now that game can be swapped out.

50
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.770
And that's the analogy of the cartridge, those old school cartridges that you used to have and plug

51
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.940
into your game system.

52
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.960
So the idea here is that we in this section are going to be programming one of these cartridges that

53
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.350
then gets plugged in to our terminal, notionally speaking.

54
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.840
And then you can play it via the terminal.

55
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.230
We aren't going to program the terminal that's already been done for us.

56
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.860
But this cartridge component that we are going to add on to our terminal object, that terminal actor,

57
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.280
that is what is going to be providing the gameplay and that is going to be your challenge.

58
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.190
So what I'd like you to go ahead and do is add the Bullecourt cartridge component to the terminal actor

59
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.210
and then double check it is there in the components list.

60
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.980
Otherwise, the code you write in the upcoming lectures will not work because of the year now and give

61
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.460
Atsuko.

62
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.840
OK, everybody.

63
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.530
Welcome back.

64
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.440
Let's go ahead now, go over into Unreal and add the bull cow catcher's component to the terminal actor.

65
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.820
OK, so the first thing I'm going to do here is just remove those lights from our cow.

66
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.930
I don't think they're necessary.

67
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.120
The next day I'm going to do here is I'm going to select our terminal objects.

68
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.990
I'm going to search for it.

69
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.800
Rather than just clicking on it to get into the habit of finding things in a much busier scene.

70
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.520
So there we go.

71
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.380
We've got the terminal objects selected.

72
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.580
And we can see here under the details that we do have the terminal selected.

73
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.570
Now that we've done that, there are a couple of ways that we can attach the bull cow cartridge.

74
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.190
We can even go to add component and search for bull.

75
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.980
There we go.

76
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.550
It's come up.

77
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.450
Now, I didn't explicitly tell you that, but I hinted at the fact there was the search barber.

78
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.410
Now you can find bald cow in this list.

79
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.550
It's under custom.

80
00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.630
Here we go.

81
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.760
And there's the bull cow cartridge.

82
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.040
The other way that you could do it is with the content Browsr focused in the C++ classes.

83
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.350
Balkwill how game we can drag the bull cow cartridge across into our scene.

84
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.230
And I'm just gonna press enter to make sure that that is its name.

85
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.000
Now you could choose to name it something else at this point, but let's leave it as bull cow cartridge

86
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.810
for the time being.

87
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.410
So let's select something else in our scene and then come back again.

88
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.440
Yes, it is definitely attached to our terminal.

89
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.920
Brilliant.

90
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.580
The final thing I'm going to do here is just clear down these searches.

91
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.600
So at the top here, we've got on the world outline.

92
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.530
We can just this is Termin at the moment.

93
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.470
I'm going to clear the search results there.

94
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.900
And there we go with that cleared out of the way.

95
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.160
I think we're all sorted.

96
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.330
I'm going to save my level.

97
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.200
Brilliant.

98
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.490
How did you guys get on?

99
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.370
Hope you've managed to successfully attach the bull cowl cartridge, making it a component of the terminal

100
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.730
actor.

101
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.020
It is really important.

102
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.340
If you miss this step.

103
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.990
Any of the code that you write is not going to work within the game itself.

104
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.220
That's it for this lecture.

105
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.290
And I'll see you all in the next one.
