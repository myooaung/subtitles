00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.310
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.060
So I am going to start by opening the Epic Games Launcher and I should say if you're on Linux you need
2

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.050
to skip this video because we have already just installed the engine in a recent video and you don't
3

4
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.260
have the Epic Games Launcher on Linux but Mac and PC people watch it.
4

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.540
So we're going to be seeing this on the PC but it's basically identical on the Mac.
5

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.020
I'm opening the Epic Games Launcher letting it download and agreeing to allow it to make changes to
6

7
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.520
my device.
7

8
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.160
So the launcher itself may need to update and it also may need to do what you see on the screen now
8

9
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.690
on PC for sure which is to install the .NET framework.
9

10
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.350
So quite a few windows are like popping up all over the place.
10

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.210
We've got the .NET framework coming up.
11

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.150
We've got the launcher itself trying to launch now so just say allow an okay to all of these.
12

13
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.940
So we're gonna allow it access through the firewall so that it can download the engine we're going to
13

14
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.920
download install the .NET framework if our machine doesn't already have it because that's required
14

15
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.680
by Unreal later on to build projects for you.
15

16
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.250
And we're going to let the actual Unreal Launcher out or the Epic Games Launcher update itself as well.
16

17
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.650
So a flurry of things may be happening you'll get slightly different things on a Mac but a similar concept.
17

18
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.470
The ultimate goal is just to get the Epic Games Launcher open.
18

19
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.840
So it's a standard opening of a software just a little bit more complex than perhaps some.
19

20
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.690
So I'll be back with you when my Epic Games Launcher update has finished and when my other .NET features
20

21
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.490
etc have finished installing.
21

22
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.370
So get yourself to the point where the Epic Games Launcher is open.
22

23
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.350
I try not to get distracted by playing Fortnight or any of the other awesome epic games and I'll see
23

24
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.840
you just in a moment.
24

25
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.180
All right.
25

26
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.580
Once the features are finally installed then we're going to go and log into the Epic Games Launcher.
26

27
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.820
So let's go ahead and do that.
27

28
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.560
You're going to need an Epic Games username and password.
28

29
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.660
I'm sure you've already got one.
29

30
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.380
But if you haven't this is the time to go and sign up it's going to be a requirement to use the engine.
30

31
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.330
So sign into that.
31

32
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.580
And when that's done you'll finally be in the launcher.
32

33
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.160
Now we're going to use the launcher to download the engine.
33

34
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.150
I'm going to ignore any updates about games Epic Games themselves are becoming very keen on selling
34

35
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.210
games they have their own store etc now which is great and awesome.
35

36
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.280
It's good to have competition out there but we're focused on the Unreal Engine parts so click on 
36

37
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.000
Unreal Engine within the Epic Games Launcher and you'll see a button to install engine.
37

38
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.670
Now you can just click on install engine but when you do if you see that it's trying to install something
38

39
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.970
that's not 4.22 then you want to be saying cancel and making sure that you do add 4.22
39

40
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.930
so imagine at the time of installing it comes up and it's trying to add some other version.
40

41
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.220
You don't need that version the version you need is with the plus symbol.
41

42
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.650
You want to go ahead and find 4.22. The latest 4.22 - 4.22.x -
42

43
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.080
any 4.22 will do.
43

44
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.450
And the later the better.
44

45
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.750
Okay.
45

46
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.220
So you have control over that with the little dropdown on my screen as you can see it.
46

47
00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.000
So just be aware that you're installing 4.22 so that we don't have any discrepancy between
47

48
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.390
what you see me doing on screen or Mikey doing on screen or.
48

49
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.110
Or Gavin doing on screen and what you see on your screen.
49

50
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.500
All right don't worry you won't miss out.
50

51
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.310
This will be some extra features at some point in the future that's in a newer version but look we're
51

52
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.410
trying to learn the foundations and the fundamentals of Unreal Engine here.
52

53
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.880
Not every latest bell and whistle.
53

54
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.520
Right.
54

55
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.050
If there's anything fundamental that ever comes out on Unreal Engine that changes the whole way we should
55

56
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.700
approach this.
56

57
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.620
We will read record of course as we have done in the past.
57

58
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.840
OK.
58

59
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.120
So the download is happening this is now time for your challenge.
59

60
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.400
Then I'll pop back and tell you a couple of other things so I'd just like you to do the same.
60

61
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.170
I get Unreal Engine four point two to downloading Linux users can skip this video use the Epic Games
61

62
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.020
launcher download 4.22.x the X doesn't matter.
62

63
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.110
Carry on with the course during the download because we're not going to need Unreal Engine for a couple
63

64
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.940
of hours of course content actually because we're going to learn the foundations of C++ first.
64

65
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.060
Carry on with the courses can take as long as you like to download and if you have to turn your computer
65

66
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.860
off you can even resume the download by reopening the Epic Games Launcher.
66

67
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.570
So go ahead pause a video and I'll be back with you in a second.
67

68
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.350
OK.
68

69
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.890
Welcome back.
69

70
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.760
So one thing I want to tell you about the download of the engine is that the progress is not the 8.6MB/s
70

71
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.390
point six mega bytes per second.
71

72
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.970
Out of eight point three gigabytes.
72

73
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.910
That's not the point.
73

74
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.470
The point is if you watch the Unreal logo it's filling up in black from the bottom.
74

75
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.700
That is your progress indicator.
75

76
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.900
And as I say you can resume this after having turned your computer off if necessary.
76

77
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.940
So we'll just leave that going and we will continue on with the course in the next video where we learn
77

78
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.680
about some new stuff related to C++ so see you soon.
