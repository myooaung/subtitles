00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.400
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.940
In this lecture we're going to be getting the players viewpoint.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
It's incredibly useful because knowing where the players looking means we know what they're looking

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.450
at.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.060
And so we can actually reach out into the world from the player and grab things.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.230
We will be taking another look at our parameters.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.360
Now we touched upon them at the end of the last section.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.330
They are a bit nasty because they actually change is a function that changes the arguments that are

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.490
passed into it.

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.350
So we're going to find a way of marking up out parameters and that's really useful.

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.090
Now there are two schools of thought on that.

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.140
One of them is that you should kind of recognize them and not expect them to be marked up.

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.420
However we can also do is make our own macro so we can make sure that we know that there are out parameters

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.050
and that anybody reading our code also can see just by glancing at it that they are out parameters it

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.020
helps them understand what our code is trying to do and then we'll continuously lock out the players

16
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.560
viewpoints to our console.

17
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.980
Okay.

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.570
So over MVS code let's have a look at the tech component and pseudocode up what we're going to try to

19
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.070
achieve over the next door the coming lectures anyway.

20
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.960
So we need to get the players viewpoint so get the players viewpoint.

21
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.610
That's the first thing we need to do.

22
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.810
Then we need to log that out and everything else that can be part of that.

23
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.470
And then we need a way of reaching out from the player.

24
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.710
Now we're going to use something called recasting for that so it's like sending out an arm or a vector

25
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.030
straight out from where the player's looking and it will have a distance.

26
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.530
So we will recast out to a certain distance and that would be our reach and then we can change the distance

27
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.230
at which the player can reach and the reach will be a private member variable that we can adjust for

28
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.750
a bit to play tuning.

29
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.930
I remember playing the witness a great game but one of the sort of funny quirks of it was if you were

30
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.970
playing on a really high resolution monitor you could actually adjust some of the controls as long as

31
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.070
you could see them you could adjust them which I found remarkably didn't actually have to be right up

32
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.530
against the puzzle in order to solve it.

33
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.160
And I know I've managed to solve a few that I shouldn't have been able to just because it was Ray casted

34
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.300
probably out to infinity.

35
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.790
Okay.

36
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.640
And then of course talking about what it hits.

37
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.760
So see what we're hitting.

38
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.910
And then of course we can work out is that something we can actually pick up.

39
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.180
Okay.

40
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.610
So let's focus on this top one here the getting the players viewpoints.

41
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.800
Now how do we go ahead and do this.

42
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.300
Well I could just tell you what it is but we could go and refer to the unreal documentation.

43
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.770
Okay.

44
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.440
So either I have to use Google of course you can use any search engine you like.

45
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.790
So let's just search forget play a few points.

46
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.310
I'm going to go you view.

47
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.690
Well they we're going to get player viewpoint you before.

48
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.130
Okay.

49
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.550
So this may be a bit contrived Google kind of knows what I'm up to.

50
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.480
Maybe they're listening to me.

51
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.520
Okay so we've got a selection here.

52
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.920
Just pick the top one hacker at a location rotation get PLAYER Oh look who would have thought that we

53
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.790
would come up on this Google search.

54
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.570
Okay let's.

55
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.120
Let's ignore that that's down there for the moment and have a look at this top one here a player controller

56
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.010
gets player viewpoint.

57
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.360
Okay.

58
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.080
So as I say that's a bit contrived because we know kind of where we're looking but you could see there

59
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.610
gets player view actually came up with the right search suggestion and we can see that's that's parts

60
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.810
of the player controller we already know how to get the player controller.

61
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.330
So this is great everything's lining up here.

62
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.770
And of course we need to include a header file so it wouldn't have necessarily been easy to work that

63
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.250
out unless we have it down here there's no game framework forward slash gets player viewpoint it's the

64
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.750
player controller that we need.

65
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.830
So we're going to need to hash include that at the top of our file.

66
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.390
Otherwise we're not going to be able to include it to get a copy that go back over to our code and that

67
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.540
the top here I'm going to hash include the player controller and remember here that we want to leave

68
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.740
the grabber h as at the bottom one all the time.

69
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.490
Okay.

70
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.910
So game framework player controller H.

71
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.690
So then we can go in here and we can start searching for the player's viewpoints.

72
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.870
Now what I'd like you to do if you feel comfortable with it is to pull the video now and try and do

73
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.640
that yourself for the rest of you that's absolutely fine if you don't feel confident enough to do that

74
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.530
then just stick with me and we'll continue.

75
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.640
Now of course the others are paused and completed it by now.

76
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.930
So let's just carry on.

77
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.440
So we're going to need to get the world again.

78
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.610
So let's go ahead and get.

79
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.320
World we go.

80
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.840
And then it was the first player controller and we're missing something else aren't we.

81
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.180
We needing to have our world in here as well.

82
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.730
So we're going to hash include just like before the engine forward slash world.

83
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.730
There we go.

84
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.000
So now we should be able to auto complete on here.

85
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.330
Now we go takes a few minutes first player controller that's the one so we're now at the level of the

86
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.980
controller itself.

87
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.880
But we want to get the view.

88
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.470
So if we hover over this we will see that it's a pointer so we can use the arrow to dive deeper and

89
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.210
I don't know where this will be so I'm going to type him viewpoint.

90
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.290
We know we're looking at that and they go it's a getter is get a player viewpoint gets actors eyes viewpoint.

91
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.210
Interesting.

92
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.200
So we've got a couple of potential options there.

93
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.030
Let's see what this is going to return.

94
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.290
We're going to return.

95
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.170
OK.

96
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:07.340
So it's going to take in a location and a rotation and out parameter those back to us.

97
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.380
Now this is an example here where we can quite clearly see that they are out parameters but we will

98
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.200
also mark up with a macro in a moment to be explicit that these are in fact out parameters.

99
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.620
That's something we didn't do earlier on in the ball cow section and to just reinforce the whole out

100
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.630
parameter thing we can see that this is a void it's not returning anything.

101
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.660
But the fact that we have our parameters means it is going to modify something so it can be very confusing

102
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.460
if you just read your code and that's our parameter macro that we're going to create is going to help

103
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.030
us make sure that that doesn't confuse us okay.

104
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.800
So in order to use this properly we're going to have to declare a couple of variables that we can use.

105
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.710
Now when we hovered over here we can see that it's going to be an effector and an F rotator.

106
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.940
And we can call them location and rotation and we can call them play a viewpoint location player viewpoint

107
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.060
rotation.

108
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.750
It's entirely up to you how you name them.

109
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.530
But obviously when things start to get a bit logic gets a bit confusing but we do want them to also

110
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.320
be descriptive.

111
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.650
So we're going to have an F vector.

112
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.570
There we go.

113
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:23.710
And I'm going to call it play viewpoints capital P there to keep things in line.

114
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.980
Location and then we're going to have an F rotator.

115
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:35.650
I thought I went onto a new line there and we're going to call this the play of viewpoints rotation

116
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:42.460
and we're going to pass those in to our Get to player viewpoint it's expecting those arguments to be

117
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:50.020
passed in there we can see too few arguments and we're also expecting it to modify those as well so

118
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.390
we're going to pass in the player viewpoint location and then the rotation the order does matter.

119
00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:01.300
So player location comma player rotation.

120
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.590
Excellent.

121
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:09.700
Now depending on your screen in your resolution you may find this is a wee bit long but there's no harm

122
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.690
in separating them out like so remember the whitespace that's there doesn't really matter so we can

123
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:22.510
break things apart like this and now you can leave it there on the end or you can bring it down onto

124
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:29.260
another line like so so it's quite clear that these are all together remember that indentation although

125
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:37.000
it means nothing to the compiler it means everything for our readability now we've got to be aware that

126
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.990
these two here are going to be modified that can be a bit iffy so we're going to mark them in a moment

127
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.930
because we are going to be logging out to test because it's important that we know that things are working

128
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.420
I thought I put a double slash in that I obviously did not.

129
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.570
There we go.

130
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.400
Okay Sara how do we go ahead and use this macro.

131
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.040
I keep mentioning so that we know that these are our parameters.

132
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:10.840
Well we go right at the top just underneath our hash includes we can hash define something and the beauty

133
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:18.730
of hash defining something is that we're now going to be able to use this keyword that we've made out.

134
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:25.240
Now one thing to bear in mind with that is that there are some keywords that are protected however out

135
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.580
we're just going to leave it blank because it's not doing anything it's just going to mark up our code.

136
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:38.560
So we know that these are out parameters and what we can then do is go down and type in that macro that

137
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.630
we've created down here.

138
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.750
So we've gone out and out and then it is very clear that these are both out parameters.

139
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:54.670
I do want to reinforce that out does absolutely nothing in terms of the code is just for our readability

140
00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:02.830
and what it will do is just before we go through and compile it will substitute out with absolutely

141
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.850
nothing.

142
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:10.750
So it's essentially removed from our code and that leads us nicely onto our challenge.

143
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:17.230
I'd like you to go ahead and log the viewpoint every tech so locked the viewpoint position and direction

144
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.700
every tick.

145
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.610
Now here's a hint you may need to use to string.

146
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.320
We've used it before so this should be quite comfortable for you and get used to working with different

147
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.280
data types.

148
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.250
Now do give it some time.

149
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:35.140
If you're struggling one of the things that I see people do far too often is especially when they're

150
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:41.590
new to code and they give up whilst their brain is still processing things so do give it about 20 minutes

151
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:46.900
or so if you're struggling with trying to log the viewpoint every tech.

152
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.200
So we're going to be logging out and we need to log that position and direction every take tech now

153
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:58.300
carry on watching for my solution afterwards if you've not managed to do it and hopefully it will you

154
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.100
will absorb it over time.

155
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.350
So go ahead pause video now and give it a go

156
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.140
Okay everybody Welcome back.

157
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.920
Let's go ahead and log the viewpoint out every take.

158
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.690
So let's go ahead and much like before the log at the top here saying reporting for duty on this bit

159
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.490
of white space there that's clean that's up logging out.

160
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:27.350
So once again it's gonna be a gooey log is going to be log temp and I I don't know what color shall

161
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.260
we do it should we just do it normal yet.

162
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.770
Let's let's do it yellow again.

163
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.040
So it stands out amongst everything else so that's just going to be a warning in this particular case.

164
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.920
And then our text macro and now this is where we need to think about it.

165
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.970
So we're going to do the location is something.

166
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.550
And the rotation is something else.

167
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.870
So rotation.

168
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.720
There we go.

169
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.200
And we need some format specifies in here now because we're going to a string we're going to have percentage

170
00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:02.880
s and the same here percentage as I think the spacing there is absolutely fine.

171
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.110
I'm not sure what we're going to get.

172
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:10.170
Actually there's going to be three values with the location our rotation will it just be the one value

173
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.310
or.

174
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.640
Well let's see what comes out of this as we go.

175
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:14.900
Okay.

176
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:21.390
So with that that we need first of all we need that reference because it's going to be an F string that's

177
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.010
coming back.

178
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:31.440
The first thing that we probably want here is the player viewpoint or location so player viewpoint location

179
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.850
dots to string.

180
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.010
Remember your brackets.

181
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:42.240
And then we need our second one you probably guessed this already as we go along this is going to be

182
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.420
the rotation.

183
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.400
And then once again dot to string.

184
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.640
OK.

185
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.260
Now that is another long line.

186
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:55.060
So once again we can bring that down on a tablet set and so it's clear and do the same here.

187
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.140
And then finally that one there again.

188
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.720
That's entirely up to you in your code style if you decide to truncate lines like that.

189
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:08.250
You may find that you've just got too much on screen anyway and that just helps it be a lot more readable

190
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.090
for you.

191
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.830
And it does separate things out especially if you started to build up lists of things.

192
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:20.330
So let's go ahead save that go over into unreal and compile our code OK.

193
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.380
The is complete.

194
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.640
So it was a good sign.

195
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.410
And let's press play.

196
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.370
Would you look at that we've got the rotation coming down and if we start moving.

197
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.730
And would you look at that we've got our location and our rotation.

198
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.960
Okay.

199
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:37.040
So our rotation going round is which direction we're looking and both up and down.

200
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.560
I've got no easy way of rolling my character at the moment.

201
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.890
So there are values going to stay zero.

202
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.420
That's really awesome.

203
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.770
Let's try moving around.

204
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.580
Would you look at that.

205
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.100
I've got a series of numbers there and that's exactly what I wanted to see.

206
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.620
Perfect.

207
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:57.650
So we now know exactly where our character is in the world we can use that information and we know exactly

208
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.160
which direction they're looking in.

209
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.170
Perfect.

210
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.610
How did you guys get on looking forward to seeing your work come together.

211
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.590
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
