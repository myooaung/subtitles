Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.050
In this lecture we're going to focus on this main area the viewport.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.530
The first thing I want to let you guys know about is the fact that you can have multiple ones of the.

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.650
So if we go up to window you will have noticed if you've been playing that there are a couple of viewport

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.460
so you can have you can have up to four.

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.550
This is really useful if you're working on multiple parts of any level and you want to keep the camera

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.900
in a special position.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.840
So for instance if we wanted this main view ports to be focused where it is now and we don't want to

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.540
muck up where this one is we can open up a second view ports we can grab it and as we've experienced

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.600
before dockets to another area or we could just drag it out into its own window and make it full screen.

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.710
Brilliant.

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
Now that this is full screen we can really focus on just the viewport itself.

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.140
The first thing I want to show you is just about moving around.

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.970
So if we hold down the left mouse button and then move the mouse around you will notice that forward

15
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.130
and back moves forward and back and panning left and right works.

16
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.570
So you're looking to the left and right but it's not up and down with that mouse button.

17
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.540
It's forward and back and we go over to the right mouse button you'll notice that allows us to look

18
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.710
around but not move.

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.030
If we go ahead and press down the middle mouse button it allows us to move around the camera in a very

20
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.920
static way which is great for going up and down.

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.430
You can mirror this behavior as well by holding down both the left and right mouse buttons at the same

22
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.880
time.

23
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.190
Now personally I prefer the first person shooter method of moving around UnREAL which is where you hold

24
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.620
down the right mouse button to look around much like you would in any first person shooter and then

25
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.150
you can use the w key to go forward the esky to go back.

26
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.350
The a key to strafe to the left the D to the right and cue and E will allow you to go up and down.

27
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.820
E being up and cube being down now if you've got a particularly large level that you want to reverse

28
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.430
what you will find is if you press W and then use the scroll wheel you can slow down for a bit more

29
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.150
of a fine control or you can scroll up and then really whiz around your level and as you can see here

30
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.330
the level is quite big and we'll get to editing it in a bit as well but these are the basics of moving

31
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.530
around your level and it's going to become critical that you learn these skills as you start using the

32
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.080
Unreal.

33
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.710
Ed the final thing I want to show you and we can do that by closing down this view ports here is the

34
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.740
actual terminal itself how we're going to interact with that so we can actually press play here and

35
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.040
enter our world and we notice at this point we can click for mouse control so we will do that.

36
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.220
And if you want to change the behavior see you don't have to click on the viewport every time we can

37
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.040
go to where we've got the play button go slightly to the right of that to this dropdown and go to advanced

38
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.780
settings when we're in there.

39
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.110
We can see game gets mouse control if we put a tick in that box.

40
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.370
We won't have to click in this window every time to get started.

41
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.890
I'm going to leave mine as default at the moment and then we'll come back to that later.

42
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.360
And then we've got the terminal in front of us in order to access that you have to press the tab on

43
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.910
your keyboard and then you should be able to type press enter and it will generate a new line.

44
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.580
So that's a good check for everything is working.

45
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.140
It should be.

46
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.880
You can also press tab to leave the terminal and go back into the rest of your game world.

47
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.300
And now it's time for a quick challenge and your challenge is to simply get comfortable moving around

48
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.140
your level.

49
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.370
But what I'd also like you to do and there will be a few of you out there that have different input

50
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.180
methods.

51
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.660
I've got a simple mouse and keyboard.

52
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.150
But if you have any other movement techniques within the viewport to share them over in the discussions

53
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.610
go ahead post a video.

54
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.420
Now get comfortable moving around your level and I'll see you all in the next video.
