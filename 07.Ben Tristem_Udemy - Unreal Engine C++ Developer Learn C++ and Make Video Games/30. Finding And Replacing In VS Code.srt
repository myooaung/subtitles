00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,120
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,160
This is a nice and quick tip about Find and Replace.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,980
Now some of you will be familiar with this.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,340
Some of us it will be totally new too but we'll take you through step by step the process of using it

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,620
within Visual Studio code.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,490
Now find a replace is not just within the same file.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,820
It's across multiple files as well so the moment we have C++ File and our header file and we've really

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,670
only got something in three places that we perhaps want to rename.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,390
However it is worthwhile knowing that as your code grows it's likely that you may need to find something

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,230
deep within your code and you can also use this technique for that.

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,260
Now I will say now and forevermore please use this with caution.

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,500
Find the replace and just blindly clicking replace all which is one of the options can lead to trouble

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,360
especially if you've even got parts of a word selected and that's involved.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,230
In other words or you have got something that's used in multiple places within your code let's dive

15
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,720
over to visual studio code and take a closer look.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,230
OK so let's have a look at my in it game example.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,720
I no longer wants to have setting up game as a comment.

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,920
I want this to be named appropriately so I don't need a comment against it.

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,180
So I need to find the other instances where init game exists.

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,030
Now we have a look under the Edit menu.

21
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,880
We get all of the controls we need.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,260
We've got find replace which is kind of an extension to find as we'll see in a moment.

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,420
And then we've got multiple files so we can find in files and replace in files.

24
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:51,030
Notice controller nature and control shift h when it comes to replacing control an F and control shift

25
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:59,470
F when you're finding something in multiple files so I would always recommend highlighting your search

26
00:01:59,470 --> 00:01:59,950
term.

27
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,160
What you're looking for.

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,960
And then if for instance here if we go control an F we get at the top right in it game and we're searching

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,450
for it and we have a couple of options here.

30
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,520
Bear in mind matching case is going to make sure that it's exactly how it looks.

31
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,600
And then we've got match the whole word.

32
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,310
Now the whole word is important because then you're not going to end up accidentally searching for parts

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,810
of words.

34
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,240
Now let's have a look at what happens if we click the little dropdown we toggle it to replace mode.

35
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:38,110
So if we wants to replace this with set up game we could do so and then we've got a couple of options

36
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,100
we've got replace and replace all.

37
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,970
I would recommend not just going replace all.

38
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,220
I'd certainly step through your selections.

39
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,500
We can see here we've got left them right arrow.

40
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,230
I go ahead and click the next match.

41
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,820
It will go down to where we've defined in it game and if we click that's again it will cycle back to

42
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,780
the top one.

43
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,600
So that's really useful for previewing.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,580
So in this case I would happily click replace all.

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,630
However if we did that we would end up with a problem.

46
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,970
So I'm not going to do it at the moment I'm going to go to my ball Cal cartridge we've still got this

47
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,730
one here in a game and because we've got to find menu still open and we're searching for any game it

48
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,950
has found it.

49
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,670
Now what I'd rather do is be able to do that all at once rather than waiting.

50
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:31,120
So in this particular case I'm going to search for and replace in files instead so replacing files is

51
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,330
control shift nature or you can go to this menu and then we end up with a different option a search

52
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,600
box appears from here.

53
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,320
It's this little magnifying glass or looking glass on the left hand side of this area just a little

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
bit smaller.

55
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,710
And what we're looking for is just in it game.

56
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,710
So as I said before it's much better if you've highlighted the word you're looking for first your search

57
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,940
term and then searching for it.

58
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,110
And we can see when I pressed the control shift and H there is now just searching for it game.

59
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,430
Now I'm gonna to press enter there.

60
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,600
So actually does a search.

61
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,360
And we can see here it's found the two instances.

62
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,140
Notice there's a number two here in the bulk cartridge C++ file and the one instance within the header

63
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,800
file.

64
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,470
Brilliant.

65
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,210
And then it finds a load of other things as well.

66
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:24,520
So this is an example here where just replacing all is incredibly dangerous because we don't want to

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,820
just replace all we want to only replace it in these three instances at the very top.

68
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,680
Now this looks a bit noisy here.

69
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,650
We can collapse all of those by going to the top right of this area and just collapsing all it just

70
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,320
makes it a bit easier to read.

71
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,240
Now we can review each one of these one at a time so we can click them and run through just like we

72
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,050
were doing over here when we were going forward and back.

73
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,690
And if you're happy with them you can replace.

74
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,170
If you look here there's a little replace button that you can click on or use control shift and one

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,860
so you can do it at the level of the selection itself or within the file itself there load.

76
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,580
Notice here is bull cow carcasses dot CBP.

77
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,070
So if I go ahead and click replace all I know that it's replaced.

78
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,340
Oh no I didn't make sure there was something in the replace area.

79
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,400
So this is something else to watch out for something that you may have set up in this particular field

80
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,670
when we were just finding replacing within one file does not automatically appear over here.

81
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,700
So let's undo that.

82
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,220
There we go.

83
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:38,040
And we're going to replace it with set up game and we can see here what it's going to do as well.

84
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,540
So that's another clue it's removing in it game and replacing it with set up game.

85
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,630
So I'm happy with that.

86
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,960
I will replace them.

87
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,720
Excellent.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,360
It will complain at this point because we haven't done it in the header file either.

89
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,200
So I'm going to replace it in the header file as well.

90
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,970
So we've now declared it over in here.

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,440
Let's make sure that everything is saved and there we go.

92
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,570
Our red squiggles have gone perfect.

93
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,100
So there we go.

94
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,160
There's the quick tip on finding and replacing use it with caution but you will find that it's very

95
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,270
easy to go ahead and find areas of your code very quickly once you get used to using it.

96
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,290
So for instance one of the examples here I haven't used I'm going to clear the search results and get

97
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,070
rid of search area on the left hand side.

98
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,910
So I wanted to find where we remove a life and I didn't know where it was in my code.

99
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,230
I could go control an F to find and let's decide type in life and there we go.

100
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,890
I found it and the view automatically moves as well.

101
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,780
That's perhaps something you didn't see before because we were at the very top of the file.

102
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,810
The other thing to note is right on the far right where you have your scroll bar you can see there's

103
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:54,660
a little area that's been highlighted that indicates where in the block of code we are where your search

104
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,470
term has appeared.

105
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,640
And here we go.

106
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,250
Highlighted red.

107
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,870
Here it is perfect.

108
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,310
I hope you find that really helpful.

109
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,880
That's entirely up to you whether you go ahead and rename your init game function setup game function

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,460
or perhaps you've got a better name.

111
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,010
If you have please share that in the forums.

112
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,740
But for now I can remove setting up the game because that's very explicit on what it does it's very

113
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,410
specific.

114
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,050
It is going to set up the game.

115
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,710
That's perfect.

116
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm going to save my file.

117
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,770
Everything sorted and then of course final thing.

118
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:33,380
The litmus test is to make sure that your code she runs before you end up doing anything else brilliant.

119
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,390
So once your game is loaded up remember you will need to click compile and because we've edited the

120
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:45,200
header file and the C++ file is going to take a little longer to compile.

121
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,490
There we go with the compile complete we go ahead and play our game.

122
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,330
So typing in there you have lost you have one perfect.

123
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,540
That's exactly the behavior I'm expecting at the moment.

124
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,200
Excellent.

125
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,690
And as I mentioned before if you have indeed chosen a different name please share over on the forum

126
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,700
and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
