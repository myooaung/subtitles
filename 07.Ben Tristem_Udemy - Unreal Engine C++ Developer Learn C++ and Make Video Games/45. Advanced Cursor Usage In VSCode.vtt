Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.170
In order to do this advanced cursor manipulation we're going to need something to make sure we can do

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.150
it properly.

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.610
So let's go and grab a list of words.

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.390
Now I'm going to just google word less than see what we get.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.360
Word lost.

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.840
There we go.

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.560
Great typing Mike.

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.450
And here we go.

10
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.120
So go ahead pick a series of words I'm probably going to pick a thousand words here a thousand most

11
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.620
common words in English.

12
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.940
Now this list is going to have non ISO grams in it but we can use the is ISO gram function to filter

13
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.260
out those that are non ISO grams.

14
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.520
And we'll get to that in a nother lecture.

15
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.130
So it pulls a video briefly here.

16
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.380
Go copy some words and paste them over into your hidden word list and I'll see you back in a few moments

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.660
OK so I'm back over MVS code and we've got our text macros here.

18
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.900
This is the issue.

19
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.450
So if we go ahead and just paste in a series of words.

20
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.850
Oh.

21
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.470
Fortunately they've all come out on one line which makes our work so much easier.

22
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.440
But there's a good chance that perhaps they came out all on one line instead of separated like that.

23
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.870
So we need to make sure that we've got a cursor at the beginning of each of these words so that we can

24
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.780
add in the text macro.

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.710
Now how on earth do we do that.

26
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.670
Well we could hold down control if it was a shorter list and just place in a couple of cursors come

27
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.940
along and go text open brackets and pop them in like this but then we need to get to the end of the

28
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.440
word and do the rest.

29
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.650
This is this is really annoying.

30
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.950
It's all gone out of sync.

31
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.080
Now you have to reset.

32
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.340
Now imagine doing that a couple of thousand times a couple of thousand times and pop the camera on the

33
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.900
end and you'd just go crazy.

34
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.280
It wouldn't work at all.

35
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.630
And of course here it looks like I've accidentally deleted the end as well.

36
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.750
So that's not great.

37
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.530
So how do we go ahead and select the beginning of every word.

38
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.440
Well before we do anything the first thing we need to do is highlight everything that we want to work

39
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.970
on.

40
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.890
Now that's quite a few lines of code.

41
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.280
There we go.

42
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.620
So I've highlighted all 1000 odd words that we need to work on.

43
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.580
And now I need to place the cursor at the beginning of every word.

44
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.520
And at the end of every word.

45
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.390
And of course there'll be one exception at the very end where we can put that comma in because your

46
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.930
self won't need one.

47
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.840
Now we can get it these operations a couple of ways.

48
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.080
Some of them are under the selection because we've selected everything we can do something with the

49
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.730
selection.

50
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.880
So you can see here we've actually got ad cursor above below and we're not adding a curse so we're adding

51
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.850
cursors.

52
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.570
And it gives us an option here to add cursors to line ends.

53
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.890
Let's use that one first so we can see the shortcut key here is shift out an eye.

54
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.590
And what does that do.

55
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.100
Excellent.

56
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.670
So it's placed a cursor on the end of all of our selection which is really useful because now we can

57
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.100
put in our quotation mark are close brackets and the comma.

58
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.550
Now remember the last one does not need the comma.

59
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.190
So if we go down right to the end we will have to remove the comma from that final one.

60
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.760
But what about the beginning.

61
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.980
That's really irritating.

62
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.590
It's got an option for the end and not for the beginning.

63
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.760
And there's a reason for that because you can use the home key to go to the beginning of any line.

64
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.360
So all we need to do is go shift Alton eye.

65
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.230
It places the cursor at the very end of all of our lines and then we can press the home key the home

66
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.110
key will move the cursors to the beginning of every line and you probably guessed it the end key takes

67
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.070
it to the end of every line.

68
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.380
So let's go to home and then we can type in text open our brackets and add in the missing quotation

69
00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.810
mark and then we go we've actually managed to very quickly add all of that to a thousand words.

70
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.140
We should be a real pain in the backside to do otherwise.

71
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.760
Now one of the things that you can do.

72
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.490
Let's go back up to the top four this is you can also use the control key and the arrow keys to jump

73
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.470
to the end of individual elements of your code which is really useful.

74
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.480
If we had a series of words typed out instead of going down the pages made our job really really easy.

75
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.030
We can let's just say we've got word one word two words three word four.

76
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.020
We could have very easily jumped between those words using the cursor keys.

77
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.690
Now notice as we go back is going to the beginning of the word and when we go forward is going to the

78
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.320
end of the words that would have enabled us very quickly to separate out words if we wanted to.

79
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.450
And one final thing that you may find incredibly useful these are all the same I to select all of those

80
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.930
things that were the same.

81
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.930
I could go and select the word and go noticed that they're all highlighted which is useful.

82
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.350
But then I can go control an f 2 and it selects all of those words and I can edit them all individually

83
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.830
very much like a find and replace.

84
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.100
Now do be careful with multi cursors.

85
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.010
It's very easy to let's say have this curse at the top here and add some additional multi curses and

86
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.580
then do something and not realize you've added something or deleted something elsewhere in the code.

87
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.140
So let me just save that word list and that pretty much concludes some of the advance cursor manipulation

88
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.240
that's going to help us out here and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
