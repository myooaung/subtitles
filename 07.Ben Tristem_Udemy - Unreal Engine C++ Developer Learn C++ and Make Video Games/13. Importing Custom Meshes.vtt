00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.560
Hello, everybody, and welcome back in this lecture.

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.000
We're going to have a closer look at importing our own custom models specifically.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.570
If you've got an FBI X now, it's relatively straightforward to go to the Unreal Asset Store and download

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.190
something and just add it to your project.

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.560
That is straightforward, but sometimes you will get a model or perhaps you've made your own model that

6
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.760
you want to import.

7
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.880
We're going to focus on FBI X here, but there are other file types that unreal supports as well.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.150
Now we need something in our scene to move.

9
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.190
So we will be importing a door and a door frame and a texture to put on it as well.

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.330
We will be assigning a material and texture to our model itself.

11
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.800
So you get a feel how you can go ahead and customize your world as well.

12
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.730
And we'll talk about getting more textures and how we can apply them to the model.

13
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.810
So let's hop on over into one real and import our model.

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.180
Okay, everybody.

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.990
Welcome to Unreal.

16
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.760
Now we need something to import.

17
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.350
So over in the content browser, we have currently just our level in here.

18
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.080
Now I'm going to right click create a new folder and call this levels were unlikely to have any more

19
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.120
than just the one level at the moment.

20
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.760
But moving it's out of the west.

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.600
We are going to move it and moving it within the engine itself.

22
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.180
That's important.

23
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.190
Don't move things externally to the engine.

24
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.870
Otherwise you'll lose their reference.

25
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.670
And we're going to import a door.

26
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.700
So I'm going to import a new folder.

27
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.680
I'm going to call this models and I'm going to go into that and I'm going to not create another folder

28
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.840
here.

29
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.790
I'll create the hierarchy when we need it.

30
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.620
So I'm going to go ahead and imports.

31
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.130
But at the moment, we don't have anything to import in the resources.

32
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.520
If you don't have your own SBX, then go ahead and download the doorframe and dall zip file.

33
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.930
That's against this lecture.

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.180
Okay, welcome back.

35
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.400
Now that you've got that, if we go ahead and unzip this, I'll just extract it to my downloads folder

36
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.740
on some operating systems.

37
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.770
You will be able to just go ahead and drag both the UVA test, PMG and the door frame over into this

38
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.000
contents window.

39
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.660
That's not gonna work in this particular case.

40
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.510
I'm going to click the import button instead.

41
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.260
And I've already gone to my downloads folder before, so it's there and ready.

42
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.550
I'm going to shift click both of those and then open them up.

43
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.380
Now, when you open up an FBI exe, it'll give you a ton of options.

44
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.700
We are not going to delve into the details here at this point in time.

45
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.330
But the important thing for us currently is we wants to also generate collision, will talk about collision

46
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.650
in bit more detail later on when it comes to making sure we're not falling through the world.

47
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.220
But generating the auto collision will just make things a little bit easier.

48
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.060
And we'll have a look at the collision it's made and see if it's right for our model.

49
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.860
I'm just going to go ahead and click import all now with certain imports, you may find it throws up

50
00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.550
a warning.

51
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.320
In that case, you can probably ignore it and it would be absolutely fine.

52
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.380
So what have we imported?

53
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.530
We've imported this.

54
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.450
Notice the color at the bottom.

55
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.100
That will come back to that in a moment.

56
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.910
And that is the asterisk means none of these are saved yet.

57
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.450
And we'll talk about how we can use them in a bit more detail.

58
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.810
So we've got to mesh objects of static mesh.

59
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.520
We have three materials we call a brass, a broken concrete and a wood.

60
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.070
And this EUV test texture.

61
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.700
So we've got three different things that we can play with here.

62
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.820
So, first of all, let's go ahead and get our door into our scene now, baby.

63
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.230
Now, it may be very tempting to just click and drag the individual components into our scene, like

64
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.750
so roughly line the map or turn on grid snapping and try and line them up that way.

65
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.440
Well, if these models have been made appropriately and together, we can get rid of them from the scene.

66
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.910
Shiflett both for those and bring them in together and they will just work.

67
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.380
And you will notice here, this is what we're aiming for as well, that the pivot point, if I just

68
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.380
select the door itself, is in the lower corner, which enables us to open and shut the door.

69
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.030
Fantastic.

70
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.360
That's what we're going to be aiming for in code shortly.

71
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.450
So how about these materials here?

72
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.120
Well, if you have a look, we have a brass M2, which is actually already on the door handle, which

73
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.840
is perfect.

74
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.600
And then we've got this broken concrete and wood.

75
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.450
Now, these currently don't have their textures appropriately mapped to them, and they aren't in this

76
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.780
pack.

77
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.370
Now, they aren't in this pack at the moment because I don't have the rights to share them with you.

78
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.590
You'll have to go to somewhere like texture's dot com to get texture's for your own scene.

79
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.190
However, in this particular case, I have got this EUV test.

80
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.720
So let's suppose you have imported a material like this broken concrete and it hasn't linked it correctly.

81
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.910
How can we go ahead and solve that?

82
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.890
Well, if we double click on the broken concrete material, you suddenly be walked away to another window.

83
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.270
Now, I'm going to go to the very top up here where it says broken concrete on the left hand side.

84
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.550
Grab that tab with the left mouse button, unjust docket next to our building escape level.

85
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.000
That's going to enable me to hop backwards and forwards between the two.

86
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.980
Notice the star means it's not saved, which is absolutely fine.

87
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.930
And it's unfortunately dumped two things on top of each other here in this main window.

88
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.120
This is a node based editor.

89
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.890
So that simply is a way of visually programming a material.

90
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.950
Now, we don't want parameter here.

91
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.990
This is just outputting a solid shade into our base color, which is what we can see over in the preview

92
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.600
window on the left hand side here.

93
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.580
So what else can we do here?

94
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.350
How do we get our texture back in there?

95
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.590
Well, let's say our texture that you ve texture that we've got there.

96
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.750
I'm going to highlight my parameter.

97
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.050
Let's just hit and delete it.

98
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.620
And there are a couple of ways of adding I can right click, which will bring up the search menu or

99
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.950
I can just click and drag across from the little circle that we want to be plugged in.

100
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.150
And then there are lots and lots of options for you.

101
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.400
Okay.

102
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.930
Same here with a quick clarification.

103
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.610
Basically, you've got lots of inputs that go in to this material.

104
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.720
But the most obvious one here is a base color, which is, as it sounds.

105
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.420
The main color is going to show up on your material.

106
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.610
There's lots of other stuff going on here.

107
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.280
That affects the roughness of the surface, how metallic it is, how shiny it is, the spec hilarity.

108
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:42.450
But we're not interested in those because we just want to give a woody color and a woody texture to

109
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.290
our material.

110
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:50.460
So we're going to try and input some of that texture into the base color using a node called texture

111
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.500
sample, which is just a way.

112
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.810
Getting the information, the pixels from your texture, sampling that and putting it into the base

113
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.980
color for the material.

114
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.280
So I'm going to click here and drag to the left.

115
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.690
What do we want here?

116
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.140
Well, if we have a look under the word texture, we get still got a ton of different things coming

117
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.390
up.

118
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.000
We want texture sample.

119
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.850
And it will open up this new node.

120
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.850
And the properties in the details of a node are over in the left hand side of the screen.

121
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.110
Further down, we can see here, it's throwing up an error.

122
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.070
We're missing material inputs.

123
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.520
This is where we can go to the texture and notice the red bar at the bottom.

124
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.810
If we go ahead and click on that, it doesn't give us any options for the moment.

125
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.730
However, if we go to the drop down to the right, we can go and click on our You test.

126
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.830
So that will apply that texture to our material and hence to our model.

127
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.900
If we go ahead and save that and go back to building escape port, we should find is now the broken

128
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.920
concrete texture.

129
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.250
Will be this checkerboard pattern.

130
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:54.940
Brilliant.

131
00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:01.990
Now let's just have one final look down here, because there are many other mapping types we can use

132
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.190
space underneath.

133
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.720
We have this sampler type.

134
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.650
And we've got color, grayscale, alpha, normal masks, et cetera.

135
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:16.060
This needs to be appropriately set when you import a particular texture for use in other areas.

136
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.460
We won't dive deep into that.

137
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.420
And this lecture.

138
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:26.830
So the final thing that I wants to show you guys about is that if you have, let's say, a color texture,

139
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.300
you want to apply to a surface.

140
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:35.920
We can simply click and drag that texture over the top of our objects and it will create a new material

141
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.170
and apply it to the surface of our model.

142
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.580
That's really good.

143
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:45.010
We can double click on that and we can see that it's set up in exactly the same way.

144
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.930
We just manually set up a material.

145
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.610
And we really are just scratching the surface as to what these materials can do.

146
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.430
If you've glanced over a tool at the right hand side, you'll see there are literally hundreds of nodes

147
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.740
that can be dragged into this node.

148
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.190
Ed.

149
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:06.250
Now, the one thing that I will say at this point is when you're dealing with materials, it's best

150
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:12.790
to create an instance of that material rather than applying the base material to an object.

151
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.890
Same here with another clarification.

152
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:21.940
Basically, what Mike saying here is that it's better to add instances because we can change the properties

153
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.460
of an instance without having to recompile the whole shader, making this an instance.

154
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.760
Now just saves us having to swap it out later on.

155
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.400
So in order to do that, what we need to do, let's say with a broken concrete here, if we write click,

156
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.720
it's at the very top.

157
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.720
We've got an option to create a material instance.

158
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.600
When we do that, we get them concrete instance and you can name these appropriately.

159
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.550
So broken concrete and we might call this doorframe.

160
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.480
Can't include spaces.

161
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.920
So there we go.

162
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.100
Doorframe concrete's.

163
00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.430
And then you'll need to remember to apply it so we can just click and drag and drop.

164
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:06.460
Then when we select the doorframe itself, we can have a look over on the details pane on the right

165
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.060
hand side and we can see we've got the doorframe concrete material applied.

166
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:16.060
The great thing about that is if you need to use this broken concrete material on different models and

167
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:21.790
perhaps want to scale it slightly differently or tint, it's a different colour, which is easy to do.

168
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.740
But you don't want that to apply to every other model that happens to have the single material on.

169
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.040
Then you can do it by having instances of that material that inherits all of the properties of that

170
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.970
base material.

171
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.920
Notice it's a dark green.

172
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.770
And if we double click on it, we don't get half the information overload that we had before.

173
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.800
This is a very basic interface in comparison.

174
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:51.410
And we'll see in a moment how we can add extra details over on the side here.

175
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.560
Extra parameters that we can use to change our material.

176
00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:01.640
So what I'd like to do here finally is just going get another texture for our door rather than just

177
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.560
leaving it as this checker pattern.

178
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.160
And I'll show you some of the issues you may come across while doing that.

179
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.510
OK, so I've gone across to texture's dot com.

180
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.470
There are plenty of other sites out there as well for basic textures.

181
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.520
Indeed, you can go and take a photo of something if you wanted to apply that.

182
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.050
So what can we do here?

183
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.140
Well, we can go ahead and just search for something like wood.

184
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.710
Now, you could do a Google image search as well for wood texture.

185
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.550
And the great thing about that as, of course, is you're able to grab textures really quickly.

186
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.580
But please bear in mind that if you do not have the rights to use a texture and you then launch your

187
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.140
game commercially and forget about that texture in there, you could be in a whole world of trouble.

188
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.080
Okay.

189
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.690
So what type of door do we want?

190
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.420
There are so many bits of wood to go for.

191
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.850
And since we're going for a more gothic feel towards the end, I think this is pretty awesome here.

192
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.750
Now, these are substance materials which are absolutely phenomenal.

193
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.360
But let's take a step back and have a look here.

194
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.310
They've got all the maps that we need in order to put that map on the door itself.

195
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.380
So that is pretty cool.

196
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.290
Now notice they are taller than they are wider in this.

197
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:10.570
Great.

198
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:15.990
So I'm going to go and grab this flat map here and with one free credit, I'm going to grab the medium

199
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.290
one.

200
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:23.030
Now, the reason why I've also gone to Texas is dot com is so I can show you we've downloaded a TFC

201
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:23.700
file here.

202
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.540
Over an unreal if we go to try and import that, it won't see it.

203
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.310
So this is one of those file types that Unreal doesn't like.

204
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.660
So what can we do?

205
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:42.390
Well, the simple thing is to open up that file and then receiver is something unreeled can open a JPEG,

206
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.970
a Panji, etc..

207
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.360
Now, because a Pangea's lossless, that's what I'm going to pick.

208
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.850
So I've opened up my file browser.

209
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.110
I have my wooden texture here.

210
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.450
I'm going to double click.

211
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:53.940
That's.

212
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.300
That's the one I like how it's looking.

213
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.970
Let's go and open that up.

214
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.250
Now, depending on your operating system, you may be able to just save it in a preview window.

215
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.390
And you can do that on Mac.

216
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:12.270
If not, if you're on windows, you can just open it up in Microsoft Paint and then literally save as

217
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.230
a PMG.

218
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.870
I don't have the option just here.

219
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.380
So I'm going to open up in GIMP, which is an image editor.

220
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:25.740
And essentially what I'm going to do is go ahead and save it as a penguin.

221
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.250
That's it.

222
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:34.430
So if we go ahead here and go file save as it gives us a couple of options here, select file by type.

223
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.700
Oh, sorry.

224
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.870
In GIMP is file exports as.

225
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.830
Here we go.

226
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.190
Let's select file type and do a Panji.

227
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.520
Click export export.

228
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.540
And now when we go ahead to import, we can see it's right here.

229
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:57.560
Now, of course, I could go ahead and just drag that image straight on top of this door or I could

230
00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.660
go and edit my wood material.

231
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:05.130
It's entirely up to you now because the wood material itself is a bit rubbish at the moment.

232
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.460
It doesn't have any of the stuff that we want on it.

233
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.290
I'm going to not do that.

234
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.420
In fact, I'm going to delete my material.

235
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.300
So I'm going to go to my material, press the delete K.

236
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.010
It's going to warn me that still reference to memory.

237
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.980
That means it's still attached to one of the objects in our scene.

238
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.130
But because I'm about to overwrite, I'm not too worried about that.

239
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.820
I'm going to click and drag and drop that on my door.

240
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.710
Now, depending on what happens here, it's actually come out as a reasonable scale.

241
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.090
That's pretty impressive.

242
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:38.140
But the thing that I don't like is that it's not rotated round the right way.

243
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:43.220
There are a couple of ways we could deal with that, and we'll do that in the next lecture.

244
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.360
OK, so we've added one texture to our scene and it's starting to look really nice, and now I'd like

245
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.160
you in your challenge to add another.

246
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.030
So your challenge is to add another material to our model.

247
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.130
And obviously you'd wanted to delete any of the ones you're not using to save cluttering up your scene.

248
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.880
So find a suitable texture for the door frame.

249
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.200
We found one for the door.

250
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.250
Yours might be different.

251
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.180
I'd love to see what you come up with, but find a simple texture for the door frame itself.

252
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.130
I'm gonna go for a stone texture.

253
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.880
Now, an optional here is does it have other map types?

254
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:25.110
Because it would be awesome to link in a normal map and in a roughness and a specular or whatever types

255
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.040
of maps it has.

256
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.230
It'd be brilliant to link those in as well.

257
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.470
And then, of course, add it to your door frame, possibly now and give it a go.

258
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.160
Okay, everybody, welcome back.

259
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.100
Let's go ahead, Dow, and add another texture to the doorframe.

260
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:41.130
OK.

261
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.810
So I'm going to go ahead and grab another texture from Texas dot com.

262
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.850
I'm going to look at rock to begin with.

263
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.070
I probably won't stone actually.

264
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.100
Stone, stone work something along those lines.

265
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:57.200
And I don't mind if it's not quite in keeping with everything else for the moment.

266
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.070
This is just a practice, of course.

267
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.770
Look at all these wonderful textures.

268
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.380
These are all substance ones, as I've mentioned before.

269
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.780
And you can scroll down and have a look at different photographed textures, plain old textures.

270
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.390
Let's go up and have a look.

271
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.740
I quite like a bit of a rough, rough look.

272
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.710
So something along those lines or not not smooth enough like that.

273
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.950
So there's many choices here.

274
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.780
I'm going to roll the dice here and pick this regular block work.

275
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.300
Something along those lines.

276
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:29.840
Perfect.

277
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:31.250
Yeah.

278
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.900
That looks like the type of block work that I want.

279
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.450
So I'm gonna go just go ahead here and grab the albino map or the base map and I'm going to download

280
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.870
that and looks like I've already grabbed that before in the past, which is great.

281
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.820
It's been downloaded as a tiff's.

282
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.530
I'm gonna have to open that and convert it.

283
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:55.480
So go ahead, open that up and I'm going to go ahead here and file export as PMG and exports.

284
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.460
Okay, so let's go ahead and import is can see it straight away, hopefully.

285
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.030
Here we go.

286
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.680
Stone wall.

287
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.750
That's going to bring that in because the door frame hasn't been set up.

288
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.490
I'm going to drag it straight on top.

289
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.130
So I'm going to call this this one here.

290
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.340
We've gone into the texture that I want to go all the way in.

291
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.420
Probably not.

292
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:19.020
I'm going to use F2 on my cable to just rename it Stone.

293
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.550
And it's applied.

294
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.000
Brilliant.

295
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.220
So that could be us done right now.

296
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.530
There is this brass one here.

297
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.380
I'm going to leave that as a color for the moment.

298
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:26.940
You know what?

299
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.490
I'm actually going to do that as well at the moment.

300
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:35.130
But the first thing I want to do is make sure we're applying material instances to the model itself.

301
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.880
So when I create a material instance and call this door material.

302
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.630
And make sure that's on the door.

303
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:49.040
Then I'm going to grab this material here, create a material instance and call this doorframe.

304
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:56.390
And I'm going to get rid of my temporary one that I created before and make sure that the door frame

305
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.590
material instance is on the doorframe.

306
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.700
I'm going to call the base material or here.

307
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.540
Metal.

308
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.020
Wood.

309
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.010
And this one here, just a stone stone mat.

310
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.700
Excellent.

311
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.890
So metal word door material.

312
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.120
That's absolutely fine.

313
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.950
Stone material stone.

314
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:17.780
So we've got an issue here potentially that this is all to do with one object.

315
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.560
It could get very messy very quickly.

316
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.800
Do we put all of our materials in one folder?

317
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.190
Do we put all of our models with their associated materials?

318
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.550
This of hierarchy, we can pick and choose as we go and leave it flat for the moment and then afterwards,

319
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:38.000
if we need to branch out into different material structures or different hierarchies, forum materials

320
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.640
for our textures, we can do so when we need to.

321
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.870
Now, you'll notice here that we've still got some asterisks across other things here.

322
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.510
I'm going to get rid of my UV tests for the moment.

323
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.610
It'll say that it's still being used.

324
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.130
Still being used because in the movie test material.

325
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.140
So we can get rid of that at the same time.

326
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.820
Some here, again, just to clarify that we're deleting the movie test material because we only brought

327
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.710
it in to show you how an FBI could contain a texture.

328
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.010
But because we're getting our textures elsewhere, we don't need that one.

329
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.890
I think that's everything sorted that I can highlight everything by holding down shift and selecting

330
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:13.870
the more I know.

331
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:14.180
Right.

332
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.290
Click and save.

333
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.330
That will save all of them.

334
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:23.350
Now, you will notice here that the door and the door frame don't look like this at the moment.

335
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.640
They work very much the same as materials, too.

336
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:33.180
So we can go ahead here and bring in a brand new door into the scene.

337
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.420
And it's not got what we can see on here on it, which is a bit of a shame.

338
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.700
So let's get rid of those and double click and go into the door itself.

339
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.170
And then here we go.

340
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.880
World grid material we don't want, but let's use the dropdown and use the door material.

341
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.710
Then we can save it than any other instance we want to create in our world.

342
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.020
It will come in appropriately like that.

343
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.410
Now, we haven't done the frame yet, so let's go ahead and do that.

344
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.490
We can double click.

345
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.800
We can go to our dropdown.

346
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.410
And because we've called it something appropriately, stone material, doorframe material, we want

347
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.670
the material instance.

348
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:19.630
I'm not quite sure on how that fits around our model, but I will say at this point in time, we can

349
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.860
adjust that later on.

350
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.300
That's good enough for now.

351
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:23.560
Save that.

352
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:28.990
Then when we drag new doors into our scene, they will be like that, which is awesome.

353
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.890
I'm going to get rid of that extra door for now.

354
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:32.820
Okay.

355
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.600
So I'm going to save my level.

356
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.830
There was the door on it.

357
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.750
I'm pretty impressed with that.

358
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.040
How did you guys get on?

359
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:44.020
Please share your door and how you managed to make it look over in the discussions and I'll see you

360
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.900
all in the next lecture.
