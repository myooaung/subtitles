00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.180
Hello and welcome and this lecture.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.080
We aren't going to be adding in specialization to our sound.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.820
So depending on our distance from sounds, they are going to be louder or quieter.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.340
And also, it's going to be panning from our left and right speakers so that we can hear whether it's

5
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.900
coming from our left or right.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.540
Let's dive in and see how all of that works.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.160
So in the last lecture, we saw how to make our sounds more interesting.

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.340
But we did notice that they're a little bit flat now.

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.680
But when we're going around in the world, they aren't sounding like they're coming from any particular

10
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.460
location.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.230
Now, why is that?

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.420
One reason is attenuation.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.660
So this is the fact that a sound that is closer to you will sound louder than a sound that is further

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.140
away.

15
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.050
Another factor coming into play is called specialization.

16
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.260
And this takes advantage of the fact that you often have two different speakers, one on your left ear

17
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.910
while on your right.

18
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.760
If you got headphones or two speakers in front of you stereo, then what happens is depending on where

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.170
these sound sources are relative to where you're looking, if it one's over to the left, it'll play

20
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.900
more of that audio over in your left speaker.

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.090
Whereas if another sound sources, moreover to your right else, play more of that in your right speaker

22
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.780
and so on.

23
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.610
And this gives you an illusion that a sound is coming from a particular direction.

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.280
And that can be really helpful in a game where you want that extra auditory cue as to whether your enemy

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.100
is trying to sneak up on you, such as in a shooter game.

26
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.530
So it's really important to be able to have both of these effects go on to give us more of a sense of

27
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.980
space.

28
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.510
Now, the way that we are going to do this is go over to Accu and in our queue we can change these settings.

29
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.860
And there's two ways we can do this.

30
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.590
If we scroll down to a section called Attenuation.

31
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.280
You can see that there's a checkbox where we can hit override attenuation and then that unlocks a bunch

32
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.500
of settings here, right here in the queue.

33
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.690
And that will allow us to add our own attenuation settings for attenuation and specialization.

34
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.750
But another option here is to add some attenuation settings.

35
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.110
And these can be shared between multiple cues and so on and so forth.

36
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.950
Now, this is the more scalable way of doing it.

37
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.700
So we're going to create a new sound attenuation asset.

38
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.640
Now, the Prefect's for this is a treaty underscore and then I'm going to call this just default.

39
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.530
Says the default sound attenuation, as I'm going to put it in the SFX folder and hit save.

40
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.170
And then we can go and reveal it in the content browser with a little magnifying glass and open it up

41
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.220
to see that.

42
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.680
It's basically just that details pain again that we were seeing in the queue.

43
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.910
Except this time these settings are going to be shared between all the cues that have it applied.

44
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.940
Now, the first two things that crop up here are attenuation distance and attenuation specialization.

45
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.140
So this shows us that right off the bat, these two are both enabled.

46
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.570
If we create ourselves a attenuation settings asset.

47
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.010
Now, some interesting set things to look at are the attenuation function.

48
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.090
You can see this is linear.

49
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.130
This is basically saying, how should I adjust the volume as an object gets further away, linear,

50
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.420
often a good start.

51
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.810
But you've got a more natural curve.

52
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.860
You've got a logarithmic curve, lots of other options.

53
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.260
Or even you can select custom.

54
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.150
And you can add in your own custom curve points.

55
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.580
Now, I would advocate for going with the defaults unless something sounds weird to you.

56
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.670
Then as the attenuation shape, which by default is a sphere, no real reason that you should need to

57
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.360
change this.

58
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.250
Some things might give off, sound more in one direction or another, and you might want to choose a

59
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.890
different option that then we have an inner radius.

60
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.420
Basically, everything this close to the sound source is going to get it at max volume.

61
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.090
Then we've got to fall off distance.

62
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.150
Basically, anything further than this distance is going to be zero volume.

63
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.620
And then finally, we've got the specialization section, which again is to do with that left right

64
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.190
panning.

65
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.890
And you can see that specialisation method can indeed be panning, which is quite simply saying if something's

66
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.680
over to my left, play more of it in my left speaker.

67
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.730
If it's over to the right, play more of it in the right speak.

68
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.810
There's also another option here called Binaural, and that does some more complicated calculations,

69
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.090
basically factoring into account the shape of your air, changing frequencies and stuff that should,

70
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.800
in theory, give you more of a sense of up and down as well as left and right.

71
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.190
But it does require you to be wearing headphones.

72
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.670
It requires a plug in to be enabled.

73
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.280
So I don't advocate using that if panning is enough for you, because panning also works on speakers.

74
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.540
And then the final setting of interest is probably the stereo spread down here, which just tells you

75
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.590
how far apart things are going to sound.

76
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.250
So if things don't sound far apart enough for you, then you can go ahead and make this larger.

77
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.600
If they sound too spaced out, then we need to go ahead, make it smaller.

78
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.100
But generally Amam indicating leaving these settings as they are by default.

79
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.460
One more thing is that if you want to go ahead and test this out, we need to open up our BP rifle and

80
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.430
set at damage down to zero so that we aren't easily getting killed.

81
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.910
And then we can go ahead and play.

82
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.020
And we know this is a little difficult to pick out one sound over another.

83
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.230
So if we go over to one of the Qs and hit either the solo button, which just plays that one Q So you

84
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:23.340
can hear all we're hearing is the rifle shot right now or we can hit mute, which turns off the rifle

85
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.230
shot so that all we can hear is the impact.

86
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.640
Kiran, of course, you can do this the other way round by going into the impact queue and soloing the

87
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.120
impact queue or muting the impact queue.

88
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.970
Now, this obviously doesn't make as much sense when all you've got is two different sounds.

89
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.440
But if you had three, for example, then solo would make a lot more sense and mute would make more

90
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.290
sense if we just wanted to take the impact cue out of the equation.

91
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.920
So it's time for a bit of challenge for you to specialize the impact sound as well as the rifle shootings

92
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.790
sound.

93
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.010
So you're going to use solar and mute to test and try and set it up with the attenuation asset that

94
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.410
we've just create, supports a video and have a go.

95
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.170
Hopefully this was a bit of an easy one for you.

96
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.390
We're going to go over to the impact queue, scroll down in the details, pain to the attenuation section

97
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.240
and select an new sound attenuation settings.

98
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.080
Then we're going to go over to the rifle and hit play.

99
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.450
Hopefully in that little play through, you are convinced that it was a specialized you can also play

100
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.700
around with the mute buttons and solo buttons.

101
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.100
So just hear one of the sound effects and just the note in my video recording, you will probably only

102
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.970
be hearing mono.

103
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.500
So you won't be able to hear the specialization, therefore, that you'll have to try it out in your

104
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.000
own game.

105
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.640
So that pretty much wraps it up for sound.

106
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.220
We now have randomise sound that is specialized and present in our world.

107
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.570
In the next batch, we're going to move on to working with a heads up display and health bars.

108
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.230
See their.
