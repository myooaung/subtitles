00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.460
Hello everybody and welcome in this lecture I'd like to give you a guided tour of the level that we're

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.480
going to create.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.760
And yours won't necessarily look like this you may take it off in your own direction which is absolutely

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.150
fine and that would be great to see as well.

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.690
So go ahead and play our game.

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.280
I'm going to launch in the new editor window which means I can make it full screen so we can all enjoy

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.520
it.

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.650
Okay so let's have a look around.

9
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.300
So we start off in this courtyard area gives you an idea that we've come from this direction.

10
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.740
There's nothing out there though but the void.

11
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.470
And then we go through the level and as you can see here there is these these rays of light coming from

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.570
something in the distance.

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.790
I'm guessing by the color of the lights that it's maybe the moon.

14
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.830
So some blue light and we've got the orange burning torches here as well to contrast and be complementary

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.370
to the overall lighting of our scene.

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.920
Now as we go through this section we'll talk about how to lay out all of this and also to make sure

17
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.410
that we don't end up with some issues.

18
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.540
Now I've left some gaps in here from where we put the level together and we'll we'll talk about lighting

19
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.970
as well I've mentioned in passing but these torches are illuminating the world around us in a meaningful

20
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.690
way.

21
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.620
And look there's this light coming through or seemingly coming through there.

22
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.180
These are the sorts of things that we have to watch out for when we puts a level together and a very

23
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.740
easy to fall foul of if we're not careful.

24
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.980
And I think around here yes we've got some more light bleed there's a way of blocking that source of

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.100
light coming through that's a somewhat the limitation of the engine.

26
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.790
However sometimes it's not a limitation of the engine.

27
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.930
But if we have a look up here we actually have a gap in our in our ceiling here where the two walls

28
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.740
don't actually meet.

29
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.970
So we talk about how you can align your pieces of geometry so this doesn't happen in fact we can see

30
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.470
I've even made a mistake.

31
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.360
Just say we have three pieces in a row with our arms joined together.

32
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.490
I was only supposed to show you the one but never mind.

33
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.470
So we go down here and we'll talk about all this.

34
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.390
That kind of breaks the immersion and we'll talk about how we can get this effect.

35
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.790
Now this is called volumetric lighting.

36
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.060
It's strong here because I want to draw your attention to it.

37
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.670
However we can certainly dial it back a bit because this fireplace in the distance is somewhat meaningless.

38
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.580
We don't see anything of the of the of the structure that's behind that because it's all faded out.

39
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.740
Now that's perhaps something you might want to include in the level you might want to obscure something

40
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.890
that's coming up.

41
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.330
You wouldn't want to lead people into a trap would you.

42
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.330
And then we go ahead and we've got this sort of room and our mission is going to be to steal the golden

43
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.520
gargoyle and we can come out of here and this will be our escape routes.

44
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.480
And there's another sort of room in here that's blocked off.

45
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.090
And then we enter the void quite literally.

46
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.200
So this is one of the options where you can take the level just that little bit further.

47
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.480
Remember there are parts of your level that you can see there are parts of the level that only the player

48
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.640
will see and that's that's kind of critical here.

49
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.520
So perhaps we can build this out a little further into an archway but wanted to leave this in here to

50
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.330
show you that it is possible to build a compelling level and then perhaps as they walk around this corner

51
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.550
this is where it fades out and they navigate to see this area entirely up to you how you structure the

52
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.240
game.

53
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.680
Now one of the main things about the game itself is escaping and where are we escaping from.

54
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.510
Well your mission is to pick up this guard gargoyle just here.

55
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.190
But when we do there's a door up here we can just about see it's there is and there's also a door hidden

56
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.650
in here.

57
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.790
This one just comes through the geometry whereas this one has more presence.

58
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.710
So we discuss how does that matter or not if you align things properly with the player even notice.

59
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.820
Well it depends on your level of realism that you're going for.

60
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.460
So go ahead and pick up our gargoyle and when we do that it doesn't look like oh look at that when we

61
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.800
put it back and it falls off.

62
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.060
So we're using physics here.

63
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.190
We'll design a grabber as well so we can pick things up in our world.

64
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.710
But when you get trapped in here both of these door shuts and you'll have to find a way out.

65
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.750
Now I'm not going to tell you the way out at the moment because that would give away some of the mystery

66
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.230
of the game but you can pick up other things in the room.

67
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.540
So for instance this pots here and wherever the Skull and Bones is gone maybe you can put that on there.

68
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.620
Doesn't look like it's there's so much that we're going to learn in this section from a little bit of

69
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.760
Level Design to lighting the world around us and to how we can go ahead and make a world that we can

70
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.010
interact with.

71
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.030
How do we go ahead and code so we can pick up how do we make sure we can't pick up something from a

72
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.590
distance.

73
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.360
We have to be close to it before we can pick it up.

74
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.910
Oh lots of fun that we can have.

75
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.190
And I'm really looking forward to going through the section with you.

76
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.890
So let's go ahead first of all and create our brand new projects.
