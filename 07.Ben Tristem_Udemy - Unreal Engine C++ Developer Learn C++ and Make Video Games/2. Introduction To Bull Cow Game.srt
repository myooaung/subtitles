Hello everybody and welcome.
1

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,910
In this section we're going to be creating a terminal based game called bulls and cows.
2

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,830
So let's go ahead and introduce the project.
3

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,070
The important thing here is we understand the game that we're going to create.
4

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,410
So we're all on a level playing field as we start during the creation of course.
5

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,710
If you want to take this off on your own direction.
6

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,480
Brilliant.
7

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,100
Go ahead do that.
8

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,100
Now it is a terminal game similar to the last one we created.
9

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,560
But this time is within Unreal which allows us to use Unreal specific C++.
10

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,300
Now this is important as we dive into Unreal.
11

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,340
We'll start to see that some of the syntax you need to use is slightly different from just regular C++.
12

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:44,750
OK.
13

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,150
So how does the game work.
14

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,860
It's a word guessing game but in order to make this an easier word guessing game is going to be guessed
15

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,460
the isogram an isogram is simply any word that doesn't have any repeating letters that limits
16

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,300
our selection of words and also enables us to give a bull or a cow.
17

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,370
What are those?
18

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:13,380
Well a letter in a guess and in the right place is a bull and a letter in a guess but in the wrong place
19

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,130
is a cow.
20

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,340
And of course if you guess a letter that isn't in our head and word you won't get any bulls or any cows
21

22
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:21,780
OK.
22

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,590
So let's talk about the mechanics of the game itself the hidden word is going to be pulled from a list
23

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,400
of words the game will let us know the number of lives that we have the player will make a guess.
24

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,820
You will lose a life if you get it wrong and display how many bulls and cows you got.
25

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,550
It may be zero if the correct word is guessed then the game is won.
26

27
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,510
And of course if you do not correctly guess the word and your lives have run out the game is over.
27

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,910
So let's have a look at that now in action okay.
28

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,120
So now we're over on our Unreal let's go ahead click the play button and see what happens.
29

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,190
So our first word here is action.
30

31
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,210
I've put this top line in here so I know what I'm supposed to be guessing here.
31

32
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,440
And it's a good way of debugging your code as well to make sure that the word you're trying to guess
32

33
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,360
is correct.
33

34
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,310
And of course the full game where we have that in place.
34

35
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,060
So we'll be guessing the six letter word and you have six lives.
35

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,720
You may have already guessed by reading that that these are linked together.
36

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,600
So let's see if we can generate a new word.
37

38
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,160
We got able now four letters four lives.
38

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,210
So we can adjust the amount of lives we have based upon the length of the hidden word.
39

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,700
Let's just stop and play that again.
40

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,560
And here we go we've got a five letter word.
41

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,360
So let's start guessing.
42

43
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:47,050
If I were to type in something that was too short we'll be able to prompt the player and remind them
43

44
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,790
of the conditions of a guess.
44

45
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,160
So let's go ahead and guess a five letter word that isn't an isogram so we can error check the
45

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,810
user's input which is a very important skill to obtain.
46

47
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,200
And of course you can decide whether you punish by docking a life at this point.
47

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,360
So let's start guessing something else.
48

49
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,240
Go above.
49

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,880
Look at that.
50

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,300
So we've got three balls.
51

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,990
If we remember about an above share A, B and O.
52

53
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,960
So let's say we thought that's our I guess itself the A, B and E were correct and we tried something like
53

54
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,530
abuse and we get down over here.
54

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,380
Oh well hang on.
55

56
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:30,500
We got one cow here so the difference there might be that the U is wrong so let's go back to here and
56

57
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,090
if we guessed correctly as you can see you in the game and you can press return to play again and then
57

58
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,980
it'll give us a new word and we can start guessing once again.
58

59
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:45,320
And here you can see four bulls and one cow because we've got the N in there just in the wrong place
59

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:52,070
so that's where a cow would come in and if we constantly guess incorrectly what we will end up with is
60

61
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,950
running out of lives
61

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,190
and at this point we tell the player they've run out of lives and tell them what the word was and also
62

63
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,870
prompt them to press return to play again.
63

64
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:05,460
Brilliant.
64

65
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,400
So that's the simple game that we're going to create.
65

66
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,660
It's going to be lots to learn during the section.
66

67
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,810
I'm really looking forward to seeing what you guys create with it as well.
67

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,900
So once you've taken this knowledge I'd really like to see you all modify the game to your own and we'll
68

69
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,300
be diving in first of all and learning about the interface and even making this level that you can see
69

70
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,770
in the background your own.
70

71
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,370
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
