Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.100
At the moment our target your is currently being set in code so whatever the initial your plus 90 degrees

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.250
is.

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.890
So what I really want to do is expose this value to the editor meaning that we can set each door individually

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.990
to open up.

6
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.650
It's very straightforward to do that.

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.480
So let's go ahead and pick our target your here.

8
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:38.060
Now all I have to do is type above it you property open up parentheses and type in edit anywhere.

9
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.310
Now at the moment that we do this and save our file go back over into unreal and compile when we select

10
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.920
our door go to the open door.

11
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.360
Now at the moment there isn't anything there because it's still compiling but once it has finished we

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.540
will see that there will be an extra thing here.

13
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.540
We shall allows us to set whatever we want.

14
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.030
Here we go.

15
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.920
Here is target your and it's currently got a value of 0 0 0 is not particularly an open door is it in

16
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.990
this particular case.

17
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.800
It's going to be set at zero and therefore it wouldn't open.

18
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.500
So one of the things that I will say at this point in time is having an initial value at that point

19
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.700
is in fact quite important because you don't want to rely on someone coming in and setting a value of

20
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.940
what open door means.

21
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.950
It's fine for someone to come in and tweak it but having it set is zero as this as the default is just

22
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.380
not worth it.

23
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.490
So we can come back into our code here and set our target your to 90 as default.

24
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.950
Now the other thing that we need to consider at this point is that we've also got some hard coding in

25
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.040
so at the moment it doesn't matter what we set our target your to because we're changing it over here.

26
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.320
So this is where we can change this bit of code we don't need that anymore.

27
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:09.490
Our target your will now be what ever the initial your is plus what ever is here so that we'll be 90

28
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.410
by default or whatever the use of the end level Ed design is going to actually set.

29
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.200
So this is going to be plus targets your or we could have that the other way round which should be target

30
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.240
your plus initial your likes.

31
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.570
So there is a another way to write this.

32
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.660
So I'm just going to comment that out for reference if nothing else and then I'll show you that we could

33
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:48.280
go the target your itself plus equals the initial your the plus an equals together is known as a compound

34
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.020
assignment operator.

35
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.290
So that's shorthand for what we've just written.

36
00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.530
Afterwards if you want the target your to be the target you're itself plus the initial yaw or whatever

37
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.460
the second value is then you can write it in like.

38
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.500
So let's go ahead and save that.

39
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.920
We're not using any of this stuff commented out below at the moment.

40
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.490
So let's get rid of that keep our code nice and tight.

41
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.020
Okay.

42
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.340
So have all of that saved.

43
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.220
Let's go over into one real compile once more.

44
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.770
You see that the target your is set to zero.

45
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.180
There we go it's flicked over to 90 on this door as well if we go to the open door component is set

46
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.100
to 90.

47
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.550
But if we want this one hit only open 30 degrees we can now type that in.

48
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.970
And when we press play we can see that this one is only opened a little whereas this one has opened

49
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:39.740
a lot.

50
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.300
Having that customize ability that is absolutely brilliant and you may want to hint at someone that

51
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.360
this door can be opened over perhaps you want them to see through the door or something.

52
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.790
Although these big holes here kind of help out with that anyway.

53
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.050
OK.

54
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.840
So there we go.

55
00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.270
I'm going to use the dropdown and build the lighting only in this particular case to just solidify all

56
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.820
the changes that I've made.

57
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.070
Now our level's really coming on here we've managed to sort out some of those initial problems and this

58
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.510
is the sort of thing that will come up time and time again when you're designing your level find a problem

59
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.960
fix it move on and there we go brilliant.

60
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.410
You can see the power of few properties here being able to expose parts of your code in the editor and

61
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.050
being able to customize different doors in this case to do different things.

62
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.820
And for instance later on when we've got a pressure plate that's going to open the door being able to

63
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.060
expose an items White is going to be a really useful thing to do because then we don't have to keep

64
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.030
diving back into the code to change items weights anyway that's enough for this lecture and I'll see

65
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.440
you all in the next one.
