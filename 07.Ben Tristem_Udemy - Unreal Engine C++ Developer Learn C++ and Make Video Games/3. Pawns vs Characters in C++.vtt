00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.310
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.250
In this lecture we're going to be learning about the difference between pawns such as this guy and characters

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.630
such as this guy.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.320
And we're going to go ahead and set up a character blueprint and character C++ actor to look like this

5
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.030
so that we go.

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.090
Wraith mash.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.750
Let's dive in and see how it's done.

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.790
Okay so the first part of our greater project plan that we're going to want to start on is the player

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.600
movement.

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.570
That's number one that's what we basically fundamental of most games not just shooter games then they

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.010
would be going on to animation and shooting and health and me death and all those other things that

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.100
we want to get to.

13
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.920
But the first thing to tackle is the player movement to do this.

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.770
We're going to create a character class.

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.030
Now what's a character class.

16
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.310
Well first and foremost there's a distinction between a pawn and a character.

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.140
The pawn is anything that you can possess as a play.

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.360
We'll talk more about possession later but you'll have seen a little bit about it before already.

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.130
But the idea here is that the pawn is the thing that is controlled by the player character what's a

20
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.580
character.

21
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.110
Well the first thing to say is the character is a pawn.

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.760
It directly inherits from the pawn class.

23
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.310
So it can do everything that the pawn can do and more so the character is a specialization of a pawn.

24
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.470
It adds character like features.

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.850
Well that's not very informative Sam what kind of things are character like about a character.

26
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.370
Well for example movement moving around just like a normal person would do moving around on the floor

27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.980
being able to jump be able to run all that sort of stuff that tends to be the domain of a character

28
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.660
rather than a pawn because pawns can fly around like spaceships for example they aren't people like

29
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.810
so that is what a character is like.

30
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.100
And it also adds things like nav mesh movement which we'll see more when we get to the A.I. section

31
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.260
of this section.

32
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.150
And that's going to help us move the character around avoid obstacles and stuff like that.

33
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.500
So how do we go ahead and create a character very much same as we would create any other C++ class we

34
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.440
get to add new new C++ class and you can see here amongst the options there is porn and there is character.

35
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.170
Now I'm going to go ahead and give you a challenge right off the bat to create the blueprint children

36
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.900
and the C++ for that matter.

37
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.110
So we're going to first of all follow along to create the C++.

38
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.090
This is not going to be part of a challenge.

39
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.530
We're going to create ourselves a pawn.

40
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.930
I'm just going to call my pawn four because we're not gonna be using the pawn.

41
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.300
We're going to want to see the difference between that and the character.

42
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.450
So we go ahead and create that class.

43
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.120
And once that goes ahead and finishes you will end up with a pawn class the sort of thing that you will

44
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.900
have seen before.

45
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.260
It's got begin play a tech set up play input component cetera.

46
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.710
So what we're gonna do is we're going to do the same procedure again add new C++ class this time we're

47
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.620
going to create a character go to next and sort of calling it something unimaginative like my character

48
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.920
I'm gonna call it the shooter character which is more descriptive about what kind of character we're

49
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.920
trying to create here and we can go ahead and create that class and when that's finished building you

50
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.560
can see that we've got ace pretty similar looking had a file in fact pretty much everything is identical

51
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.890
except for what it inherits from the character class instead of the Pawn it's very very similar.

52
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.110
Other than that.

53
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.670
So to see the differences we're going to have to look at the blueprint children of these things to see

54
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.250
what kind of components are there.

55
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.550
So that's going to be a challenge to follow along to create the C++ as I just did add a blueprint child

56
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.410
for each of those that my pawn and the shooter character then.

57
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.470
What differences can you see when you open up those two separate blueprints pulls a video and a half

58
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.040
ago.

59
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.360
KAYE Welcome back.

60
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.740
So let's give this a shot.

61
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:12.600
If we go into the ED and I'm just going to navigate to the top of my content directory and then I'm

62
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.790
going to add some new blueprints.

63
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.360
So I'm going to right click Create a blueprint class and instead of inheriting from one of these I'm

64
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.200
going to select all classes and look for the my porn class which is a child of the porn as we can see

65
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.440
select that one and go and create an override of that I'm going to call it the BP underscore my porn

66
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.290
to use that convention which helps us differentiate between the C++ and the blueprint so against then

67
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320
right click and create a another blueprint class.

68
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.550
This time I'm going to be looking for the shooter character and select that one.

69
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.770
And predictably I'm going to call that BP underscore shooter character.

70
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.710
It kind of helps us in terms of not having to be too imaginative about naming things you don't want

71
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.530
to be imaginative about naming those blueprint children.

72
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.880
You just want to be able to say it's going to be exactly the same name just with BP underscore on the

73
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.740
front.

74
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.360
So let's go ahead and open those two up and dock them to the main window so we can compare them nice

75
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.890
and easily not the shooter character docked to the main window and straightaway we can see some differences.

76
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.430
The pawn basically has nothing going on in the component view.

77
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.450
It has a default scene roots and nothing else.

78
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.130
We go over to the shooter character.

79
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.430
However you can see there's a few more things going on for a start.

80
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.570
We have got ourselves a capsule component here which is kind of implying already that it's expecting

81
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:48.490
a humanoid shape to fit inside that capsule the capsule is for doing rough physics and manipulation

82
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.950
or collision with the terrain and then obviously something that fits inside that very nicely as a humanoid

83
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.630
character.

84
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.410
Got an arrow component which just basically tells us which way is forward for this character.

85
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.230
And then we have a mesh which is an inherited it's inherited from the C++ in fact it's inherited from

86
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.850
two levels up because we haven't defined any measures here in the a shooter character.

87
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.180
They must have been defined up in the a character class instead.

88
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.820
So that mesh component is trickling all the way down here to this blueprint class.

89
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.520
And it doesn't have anything in that mesh just yet.

90
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.920
So we can go ahead and put a mesh in there.

91
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.680
So let's go ahead and try that go over to the details pane to the skeletal mesh and we want to basically

92
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.740
put in our Rafe character.

93
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.510
So I'm just going to select Rafe in here and there we go.

94
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.900
It has puts him in a little bit off the ground.

95
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:46.600
So what I want to do is go ahead and adjust his feet so they meet up with the bottom of the capsule

96
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.580
as best I can manage.

97
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.680
Looks like I pretty much got that right first time and then we want to also align him so that he is

98
00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:01.180
facing towards that forward arrow so we can do a little bit of rotation magic 90 degrees that way and

99
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.700
we are golden I was hitting the arc key to get to the rotation which by the way or you could use these

100
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.600
little widgets at the top of top right or your viewport to get between your translation and rotation.

101
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.040
Another thing that's worth noting here in the component hierarchy apart from the fact got this mash

102
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.050
the arrow and the capsule component is we've got this character movement component.

103
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:29.410
This is what is entirely responsible for giving it character like movement being able to walk and run

104
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.210
et cetera.

105
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.290
You can see here in the details pain we've got a bunch of movement settings we've got the gravity scale

106
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.680
so you could make it look like we're playing on Mars or on the moon or on Jupiter whatever you want

107
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.240
to do you can change the graph the scale can be fun we've got default movement types for whether we

108
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:54.130
are on land whether we're on water or this kind of stuff walking jumping information network stuff this

109
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.350
automatically works well in multiplayer games it's got all that built in.

110
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.130
So basically lots of stuff already being done for us here.

111
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.580
So that's why we want to use a character over a pawn where we would have to write all of this movement

112
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:12.250
code from scratch for use the character it's already set up with this character and movement component

113
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.980
for us and that's far from being all of the things that the character provides for as it also provides

114
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.740
lots of niceties and nice functions that we can call in the base class to get our job done even more

115
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.740
easily we'll be seeing that in upcoming lectures.

116
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:33.190
So the final thing we might want to do is make sure this character is the pawn they get spawned in our

117
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.130
map.

118
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:39.060
So the way I'm gonna do this is going to the roots of our contents again and this is revision.

119
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:46.750
So many challenge for you if you want it where you could go ahead and create a clone of this map and

120
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:53.100
a blueprint game mode set from this map that will spawn at BP shooter character.

121
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.130
I do encourage you to attempt these mini challenges as well as the main big challenge.

122
00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.300
I'm gonna move on though and give no challenge slide for that one.

123
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:07.060
So we've got the modular sci fi season one starter bundle Collette collection maps got Matt one here.

124
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.530
I'm actually gonna just go ahead and copy that in to the root of my project for now.

125
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.970
And we can reorganize things a little bit later as the route gets a little bit more stuff in it and

126
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.860
the organization structure becomes clearer.

127
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.600
I'm going to rename that map to sandbox.

128
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.980
I'm gonna set it as the project's default by going to project settings maps and modes and then changing

129
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:39.970
it from map 1 to sandbox for both the game and the editor then I'm gonna make a game mode so I'm going

130
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.760
to right click and create a blueprint class.

131
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.670
I'm going to create a game mode based blueprint.

132
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:55.770
Call it BP underscore shooter game mode and open up that I don't need any C++ in this base class so

133
00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:01.740
I'm basically not deriving it from C++ but once we do need it we can always reap parents blueprints

134
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.760
to C++ classes of our own devising.

135
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.650
So what I'm going to do is go over to the details if that's not selected for you need to go to class.

136
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:18.030
Defaults here in the top bar and then you can go to classes section and find the should be something

137
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:24.750
like the default porn class like so and we're going to look for the BP shooter character on the blueprint

138
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:30.570
version because it's got the MASH set up and then we're gonna go back to our sandbox open up our sandbox

139
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.140
and change out its game mode.

140
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.810
Now the reason I created a sandbox is because I don't want to be editing the original map because I

141
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:45.810
might always want to go back to that one for reference if I've mucked up my sandbox so let's go to the

142
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.930
blueprints down in the top bar and select the game modes currently set to game mode base.

143
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:58.770
I'm going to select instead the BP underscore shooter game game mode shooter game mode rather and the

144
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:05.100
final piece of the puzzle is going to be to put in a player start somewhere so go to your place actors

145
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:11.280
tab over to the left if you haven't got it go to window and select to place actors to make it show up

146
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.580
and we want basic actors we want the player start act.

147
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.350
If you just go ahead and bring that in it gives us this little capsule with an forward arrow that shows

148
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.580
us where porn is going to spawn so we can go ahead and hit play.

149
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.670
It's not immediately obvious whether this has worked or not.

150
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:41.580
So what you've got to do is go to f eight to eject from your pawn to possess it.

151
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.880
If you turn around you can see that sure enough we have got our character here.

152
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.830
He just had a camera somewhere inside his groin unfortunately.

153
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.500
And so we are going to fix that later on.

154
00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:01.420
But at the moment we were have got our mesh in place and we are going to be continuing from this to

155
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:09.000
fix up the animations get a third person character and so on and get it moving most importantly so we've

156
