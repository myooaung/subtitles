00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,320
Hello and welcome in this lecture, we are going to be setting a blackboard key from our C++ so that

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,130
we can set the player's location and begin play.

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,870
Let's dive in and see how that works.

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,030
OK.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,590
So as I said in the last lecture, we want to be able to set some state from our game, play in the

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,870
blackboard for the A.I. to act upon.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:36,630
So the blackboard looks like this and it currently has this self actor key, but it doesn't have any

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,410
other keys here.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,010
We can add keys like clicking on this new key button.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,540
You can change the type.

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,330
There isn't actually a type for actors or anything like that that just goes under the nebulous type

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,070
of object for everything else.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,510
There's boules classes, OENOMAUS, et cetera.

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,700
But you can choose what kind of type that you want.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,080
That object to be by going to your blackboard, details dropping down and choosing what base class you'd

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,290
like.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,610
So, for example, it's saying here that the self actor is of actor type.

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,160
This has just been put in here by default.

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,570
But what we want to do here is set a new key.

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,120
And to do that, we need to do.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,310
Find out how we can gain access to this in the C++ so weak.

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,370
Already have an easy function that allows us to get hold of the blackboard by doing a get blackboard

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,790
component on the AA controller.

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,230
So simple as we can just to get blackboard components.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,570
And let's have a look at that blackboard.

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,340
Components.

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,080
Don H.

28
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,630
And have a look what is available in here.

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:53,790
We want to be doing something like set key or Set Blackbaud, where in fact, it's as simple as just

30
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,960
set value.

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,660
So, hey, you've got a bunch of different functions on that blackboard, components that allow you

32
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,660
to set these different values so you can do it by a key name, which is an F name here.

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,640
Then you can set the value as an object or you can set the class.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,700
All of the different types that are available here.

35
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,800
So let's give that a go.

36
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:25,710
I'm gonna go over to the C++ and try and set our player porn's location as one of the variables.

37
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,980
So we're going to do first of all, we need to get hold of the blackboard components.

38
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,760
So let's give that a shot.

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
Get blackboard components.

40
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,110
Then we need to have the right includes.

41
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,650
So if I hover over the blackboard component, right.

42
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,060
You can see that we need to be including behavior tree forward slash blackboard components.

43
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:52,740
So let's do that hash include then it's going to be the behavior tree forward slash blackboard component

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,430
or H.

45
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,460
Now we can use the arrow operator on that type.

46
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,040
And we should be running.

47
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,090
We want to in this case, be setting a vector.

48
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,380
We can set the location.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,380
So setting a vector and not copy the whole line but just set vector.

50
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,360
And then we want to what's the first parameter is the name that we're trying to set.

51
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,430
So we can use our text macro for that.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,370
I'm going to call it the player location.

53
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,360
That's gonna give us the location at the start because of calling it in begin play.

54
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,670
And then we need to actually set the location so we can get that from the line of code, getting our

55
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,400
play porn first and foremost.

56
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:41,850
So uncommon that and then we want to do the play a porn arrow and get actor location like so and finish

57
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,930
off the lineman's semicolon.

58
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,580
And it's as simple as that to go ahead and set a blackboard value.

59
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,970
So your challenge is going to be to do the other half of this, which is to create a key in the blackboard.

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,300
So add the key to the blackboard.

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,170
Make sure it's at the right type, the right name.

62
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,150
And then if everything works correctly, you should be able to check that value at runtime.

63
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,060
Remember last lecture we saw how we can see the behavior tree.

64
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,890
You can do the same thing.

65
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,840
You can inspect the blackboard at runtime when you're playing and you should be able to see what value

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,880
was set by the C++ code.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,220
Pause a video and have a go.

68
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,140
OK, welcome back.

69
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,010
So I'm gonna go over in to the editor.

70
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Hit compile.

71
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,210
I haven't done that already.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,700
And we're going to add a new blackboard key.

73
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,840
And in this case, we have to get the names right and the types right.

74
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,440
Otherwise, things will go wrong.

75
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,290
So we've got a vector key, which we're gonna be calling our player location, and I'm gonna copy that

76
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,730
to make sure that we have got the right spelling here.

77
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,950
Yes, we have cool beans.

78
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:48,210
And then what we're gonna do is we're gonna head over and just check that the blackboard details are

79
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:48,720
okay.

80
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,500
So, yeah, there's a name you could add a description if you wanted.

81
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,550
The type is a vector.

82
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,220
That's cool.

83
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,100
Instance sinked.

84
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,970
This is a variable that we're not particularly interested in at the moment.

85
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,690
Cool.

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,580
We've got our code has compiled.

87
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,500
So let's go and hit play and see whether we can inspect that blackboard value.

88
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,610
Go over to the blackboard and you can see we can still have that dropdown of choosing which A.I. we

89
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,410
want this to relate to.

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,680
We've only got one in our world.

91
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,260
But you can see that self out there hasn't been set, but the player's location has indeed been set.

92
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,330
Let's check if that is roughly correct.

93
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,430
If I f eight d possess.

94
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,720
Have a look at my player and have a look at the player's location.

95
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,440
You can see that.

96
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,940
Yes, it's pretty much correct.

97
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,260
Two thousand minus five thousand one hundred two thousand minus five thousand one hundred.

98
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,960
So that's setting the value through from C++.

99
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,620
Simple as that.

100
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,720
We can start to see how we can interface with our behavior trees in the next lecture.

101
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,090
We're going to look at the actual structure of behavior trees and making them do something.

102
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,140
The exciting part.

103
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,710
See their.
