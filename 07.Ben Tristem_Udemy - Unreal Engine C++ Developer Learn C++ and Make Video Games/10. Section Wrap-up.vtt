Hey well done.
1

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.230
Getting to the end of Section 1.
2

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.860
I'm really excited that you are all set up and ready to go.
3

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.240
We'll be using Unreal engine for the first time in section 3 with Mikey.
4

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.630
The reason I designed the course this way to teach you C++ first.
5

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.910
When I first designed this back in 2015 or so but because I remember the time when I first hit Unreal
6

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.980
engine and it was really overwhelming both trying to learn a complex engine like Unreal and the foundations
7

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.040
of C++ at the same time.
8

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.790
So what we've done is we've simply broken it up.
9

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.180
We firstly teach you the very very basics of C++ so that when you hit C++ for the first time inside
10

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.830
Unreal engine it's not so scary.
11

12
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.790
That's the subject of Section 2 Triple X with Gavin.
12

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.020
Then you move on with Michael from Section 3 onwards in Bullcow game and building escape and others
13

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.750
to really learn how to use the engine in combination with C++ so remember to use all the resources available
14

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.990
to you.
15

16
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.480
We have a wonderful community forum site nearly every lecture links to a specific post on that site
16

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.080
for you.
17

18
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.090
Remember to use discord.
18

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.420
Our live chat server thousands of people online at any one time to help you out and remember to use
19

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.790
our Unreal course community Facebook group all those places are thriving in great places to meet other
20

21
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.800
people in the exact same shoes as yourselves.
21

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.080
So thank you for being our student.
22

23
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.960
Please do enjoy the journey and I will see you again soon.
