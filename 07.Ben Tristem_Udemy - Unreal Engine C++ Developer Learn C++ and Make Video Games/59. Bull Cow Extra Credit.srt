Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,360
This is the penultimate lecture so instead of just wrapping up the section what I thought it would be

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,060
a great time to do is inspire you to take your code just that little bit further at the moment.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:22,040
We have a functional game but there are a couple of features that you may want to add to your game.

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,610
Perhaps you've got some suggestions if you do please do place those suggestions over on the forum.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,100
It'd be great to see what else you guys want to do with this game and what I'd like you to do now is

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,600
really push yourself and try to implement on your own.

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,380
A couple of additional features for your game.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,770
It doesn't matter what they are but I'd like to try and do that.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,530
There is no failing at this point.

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,860
It's the act of taking the knowledge you've got and actually going through the process of trying to

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,490
implement it.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,160
Now what you can do of course is discuss us with the features that you want to implement.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,550
So go over to the forum share your idea where you want to take it go whoops I happened to be stuck at

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,780
this particular point I've tried these things.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,170
Well that's a perfect way of improving your knowledge the one way that you'll be able to improve is

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,170
constantly applying the knowledge that you've learned.

18
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:20,260
That's why we put these challenges in every and almost every lecture anyway so thank you for staying

19
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,210
on the journey with us so far.

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm really looking forward to see how you adapt your games as well.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,810
So please do share your ideas and annual final outputs over in the discussions and I'll see you all

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,890
in the next lecture.
