00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.750
Hello everybody and welcome to trigger volumes in this lecture.

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.430
We are going to add a trigger volume to our scene and then we're going to jump straight into a challenge.

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.930
It's one of those challenges that's going to combine everything you've learned so far.

4
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.920
So shouldn't be too much of a stretch but there will be a little bit of reading to do says go over into

5
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.800
one real okay.

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.000
So there are a couple of ways in which we can add the trigger volume.

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.180
It is available over on the left hand side.

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.250
We can see there are some other types of triggers here.

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.620
There's a box trigger and a sphere trigger.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.580
And in general triggers are incredibly useful.

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.650
They will enable you to set points in the game where in this case we step onto it and it's going to

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.510
open the door.

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.250
Later on we will set a weight limit for that.

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.540
So we will be able to open it but as soon as we walk off of it the door shut.

15
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.740
So that's also really useful.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.820
And of course you can use triggers for many other things as well such as spawning in enemies when you

17
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.260
pass a certain point.

18
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.600
I'm sure you've all played a game before where you enter a room and it's only when you enter the room

19
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.100
that all the enemies appear.

20
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.860
And that's exactly the type of thing we're using.

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.840
So we need to go to a volume on the left hand side and of course there are going to be a lot of volumes

22
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.530
here and for right down near the bottom there is a trigger volume.

23
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.080
Now what you could have done is also at the top here underclass is searched for a trigger and we can

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.340
see here trigger volume is one of those options.

25
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.350
Let's go ahead and click and drag that into our scene and we can see it just appears in scene like any

26
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.580
other actor would.

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.250
Now I'm going to place this in the back corner over here.

28
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.920
Now there's no affordable it's that you need to go and stand in there so I might add a spotlight in

29
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.660
time but for the moment I just wants the trigger volume all the way back here.

30
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.580
Now whilst I'm doing this one of the things I would encourage you to always do said it before is naming.

31
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.670
So we have currently it's just called trigger volume let's call it a pressure plate.

32
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.400
That's useful because we know what's that trigger volume is actually going to do.

33
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.550
Or just press plates maybe that's high pressure plates.

34
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.070
There we go.

35
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.590
Okay.

36
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.700
So that's all in our scene and ready to go and what we want to be able to do but we won't be doing in

37
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.790
this particular lecture is we want to be able to enter this pressure zone or this volume at the moment

38
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.880
and just trigger the doors to open first of all we need to link these two together and we're going to

39
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.850
do that in our challenge okay.

40
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.030
So your challenge is going to be to assign the trigger volume so declare an a trigger volume star pressure

41
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.420
plate.

42
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.490
Now I'm going to call it pressure plate.

43
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.080
You can call it something else if you want but that won't also complete until you have the right hash

44
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.710
include.

45
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.230
Now I'm not going to tell you what it is here.

46
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.970
I want you to go and research what you would need to do in order to have that not only autocomplete

47
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.300
but the compiler actually work.

48
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.510
Otherwise it will fail compilation.

49
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.790
Make the pressure plate a few properties so we can edit it anywhere and then in the UAE for Ed on the

50
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.580
open door component set the trigger volume to the one we've placed in our scene.

51
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.240
So you'll be able to pick it from a list of trigger volumes and you will need to compile in order to

52
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.210
do this.

53
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.560
And now just a warning ahead of time.

54
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.410
Anything with the Open Door component on it but not set which volume it's going to use will crash the

55
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.720
editor now when we implement it so it won't be this time round but I will show you what will happen

56
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.600
otherwise because it's not clear in the aerial or the logs what's actually happened when you go ahead

57
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.830
and do this this is nasty undefined behavior error but we will also put safeguards in place so it doesn't

58
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.660
cause us any issues.

59
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.000
Now before we go ahead and dive in to the challenge I'd just like to do one final warning.

60
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.840
In our code here at the moment when you go ahead and find the right hash include that you're going to

61
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.670
use make sure that the open door that generated H currently line 7 is at the bottom of all of the hash

62
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.410
includes.

63
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.910
So don't put the new hash include underneath.

64
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.460
Okay so go ahead pause a video now.

65
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.070
Probably take you between five and 15 minutes depending on your skill level to implement this and I'll

66
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.900
see you back in a few moments

67
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.320
okay.

68
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.640
Everybody welcome back.

69
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.180
Let's go ahead and assign I'll trigger volume okay.

70
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.390
So we'll start with the hash include.

71
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.770
So our auto complete works and it will compile so we can hash include.

72
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.160
Now there is a chance here that when you were finding out what you could use that you found something

73
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.330
that also includes within it the engine hash slash trigger volume pedophile but the direct one that

74
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.830
we need to include here is the engine slash trick volume pedophile.

75
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.000
And I'm going to save my file and scroll down the next thing we need is a new property.

76
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.930
So we're going to start typing that in.

77
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.060
I seem to always be able to finish typing it before the intel he sense kicks in.

78
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.270
And this is also going to be edit anywhere.

79
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.640
The next thing we wants to do is declare an a trigger volume.

80
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.800
He knows that I've used this before.

81
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.230
Remember it's a pointer.

82
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.340
So we're gonna use the star there and we're going to call it.

83
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.740
We could call it trigger volume.

84
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.350
I'm gonna call it pressure plates.

85
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.510
Again the names that I use a new use is entirely up to you especially if you're taking a project off

86
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.910
on a slightly different tangent.

87
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.510
I know some of you like taking the lectures that you're learning and applying it immediately to your

88
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.360
own projects.

89
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.320
Slightly different.

90
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.020
Great way of learning.

91
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.940
Okay so that's all the code that we need.

92
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.230
Let's go ahead over into unreal and click compile and then what we should be able to see is that our

93
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.020
pressure plate becomes an option or indeed.

94
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.460
Here we go compile completely select our door our open door component.

95
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.940
And here we go.

96
00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.340
We've got our pressure plates and from this dropdown we can select the trigger volume called pressure

97
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.300
plate.

98
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.740
Now I'm only going to apply it to this one door at the moment so in a couple of lectures time I can

99
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.610
show you a crash that we will have to mitigate.

100
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.180
But I would advise that you make sure that anything that has the open door component on it has the pressure

101
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.180
plate actually have something in it it won't crash at the moment whether or not it's has one but it

102
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:28.080
will do once we actually implement it which we will be doing in the next lecture.

103
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.900
See there.
