00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:13,060
We are going to be getting a third person camera set up like so so that when we back into a wall, it

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,250
is going to keep at character in view and not disappear within the wall.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,710
Let's dive in and see how this can be achieved in Unreal.

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,580
All righty, then, a third person camera.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,220
How we gonna do this?

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,200
Let's go and do this in Blueprint, because there's really no point doing this in C++.

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,700
It's all configuration.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,850
It's really much easier to do with some components in blueprint.

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,970
So let's go to the BP, shoot a character, open the full blueprint editors so we can see the viewport

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,560
so we can see all of the components over on the left.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,010
And what we can do is add in a little bit of a camera component.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,810
So go to add components camera.

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,410
And the easiest way to get a third person view is and something we probably already knew.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,390
Just move this camera out and over the right shoulder, left shoulder, whichever way you want to move

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,030
it back and you can go ahead and have a play.

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,500
And that's gonna be a third person view.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,310
Simple as.

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,480
But things are not going to be that simple for a start.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,270
You can see that I control rotation isn't entirely working.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,190
It can't go up and down.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,820
And but also, if I back into a wall, you can see that I'm looking through the wall.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,800
That's no good, is it?

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,300
So let's try and see if we can make this a little bit better.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:34,510
Now, Unreal has a component for this that makes using cameras in this way a lot, lot better.

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:42,040
But before we do that, I want us to go to the camera components and fix that rotation problem so you

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,690
can get the camera options and check the porn use control rotation.

28
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,040
And what that's gonna do is it's going to rotate the camera using the control rotation.

29
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,320
Let's go ahead and hit play and see if that works.

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,130
Yes, it does rotate, but unfortunately it rotates around the camera.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,120
That's not a very third personally.

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,380
Look, you tend to expect it to rotate around that kind of point over the shoulder here so that you

33
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,050
can always keep that character within view.

34
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,740
Okay, enough teasing.

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,640
What we want here is the spring arm components.

36
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,550
Just let the capsule component go to add component, because I want this to be a child of the camera

37
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:17,920
component.

38
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,690
Add a spring arm in here.

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,230
For some reason, Unreal is focused on trying to put these components in my character's crotch.

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,260
Now let's go to the camera and make the camera a child of the spring arm and against just reset its

41
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,990
location and try and transform location under the details pain so that when we select the spring arm,

42
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,500
you can see that the camera goes on the end of the spring arm.

43
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,510
And then what I'm going to do is you could move the camera, but I'll show you why in a second.

44
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,410
That's not a good idea.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,750
We're going to move the spring arm instead.

46
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,050
And because the camera's child to the spring arm, it's moving with it.

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,090
We're gonna move that, too.

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,080
So there's this point just to the right of my character's mesh, the right of his shoulder, and that's

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
what the camera is going to try and look at.

50
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,850
So if we go ahead and hit play now and move, the movement is still not quite right.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,930
But we should have fewer problems with the walls.

52
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,820
You can see that now.

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,520
I can back into a wall and my camera doesn't go through the wall.

54
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,420
That is the functioning of the spring arm itself.

55
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,520
So, you know, when I went into camera and I set the U.S.

56
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,470
Porn control rotation checked that we actually want to uncheck because it's not the camera that we want

57
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,450
to rotate, but rather the spring arm.

58
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:40,030
Because you can see if I use my rotation widget Tonkinese E to switch over to my rotation, which it

59
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,580
if I were to rotate the spring arm, you can see that I'd get the right sorts of rotation.

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,720
It wouldn't be just the camera looking up and down, because if I select the camera rotate that you

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,240
can see the camera just looking up and down, which is the behavior we were seeing.

62
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,000
We want it pivoting around that spring arm.

63
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,120
So what we can do is we can select spring arm and go to use portion control rotation on the spring arm

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,690
itself.

65
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,900
Now, if we hit play and we move around, you can see.

66
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,180
Yes, that is much more like it.

67
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,260
That is third person camera at its finest.

68
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,690
And you can see that we are able to move into walls and that is no problem whatsoever.

69
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,260
So like you to run a little experiment as part of your learning here, we're going to try and figure

70
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,940
out why not move the camera?

71
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,760
Why do we move the spring arm and not the cameras?

72
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,030
Get a third person view.

73
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,800
So try moving the camera, not the spring on and see what happens.

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,560
See if you can figure out why I did that.

75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,030
Those videos have a go.

76
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,340
Kay, welcome back.

77
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,780
So let's give this a shot.

78
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:47,320
I have got to just go ahead and put our spring arm back in its original location just by resetting it

79
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:56,080
and taking the camera, instead using the movement widgets and bringing that up into a higher location

80
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,780
over, up and to the left.

81
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,200
So spring on.

82
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,790
You can see the little red lines pointing back here.

83
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,110
The camera's up there.

84
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,710
And so the left go ahead and hit play in this configuration.

85
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,730
Let's see if we can figure out.

86
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,490
Well, seems to be mostly working the same, doesn't it?

87
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,290
Let's go and have a look.

88
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,480
Go near an edge of something.

89
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,480
And see if we can figure out what's going wrong.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,290
There you go.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,520
That is exactly an example of why we moved the spring on.

92
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,090
Now, what's going on here is that that little red line of the spring on this one here that was in the

93
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,460
clear when we went through this doorway.

94
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,470
It was kind of going through here.

95
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,480
So it was going through the hallway just fine.

96
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,460
The red line was clear.

97
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,040
The camera wasn't clear.

98
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,140
The camera was up somewhere inside the wall.

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,280
So what we want to have happen is that this red line needs to be wherever we need to clear the view

100
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,980
for the camera.

101
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,550
And that's why we want the camera to always be looking down the red line.

102
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,380
So if we reset it and go and have a look at our spring arm, you can see that now the red lines kind

103
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:09,560
of pointing, firing out the camera to the point of interest, which, as we said, unreeled got a bit

104
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,330
of a interesting point of interest.

105
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,290
And in this case, it should be just above the shoulder like this.

106
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,830
And that's the point that we're going to want to go and get the camera to focus in on as much as possible.

107
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,010
Now, this does have an interesting point, which is that we want to if we wanted to say, rotate this

108
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,520
spring on, you can't simply just go ahead and rotate the spring on.

109
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,350
That doesn't work.

110
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,300
It seems to once go straight out backwards.

111
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,720
And the reason for this is it's in the settings of the spring arm itself.

112
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,030
You can see that there is this socket offset, target offset and spring arm length.

113
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,440
So the length is telling us how long that length is.

114
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,560
That's kind of makes sense.

115
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:56,450
But if you want to do a rotation type of thing, then you can use the offsets as no real kind of rotation

116
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:02,870
going on here, but rather we're just kind of moving that camera over using the offsets.

117
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,180
And then if you wanted to rotate the camera, too, you could rotate the camera independently so that

118
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,790
if it was pointing more in towards the player like so.

119
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,810
And because we've still got that red line set up in the right way, if the camera's going to work,

120
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:22,340
it's going to keep our visibility clear towards the player as much as is physically possible.

121
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,400
Now, I'm just gonna go ahead and tweet this more to my liking.

122
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,370
So I'm going to move it a little bit closer to the shoulder here, because I if I got the camera coming

123
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,060
in, I want it to almost be looking down the barrel of the gun.

124
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,840
But then I don't want any rotation on the camera itself.

125
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,520
I find that it's not really necessary.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,650
But I do want to have a bit of a spring arm offset so that we can get that camera looking over slightly

127
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,660
more to the right when we are not near a wall.

128
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,100
And as we get near a wall, it's going to look closer and closer to the player's shoulder.

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,020
Let's play that, see how that feels.

130
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,740
So that's looking like I'm a bit too far over to the right here.

131
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's bring it in again.

132
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,390
Think about maybe 60 units would be good.

133
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,430
Like, so just have a nice round number gonna hit play and you can see that's kind of in the right sort

134
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,970
of spot for a third person view, in my opinion.

135
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,060
And if I go up against the wall, you can see it kind of brings me closer into the shoulder so I can

136
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,120
still keep an eye on my character, are probably going to have a gun barrel.

137
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,240
This might need some more tweaking later on when we've got our animations in place.

138
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,270
We actually want to be looking down the gun barrel when we zoom in.

139
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,470
That's fine.

140
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,540
We don't need to do that just yet.

141
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,030
OK.

142
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,210
So hopefully you have got now a working knowledge of the spring arm and camera and how we can use those

143
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,080
two components together to create a third person camera.

144
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,300
Now, all that brings out the fact that animations are not there is just standing in a static, a pose.

145
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,500
So in the next lecture, we're gonna look at adding in those skeletal animations.

146
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,040
See that?
