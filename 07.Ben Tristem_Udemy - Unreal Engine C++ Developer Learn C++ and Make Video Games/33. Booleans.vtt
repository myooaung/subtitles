00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.180
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture.

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.350
We're going to focus on Billions.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.890
It's going to be more of a refresher and a reminder because we covered them in the last section as well

4
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.750
but we're going to be focused on their implementation in this game and specifically with unreal as well.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.340
So at the moment we've got nothing.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.530
Checking whether the game is won or not which is quite strange.

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.710
But then again we're going to fix it right now.

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.010
Now boolean variables in Unreal are prefixed with a B.

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.110
So as an example we've got the B game over variable and its type is a bully.

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.270
Now in this lecture we'll see there are multiple ways that you could accomplish this.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.420
And it does depend on what type of language you prefer as well.

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.520
So we could say if the game is not over do this or if the game overs do this first.

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.120
So there be two main ways of doing this.

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.990
However there's no real right or wrong.

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.650
It will depend on your language structure or the team's language structure which are working in.

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.550
So first of all at pseudocode up what we want to accomplish make sure it makes some sense.

17
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.610
And then we can start putting in the proper code and in order to do that we're going to have to hop

18
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.560
on over into v s code okay.

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.050
So we're over MVS code.

20
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.780
Now the first thing I'm going to think about is where we're going to actually sets the game over to

21
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.040
true.

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.300
So let's have a look further down so before we implement how it's going to work let's think about where

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.310
it's going to happen.

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.970
So if we actually win the game the game is over.

25
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.810
So this is a place where we can set a variable which we've not declared yet.

26
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.010
So I'm going to comment it out be game over.

27
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.070
We're going to set it to true and obviously once we finish our coding we can uncommon.

28
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.110
That's to make it work.

29
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.450
Now whilst we're here with that single comment line there you can comment out individual lines with

30
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.030
control and Slash.

31
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.140
And so you can toggle them backwards and forwards which is really useful in our case here as we're starting

32
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.460
to implement things.

33
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.450
Now our game at the moment really does only have a win and lose condition because we don't and haven't

34
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.000
implemented lives which we will do in the next lecture.

35
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.360
So at the moment we've just got one guess and you either guess it right or wrong.

36
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:29.600
And here we go you have lost and we can also set our B game over variable to true and for the rest of

37
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.630
the game it's really going to be false.

38
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.630
And that now well would be a good place to set that's what we've got.

39
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.480
Begin play and so we set up the game as one of the first things we do.

40
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.540
So since you starting in the game and we're setting up that game this would be a great place within

41
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.850
that function because the first thing in our game that's called we can set it to false at that point

42
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.810
just go all the way down to where this function is defined.

43
00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:02.010
This is where we can set up the game over variable to false and of course comments out that line.

44
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.940
Now one of the things that I wants to point out here not only is my capitalization off but is also the

45
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.160
fact that this big game over is being used in multiple places.

46
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.830
So what type of variable does that make it.

47
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.380
If you're thinking member variable then you're correct because we're using this variable all over our

48
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.160
code.

49
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.120
We can go to our header file and declare it over in our declarations.

50
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.770
So we've got a ball B game over.

51
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.420
And of course we're not going to give it a value because this is just about declaring it.

52
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.450
I'm going to save it had a file and go back into our implementation.

53
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.260
Now at the moment we're going to run into a slight issue with our code and I can foresee it simply because

54
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.120
this code is evaluated when the player hits enter.

55
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.050
So when we start putting code in here we are going to potentially be able to get something right or

56
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.410
wrong.

57
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.410
And the game wouldn't be over yet until the next time the player hits enter.

58
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.770
We'll sort that out later on.

59
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.910
That's just a bug that we'll have to focus on and clear up so we're talking about if the game is over

60
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.870
then do something that's not very descriptive.

61
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.060
What would that something be.

62
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.070
Well in this case we could prompt them to play again or and then quit the game.

63
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.230
But to keep things simple at the moment when the game is over let's go ahead and clear the screen and

64
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.890
reset up the game so that they can play it again.

65
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:42.140
So instead of doing something let's clear the screen down and reset up the game we shall be simply setting

66
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.920
the game up.

67
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.060
There we go we can call that function.

68
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.510
And since this is a function here as well is it really up to you style wise whether you decide to code

69
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.240
things in explicitly like this to say well then we're going to do this clear screen function and then

70
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.140
setup game or whether you want to keep it a bit more generic.

71
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.010
It's entirely up to you.

72
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.270
And then of course we really want to go what what are we going to do.

73
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.490
Well if the game is not over will simply be checking the player I guess.

74
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.940
So we've got here checking player guess.

75
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.830
So I'm going to shift that up and merge it in here.

76
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.990
That's absolutely fine.

77
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.270
Elsewhere checking the player gates which is what's beneath at the moment.

78
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.120
Now notice the language that I've used.

79
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.510
I've said if the game is over then do this clear screen this sets up game.

80
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.910
Now you could quite easily say here if the game is not over then do.

81
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.820
Then do the play I guess and then else clear the screen and set up the game.

82
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.380
Both are valid.

83
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.650
So we'd have to move this up here and then this down here.

84
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.970
So they're perfectly valid ways of writing the code.

85
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.870
Personally I like to think of it the game is over.

86
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.370
I like to speak in the positive when necessary.

87
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.180
So I'm going to set mine back so my pseudocode is reading like so.

88
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.220
So if the game is over there we're going to clear the screen set up the game.

89
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.690
Otherwise we're going to be checking the player guess which at the moment is only this validation check

90
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.270
that we've got here and nothing else.

91
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.160
Okay that's good for me.

92
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.540
And one final thing before your challenge.

93
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.890
We've got two comments next to each other here.

94
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.230
If you would code this sounds a bit more formally where you have got the if statement there but you've

95
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.500
just commented it out.

96
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.140
What we can do is a comment block itself.

97
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:31.120
So I'm going to get rid of those comment lines and do a comment block instead.

98
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.490
Now you can get at this underneath the Edit menu we've been using the toggle line comment which is control

99
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.490
and slash.

100
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.640
However we can do a toggle block comment we should shift out an A.

101
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.070
So in this particular case if you had let's say perhaps a few more lines code in this will go shift

102
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.130
Dalton a.

103
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.170
And it would comments that block out now.

104
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.210
Personally what I prefer is to have it even the side of that.

105
00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.930
So I would highlight the line above and below and comments it sounds like so but it's entirely up to

106
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.590
you how you decide to comment your lines out.

107
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.930
In this case because there's only two I'm going to come out with my line comments.

108
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.600
Okay.

109
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.450
I think we've got enough information here in order to do our challenge okay.

110
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.850
So here comes your challenge it's going to be slightly larger than the last couple of challenges.

111
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.330
So do take your time and go through your code methodically making sure that what you think is happening

112
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.130
is actually happening.

113
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.080
The first thing I want you to do is create an end game function that we can call.

114
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.320
We're going to create this end game function simply because we're going to end the game as we've discussed

115
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.910
at multiple points.

116
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.530
We might as well get it to do the same thing at those multiple points as well.

117
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:50.220
Now get it to set the big game over to true and instruct the player to press and continue within the

118
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:57.870
main game function implement an if statement checking if the game is over or not and run our existing

119
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:03.720
code if it's not over so we're going to have what we have before on inputs while within the on input

120
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.490
function we're going to start checking the code and of course at the moment we've discovered that as

121
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:14.490
we reset the game it's that she welcomed the player again nor does it give the player any instructions

122
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.140
as to what to do which is a bit of a bug in itself just in our code flow.

123
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:25.370
So we'll be moving the welcome perhaps into game set up that will be a good place to place it supports

124
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:31.260
a video now spend about 10 15 minutes I should imagine it will take most people to do this and I'll

125
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:38.370
see you all back in a few minutes okay everybody welcome back how did you get on a bit challenging when

126
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.900
we start moving code around as well as thinking about implementing something new as well.

127
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.530
Hope you got on.

128
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.940
Okay let's go over and see how I ended up with a better behaving code.

129
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.410
Okay so this is where we left off before.

130
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.730
I think what we can do here.

131
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.760
Let's let's play through the game methodically and see what we need to do.

132
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.250
So we begin playing and we set up the game.

133
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.870
Now the problem at the moment is that we don't have this debug line anywhere else.

134
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.820
I'm going to leave it right at the top here.

135
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.940
It's easy to turn on and off but this whole welcoming the player you'd make much more sense than that

136
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.440
for that to actually be in the setup of the game itself.

137
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.820
So what we can do here is we can welcome the player.

138
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.460
I'm not going to put the welcoming of the player into its own function.

139
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.940
What we will do however is move all of this code and prompt the player for gas.

140
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:34.830
That's essentially what we're doing here anyway so we might as well move into the position and then

141
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.480
let's remove that and put it down here in the setup game.

142
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.850
Now it won't all be on one line.

143
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.820
The reason for that is we welcome the player.

144
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.940
That makes sense.

145
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:51.740
But then we're asking the player on line 58 here to guess the number of character letter word.

146
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.330
Okay.

147
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:56.290
The problem here is we haven't actually set the hidden word yet.

148
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.600
So we're going to have to do that.

149
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.910
So we're going to welcome the player.

150
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.730
Then we're going to set the hidden word which is fine.

151
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.040
We might as well set the lives at the same time.

152
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.430
And we go ahead.

153
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.660
And here we are giving the player some instructions typing your guess.

154
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:18.900
I'm going to put a full stop in there and pop a new line in and then say press sense to continue.

155
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:24.450
That's going to solve that issue that we've currently got with the words wrapping round.

156
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.920
And then finally we need to set our big game over to false.

157
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.360
Now we can do that at any point.

158
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:36.360
In fact I'm going to pop it up here with the rest of our variables that we've got so far so they are

159
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.650
all grouped together.

160
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.320
And finally I'm going to remove this extra whitespace at the bottom.

161
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.180
Okay that's great.

162
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:48.560
So we've done the first part here we're now welcoming the player that makes this a lot easier to read.

163
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.860
First of all we set up the game then we're going to jump straight into assessing the players input when

164
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.080
they press enter.

165
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.970
I'm going to leave as if said the debug line at the very top here so I can turn on and off and I'm going

166
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.390
to remove this extra whitespace that we've got underneath.

167
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.740
Okay perfect.

168
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.820
Now comes this slot here.

169
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.610
I'm going to I think just think about how this is going to run.

170
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.950
I'm not going to clear the screen on the first run to clear the screen on the first run your instructions

171
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.340
disappear as soon as you press enter.

172
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.540
That doesn't seem a great way of playing the game right.

173
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.310
First of all we need to think about our if statements.

174
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:34.300
So we've got the code underneath Let's type it below this have are also fell doesn't block our way so

175
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.330
first of all if the game is over.

176
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.130
That's the language that I'm using.

177
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:46.810
So I start typing that we'll get our B game over available to us and then we're going to talk about

178
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.350
what to do so let's open up our curly brackets.

179
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:56.230
And by the way we do not have to hear say if the B game over is equal to true.

180
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.980
This is going to either be true or false right from the offset.

181
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.030
So let's go ahead and remove that extra bit of code and let's think about what we're going to do here.

182
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:14.370
So if the game is over we're going to clear the screen and then we can just go ahead and set up a new

183
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.150
game.

184
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:22.680
Now when it comes to setting up a new game eventually we'll have that bringing in a new hidden word.

185
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.280
So that's great.

186
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.350
So that restarts the game.

187
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.550
So what are we doing here.

188
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.240
If the input.

189
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.740
Oh this would be our l statements.

190
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:36.050
So we've got else here followed by the rest of our code.

191
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.660
So let's just clean up the formatting there and then we're going to simply grab what we've got already.

192
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:48.260
Remember to grab your curly braces at either end and chuck that into the right place.

193
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.050
Excellent.

194
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.780
And we've got the right level of indentation there as well.

195
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.830
So we've got this repeated area here if B game over equals true.

196
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.310
So this is where we can add in our end game function.

197
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.820
So what we're really going to do is all the way down here.

198
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.230
So we're going to go first of all you.

199
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.270
Ball.

200
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.970
Colon code on end game.

201
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:14.010
I can't think of a better name for our function as long as it's spelled correctly.

202
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.070
And the function itself is going to do two things.

203
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.280
It's going to set our B game over equal to true.

204
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:28.920
The next thing that is going to do after I've pop the item that I've missed is given instructions.

205
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.770
So this is where we're going to print out to our term and also print line.

206
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.310
Then we're going to use our text macro and then we're going to say something.

207
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.430
So this case I'm just going to go press and to continue.

208
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.860
But wait no it's not continuing.

209
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.250
It's to play again.

210
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:52.320
Then the final thing we need to declare the end game function exists and we're going to go over into

211
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.250
our head file.

212
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.860
It's not returning anything.

213
00:13:54.870 --> 00:14:00.280
So we can just go void and game save our head a file.

214
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:05.910
Now we've gotten rid of all of our squiggles that's remove this whitespace as well.

215
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.060
Let's run through our code.

216
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:08.980
OK.

217
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.040
So this is quite self-explanatory here.

218
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:17.400
If the game is over then we're going to do what's in those curly brackets so I can delete that comment.

219
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.980
Now the else we're going to be checking the player.

220
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.800
I guess that's fine.

221
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:27.120
I will add that down here just as a summary that gives us a hint that perhaps we need to have something

222
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.940
here that's a bit more readable because otherwise we're just doing something that it's not apparent

223
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.230
at the moment that we're just checking the player guess other than if you start reading through the

224
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.820
rest of the code it'll be good here if it says else we're checking player guests or checking guests

225
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.020
or processing the guests.

226
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.540
There's lots of variations that we can do that.

227
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.430
The final thing we need to do is just trim up these extra comments.

228
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.400
So we've got that delete line 25 as well.

229
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:53.570
OK.

230
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.840
So format wise that looks great.

231
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.970
We now not need to add in our end game here.

232
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.800
So because if we've won the game we're going to end the game that's fine.

233
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.010
OK.

234
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:10.640
So we also need to add in here end game which is fine but then oh here we go.

235
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:16.770
We have not really we're not trying again at this point because our game is set up without any lives.

236
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.720
So let's make sure this reads correctly this isn't going to be try again.

237
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.900
It will be you have lost.

238
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.770
And of course we know from experience that this is not going to wrap around the terminal so let's pop

239
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.920
in our new line.

240
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.980
And there we go you have lost in the game we don't need this.

241
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.170
Bits of code anymore on line 35 34 is redundant whitespace.

242
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.480
I think we've got it there.

243
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.490
Let's save it.

244
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.510
Go over into bool cow.

245
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:49.530
Compile our code and make sure that it works oh the compilers failed.

246
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.620
What have I missed.

247
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.990
Let's show the log.

248
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.580
So we're talking about.

249
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.640
Where is it.

250
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.520
Line 70.

251
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.440
Let's go have a look at line 70.

252
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.320
You can see in the brackets there we're talking about line 70.

253
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.130
Let's go over what have I done something really silly.

254
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.160
Yes I've missed my semicolon off at the end of my code.

255
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.110
So there we go.

256
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:18.030
And if we read the code fully if I expand this window out It even tells us what we're missing.

257
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.230
There we go.

258
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.410
Let's close that down click compile.

259
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.130
Excellent work this time.

260
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:30.020
Press Play welcome of all girls guess the five letter word typing you guessed press any press Enter

261
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.450
to continue the hit and where word is cakes and that's something we can remove out and that's fine is

262
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:40.760
moved the position of the hidden word is cakes because we do all of this first let's go ahead and play

263
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:46.160
our game and make sure it works if I type in cakes says you have one press Enter to play again we present

264
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.430
to play again it resets the game perfect Let's type in something wrong hidden word is five characters

265
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.060
long you have lost Princess enter to play again it clears them the screen.

266
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.450
This is good behavior now okay.

267
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:04.950
So in summary if we type in nothing or a word with the note wrong number of characters.

268
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:10.670
Notice that if we type anything in here it will just reset the game that's desired behavior we don't

269
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:16.260
want it guessing again so that's fine if we type in case we get you have 1 percent to play again but

270
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:23.300
if we type in something that's got the right number of letters it doesn't do anything in fact we don't

271
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:30.320
even have an assessment at the moment as to whether or not we have any repeats of characters but that's

272
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.560
fine we will deal with that as we progress our code.

273
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.000
Brilliant.

274
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.490
How did you guys get on did you get working code at the end with a similar behavior to this.

275
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.660
Did you structure your code slightly differently.

276
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:48.000
I'll be really interested to see how you coded in this behavior and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
