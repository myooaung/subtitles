00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,570
Okay, so to get started with this section, you want to download the starter project, provided the

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,730
project has been created in version four point twenty five.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,000
So you'll need that version or above installed.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,620
You can then extract and run the project just like any other unreal project you've worked with.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,480
So inside of the tank game project, I've already set up some of the folder structures.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,480
The input settings and created the default main map, as well as providing the audio and visual assets

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,800
that we'll need for the game.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,260
This would just allow us to focus as much on implementing the logic in the classes as possible.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,540
You might have also noticed that this project was created from an empty blueprint project, meaning

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,600
that we don't have or see any of the C++ directories or the classes in the project at the moment.

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,750
And this is because I find this to be a lot of the time kind of preferred approach to creating new C++

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,240
projects just because it avoids the engine, creating the default game mode class, which in most cases

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,630
doesn't follow the ideal naming convention or folder structure.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,850
Now I know that in some of the previous sections you've seen how to delete classes from the project

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,940
and this can be a slightly long winded process.

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,370
So this is something that where possible we want to try and avoid having to go through that process.

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,560
So in the next lecture, we'll be looking at how we can turn a blueprint project into a C++ project

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,380
whilst also getting that full control over the project structure.

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,220
The naming conventions and things like that.

20
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,720
And just for those of you who may have noticed that my unreal engine editor interface is looking a little

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,320
bit different.

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,920
That's just because I've installed the minimal UI pack.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,210
Now, this is a free download and you can find this by following this link.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,460
And then on the get help page here, you just need to select the download option and follow the simple

25
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,530
four step installation process.

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,730
Just know, though, that even if you don't want to do this, that everything still appears in the same

27
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,840
location on the screen and it doesn't affect any of the processes that will be taking.
