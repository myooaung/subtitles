00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.330
Hello everybody and welcome to inheriting a game mode blueprint which we are going to inherit from a

2
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
game mode select start with hard coding.

3
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.130
This means that the assets are written into the code.

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.200
The file paths their exact name and if you need to update them you need to update the code itself.

5
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.580
Now our default pawn blueprint is an asset.

6
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.080
So we want to be able if we want to be able to track changes to its name is convenient to use blueprint

7
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.960
for this purpose.

8
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.210
So what we are going to end up doing is extending our C++ game mode with blueprint.

9
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.950
And if you cast your mind back right to the beginning the reason why we've got a C++ game mode is because

10
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.060
when we originally set up our project we set it up as a C++ game.

11
00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.030
And that's always a great way of starting because it's much easier to extend the C++ game mode with

12
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.340
blueprint than the other way round.

13
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.550
And then finally we will be selecting the new default porn blueprint and setting that as our default

14
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.500
porn in our scene.

15
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.890
OK.

16
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.200
So first of all I'm going to get rid of my whopping great big default porn blueprint I DRAGGED INTO

17
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.380
MY SCENE BEFORE.

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.280
And just to check when we press play at the moment if we have a look in the outline Oh still spawning

19
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.350
the default porn that comes with our game mode and if we go down and open up project settings we'll

20
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.940
be going in here in a bit.

21
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.330
So you're familiar with the area we're going to be able to select a new game mode and then set our default

22
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
porn underscore BP as the default porn class okay.

23
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.640
So let's go back over and if we have a look outside the fault porn we hover over it we will see that

24
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.180
it is parent classes default porn we've seen that before.

25
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.600
Now when it comes to the game mode itself that will be under the building escape project of the C++

26
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.540
classes in your content browser and inside this photo we can see here we've got our building escaped

27
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.140
gamer base.

28
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.440
This is the C++ class.

29
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.980
So what we want is a blueprint that inherits from the building escape game mode base in very much the

30
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.510
same way.

31
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.670
If we go back over to our blueprints of a hover over this you can see that this is inheriting from that

32
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.840
the fault porn.

33
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.180
Okay I think you've got enough information there to go ahead with our challenge.

34
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.050
Okay.

35
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.830
And your challenge.

36
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.260
Well I would like is a blueprint in the game mode.

37
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.290
So find the C++ game mode in the content browser.

38
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.680
We've already popped over to it once and create a blueprint class derived or inheriting from it.

39
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.310
Now set this as the default game mode in settings project settings maps and modes.

40
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.220
We've been there a couple of times and that's the reason why so we know where we're going.

41
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.470
And once you've done that make sure the game still runs the same.

42
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.450
And then after that we'll do a few other things as well.

43
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.830
So go ahead post video now.

44
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.300
And that's Ingo Okay everybody Welcome back.

45
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.300
Let's go ahead and blueprint the game mode okay.

46
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.370
So we go to the building escape folder here we've got our game mode base here.

47
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.140
Now you may have gone around exploring perhaps go up here to blueprints.

48
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.050
So if you're hovering around up there you probably wouldn't have found it.

49
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.200
However down in the content browser if we were to right click we can create a blueprint class based

50
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.760
upon the building escape.

51
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.010
So let's go ahead and do that.

52
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.000
I'm going to prefix it sorry suffix it with BP and create that blueprint class.

53
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.970
That was nice and quick.

54
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.220
Let's go over into our project settings now.

55
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.740
All being well the default game mode what we should now be able to do is here we go.

56
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.000
We have our new building escape game mode that we can select and look at that.

57
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.980
All of these other ones suddenly become available for editing and we can change our default pawn here

58
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.020
to our default pawn blueprint How about that.

59
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.950
Excellent.

60
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.650
So let's go back into building escape for the moment.

61
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.120
I'm going to press play and there we go.

62
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.700
Looking pretty good.

63
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.980
Let's inject ourselves so let's go play and eject and look back at ourselves now.

64
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.080
Hey that looks familiar doesn't it.

65
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.060
That's the big default porn underscored blueprint.

66
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.720
That's awesome.

67
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.190
That's exactly what we wanted to do.

68
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.780
Now if we have a look at that and scroll up here we've got our grabber.

69
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.510
So if we go ahead now and open that up we can actually make sure everything's working and that the grabber

70
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.220
component is working as well we can announce to the world we'll just log to the output log quickly and

71
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.440
say grab a reporting for duty.

72
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.130
So I'm going to right click on that and open the grabber pedophile.

73
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.970
So here we go.

74
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.140
We're over in the code now.

75
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.180
Let me close down the sidebar there and let's go into the graphic CPB and I'll begin play.

76
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.340
And let's go ahead and log out to the console basically saying hello I'm going to print it in yellow

77
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.680
so it's going to be a warning.

78
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.420
And then we just need our text macro in there.

79
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.940
OK.

80
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.880
What should we say.

81
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.650
Let's say grabber.

82
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.730
Reporting for duty.

83
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.200
Remember our semicolon on the end and save.

84
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.750
OK back over in a real stop compiler code okay let's go ahead and press play.

85
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.660
There we go on grabber is reporting for duty brilliant.

86
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.650
So there we go.

87
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.900
I think we've accomplished what we set out to do here.

88
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.800
Let me just stop for the moment and go back over into V.S. code.

89
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.470
Okay so we've got our boilerplate here with the CPB file.

90
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.030
If we go back over to the grammar dot h we can see that we've got a constructor here.

91
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.680
It's constructing the new grabber.

92
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.960
And of course the use just the prefix that unreal puts there because it is a class that is the right

93
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.030
word from you object and then we have our begin play and tick component exactly like we had with the

94
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.750
open door.

95
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.620
And let's go back over to the implementation file and then as we come down here we've got our you grabber.

96
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.680
We've got to begin play and a tick component once again.

97
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.260
And here this primary component take if you have a have something that doesn't need to have an update

98
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.570
on every frame as it says here we can say that's a false if we want to and that will be a performance

99
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.360
improvement.

100
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.520
But we do need to check every frame with our grabber is something within reach.

101
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.590
Can we grab it.

102
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.770
So in Biggin play we've got our our grabber reporting for duty so we know everything's working.

103
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.230
And then in the next lecture which starts coding up what's the grammar is actually going to be doing.

104
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.840
So I'll see well over in that next lecture.
