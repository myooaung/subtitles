Hello everybody and welcome to the section.

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.550
So what are we going to get up to.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.830
Well there is so much to cover and we've got a relatively short space of time to do so but we're going

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.660
to end up with quite a compelling game by the end of it and in the next lecture I'll show you around

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.160
the level itself that we're going to put together Now I'm just going to refer to my notes here.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.370
We're going to start off by simply setting up a branding project.

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.940
We've played in the unreal Ed but we've not actually created our brand new project from scratch before.

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280
And that's what we're going to do in this case.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.840
The next thing we're going to dive on over into is just making sure that we can layout a level something

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.350
that's compelling has a reason a back story to it.

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.690
So it's not just a test ground.

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.510
Now that is how we're going to produce a lot of our initial code and testing code.

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.840
We'll have a little sandbox environment that then will move over to a full level by the end of the section.

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.460
Now we'll be using new measures will be important things will be changing around materials so there's

15
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.530
a bit of customization of your level going on there and especially when it comes to doing things like

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130
oh I want my war to be a little bit longer.

17
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.880
Well you're going to stretch the textures and make it look odd.

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.320
So how can we combat that.

19
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.800
We'll go through the simple things that you could do in order to do that.

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.700
We'll be going through and using C++ and a little bit of blueprints where blueprints make sense.

21
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.480
And that's the important thing.

22
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.780
We don't want to dive on and use just C++ when there's a great tool especially with blueprints called

23
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.150
the timeline and you'll see that when we come to opening and closing our doors and we'll also be calling

24
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.000
the c++ code from blueprints as well so we'll see the two way interaction that can happen there.

25
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.260
And there's gonna be so much more as well that we end up covering.

26
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.200
So I'm looking forward to going through this section with you.

27
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.290
And I'm really looking forward to being able to see what you create from it.

28
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.510
This is going to be a great exercise in you being able to take the learning journey that you've had

29
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.240
and perhaps applying your own models or a different asset pack and actually creating a different world

30
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.930
and how you interact with it is going to be phenomenal.

31
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.100
So I can't wait to see them.

32
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.200
So let's dive on over into setting up our first project.
