00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,050
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,480
It's time for your end of section challenge to build what I showed you at the very beginning of course

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,800
you don't have to follow along exactly with what I've done make the level your own and have a lot of

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,450
fun.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,180
So you're going to create a new level go up to new file do new level and give it a name and then you

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,540
can go to your levels folder and go backwards and forwards between the one you've got and your new one.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,990
Now let's make something a bit more than just a rooms with a couple of things in it that we can move

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:39,430
essentially or we have at the moment is a tech demo and that's not as inspiring as you could have otherwise.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,400
Now I would recommend getting some assets from the assets that you don't have to do that you could use

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,870
BSP and build up a simple game that you're working on from there.

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,610
It's entirely up to you how you approach this but what I would like you to do is just combine all of

12
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,690
the knowledge that you've learned so far.

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,950
Now I'm going to go onto the unreal asset store and use the medieval dungeon pack.

14
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,340
Now if you want to know how to do that then watch the first part of the challenge solution.

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,220
But if you already know how to do that then you can plow forward and get one of those asset packs.

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,220
Now this one is now this one is free which is great because we can just go ahead and use it.

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,190
And of course this will test your level design skills even though we've not done any formal training

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,700
on it.

19
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,730
Just make something that's simple and have fun.

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,670
I mean my level itself is quite big.

21
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,480
So if you remember right at the very beginning making something like that's probably going to take you

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,530
between two and five hours to do so I wouldn't recommend going over the top make sure it's small enough

23
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,560
that you can you feel confident that you can get it done in maybe a couple of hours including anything

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,580
extra that you want to do.

25
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,950
So an example there might be that you instead of having the doors open on a hinge you might want to

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,470
have them lift up and down or slide.

27
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,240
It's entirely up to you but have fun.

28
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,520
And then finally I want you to show off your creations in the discussions.

29
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:05,970
I want to see what you guys end up making Paul's video now and give us a go okay.

30
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,850
Everybody welcome back.

31
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:13,100
Let's go ahead and start building our level Okay so one word of warning here.

32
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,180
If you're on Linux I'm afraid you're going to have to go and grab or a friend or grab a Mac or P.C.

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,770
in order to do this.

34
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,270
Parts of it you cannot access the marketplace on Linux.

35
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,470
Currently there are some third party things that you can use but I'm not going to show you through that

36
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,680
in the course because they've they've turns out to be pretty unstable.

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,260
So under the Unreal Engine side tablets go to the market place in the marketplace.

38
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,600
There are quite a few different options available to you so you might want to go ahead and pick something

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,500
different.

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,620
Now I'm going to search under the free category.

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,370
See here free and providing you've signed it of course you can pick any of these things that are in

42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,130
here for free.

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,390
Now what I'm looking for specifically my search for products and go for dungeon I start typing is bound

44
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,870
to find it any way.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,440
There we go.

46
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,740
So I've not got the free tab enable it's quite simple to do over here on the right hand side on filter

47
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,960
on the max price.

48
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,380
I'm going to select free.

49
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,030
And there we go there's the medieval dungeon.

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,900
You can see I've already got it.

51
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,060
If you go ahead and you want to follow along with the kit I've got you can see this is pretty awesome

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,260
for creating something.

53
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:24,790
What you can then do is go ahead and add it to your project so you can click that dropdown and select

54
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,310
the projects that you want.

55
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,680
Now I've already popped into my project so I won't be doing that and I'm basically going to jump into

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:40,030
a speed run now of me building the level as it took just over three hours in total to do and that would

57
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,100
be a very long video to watch through.

58
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,030
Okay so I'll play that now and I'll see you all again soon.

59
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:41,930
Okay.

60
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,290
So here's my final level.

61
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,800
It's much in the same spirit as the original one.

62
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,860
Everything's a little bit larger.

63
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,810
So we've got the God rays coming through there some nice highlighting from the sun in the background

64
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,820
as well I really like the deep orange I've picked her.

65
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,940
Now I did see if I could jump over the gates and it turns out I can.

66
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,050
So this is one of the great things about play testing you don't necessarily find out these things unless

67
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,520
you start mucking about.

68
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,710
But I know how to win the game so go and grab the dark puppet next to here and then I can steal the

69
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,060
golden statue.

70
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,690
Of course the moment I remove it the doors shots in hats I managed to get the statue out but not me.

71
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:27,110
So replacing the gargoyle exactly the same stuff that we worked with in the course itself.

72
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,520
And then the door opens again and we can run off.

73
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,940
Goodbye everybody.

74
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,680
It's time to go.

75
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,680
Excellent.

76
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,020
So I had lots of fun putting that together and I'm really looking forward to seeing yours.

77
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,820
So please share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
