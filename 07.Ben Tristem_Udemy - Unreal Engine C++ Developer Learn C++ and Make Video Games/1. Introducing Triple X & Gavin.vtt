Hey guys.
1

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.680
So a quick overview of this video we're gonna introduce Gavin we're going to explain what this game
2

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.610
is all about.
3

4
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.500
We're gonna talk about Visual Studio Community 2019.
4

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.030
We're going to warn you of a couple of traps in the section and then that's it.
5

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.140
So Gavin who are you.
6

7
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.890
Hello.
7

8
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.970
So I'm Gavin I've been teaching on real for nearly five years now.
8

9
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.990
So we gonna get started with this game before we go into Unreal because we just wanna get some foundations
9

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.590
with C++. Absolutely so that's TripleX it's a fun number based puzzle game that's gonna give you just
10

11
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.730
the foundations you need.
11

12
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.380
So also if you are watching this video we are using Gavin we using Visual Studio Code.
12

13
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.100
But Gavin is it possible to follow along in Visual Studio Community.
13

14
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.160
Yes absolutely yes.
14

15
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.590
The main... We're teaching in Visual Studio Code.
15

16
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.720
But if you're using Community or you're used to Community you can absolutely follow along in Visual
16

17
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.280
Studio Community either 2017 or 2019.
17

18
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.660
Yeah absolutely.
18

19
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.980
That's mainly if you are of course, exclusively if you're P.C. guys out there.
19

20
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.200
OK.
20

21
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.030
So another slight warning for you at some points in this section we'll be using things that are very
21

22
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.150
specific to using C++ on the terminal like "cin" and "cout" you'll see those Gavin will guide you through
22

23
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.320
the points at which you shouldn't dive too deep unless you're specifically interested because those
23

24
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.570
things won't be applying to Unreal but they're necessary to it to create a game like this on the terminal
24

25
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.920
and shield you from all the complexity of Unreal and what is the purpose of this section what are we
25

26
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.060
setting everybody up for.
26

27
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.340
Yeah we're just getting use up of just that the absolute foundations of C++ really because if you jump
27

28
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.790
straight into Unreal you just got to be overwhelmed with the amount of stuff that's already there.
28

29
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.840
So we're just getting you absolutely prepared ready for your first steps into Unreal.
29

30
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.410
Awesome.
30

31
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.630
Okay.
31

32
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.090
So enjoy the section and I think you're gonna find that if you're new to C++ this is going to give you
32

33
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.650
a great basic foundation.
33

34
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.390
So over to Gavin, see you in there.
