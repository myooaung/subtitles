00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,090
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,190
In this lecture, we're going to be working on a focus.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,720
So that is some built in functionality, in unreeled that we can use to make sure that our A.I. characters

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,550
follow us around the world, are able to aim at us no matter where we go.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,920
Let's dive in and see how focused works.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,990
So I currently doesn't really do very much, and I think a first starting point for it to do anything

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,500
would be for it to turn and face towards our player.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,980
Now, to do this, where we can use some built in functionality of the A.I., which is setting a focal

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,400
point.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,370
So if you have a look at the A.I. control dot h and look for set focus, there's a couple of relevant

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,120
methods here.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,740
One is set focal points.

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,910
The other is set focus.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,220
And the one just below that is clear focus.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,330
So the idea here is that you can tell the A.I. controller that it should be trying to focus either on

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,780
a particular point or it should be trying to focus on a particular actor.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,870
If you choose the latter, if you choose to focus on an actor, then what's going to happen is as that

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,560
actor moves, you're going to keep focusing on that actor.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,060
Whereas if he chose to focus on a particular point, you would keep focusing on that point.

20
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,330
But if that point was the location of an actor, when the actor moves, that point does not get updated.

21
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,250
So typically, focal points are for things that are fixed in the world, actors for things that move

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:28,640
around.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,510
That kind of makes sense.

24
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,990
And then we have this clear focus function down here, which tells us that we should stop focusing on

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,380
something.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,120
So that's how it works.

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,840
You set focus, you clearer focus.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,930
Now, there is this priority variable in here which we are going to come to a little bit.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,410
But the idea here is you've got different levels of priority.

30
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,370
We've got this enum here, which by default on set focus and set focal point is set to gameplay.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,440
If we go and have a look at the definition of that enum, you can see there is a default move and gameplay

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,150
and they're basically listed in the order of priority.

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,530
So game play will have the highest priority if he said something is gameplay.

34
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,770
That's what it's going to look at.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,710
If gameplay isn't set because you cleared the gameplay priority, then it's going to look where it's

36
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,310
going.

37
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,460
And if it's not moving anywhere, then it's going to just look at the default priority, which might

38
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,200
just be some wear off in the distance.

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,210
So if you've got a guard, there's got a patrolling behavior, he'll default to looking to where he's

40
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,080
next moving to.

41
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,010
Once he gets there, you could set a default point for him to look at.

42
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,230
So I don't know, maybe he's looking at the entry way to his particular zone.

43
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,250
Something like that.

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,890
Anyway, this is what the priorities are all about.

45
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,460
As I say, we weren't have to be using them too much because we're mostly going to be using this gameplay

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,830
functionality to say that, hey, there's something interesting going on over there.

47
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,640
There's the player.

48
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,500
So let's go ahead and look at him.

49
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,650
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to implement to begin play on our A.I. controller so

50
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,840
that we can set the focus on begin play.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,720
That's just going to be to show us how this function works.

52
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,830
So begin play, as we've probably seen before, it's a protected function.

53
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:16,160
So we need to create a protected section and then we want our virtual void begin play again to put the

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,190
override keyword just for safety here.

55
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,470
And then we're going to go ahead and create implementation over in the C++ and we're going to want to

56
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,450
call to super begin play because that's always good practice, because otherwise things in blueprints

57
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,020
go wrong.

58
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,440
If you forget to do this, you can have a problem with blueprints.

59
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,220
After you've created a big begin play, make sure you check that you're calling to super.

60
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:46,130
And then at this point, what we want to do is get hold of the porn actor and set the focus to it to

61
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,270
get hold of a porn actor.

62
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:53,930
We can use a function from the gameplay static's header, which if you hover over their source, search

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,380
in control.

64
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,800
Pete.

65
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,850
Fine gameplay static's.

66
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,780
You can find that this is under the kismet forward slash gameplay static's.

67
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,550
So it will go back over to the shooter A.I. Controller CVP and include that.

68
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,340
So hash include and then it's going to be kismet forward slash gameplay static's.

69
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:17,780
And then we should be able to do our new gameplay static's and use a function from within here which

70
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,290
I find very useful is the get player porn which is gainst return as a point to play a porn.

71
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,180
And it does that by taking in a world context object and the play index.

72
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,370
In our case we're going to find the zero player.

73
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:39,020
So let's say you get play a porn and do a get world and then we're going to look for index zero and

74
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,820
we're gonna save this into a variable.

75
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,870
A porn.

76
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,880
Which is going to be the player porn like say, that's what we want to focus on.

77
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,100
So it's challenge time for you to set the focus.

78
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,620
Use the play, a pawn that we've just got using our game, play static's function, call set focus and

79
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,210
test it out in the world to see if you move around our different A.I. characters.

80
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,860
Will they follow you?

81
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,650
Will their gaze follow pause video and find out?

82
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,850
Okay, welcome back.

83
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,980
So hopefully it wasn't too difficult.

84
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,800
We need to call set focus because that focus is on a parent.

85
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,060
We don't have to find any pointers here.

86
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,110
We do set focus and what we got here, we just need to put in the actor, basically, because the priority

87
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,830
is already got a default of being set to the game play, which is what we wanted anyway.

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,930
So we can just passin in play a pawn and that should be who we focus on.

89
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,950
So let's go ahead and build.

90
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,500
And once that's done, let's hop over to Unreal and play.

91
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,490
For some reason, I still have this pesky spawn point here.

92
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,520
Let's go ahead and delete that and make sure we're spawning near our A.I. character.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,660
Here we go.

94
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,900
Let's go and have a look, a little walk around this A.I. carrots.

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,690
And instantly I can see that he is turning to face my porn wherever my porn leads.

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,620
So that is the beginnings of some A.I. in place.

97
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,090
I know it's not much, but we're going to work on that, getting this even deeper in the next lecture.

98
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,990
I'll see you there.
