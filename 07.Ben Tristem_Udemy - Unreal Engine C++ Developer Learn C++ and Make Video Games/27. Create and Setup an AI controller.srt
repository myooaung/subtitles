00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,300
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,150
In this lecture, we're going to be setting up the basics in place for our A.I. getting started on the

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,240
whole A.I. process, which is going to be quite a series of lectures.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,040
So we're starting with a revision of A.I. controllers and blueprints.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,530
Let's dive in and see what we're revising.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,730
So let's check back in with our project plan at the moment.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,710
We have done player movements, animation, shooting, health and death.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,720
So far, those things are pretty much covered.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,080
We're going to look next at a very big chunk, which is going to be the enemy A.I..

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,530
So let's get started.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,150
The first thing we always need to do with A.I. is to have an A.I. controller.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,800
So we're gonna go over and create a C++ one that I'm going to challenge you to create the blueprint

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,040
subclass and hook it up as the default for the pawn.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,080
So we're going to go to add new create a new C++ class in here and then we're going to go down and look

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,190
for if there is an AI controller in here.

16
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,040
I'm not sure if there is something to show or classes and look for the A.I. controller.

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,370
And we're going to use that as a base class.

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:23,670
Go ahead and rename it to something like Chuter, A.I. controller and go and create that class.

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,550
And once that's gone ahead and generated and recompile, it may take a little while in your system.

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,390
You should end up with a C++ class like this.

21
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,510
Now, that's pretty much all I'm going to do because the rest you should be able to remember some of

22
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,080
it yourself.

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,370
We done a lot of this in the previous section already.

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,480
So let's see if you can do it.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,920
So here's a challenge to create a blueprint child.

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,300
You're going to have to first create the child class.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,530
Then set it as the A.I. for our blueprint character.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,130
You may or may not remember, but that has to go.

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,500
You go into your blueprint for that character.

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:05,230
The first person should, while the third person shooter character and you can set the A.I. that should

31
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,150
automatically possess these characters when they're placed in the world and then test the actors.

32
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:17,500
I'll create to test that the A.I. controller actors are created by basically UN possessing, doing their

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,570
fate and having a look in your world outliner to see if those actors are present.

34
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,430
Pause video and have a go.

35
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,680
Hey, welcome back.

36
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,140
So first of all, we're gonna create a blueprint.

37
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,340
Child class here.

38
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,640
So I'm going to do that by going to add new blueprint class and I'm going to make it a child of the

39
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,890
shooter, A.I. controller.

40
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:47,360
And then I'm gonna call it the BP underscore Chuter A.I. controller I and get the capitalization right.

41
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,850
Like so and then we want to make that the defo A.I. for our BP Chuter characters.

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,790
I'm going to open up the BP chute's character and dock it to the main window.

43
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,320
And then I'm going to go to the class defaults details.

44
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,360
And in here, we should have, under the porn settings, the A.I. control class, which we want to switch

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,160
over to the BP underscore Chuter A.I. controller so I can click all save.

46
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:21,940
Okay, do all of that and go Olt P to play and then F eight to D possess and have my mouse back and

47
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,200
look in the world outliner.

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,540
We should be looking for a shooter A.I..

49
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,470
And here we go.

50
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,420
The BP shooter, A.I. controller is being created for that character we put in the world.

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,400
If you are to put more characters in the world, there would be more A.I. controllers being created.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,550
And do watch out.

53
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,400
That is the blueprint version being created because we want any of the modifications that we make in

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,940
Blueprint to be showing up in our game, basically.

55
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,590
Cool.

56
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,730
So we've just gone through a quick revision of how we typically set up A.I. controllers.

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,140
And next, that show will be actually making that A.I. controller do something.

58
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Basically aiming at our player.

59
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,880
So you then.
