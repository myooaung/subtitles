1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,250
Okay, so to finalize our level creation, we're going to play with the landscape itself.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,010
Let's make the viewport slightly larger.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,900
And let's zoom out.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,840
So you may want to adjust both the look, these textures applied these materials on the surface.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,330
Or you might want to put another hill in.

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,070
Let's see how you'd go about that.

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,980
So over in the mode's tap, in the Mode's window, for those of you using a version of Unreal since

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,180
four point two five, you'll notice that the Mode's pain is no longer here.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,330
Over on the left, by default, it's now on the taskbar.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,810
So you click on modes here and then you can use the different options here to select landscape, et

11
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,220
cetera.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,000
And that gives you a new tab over here on the left.

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,800
We've got a series of options along the top and now that's that's open.

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,230
You probably guessed we want the landscape option, which we can see there.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,740
The shortcut key for is shift three.

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,220
If we go ahead, click on that.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,290
We have a series of options.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,150
We've got Manege sculpt and paint.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,090
Let's start off with the sculpting itself.

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,140
So let's zoom out ever so slightly, move around.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,490
Let's use this area over here to practice then, because it's a bit of dead space, as it were.

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,100
Now, it's often the case that a lot of levels that you work on will have an artificial wall around

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,310
them.

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,000
And you can do that with a mountain range or something along those lines.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,660
At the moment, you can see as we go over the top, we have this brush.

26
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,440
It has a main area and then a fall off to it as well.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:38,290
So it's not jarring as we start moving and we can see here under the brush settings, we've got a size

28
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,720
and fall off if we change the size of the full office.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,300
Can't can't really do it there.

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,210
But you can see as if I set the brush fall off to one.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,890
It's a very, very, very gentle hell that it will create.

32
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,710
We set that down to zero, will end up with a much harsher transition, more like a plateau.

33
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,560
Now, of course, the brush size is rather large at the moment.

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,840
That's absolutely fine whilst we're playing around.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,110
We do have other options as well.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,270
We've got the strength of the brush is set to point three.

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,180
And that basically means that as we start changing the landscape, as you can see here, is only moving

38
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,620
a little bit with every click.

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,330
We start moving the mouse around.

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,500
We do get some additional landscape forming.

41
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,780
That's pretty cool shape.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,640
I've just made that.

43
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,560
If we turn that all the way up to one, you'll get rapid transition and very quickly see, you will

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,960
have to watch out for that.

45
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:28,870
Of course.

46
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,240
How do you go about undoing this?

47
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,000
Say we've made it to two and we want to shrink it down a little, but without just undoing everything,

48
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,340
which could be a bit too much to do.

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,680
So we can redo any undo with control and why there was some programs you may be used to control Shift

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,160
and Z.

51
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
But in this case, it's control and why?

52
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,620
We'll bring that back.

53
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,260
So with the strength set to one.

54
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,550
Anything that I try and do is going to be very rapid.

55
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,060
So let's bring that back down to the point three.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,160
So you can both drag your mouse around here or type in the value that you want and press enter.

57
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,590
Now we can hold down shift and it will do the opposite of what it's currently being doing, which is

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,280
really useful.

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,340
We can then change the landscape backwards and forwards to get the overall form that we want.

60
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,750
You'll notice at the top here, we do have some slightly different tools at the moment.

61
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,030
We're using the sculpting so we can go through and flatten or smooth out.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,560
So we've ended up with a lot of jarring geometry here where the landscape is.

63
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,870
We could come in and smooth that out.

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,070
And there we go.

65
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:39,580
It it's a lot easier to follow around now and it's very easy to get very carried away with this and

66
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,550
really start enjoying the process of making our world.

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,770
But before I get too carried away with the sculpting tools, I want to introduce you to the painting

68
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,280
tools.

69
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,650
So you probably guessed where this is going to do.

70
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,780
It's gonna give us a series of options in terms of what this is going to look like.

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,210
So we've got a couple of layers, a couple of layers that we can paint onto our world.

72
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,340
And we can see quite clearly we've got our path material running through.

73
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,640
We've got grass and we've also got this beach colour so we can add some warn areas in as well.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,280
So we can carry on the path if we wanted to.

75
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,810
Not with this size brush, though.

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,320
Let's make that smaller, maybe 300 or so so we can just come in and let's say the path goes down there,

77
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,280
maybe want to make that's a little larger and strength.

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,420
This might be one way you do want it to be 100 percent for the first run.

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:39,670
So you can really define where the actual path is and then maybe come back later with a lighter brush

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,450
and come in and make things just a little bit smoother as we go round.

81
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,590
Now, of course, this is entirely up to you, how you end up making your world look.

82
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,200
It's a lot of fun to start playing with things.

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,380
We can see here that we had shaders compiling for a moment.

84
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,690
So this area of landscape just disappeared.

85
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,550
Don't fret if that happens.

86
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,830
I'm also going to turn my brush, fall off a bit higher as well, which is going to give me a much softer

87
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,310
edge.

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,100
So we can have a Sandy area there as well, and I can add a bit of grass in as we go back.

89
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,970
Perfect.

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,090
You may also notice that the path itself has these mesh items placed on top of it as well.

91
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,910
And you already know how to do that.

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,070
So there we go.

93
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,580
That's pretty much everything you're going to need to know in order to make this world your own.

94
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:31,150
And one thing I do want to cover just before your challenge, if we go ahead back to sculpt mode and

95
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,150
go to where we've already got something on the ground.

96
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,920
Let's have a look at this tree just here.

97
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,460
If we decide to raise up so let's go not to the smooth tile, but back to sculpt if we decide to raise

98
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,030
up the ground.

99
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,560
Notice that the assets that was on the ground get swallowed up.

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,530
In fact, we could swallow up the cow quite easily.

101
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,140
This is a problem, of course.

102
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,910
And why you need to be careful about making sure your landscape is what you roughly want it to be first.

103
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,810
Otherwise, you may end up burying a ton of assets unnecessarily.

104
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,640
So I'm going to undo that for the moment.

105
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,010
Let's say we did put a little bit of a mound here.

106
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,210
What we can then go ahead and do is place the tree back on top of it.

107
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,110
And to do that, we will need to switch back to the place or shift one.

108
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:21,430
Once we've got that tall, I'm going to shift select the tree and then making sure that we have surface

109
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,480
snapping turned on.

110
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,530
It won't take long if we grab the little ball here to snap it to the surface.

111
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,180
And you can see the moment I've done that has separated the top here.

112
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,170
They've got different origins by the look of it.

113
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,180
So I can put that back on top.

114
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,610
And then we've got our cow as well.

115
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,460
Now, this is perhaps where you do want rotate the surface normal because a cow might be stood on on

116
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,180
the top just up here or even looking down the slope like that.

117
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:53,470
Let's go ahead and press play to make sure things make sense now because I've moved my interface around

118
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,930
a little play no longer exists up here.

119
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,550
We have to go to the double Chevron at the end and then we can hit the play button.

120
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,400
Alternatively, you can get used to using the shortcut key OLT and P, and there we go.

121
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,000
We can see here that with a wider frame, it's going to look roughly like that.

122
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,570
So we can set things up based upon how we're starting.

123
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,150
And of course, looks a bit more closely if we were setting the player start.

124
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,860
Not so close to the sign.

125
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,220
And now it's time for your challenge.

126
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,670
And the challenge is to make the world your own.

127
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,720
So edit the landscape, add some additional actors.

128
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,630
Those are the two main things that you can do in this particular case.

129
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,240
And most importantly, I'd like you to have fun.

130
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,970
You should find yourself much more comfortable in Unreal now that we've been playing with the interface

131
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,170
and the level itself.

132
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,820
And that's really important because then you're not focused on how do I use this thing when it comes

133
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,640
to the coding, which we're going to be diving into really soon.

134
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,970
So once you've gone ahead and made the world your own.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,130
I'd like you to share some screenshots of the level that you've created over in the discussions.

136
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,140
Pause video.

137
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,560
Now make the world your own, and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
