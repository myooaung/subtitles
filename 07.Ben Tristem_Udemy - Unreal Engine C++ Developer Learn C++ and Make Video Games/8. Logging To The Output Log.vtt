00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.450
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.170
In this lecture we're going to focus on runtime messages for feedback.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.110
So what are we creating our game was very easy when we're using a terminal based game like in the last

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.120
section with the ball game terminal we could just type in things and test them and get them printed

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.810
out.

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.740
Now similar to how we were using print line in the previous section we can use something with the unreal

7
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.680
output log.

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.930
And that's something is the use log.

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.310
We then have a couple of parameters that are passed into this.

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.880
We've got the category in which we can place things now.

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.110
You can have custom categories we're not going to cover that in this lecture.

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.700
Now the verbosity.

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.920
This simply says where things are going to go so we can log just in the outputs log we can output in

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.260
it to a text file and things like that as well.

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.990
In this particular case we'll be using one of three keywords that we can put in here and then we've

16
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.870
got the text macro which you're all familiar with by now.

17
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.090
And then the message we want to display now what we're going to use is the following.

18
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.770
So we're going to give you a log.

19
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.180
Then we're gonna do log temp.

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.460
So it's just going to come up in the output log.

21
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.540
It's just a temporary log.

22
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.990
In this particular case as we're going through and testing warning what does that mean.

23
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.410
Well it's actually going to color in our message that we give yellow and we'll see that in more detail

24
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.980
in a moment.

25
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.700
And finally the message is hello once again within that text macro.

26
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.340
So what other words could we use where we could use error if we wanted it to come up red warning is

27
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.580
yellow and just the display is green.

28
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.660
So this type of TV is code and have a look okay.

29
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.070
So now wherever MVS code.

30
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.170
The first thing that we can do is decide where we're going to go ahead and put this logging code.

31
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.650
Now we could put it in a couple of places we could outputs it here so that when the object gets constructed

32
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.530
it outputs to the log.

33
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.640
But we can also do here which is when we go ahead and press play let's go ahead and pop it here instead.

34
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.340
So we need you a log comes up straightaway brilliant and then we're going to open our brackets.

35
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.910
The first thing is our category name.

36
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.420
Here we go this is what we're talking about before log temp.

37
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.170
Brilliant.

38
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.980
And then finally here we can have a yellow warning and then we use our text macro as we've done before.

39
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.760
Open those brackets and say this is a warning exclamation mark.

40
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.080
And then finally the semicolon at the end.

41
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.800
Now I'm going to save that and dive over to 0.

42
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.880
We've missed something here.

43
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.240
We've missed a comma.

44
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.690
Make sure you've got all three parameters in that X and save our file and go over into one row.

45
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.670
Okay brilliant let's go ahead and press compile and we won't see the log straightaway.

46
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.180
So whilst that's compiling let's go up to the window menu and go down to developer tools and there are

47
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.060
a couple of different logs here we want the output log compiles complete brilliant so nothing will be

48
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.100
in here yet and this is everything that's going on in unreal at the moment.

49
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.610
So what we can do here is go up to the top and press play and then here we have a look down in the log

50
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.980
towards the bottom.

51
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.130
Yes here we go.

52
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.020
This is a warning this is a warning.

53
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.210
Why is that coming up twice.

54
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.380
Well if we just stop and come out and then we'll have a look at some of the things that were going on

55
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.200
there as well.

56
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.890
We've got our world position component on both these two objects.

57
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.130
So the moment that the game is being played both of these world position components are outputting that

58
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.330
warning.

59
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.980
Now a couple of things here I want to clear up with yourselves.

60
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.490
When we go ahead and press play we end up with this message at the top here the lighting needs to be

61
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.270
rebuilt.

62
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.090
That's nothing to panic about in Unreal.

63
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.530
The lighting is static.

64
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.140
That's how it looks so pretty.

65
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.950
And so what we need to do is build the lighting occasionally.

66
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.750
This is not going to affect the running of our game but it will affect the looks of our game.

67
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.250
So we don't want it running all the time because it's quite an intensive process.

68
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.390
The other thing I want to sort out is the fact that we're facing the wrong way when we start our game

69
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.710
sets come out of here press stop.

70
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.090
Now how you can build and we'll be using this later on when we talk about some BSP is when we map out

71
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.660
our level but we just press build here.

72
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.580
It'll do everything that we need to do.

73
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.960
We've got a warning here which is now gone.

74
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.170
Perfect.

75
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.070
And now when we press play that is no longer an issue.

76
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.980
OK so the final thing here is making sure that we're facing the right way when we started the game that's

77
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.520
going to be very straightforward to do.

78
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.920
So we've got our player start position just here.

79
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.040
I'm going to pull that forward using the rotation key which was a I'm just gonna rotate that all the

80
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.590
way round 180.

81
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.690
And then when we start our game we'll be facing the right way.

82
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.490
So now it's time for your quick challenge.

83
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.110
Okay see your challenge is to create a log message that is red and gray as well so you're gonna have

84
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.870
two additional log messages.

85
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.270
And so in total you'll end up with three in total.

86
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:07.190
Per component that you've got in your scene positivity now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome

87
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.400
back.

88
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.610
Let's go ahead now and create our red and grey warning messages.

89
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.210
Okay.

90
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.020
So I would normally say let's not copy and paste.

91
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.580
So let's not copy and paste.

92
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.800
So we've got a warning there.

93
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.330
We can also have our you log log temp and this time it's going to be an error.

94
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.510
This one is going to come out red.

95
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.260
Now what are we going to say in this one.

96
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.840
Well let's be explicit about what it is.

97
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.710
It will probably be this is all let's just put era actually nice and short because that is what you'd

98
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.290
want.

99
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.450
I'm gonna place the next one up here so there is ascending order of importance let's say.

100
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.250
So this is gonna be a log temp and this time it's just gonna be display.

101
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.540
Now noticed that they've all got capitals at the beginning this is important if you have a lower case

102
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.210
in there these wouldn't work.

103
00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.510
I've been caught out with that before when trying to debug something that's been going on so just a

104
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:10.190
log nothing to see will hopefully would never outputs just a log for the sake of doing it.

105
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.890
But this is for practice.

106
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.970
Okay so everything's okay there apart from the semicolon on the end.

107
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.180
Excellent.

108
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.490
So we should end up with a great message.

109
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.270
A yellow message and a red message.

110
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.420
And then that's again because we have two actors with this component on them in our scene.

111
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.670
So let's go ahead and compile let's press play.

112
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.790
Okay and let's have a look at the output log itself.

113
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.590
Here we go.

114
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.860
Just the log enough to see this as a warning error.

115
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.630
Perfect that's exactly what I wanted to see.

116
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.430
Now that was pretty straightforward we used to doing that sort of thing when we were doing the bull

117
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.230
Cal game.

118
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.650
Excellent.

119
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:52.400
So one last thing I want to let you know about is in the lecture resources I've included a link to the

120
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.710
documentation with all of the rest of things that you could implement using the logging system.

121
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.980
Let's take a look at that and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
