00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,750
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,130
In this lecture we're going to log out to the console for the moment what our ray coming from us our

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,230
reach out into the world is intersecting with.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,790
So we've got our cube and our cone.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,430
And as I walk up to them if you pay attention to the log Well we get close enough.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,850
We've got a line trace here.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,060
We've intersected with the cube and we go to the cone we get the same thing there but nothing will happen

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,180
with any of the other objects that are not set.

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:40,410
As we talked about in the previous lecture with the four simulator physics turned on and the collision

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,850
object type set of physics body let's dive over into unreal OK.

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:54,010
So I said on real actually MVS code let's do a tiny bit of tidying up here and we'll get rid of the

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,560
logging that we've been doing we'll be doing some different logs in a bit.

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,690
When we log out to test I'm going to keep that line but just put it further down because we're going

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:10,720
to log out that's going to be your end challenge to lock out anything that we're intersecting with with

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,180
our ray cast.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,780
So we're going to have to recast out to a certain distance which we've already defined up here.

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,820
So it's going to be quite straightforward to start building up the beginning bits of our cast.

18
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,730
And then there are some new concepts that we've got to go through now when we're right casting.

19
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,050
This we'll be in the world.

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,770
So the first thing we want to do is get the world.

21
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:39,590
So we're in our level and then we need to use the line trace single by object.

22
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,740
So line trace single by objects.

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,590
I've done it before.

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,530
It's top of my list.

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:50,170
You may have to type more letters and now comes the interesting part there's lots to go through here.

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,210
Let's go through it one by one.

27
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,480
So the first thing we've got here is s hit results and then we can see it's a reference and it's an

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,000
out parameter as well.

29
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,620
So how do we deal with this.

30
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,690
Well let's go ahead and create an F hit result because we don't have one at the moment for it to be

31
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:14,700
stored in F hit results and we should just call it hit for the moment now because it is an out parameter.

32
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:21,460
We can just type in our macro to highlight the fathers and our parameter and then we've got the hits

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,840
variable name.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,570
Okay.

35
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,330
Now unfortunately the auto completes is having a moment I don't want a semicolon.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,170
I do apologize.

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,880
That's a comma.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,330
There we go.

39
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,480
And then we get the auto complete.

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,400
Right.

41
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,420
The constant vector starts Well currently we're using the player viewpoint location which is the center

42
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,400
of the fault pawn essentially.

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,660
So that is just the player view points a location that's the right one comma.

44
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,280
What's the end point.

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,950
Well we've already defined that as well.

46
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,710
That's the line trace and that we've been working with now of course because these two things are linked

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,980
to the debug line that we've already drawn in our scene on line 47.

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,140
That means that if we change any of the settings like the reach we'll get a visual representation with

49
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,710
our draw debug line.

50
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:19,180
And of course our code with how far we are actually interacting with the world will also be the same

51
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,010
right.

52
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,050
The next thing here.

53
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,520
This is where it starts to get a bit interesting.

54
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,950
So you've got an F collision object query parameters.

55
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,800
Okay let's start typing that since the F collision query parameter is that right.

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,500
Object query param so it's important here there's a lot of things with similar names.

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,020
So let's carry on typing here until we get the one that we want.

58
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,170
Object query parameters.

59
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,530
Okay let's open up parentheses here.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,450
Let's have a look at the different signatures here so we get one that takes in nothing.

61
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:59,290
And I believe the one that we're actually looking for will be something to do with collections object

62
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,680
collisions i.e. collision query channel.

63
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,890
This is the one.

64
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,390
Now if you remember in the last lecture let's go over into our real in fact.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,460
If we go ahead and select an object like this we have the object type as a physics body that's what

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,800
we're talking about here.

67
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,100
The collision channel which channel is its own.

68
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,990
So we've got physics body then let's see if we can go and use it.

69
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,320
So e collision channel.

70
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,350
Now if we hover over each collision channel we can see that is an enum and in order to access any members

71
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,760
of an enum you use two colons next to one another.

72
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,730
And then we've got a load of options I can already see physics body is there but if we starts searching

73
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,400
it's right there for us.

74
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,400
Okay.

75
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,110
The next one.

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,890
Now this has nothing to do the object query parameters we're not querying which object but this is just

77
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,410
the parameters for the collision query itself.

78
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:02,460
So before get world let's go ahead and create our f collision.

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,170
Now be careful there's many options here it's the query parameters that we want and what should we call

80
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,310
it let's call it trace paradigms I think or something along those lines.

81
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:19,120
So nice and clear what is is and what we're using it for let's open up our brackets and I'll put my

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,540
semicolon on the end straight away and I'm also gonna do that down here as well.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,740
OK so what are we going to put in there.

84
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,970
Well there's no auto fill coming up on this.

85
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,890
So let's go and have a look at this online.

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,020
Okay.

87
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,900
It's a structure that defines parameters passed into the collision function.

88
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,030
That seems pretty clear.

89
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,520
Now we may have to include hash include collision query parameters.

90
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,460
I think we're covered.

91
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,770
I think it's a subset of something else we've already included.

92
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,330
Here we go here's the interesting one here of the constructors that we can use now looking at it I think

93
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,490
it's this third one down that we're going to have a look.

94
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,820
So let's drill a little deeper into it.

95
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,410
Yes yes.

96
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,100
This is the one.

97
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,390
So we have the name.

98
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:10,510
So in trace tag are we using tags in order to query whether we've collided with something.

99
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:17,320
No we're not we're actually using the e collision channel sets of physics body in order to assess whether

100
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,980
it's a valid object for collision.

101
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,660
So the next one hairball in trace complex what does that mean.

102
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:30,100
Well let's go over to unravel quickly so it's a basic question Are we viewing the world like s with

103
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,960
all of our simple collisions or are we viewing it with the visibility collision.

104
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,830
Now as I was saying if you were trying to reach through the door you'd have to have this set to true.

105
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,940
So are you using the complex collisions.

106
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,220
The answer of course is going to be no we don't want any complex objects.

107
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,180
So we've got something with wings on it.

108
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,490
We don't want it make to make it any more difficult for the player to interact with the objects than

109
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,580
it needs to be.

110
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,420
Unless of course it's a dexterity challenge.

111
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,100
And then finally what do we need to ignore other any actors we need to ignore.

112
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:13,010
And if we have a look at ourselves in the world let's go ahead and press play checks ourselves from

113
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,960
the scene.

114
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,020
We won't be able to see in this view and we get old and fall and go back.

115
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:25,970
So because our ray cast at the moment originates from with in the sphere itself.

116
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,270
If I can just clip through there we go as he starts inside of the first object that we actually hit

117
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,400
is ourselves.

118
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,950
So we need to make sure that we ignore ourselves.

119
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,200
Otherwise we won't be able to pick up anything in our world.

120
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:39,760
Okay.

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,330
So let's go back to our code here.

122
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,400
So we're looking for a couple of things.

123
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,360
The first one was is there any f nine.

124
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,750
Now we can't leave these blank.

125
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:54,840
We still have to start filling them in but we can leave the value itself blank when we get there.

126
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,440
So we need our text macro.

127
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,200
Can't do that.

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,340
So text macro but we leave it blank in there.

129
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,110
So that's our first parameter.

130
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,720
Let's go to our second one.

131
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,260
I've gone to father and that was whether or not we were using the complex.

132
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,970
Aha.

133
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,440
Look I started to give us the various constructors that we could have.

134
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,690
But we know that this is going to be false.

135
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,230
We don't want to use the complex.

136
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:27,380
And the final one here is is there anything that we should ignore yes we need to ignore us and we are

137
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,040
the owner the grabber is on us.

138
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:38,390
So we can just get ona now providing I've got enough parentheses that should be working and now we can

139
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,600
use that down here.

140
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,230
Now there is a red squiggle here.

141
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,350
Have we got enough.

142
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,170
No we've not got enough parentheses around this bit here first.

143
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,720
OK that's good.

144
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,090
And we've got too many at the end.

145
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,880
It can be very difficult to keep track of all these parentheses.

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,340
Okay so now we've set up our trace parameters.

147
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,910
We can then put that in here as well so.

148
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,460
Trace parameters.

149
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,990
Is there anything else.

150
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,100
No I think that's it.

151
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,380
So we don't need the extra whitespace on the bottom.

152
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,660
Wow.

153
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:18,380
That was quite a bit to go through but we've got everything set up now ready to report back and log

154
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,870
out what we're actually able to go out and reach or rather intersect with in our world.

155
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,300
Okay.

156
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,920
It's time for your challenge.

157
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,250
So what I'd like you to do is log the actor that is hit.

158
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:38,030
So get an actor star from hit perform and get name on this actor.

159
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,340
Now forget name I believe will return an F string and of course then you can log that to the console

160
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,720
and finally test that it works because shortly we'll actually be picking it up and this will confirm

161
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,690
that when we're intersecting with a particular object that will be able to be picked up and you might

162
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,650
want to protect yourself from a null pointer as well.

163
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:10,530
So you could say if the actor is hit then log out that will help protect you from having any normal

164
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,490
pointers come up.

165
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,250
Okay.

166
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:18,450
So Paul's video now and log the actor hit OK everybody welcome back.

167
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,320
Let's go back over into v s code.

168
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,650
OK.

169
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,860
So logging out to test that's fine.

170
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,840
Let's see what it hits first and then do the rest.

171
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,110
OK.

172
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:37,980
So if we go hit and hover over it we can see that it's not a pointer so we can use the dot operator.

173
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:45,140
And we've got a couple of options here one of which should be get actor excellent in our parentheses

174
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,550
and finish that off.

175
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,470
Now we're not doing anything with that yet but let's hover over and see what this is returning.

176
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,070
It's returning an actor star hit results.

177
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,940
Okay so that's good because that means we know what is what the type is that we're going to assign.

178
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:08,450
So a actor star remember that and we can call this the actor that was hit.

179
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,130
Now let's just call the actor hit.

180
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,930
Okay so now if we hit anything it should be stored as actor hit which is great.

181
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:24,710
And because this is in the tech component that will update every single frame if we are hitting an actor

182
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,100
that meets the criteria that we have set then it will be logged into the log.

183
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,510
Of course we do need to log it in a moment.

184
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,850
So to protect ourselves we are going to use an if statement.

185
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,680
So if actor hits then we're going to do something.

186
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,850
So we're going to do a a log.

187
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,450
It's going to be log temp as always.

188
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:54,890
Now I'm going to log this as an error just search a different color for once obviously later on we won't

189
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,200
be so flippant with the colors we're using.

190
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,870
I'm just fed up seeing a sea of yellow at the moment.

191
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,360
I'd like to see something red an error.

192
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,470
And what do we want to say.

193
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:11,070
Well this is going to be in our text macro and we're going to say that's our line trace has it percentage.

194
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,100
Yes.

195
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,790
That's good.

196
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:20,980
Now whatever is because it's an F string you log is going to have us the reference sets and then act

197
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,250
to hit an actor hits is a pointer.

198
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,130
So let's see what we can access with the arrow operator so we can get the world that it's in.

199
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,910
How about getting its name.

200
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,850
Does it have a name.

201
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,630
Let's bring this up a pen name.

202
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,160
We don't stick a name to it.

203
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,470
While there are quite a few here and there it is.

204
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,620
Get name and that returns.

205
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,480
These are parentheses that returns are f string which is exactly what we want.

206
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,540
So the line trace has hit and then it will give us the name.

207
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:50,840
Okay.

208
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:57,140
All being well let's go ahead and save our file and go back over it some real and compile it stop play

209
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,900
press compile.

210
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,210
Okay.

211
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,170
The compiles complete.

212
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,500
Let's go ahead and press play.

213
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,830
K cube hit.

214
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,320
Excellent.

215
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,890
Let's read as we expect cone.

216
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,830
So I think we're going to have to have this just a little bit longer.

217
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,780
I feel like we're having to get a bit too close to these objects to touch them.

218
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,760
Now that's just the viewpoint itself but all the size of these objects.

219
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,280
I mean that is quite a big box so perhaps it would fill a lot of your view up.

220
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,590
OK.

221
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,130
Brilliant.

222
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,990
So we've got our recasting our line trace or working.

223
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,630
How are you guys getting on.

224
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,280
Share your experiences over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
