00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.310
Hello everybody and welcome back in this lecture we're going to have a quick look around at the unreal

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.170
interface.

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.870
If you've used unreal before this to be a great refresher if you're new to the scene.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.130
Well let's get in straightaway and talk about the various windows we can see in front of us.

5
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.920
The biggest one right in front of us were the in-game terminal that we've created for you and the two

6
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.260
cows on the screen.

7
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.850
Well this is our main viewport This is the level that we'll be working in and we'll learn how to control

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.570
that in a bit and how to look around on the left hand side.

9
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.750
We've got a modes window this is great.

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.920
It's a load of actors 34 objects that we can drag on over into our scene which is really useful for

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.700
even setting up place holder assets or tweaking things like the lights etc. As you can see at the very

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.550
top we have a toolbar that's got some of the main functionality that we need.

13
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.890
And I will just point two buttons that I would like you to use often save current and compile.

14
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.720
Now I'd say that now and I'll say it again because there's no in the times where you save your code

15
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.180
when we go and start writing some code.

16
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.160
And because you've saved it in your head you may think oh we can hop on over into unreal click play

17
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.790
and it will work.

18
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.950
No remembers click that compile button over on the top right hand side we've got the world outline.

19
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.500
As the name suggests this is an outline of our entire world it's a hierarchy of everything in our level.

20
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.670
And then we've got this details area underneath if we were to go ahead and for instance click on one

21
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.600
of the items one of the objects in our world we get a more detailed breakdown of how the item or objects

22
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.760
is constructed at the very bottom here we've got the content browser.

23
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.010
And as that name suggests that's how you browse different content whether that be assets whether it

24
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.050
be scripts that have been written.

25
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.370
And once again this will be an area we look at him much more detail later on.

26
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.020
Now one of the great things about unreal is the interface is very very customizable.

27
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.390
I've got it set up as the default setting.

28
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.980
And if you ever make a mistake and you're struggling to get your windows back how they look right now

29
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.200
you can always go to the window menu and down at the bottom.

30
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.700
We have the option to reset the layout which is really great because what I'm about to get you to do

31
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.960
is move things around.

32
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.880
We've always got a get out of jail free card there by resetting the layout.

33
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.530
So what I mean by it's customizable.

34
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.260
Well it does depend on your particular setup.

35
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.300
So I'm trying to teach you guys here about on rails I'm going to have a certain way of setting up my

36
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.970
view.

37
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.030
However if you're working with multiple monitors you may want to move some of these windows to another

38
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.840
place.

39
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.710
How do we do that.

40
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.770
Well for instance this modes window at the top here I can click and drag and perhaps stack it next to

41
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.850
the world outline or I could put it underneath or stack it with the details that we go underneath and

42
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.200
it's just a matter of clicking it's moving it around.

43
00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.190
You can see now I grab the handle in between the main view ports and the content browser.

44
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.700
And I've given myself a lot more screen space now to work with at the expense of making the modes tab

45
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.020
harder to work with.

46
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.360
You can also have any of these windows floating which can also be incredibly useful if that's the type

47
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.160
of workflow you like.

48
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.420
Now say you had done that and you click the cross to get rid of it and you're gone.

49
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.210
Oh no.

50
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.380
How do I get that back.

51
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.650
Well over time you'll learn what each of these areas are called.

52
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.250
And under the window menu we've got the option of bringing back in the modes window.

53
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.260
We go ahead and do that.

54
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.390
We've got it back here.

55
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.370
Then we can drag it into certain places.

56
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.440
You can see that we've got various options of how to snap things in place.

57
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.480
And a reminder once again if you want to go back to their default layouts you can go to window reset

58
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.460
layouts.

59
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.720
Now when you do this is going to warn you that it's going to require the unreal editor to restarts.

60
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.360
So you can go ahead and click on.

61
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.320
Okay.

62
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.160
It will say it would prompt you to save it if it needs if any changes have happened and then it will

63
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.340
just load the unreal project back up.

64
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.900
Now I've had enough of this reflection captures needs rebuilt so I'm going to go ahead and just click

65
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.870
on the build button there and allow that to run through.

66
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.370
Now in this particular case it has give us a warning we won't deal with that warning just at the moment.

67
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.790
We will shut that down.

68
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.200
But we've gotten rid of the error at the top there and I will save my level by taking safe current and

69
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.520
now it's time for you to practice with in the edit to now with our challenge.

70
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.850
So the challenge is quite forward I'd like you to get comfortable with real so Doc and undocked some

71
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.730
windows practice reorganizing the layouts and if you do have dual screen why don't you practice having

72
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.540
some of your items on another screen.

73
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.110
That would be a great way of testing how you might set it up in the future.

74
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.480
Now there are gonna be times when you want certain layouts and being able to adjust them to your needs

75
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.190
is incredibly important.

76
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.420
Some people just like sticking with the default and they will be doing that throughout the course in

77
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.300
the majority of cases maybe resizing windows.

78
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.480
But in general I keep the major components on the screen and do remember you can reset the layouts under

79
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.000
the window reset layouts option now I am happy with my current layouts as I am sticking with the default

80
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.780
one but what I'd like to do is pulls a video play with the layout and also go over to the forum and

81
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.940
let us know your particular setup.

82
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.660
Have you got one two or even three monitors.

83
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.550
Can you think of different ways that you might want unreal to be set up.

84
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.030
Share your discoveries over on the forum and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
