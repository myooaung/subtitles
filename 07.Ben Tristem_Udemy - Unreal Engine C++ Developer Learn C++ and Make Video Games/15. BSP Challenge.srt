1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,900
Okay everybody Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,400
So we're on to our challenge here where you get to create your Test level.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,980
So the challenge is going to be to create your room.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,900
I'm going to recommend using the BSP to do that.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,020
And here are some specifications for you.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,020
The walls must be three meters high.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,610
Remember to organize your scene.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,710
We've started making a fold I'd like you to continue making a folder and remember to name things as

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,690
you go later on.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:36,750
Even though this is simple it's the time to solidify that if you leave it until later on when you've

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,760
got several objects in your scene.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,380
It's going to be a real pain to try and work out what is what they might use to create a doorway that's

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,810
2 meters in height and one meter in width.

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,720
And you're going to place your door in that hole.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,510
Now I'd like to be specific here as to what end of the room you should push your door.

16
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,800
Let's go over it and turn real.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,650
Before I give you the challenge and this will help solve a potential issue you may have later on okay.

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,610
So let's just make the 3D Ed view just a bit better.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:08,850
Okay.

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:16,270
So in this viewport if you click on your door right now and scroll up and your details tab to the transform

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,620
option take note of the rotation.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,820
If it's not 0 0 and 0 looks like that might be zero point something like We get zero then make sure

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,250
it is because later on we will be rotating the door.

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,370
And if it's at 90 degrees already.

25
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,240
Initially when we start working with the code we'll be rotating it to 90 degrees.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:49,270
So make sure that if you have a look at the axes that your door is in line with the x axis the red one

27
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,020
and perpendicular to the green axis.

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,320
And that would mean that basically anywhere along that y axis providing it's there you'll be absolutely

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,090
fine.

30
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,260
I would recommend as well when you create your hole for the doorway that you do it in such a way that

31
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,220
it's easy to make that hole.

32
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,950
So make sure you use something like the grid to align everything in its place.

33
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,990
Okay.

34
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,590
Polls over the year now make your level as simple or complex as you'd like.

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,180
If you're having lots of fun perhaps make another room to move into.

36
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm not going to do that at this point but later on when I start putting my level together rather than

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,540
just the test level I will start thinking about other rooms that we're going to move into.

38
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,400
For the moment I'm just going to go for the one room I'm going to open the door and go out into the

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,740
void and remember just like we were talking about in the last lecture.

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,230
You don't have to make it as one wall you can make it as modular pieces that you stack together.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,120
It's entirely up to you how you approach it.

42
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,250
So go ahead pause a video and give that a go

43
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,090
OK.

44
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,090
Everybody welcome back.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,640
Let's go ahead now and create my test level or should I say test room.

46
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,390
OK.

47
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,460
So I'm pretty much set with this wall piece here and there are a couple of ways that I could do this

48
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,680
I could go ahead grab this hole down out a move it's cross boom we've got the other wall very quickly

49
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,090
and then I could do the same again hold down ALT drag it to roughly the middle.

50
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,740
Pull it out this way I didn't have to do it in this order and then I'm going to rotate thrown by 90

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:31,330
degrees and if I've got my rough lining up Oh no I was so close look at that I'm out by a couple and

52
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:37,180
I wouldn't I would have that as well if I was in this view so this is the the benefits of using these

53
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:44,560
views is we can snap things together incredibly quickly now if we have a look at all not geometry here

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,310
it is intersecting we do have to be careful when things intersect especially if faces are on top of

55
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:57,190
one another this is absolutely fine for the type of work we're doing it really isn't worth the effort

56
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:04,090
of going into geometry editing selecting this face here let's make sure we've got the face selected

57
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,950
have a press.

58
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,210
There we go and just pulling it back and then go oh no that doesn't fit it properly needs to be ten

59
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,320
and then dragging it back there we go.

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,050
No no no no don't waste your time doing that just leave it as it is remember this is a test level and

61
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,320
even though it's lots of fun and I know the perfectionist in you is going to try and get things lined

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,690
up absolutely perfect do remember that this is in fact a test level to take it to a good degree of perfection

63
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,440
but not all the way there.

64
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,820
In fact I am going to do a bit of editing here and bring down the heights because I was not paying attention

65
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,930
when I duplicated this I've duplicated it and it's 400 in height Whoops.

66
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,650
So I'm going to come in here and said That's a 300 and I'm going to have to move things around a little

67
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,140
in a moment but that's that's no big deal there's only a couple two moves so hit this one here this

68
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:06,580
one and this one over here finally now one of the things with the lining everything to 100 meters or

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,300
50 hundred meters centimeters is that things aren't quite lining up here properly and I don't know whether

70
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,890
that's because my floor is funny I've just accepted its default position but it may be at a funny location.

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,580
Yes is it z equals 20 something the set is z equals zero.

72
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,280
That should allow me to set the location here

73
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,930
what does it need to be 150 by the looks of it.

74
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,340
So let's grab this one and type in 150.

75
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:36,830
Excellent.

76
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,670
I should be able to grab the other one as well.

77
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,110
Okay.

78
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,270
Brilliant.

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,750
So those are the four walls all sorted.

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,510
Now I could have them as static meshes.

81
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,220
I want to leave them editable for the moment.

82
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,270
Obviously this is quite a big room.

83
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:57,650
You'll often find that rooms especially in first person view are indeed bigger than they would be in

84
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,810
real life because otherwise it feels incredibly cramped like you can't move.

85
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,190
In fact this door is a real life door and it looks quite small.

86
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,950
It's not its is bigger than a lot of doors.

87
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,010
It's a metre wide and two meters tall.

88
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,600
I know the doors in my house are a lot less white than that but that doesn't look like I can fit through

89
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,250
it so it's just an illusion of the way that the first person camera works in games.

90
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,710
But I'm happy with how that is for the moment and this door.

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
I'm going to bring down to zero as well.

92
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,830
Excellent.

93
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,030
And then we've got our wall.

94
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,500
Now the question is Where am I going to place my dog could have it on an edge here.

95
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,110
Absolutely fine I could have it smack bang in the middle.

96
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,270
I'm going to choose smack bang in the middle and then we're going to have another wool piece going across.

97
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,370
Now there are a couple of ways that I could do this.

98
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:53,090
I've obviously elected at this point to make solid wall pieces like this rather than smaller modular

99
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,870
pieces.

100
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,610
That's absolutely fine if you've gone the other way.

101
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,030
Again no problem at all.

102
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,440
So that's moved across.

103
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,940
That looks really good.

104
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,200
But from the door doesn't go through yet.

105
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,730
So we need to make a door hole that is two meters high and one metre wide and we'll see we will have

106
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,330
some Z fights in because that is the exact size of the door.

107
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,340
So we might actually have to alter it to compete with that Z fighting that we will have.

108
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,890
So let's drag in a new box.

109
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,260
It should be a subtracting box.

110
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,080
So let's change it to 1.

111
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,880
And this is where we can set our settings appropriately so in the x direction we can see that's the

112
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,730
width here.

113
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,380
I'm going to set that to 100 for the moment and the depth.

114
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:45,490
Well that doesn't really matter at this point in time with where it is we can see our door needs repositioning

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,710
that's absolutely fine so that scrap the door and the door frame is almost worth putting them in their

116
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,660
own folder.

117
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,950
But anyway let's move into the wall ever so slightly so we can pop it there haha.

118
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,160
Here we go here's some Z fighting straight away.

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Is there any at the top.

120
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:09,020
Yes there's some at the top and the side so I'm going to combat that straight away and we'll go to this

121
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,770
box brush.

122
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm gonna bring it up I'm going to call it.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,460
Cuts out.

124
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,560
That's essentially what it is.

125
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,730
And if we do anything here to make it higher and wider wider I'm gonna do higher.

126
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,610
I'm not because if I just make it bigger it's going to eat into the floor at the same time.

127
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,780
Actually it probably doesn't matter with how we've got things set up.

128
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,660
But I'd rather just extend it manually at the top in this particular case because the floor is not a

129
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,750
BSP but it could be in a game you're creating in the future.

130
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:52,290
So the X value here if I said that instead of 2 100 maybe 120 it then can expose all.

131
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,410
Yeah that's fine we can see here on the doorframe that there is enough space in fact it's about halfway

132
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,960
through.

133
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,400
That's really good.

134
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,880
And then I'm gonna go and edit geometry I think we can see that there is a shortcut shift and the numbers

135
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,880
so we can move backwards and forwards if we need to one two three four five perfect.

136
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,360
Now I can't see that at the moment so I'm gonna select it so I can click the top here and I'm going

137
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,170
to pull it up just by one unit which in this case will be 10 because of the snapping.

138
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,070
Okay.

139
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,020
And I think that will be absolutely fine.

140
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,010
The final thing here is more of an alignment.

141
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,150
And again I am being quite picky here.

142
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,890
I'm going to have to drop this down to five so it fits in between if I picked a different wall size

143
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,070
that should have been fine.

144
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,380
Is it coming out here.

145
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,070
Oh no that is exactly 20.

146
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,480
Mm hmm interesting.

147
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,710
So perhaps I need to make my doorway bigger in future yeah.

148
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,090
Okay.

149
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,870
I'm just gonna pull this out here and worry about the rest later because this wall is gonna have to

150
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,730
be slightly thinner.

151
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,270
In fact I am gonna make it slightly thinner.

152
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,920
What's it sets out at the moment 20.

153
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,130
Well let's make this one just 10 wide OK.

154
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,990
Now let's move our door back in to that.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,150
So hopefully now that's even on both sides.

156
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,020
OK brilliant.

157
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,990
OK a bit of hacking there but that's absolutely fine.

158
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,020
The other question here is do we want a roof on our building.

159
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,430
I think yes.

160
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,420
Now you may not have put a roof on yours I appreciate that it wasn't actually part of the challenge.

161
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,700
It's just a couple of ways that we can do that.

162
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:38,100
We can grab the floor which is a static mesh actor that we've already created or we could just create

163
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,270
one a new one to fit this.

164
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,060
I'm going to go ahead and just practice the skills that we've learnt by dragging a new one in I'm not

165
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,460
going to give it any materials at the moment either.

166
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:56,640
That's deliberate and I'm going to set the size to 1000 1000 and the thickness not 200.

167
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:05,110
I'm just going to set it is 20 like everything else then I'm going to set its position to 0 0 and then

168
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:13,830
I think if we set it to 300 it'll mean the room is ever so slightly shorter than what we thought it

169
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,370
would be 3 meters because it would come down maybe 10.

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,980
But that is pretty good.

171
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,430
OK let's go ahead.

172
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,260
Save my level because I've been doing a lot of work there.

173
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,670
I'm going to click on build to make sure that all the lighting is built.

174
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,100
And of course we get our standard map lighting needs rebuilding.

175
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,880
Yep fine.

176
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,840
The geometry is now rebuilt the lighting is rebuilt and it should be pretty dark in here.

177
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,090
Now you will end up with a couple of issues when it comes to the corner here.

178
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:51,330
You can see that we've got almost looks like likely then we stare at it long enough the exposure settings

179
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:58,020
within here slowly bring it out is to try and give the fake illusion of eyes adjusting.

180
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,920
Now that's quite interesting you see because it does happen there and it doesn't happen in these corners.

181
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,600
It does happen slightly right down there.

182
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,300
Do you see that little bit appearing that I've just go straight through anyway.

183
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,370
So perhaps we can muck around with our geometry and make a line a little bit better.

184
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:22,440
But for the moment that's pretty well I want to say watertight but light tight now we can of course

185
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,790
add lights in and we'll be talking all about that in the next lecture.
