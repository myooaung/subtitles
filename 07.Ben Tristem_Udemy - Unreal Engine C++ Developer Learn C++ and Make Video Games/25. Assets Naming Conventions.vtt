Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.610
In this lecture I'd like to first of all show you about some other asset naming conventions it dawned

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.840
upon me after changing our static meshes to actually having the S M prefix on them that we hadn't touched

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.860
on materials or textures so we should probably do that at the same time.

5
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.890
Now I'm currently looking at the wacky Unreal engine and you can see here it's temporary disabled they

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.610
are working on a new wicked brilliant.

7
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.300
But for the moment this link up here it will be over in your lecture resources as well.

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.490
It will give us an idea of what we need to do now.

9
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290
These are guidelines.

10
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.230
You don't have to stick to them but doing so means that your work is going to be more compatible with

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.670
other peoples and especially as a beginner.

12
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.400
It helps you solidify naming conventions later on of course you can change how you name things according

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.490
to your own workflow.

14
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.980
So one of the biggest things here is we start scroll down asset names.

15
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.780
Here we go prefix asset name its number and these suffix that it has.

16
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.970
And here we come to the first part of it.

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.320
So prefixes they are optional because of filters in the content browser so we look at some real and

18
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.640
look at the content browser.

19
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.190
Let's go into our materials and textures.

20
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.510
We can really see what things are but we can go to our filters as well and come into materials and textures

21
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.070
and only look at material instances.

22
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.990
If we wanted to we can actually go in and also add additional filters that we want to talk it targets

23
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.640
toggle on and off.

24
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.160
So we go back to our materials and textures and turn on texture as well.

25
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.310
We can talk all these on and off in order to filter our view.

26
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.930
That's why they're optional.

27
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.510
I will go through these and challenge you as well to make sure that things are named appropriately anyway.

28
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.190
Then further down we've got different types.

29
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.980
Here we go and once again this is entirely up to you Will you follow this as naming scheme.

30
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.640
But it does help you work out and organize your structure which is incredibly useful T for textures

31
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.180
you could have an image in there that isn't actually a texture.

32
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.610
It might be something else.

33
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.580
Actually labelling texture is incredibly useful.

34
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.270
You may find sprites for instance this is a good example or a sprite sheet.

35
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.240
They also would be a texture.

36
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.910
Technically they will be an image.

37
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.170
However differentiating them is going to be incredibly useful suffixes for the type of texture.

38
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.550
All we've got at the moment is what's known as the base colour.

39
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.190
So when we have a look back over here we've got this door.

40
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.140
Well in order to name it appropriately we put the T in front of it and at the end we'll call it the

41
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.680
base colour and there we go.

42
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.390
That's now got the appropriate name on its materials so this brass material here would have an m an

43
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.680
underscore and then let's say the door frame and material which is a material instance in this particular

44
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:20.910
case would be m I underscored Daw underscore frame underscore material or we could just leave it as

45
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.780
a door frame for instance it wouldn't necessarily have to have door material if it doesn't make much

46
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.860
sense to call it a material when it's implied because it is a material to begin with.

47
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:45.030
Now I've seen plenty of projects that have had materials and material instances both be called materials

48
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.890
because essentially that's what they are.

49
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.940
But there is a differentiation between having your materials and your material instances you start playing

50
00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.310
around with materials you know that you're likely to be affecting more than one thing in your scene.

51
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.610
The same with textures.

52
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.620
I mean this texture here is base colour for our door is being used on the ceiling as well.

53
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.170
So actually doors not a great name for it.

54
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.910
I'm gonna leave it like that at the moment I'm just I don't want a name rename things for naming sake

55
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.750
and in fact the name I gave the material that I first used it on is probably a better name.

56
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.280
This metal would say I'm going to call it that.

57
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.590
Now the other thing to bear in mind here and much like every renaming that I have done so far is it's

58
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.350
worth bearing in mind that this is taking it further and further from whatever the source materials

59
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.030
name actually was.

60
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.790
So at this point unless it's visually distinct enough that I can recognise sets I've got no hope in

61
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.110
finding the source material for this anymore.

62
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.690
Okay.

63
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.450
So what I'd like kids to do as a challenge for this lecture is just go through your materials sort out

64
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.790
their naming as if they were a material.

65
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.980
Call them M underscore material the material instance am I before them the.

66
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.360
And we've only got one of a base colour I think to sort out and that can go in there as well and take

67
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.430
a good look at this list.

68
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.070
It's not going to be used in anger at the moment it's something you can build up upon and start to use

69
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.820
as you develop your skills in Unreal.

70
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.580
One of the things about naming is it just means that you can find things much more easily than you would

71
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.580
otherwise.

72
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.290
Now these suffixes here with the textures they are important because otherwise you're just going to

73
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.350
have all of your textures dumped in together you can search for displacement textures or normal textures

74
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.300
if you've got these on the end.

75
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.020
If you don't have these everything's just going to come up in one big lump.

76
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:55.010
Okay suppose video now and go through and rename your textures and materials Okay everybody Welcome

77
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.250
back.

78
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.490
Let's go over into unreal and just finish off of our naming.

79
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.800
So we've got a material instance here that is our ceiling.

80
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.510
Now fortunately it won't allow you to put spaces in.

81
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.410
And then we've got our stone material just here.

82
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.880
Now I'm just going to leave a stone slab something like that.

83
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.610
So is a material on material instance I can tell it because of the color.

84
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.710
I'm going to call that block work for the moment and of course feel free to rename things and change

85
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.450
things out as you go stone floor.

86
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.290
Well that's just a material instance.

87
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.020
It just needs the M.R.I. prefix.

88
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.550
Here we go.

89
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.430
Are stone here.

90
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.570
So we've got a texture which we can filter by any way.

91
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.420
And then it is a base color.

92
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.630
Okay.

93
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.240
Anything else to rename in here.

94
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.110
Our wall.

95
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.020
I'm going to leave that just as I am I would have I named everything here.

96
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.740
Looks good to me let's go.

97
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.540
Upper level models ascend doors and doorframe.

98
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.050
Okay so everything's looking as it should do.

99
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.990
So how are you guys getting on with this now.

100
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:10.980
I know at this moment in time it feels more like busy work than useful but being able to solidify the

101
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.140
skill of making sure your naming things appropriately from the beginning and slap on the wrist.

102
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.220
I totally forgot this as I was playing with the materials earlier.

103
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.910
So it's been sat there for a while and then I looked at it and realized I know we we had done these

104
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.960
models here.

105
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.650
We haven't even touched the rest of the materials.

106
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.840
Now this is just the starting point for you.

107
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.760
It's just really useful getting into the habit of doing nice and early so that's it for this lecture

108
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.830
and I'll see you all in the next one.
