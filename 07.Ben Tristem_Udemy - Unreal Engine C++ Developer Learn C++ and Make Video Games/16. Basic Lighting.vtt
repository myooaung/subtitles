00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.210
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.220
So we're going to have a look at basic lighting we can't see anything in our room at the moment.

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.580
Now I've put a roof on.

4
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.910
If you were clever enough not to put a roof on yet you'll still be able to see your room obviously.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.630
So what do we need to do in terms of lighting.

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.060
Well the first thing I'm going to do is notice that I didn't name my roof roof.

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.510
I do apologize for doing that slap me on the wrists and pull up parts of the building as well.

8
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.410
So we've got all four walls.

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.750
Okay.

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.020
So all of that is in the right place.

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.460
Okay.

12
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.710
Lighting.

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.670
So once again we're going to play something in our scene.

14
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.220
We're going to go to lights and we can see here we've got a selection of five different light types

15
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.870
we've got a directional light appoint spot rect and sky.

16
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.890
Now any points of course if you're curious you can go ahead and click on the little icon.

17
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.800
They'll take you to the documentation directional light and skylights are already set up in our scene

18
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.060
we will manipulate the directional light in the moment because I want a shadow from this door on our

19
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.880
floor and we're not going to get that if the sun is facing in a different direction.

20
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.840
Okay.

21
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.010
Spotlight and Point Light.

22
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.890
Well let's drag one into this corner and drag another over here and we see that they're very similar

23
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.850
in terms of how much lights they produce only the fact that the spotlight is cut down and facing the

24
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.050
floor.

25
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.600
Now that is really useful to know because this is going to be great for Ford and being able to focus

26
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.370
on things.

27
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.850
This is gonna be great for general lighting.

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.290
You might not like the color that's already there and you'll never guess what.

29
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.230
Yes.

30
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.530
Over in the details tab you can change that.

31
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.590
So we go and scroll down we start off with our intensity basically how bright it is.

32
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.870
So you can add subtle lighting to a scene.

33
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.880
In fact you could probably animate this and make a blinking lights.

34
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.790
How about that spooky scene.

35
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.550
Excellent.

36
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.370
I'm going to set that to let's say 20 for the moment.

37
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.360
It's a slightly brighter than this light over here.

38
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.570
This point light source and attenuation radius.

39
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.130
So how much does this affect.

40
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.020
I'll see now the reason why it does this.

41
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.670
Because you're probably thinking to yourself Well hang on a minute lights does attenuate but that's

42
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.900
just because it spreads out and gets less and less as it gets further and further away.

43
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.590
Well with the game engine you don't necessarily want lights interfering outside of a certain radius.

44
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.680
We've already seen that lights can leak through corners.

45
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.530
Well if you've just got a huge attenuation radius you can end up with a light in one part of your scene

46
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.540
affecting the lighting in another.

47
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.440
So being able to control how far that light can reach is pretty awesome.

48
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.000
We've got an inner cone angle and outer cone angle that you can play with to get a tighter or looser

49
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
spot and you can play with all of these settings and see what you come up with.

50
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.870
I've skipped over light color.

51
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.350
Here we go.

52
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.050
So we can end up with a purple light.

53
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.480
We go ahead and click Okay.

54
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.170
OK.

55
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.530
That might be pink rather than purple.

56
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.650
I was aiming for purple and missed horribly.

57
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.700
There we go.

58
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.150
There's our purple and that's more like a blue.

59
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.880
OK.

60
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.100
You can argue about what color Eva is later on but you can see here we can adjust and you will find

61
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.220
that some colors are naturally darker even though they're the same brightness or intensity as others.

62
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.900
And a nice warm lamp here would be somewhere around this area I should imagine.

63
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.290
That's correct.

64
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.490
Okay yes.

65
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.280
That's a nice warm color.

66
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.940
And of course now we've got some lighting in our room so clicking the build button is essential.

67
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.920
Lighting needs to be rebuilt.

68
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.280
And this is baking our lighting into our scene.

69
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.660
It's incredibly useful for that to happen.

70
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.010
The scene will look different afterwards as well.

71
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.270
And when we press play we'll be able to walk around our scene and look we can actually see in that area

72
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.140
there is incredibly bright.

73
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.150
Now one of the things to bear in mind of course is even though that's incredibly bright it's not coming

74
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.330
from anywhere.

75
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.700
So this is a great example where you might want to go ahead and we've got a spotlight here does seem

76
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.560
to be coming out of nowhere but it's potentially something you could put closer to the wall to make

77
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.000
it look like it's a down light could do that.

78
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.380
And then of course you can go ahead grab all account a cylinder.

79
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.630
Yet we can grab a cylinder that's going to be absolutely massive and it's taken a big chunk.

80
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.440
Here we go.

81
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.840
But now I can go down to my settings here.

82
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:46.150
It's not gonna be two meters that's set it maybe 30 centimetres in height outer radius of maybe a radius

83
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.110
of 10 that'll make it 20.

84
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.990
And then we can just drag that towards where the lamp would be and again lining things up.

85
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.960
If you're struggling you can go to another view.

86
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.740
But if we put these next to one another we've basically produced ourselves a war lamp pretty awesome

87
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.680
Hey doing that now when we go ahead I'm going to have the press build again.

88
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.860
The reason for that is whenever you put another object into your scene when it comes to lighting you're

89
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.810
going to have to rebuild your lighting.

90
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.380
Now what does he have.

91
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.050
Don't just do it every single time unless you need to see the effects.

92
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.820
But here we go.

93
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.960
We can now see that that's off center.

94
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.390
I need to move it again.

95
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.280
Okay.

96
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.780
Pay attention stencils thing that's not necessarily something that's.

97
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.580
These views are always going to help you out with.

98
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:43.460
But we could certainly zoomed in here and seen our lights and our torch itself or this little block

99
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.860
that we've created to emulate it weren't quite aligned with one another.

100
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.960
So we can line them we can build on lighting back again.

101
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.230
Going to make that full screen going to take a while to do a calm play whilst it's doing this.

102
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.220
Now you will find that building your lighting or streaming of textures and other things like that can

103
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.250
be a real bugbear when it comes to unreal to be careful.

104
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.390
And we can see here probably still need a bit more tweaking.

105
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.260
I might even put a cone coming out so it looks more like a lamp itself.

106
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:19.370
So but anyway our rooms now let's up and my small challenge to you is to go ahead and add some lighting

107
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.470
to your scene perhaps even add in a few lamps made out of just BSP is just as place holders.

108
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.710
Now of course we don't want to leave it it's just a cylinder brush.

109
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:36.590
We want to make sure to pull that douses roughly in the right place and going to build as well but I'm

110
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.490
going to call this a lamp.

111
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:44.660
The great thing of course is if we put them into one space we can then duplicate things together.

112
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.280
So let's go ahead.

113
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:55.500
I'm going to make a new folder within my building and I'm going to call it lighting.

114
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:03.020
I've nested the wrong thing incisors move building back up and lighting into building and then move

115
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.380
my cylinder brush into lighting and call it down might

116
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.000
and then I've got my point light source as well.

117
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.480
And indeed.

118
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.890
OK cool that down lights I am going to cool that down light rather than lighting.

119
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.120
So I'm going to click on that.

120
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:29.640
There we go down lights and I'm going to call this I've tracked the wrong lights.

121
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.360
Here we got go spotlights here.

122
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.500
This is gonna be all down lights.

123
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.850
Bring this up.

124
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.610
We can see some type spotlights spring in there.

125
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.190
The point light is just parts of the building at the moment.

126
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:50.090
It's not signed to anything but there we go we've got our down lights in here over here in the corner.

127
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:55.910
We can select both of them and we can make a duplicate because we've got things aligned as they need

128
00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:01.180
to be now so I can duplicate that and I'm gonna pop it all the way over here.

129
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.400
It's gonna bring it's out only has to be rough.

130
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.730
There we go.

131
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.170
So the sensors definitely out and over the scene.

132
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.790
Yep we can see that I'm going to build my lighting press play and make sure that works.

133
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:19.490
So this is a good example of making sure when you put things together they're named correctly and that

134
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.730
does mean that you're able to very easily copy things then building it quickly and checking we can see

135
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.480
here that it's not out of the wall far enough.

136
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.320
I didn't bring it out far enough.

137
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.600
That's annoying but it's just something we have to go through and sort out.

138
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.630
Remember you can go ahead hold down shift and select them both in the outline.

139
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.050
And then I can drag that forward.

140
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.740
That looks a bit more like it.

141
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.390
Going to click Build and just see what it looks like.

142
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.150
Get rid of that.

143
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.500
Yes.

144
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.100
That looks much better.

145
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.200
Now of course this is just place holders don't get too hung up on them.

146
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.200
Excellent.

147
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.940
Really looking forward to see how you've decided to light your room.

148
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.280
Have you gone all psychedelic have you gone a bit more neutral.

149
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:08.100
Did you add any actual actual lamps as well to share screenshots of how you've set up your lighting

150
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.440
in your scene over in the discussions.

151
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.430
Looking forward to seeing it and I'll see you all in the next lecture.

152
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:14.850
Take care.
