1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,000
In this lecture, we're gonna be adding a little bit of Polish with some background music.

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,230
And a little bit of an introduction text and a little bit of an introduction sound as well.

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,320
And we're going to look at a list of things that you could improve and build upon in this shooter project

4
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,840
as mega challenges for yourself.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,560
Let's dive in.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,130
So it is nearly time to wrap up.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,840
And for me to say good bye.

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,820
But before we do, I would like to leave you with a few challenges to expand upon this project.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,370
These are my mega challenges, distinguished in the fact that I won't be showing you all of the solutions

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:42,760
for that.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,650
You're going to have to rely on the community and talk to each other and help each other out and really

12
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,730
explore the engine.

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,150
Hopefully this will help you really get to grips with unreal.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:58,270
So the first mega challenge is going to be level layout and I am going to do some of that in this lecture.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,890
So basically, I mean, lay out your level, put your enemies where you want them to be.

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,590
Make it really a challenge.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,140
Try and play.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,530
Test.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,400
Try and play.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,240
Get your family and friends to play the level and try it out.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,210
The next one is background music.

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,170
I do have some background music assets in there.

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,840
And again, in this lecture, I'm going to show you how you could add those in.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,700
So if you want a challenge for this lecture, you compose a video and have a go right now.

25
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,270
Okay.

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,900
Welcome back.

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,120
So I'm going to go in and do these challenges just a bit.

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,080
But in case these were not the ones that you want to tackle and you want to try some other things here,

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,510
the rest of my challenges for you.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,510
One of them is to implement weapon switching.

31
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,040
At the moment, we've got quite a flexible weapon architecture that would support weapon switching.

32
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,930
But at the moment, it does not.

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,500
So I'm going to give you some pointers on how you might want to go ahead and implement that.

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,200
But I'm not going to go through the entirety of the process with you.

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,900
The other one is implementing ammo with the weapon.

36
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,400
Again, I'm going to give you some pointers on the process here, but not the actual code.

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,800
Then some more advanced A.I. What do I mean by this?

38
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,320
Well, if you're introducing ammo and weapons switching, maybe your A.I. needs to know when to use

39
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,670
each one of these.

40
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,450
So you might need to add in some behaviors for switching weapons and so on.

41
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,130
You might also want to have an I have an idea of whether it's under fire, whether it's being shot at.

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,000
In which case it might want to try and take cover so you can have some more advanced behaviors like

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,300
that.

44
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,800
All of that can be implemented with behavior, trees and services and custom tasks.

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,910
You might want a main menu in order to select between multiple levels and yes, multiple levels.

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,040
Add in some other layouts of level.

47
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,010
Put your A.I. differently, make it more challenging how a progression and have it so that you move

48
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,300
from one level to the next.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,920
When you succeed.

50
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,690
Now, I'm going to go through the details of weapon switching and ammo in just a second.

51
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,000
But first, we're going to do at level layout.

52
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,800
First thing I want to do is move.

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,980
My player starts to more of a neutral location.

54
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,410
I go delete the main player, start we've got and I'm going to take the player, start over here instead.

55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,680
So I'm can look for place actors pain and I'm going to look for the player, start and stick it in here.

56
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,050
And that should mean when we hit play that we end up in this corridor.

57
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,640
That's good.

58
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,840
Next up, what I want to do is add in some enemies.

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,760
I'm going to put one enemy in here.

60
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,440
So BP shoot a character in here.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,360
There's one enemy then.

62
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,090
We've got already an enemy over here.

63
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,790
I like that.

64
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,950
I'm going to add a couple of enemies, one over here and one down here.

65
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,100
So you have to kind of go out of your way to find them and they're going to try and shoot at you and

66
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,660
come and find you as soon as possible.

67
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,180
Then we've got one enemy over there.

68
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,870
That's good.

69
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,680
I might stick.

70
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,150
And just sticking enemies everywhere.

71
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,550
One round this corner, one up here.

72
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,420
That's great.

73
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,880
Another one maybe here.

74
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:52,430
Maybe a couple down here to shoot you as well as maybe one up at the top of the stairs here.

75
00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:01,330
To just shoot down from rain, bloody fire from up there, and then we're going to stick a quite a few

76
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:09,080
in this command center type room, one few to ambush you round the corner here and maybe one or two.

77
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,590
Down in this little pit that we go out.

78
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,250
Now, this room is gonna be a real challenge when you come in here.

79
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,020
Just gonna be shot to pieces.

80
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,950
So if we go ahead and play, we're going to go and try this out.

81
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,810
It's going to be pretty tough at the moment.

82
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,160
And you may want to tweak it much further than just gonna mute here.

83
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,340
You want to tweak it further and tweak the amount of health you have, maybe to make it the right level

84
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,090
of challenge.

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,880
Or maybe you wants to tweak how many A.I. there are in the level, all that sort of thing.

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,200
You can try by playing through and just starting this game to bits.

87
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,430
And then one final thing I want to do is add some background music and some ambience.

88
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,760
So if you look for sound in the place, actors, you can see there's an ambient sound actor.

89
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,190
We can drag this into the world.

90
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,550
It doesn't really matter where because it's going to play some sound everywhere.

91
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,620
And then what we want to do is select a sound from here, which I'm going to look for music.

92
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,860
And we basically want the shooter game music here.

93
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,950
And you can pretty much just leave that as it is.

94
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,530
And if we go and hit play, you can see that we've got background music going on, giving us a lot nicer

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,370
ambience here.

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,390
And then one more thing I want to do is just add a little bit of an intro text, which I'm going to

97
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,520
do from our player shooter character.

98
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,580
And I'm going to open up in the blueprint here.

99
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,080
Open up the full blueprint, Ed, and I'm going to go to the event graph and off of the begin play note.

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,220
We're going to add a play sound at location, the location.

101
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,650
I want to be the actor location.

102
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:47,410
So and then the sound asset that we want is going to be I believe I've got something called intro,

103
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,180
which is something that I recorded myself just to say, yeah, let's go and kill these guys in the level

104
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,860
or something to that effect.

105
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,860
So now if we go ahead and hit play, we get a little bit of that introduction telling the player what

106
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,670
to do, that they need to go and clear this base of all of the enemies.

107
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,930
Now, as promised, what we're going to do with things like weapons switching and ammo.

108
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,310
Well, weapons switching roughly the flow is going to look like this.

109
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,730
That's where you're going to add an array of weapons or weapon classes to the character so that it knows

110
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,400
which weapons it can use spawn.

111
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,190
All of those weapons into yet another array.

112
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,310
So that you can keep track of the different weapons that character has.

113
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,030
So basically going from using a single weapon class in a single weapon instance to having an array for

114
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,850
both of them, then you want to have something like an active index integer that keeps track of which

115
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,180
weapon is currently the active one you're going to hide.

116
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,730
All of the weapons basically deactivate and hide all of the weapons except for the one eye and the active

117
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,150
index.

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,030
And then you might want to bind the scroll wheel or the numbers so that that changes up your active

119
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,540
index.

120
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,250
And you can update once you do that, once you change the active index, you want to make sure you're

121
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,430
updating the weapon that is currently visible.

122
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:10,000
And you also need to make sure that you bind the fire so that it selects, which have a weapon is currently

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,920
active, so that it uses the fire method, the trigger method of your currently active weapons.

124
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,510
That's weapon switching a brief kind of outline of how you would implement that and how you'd go about

125
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,110
trying that.

126
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,710
The other one is ammo, which is also fairly straightforward.

127
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,800
If you follow along with these steps, you're going to need some sort of ammo variable on your weapon.

128
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,320
There's an integer saying, how much ammo do you have left?

129
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,310
You're going to subtract from that every shot until you get down to zero.

130
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,670
Very much like health, really.

131
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,780
If you think about it, you're going to prevent from shooting.

132
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,770
That won't be possible to shoot if you're amigos.

133
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,270
Less than zero play some sort of empty sound to give a signal to the player.

134
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,740
And you might want to create some sort of pick up act as a create a new actor.

135
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:58,660
Something derives from actor at a collider, at a match to it, so that when you overlap with it, when

136
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,990
an actor, a character overlaps with it, you're going to get hold of the currently active weapon on

137
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,440
that character and you're gonna add your ammo to it.

138
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,230
And finally, you probably want to disable collisions and hide the mesh, at least for a short amount

139
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,590
of time.

140
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,450
You might want to re-enable it on a timer, but you want to disable it at first, once you've gone over

141
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,730
that pick up so that you aren't continually refueling your ammo while you stand on it.

142
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,870
So that's it for this lecture.

143
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,500
I'll leave you with the challenge slide of things that you can do to expand on what's already there.

144
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:38,170
Do check out the Q and A. and the discussions and at Dischord Channel for input, feedback and other

145
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:44,230
people who are sharing what they have done to continue their journey with this shooter game.

146
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,090
Can't wait to see what you make with it.

147
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,640
I will see you in the discussions.
