00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.380
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:12.730
In this lecture we are going to be adding in an asset pack with a whole bunch of beautiful assets such

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.190
as this great level here which is going to be a fantastic starting point for our first person shooter

4
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.640
as well as character assets guns particle effects and more.

5
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.400
So let's dive in and see how to do that case so let's get started at the beginning creating the project.

6
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.900
Now you've done this a few times before.

7
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.520
So I'm going to go through this quickly.

8
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.870
The engine version I'm using is four point two five.

9
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.330
Feel free to use this one or a newer version when doing it for yourself.

10
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.430
We're going to go ahead and first of all launch the engine to get at new project creation dialogue.

11
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.830
This obviously may take a variable amount of time depending on your setup so in the meantime let's talk

12
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.600
about the assets we're going to be using here we have got a shooter asset pack that we are going to

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.550
be importing into our project and the way we're going to be doing this is it is itself a unreal project.

14
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.130
So we're going to migrate the assets out of that project and into your project.

15
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.630
Basically this instead of having a starter project that's just another way of doing it.

16
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.940
And the benefit of this is that if you have got an existing project you want to use these assets then

17
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.420
you can you can migrate those assets into that project.

18
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.590
So let's create first of all a project to start with.

19
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.760
Now you'll notice if this dialogue looks unfamiliar to you it's because it's a little bit new.

20
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.090
In some newer versions of real but don't worry it's not that different.

21
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.950
Basically has the same options.

22
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.820
We want to select games because that's what we're making we're not doing any of these other applications

23
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.610
that unreal is often used for.

24
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.490
So that games go to the next screen now it starts look a bit familiar.

25
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.660
So we want a blank project notes there's no tabs here for blueprint or C++ create a blank project on

26
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.820
this next screen.

27
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.500
This is where we have the option to select between blueprint or C++ I'm going to get to C++.

28
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.950
It's a C++ course.

29
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.130
Then all these other options are going to leave the same.

30
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.140
I'm not going to add start to content although you could if you wanted to have those extra assets in

31
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.230
the starter pack to play around within your shooter then I'm going to give my project a name which is

32
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.770
going to be simple shooter the name of this section and I'm already happy I got that location set to

33
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.600
the right thing.

34
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.840
But you can go ahead and change the location to wherever you want your project to be saved and go ahead

35
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.340
and create the project.

36
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.100
Again this can take a variable amount of time.

37
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.380
We're going to go back and have a look at the asset pack.

38
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.250
So as I said it is a new project and in fact is it made in version four point to two if I'm correct

39
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.730
which means that you can use it in any version greater than four point to two.

40
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.050
So we're going to go ahead and open it up.

41
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.990
And that just explains why we see this first dialog box that says select an engine version because the

42
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.700
version of the project itself was not four point two five.

43
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.930
So it's just going to do an upgrade but that's fine.

44
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.880
We can go ahead and do an upgrade to whatever version you've currently got on your system and it should

45
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.080
work just fine.

46
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.420
And the zip for this asset pack can be found against this lectures resources.

47
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.630
So you do go ahead and download that.

48
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.140
Get that extracting it can take a little bit of time because there's quite a lot of heavy assets in

49
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.110
there make sure you get that download started while you're watching this video.

50
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.850
Now for the next step we will need to have this discovering assets a little dialogue have finished discovering

51
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.280
all the assets in the project because we can't migrate them if it doesn't know what they are.

52
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.260
So what we're going to do basically is take this folder here the asset packs folder you can go and have

53
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.590
a look at it.

54
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.080
There's a few different asset packs that I've aggregated together from the permanently free collection

55
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.410
from unreal example projects and some assets of my own which I have created with my microphone.

56
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.690
And you can go and have a look at take a look at any of this.

57
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.020
It's quite fun anyway but we're going to try and migrate this.

58
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.330
That's right click on the asset pack and hit the migrate button.

59
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.710
So we're doing this at the root folder so that in migrating all of these folders underneath it you can

60
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.090
see that it's selected them all automatically and we're going to go ahead and click Okay.

61
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.050
That's all the asset.

62
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:24.860
So we want to migrate then what we need to do is go and navigate our way to the content folder of the

63
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.740
project we want to import this into you can see it's currently in the content folder of the projects

64
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.480
that we're importing them from.

65
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.710
So the shooter asset pack content is where it currently is.

66
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:44.220
But we want to go to where we've created the new projects so for me that's under courses and unreal.

67
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.460
And then the simple shoes that we've just created and then you can see the unravels created this content

68
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.330
folder where all your blueprints and your assets generally live.

69
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.380
So once you've got that an empty content folder.

70
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.920
We can just go ahead and hit select folder and the copying process is going to start.

71
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.400
This can take a little while because there's a few gigs of assets in here there's quite a lot of high

72
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.210
res assets for you to use.

73
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.850
So once your download is finished do go ahead and get started on this migration as soon as possible

74
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:25.590
to bring those assets in to your project Okay so once that is complete you may get a message saying

75
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.950
that some files were not successfully copied that may or may not be a problem we'll see down the line

76
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.240
we can always migrate things again if we find that something is missing.

77
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.250
So let's take a brief look at what came in.

78
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.430
We're going to go over to our simple shoes so we can now close down the shooter asset pack we no longer

79
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.760
need that project you can delete it off your downloads if you like or keep it around in case you want

80
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.020
it for something else.

81
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.640
Now what's in the asset packs.

82
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:59.250
I think the most interesting things to have a look at are the modular sci fi season one starter bundle

83
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.270
which is in the permanently free collection so you could go ahead and download this anyway I've just

84
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.810
packaged it all together to make it simple.

85
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.480
And what we can have a look at is the collection maps and map number one go ahead and load that one

86
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.750
up.

87
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:19.110
So once that has opened and it can take a while depending on your machine for me it took about five

88
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.320
or 10 minutes to open this map.

89
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.190
But don't worry once you've opened it once it's going to be a lot quicker in future.

90
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.610
And what you're going to see is this kind of environment.

91
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.490
At first it might be not particularly pretty as you can see over here.

92
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.710
That's because we're still compiling the shaders and there's lots of shaders to compile for a scene

93
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.240
like this and once that's done this is going to look super gorgeous and pretty.

94
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.100
So that's what we're aiming to get is in to being able to have this level here.

95
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.790
I'm gonna make that my default map so I'm going to go over to settings project settings then to maps

96
00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:00.480
and modes and I'm going to change over the editor startup map to be this one which I think was called

97
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.190
Map 1.

98
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.790
So it's going to search for it.

99
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:09.480
Same for the game default mode is also going to be map one for now until we create our own.

100
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.870
And I can go ahead and close that down.

101
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.420
The other thing I wanted to show you in the asset pack is the paragon Wraith which comes from epics

102
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:26.220
canceled Paragon game and if we go into the Paragon wraith characters heroes folder wraith then we're

103
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.050
going to see this guy.

104
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:34.350
If we go and have a look at his blueprint character which again may take a little second to load and

105
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:40.200
once that has opened up you can go to the viewport to have a look at the blueprints and have a look

106
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.840
at the Wraith character.

107
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.870
Now again compiling shaders so you can't see the shaders on this guy.

108
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.950
He is very pretty.

109
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:52.530
Once you can so do go ahead and open all these assets up it will start the shader compilation process

110
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.200
and you'll be able to see what we're going to be working with.

111
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.440
So that's it for me in this lecture we set up our project we've got the assets and we've had a little

112
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.110
poke around and look around.

113
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:10.050
The next step that I'm going to do that you may wish to is optional step is to put this all under version

114
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.980
control.

115
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:18.450
For that I've included this adults get ignore file in my downloads here which is going to be against

116
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.560
this lecture.

117
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:25.350
And what we're going to do is we're going to just go ahead and copy that in to our project.

118
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:31.590
So I'm going to go to the simple shooter project that we just created earlier and a copy in this dot

119
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:39.360
gets ignore file and then what I can go ahead and do is in the Visual Studio project that was opened

120
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.090
up by the Visual Studio code project that was opened up because that's the editor I'm using I can go

121
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:53.340
ahead to source control tab and initialize my repository here and choose a simple shooter as the folder

122
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:59.040
that I want to initialize the repo in because I call that dot gets ignore file I won't get reams and

123
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.680
reams of stuff well I will get reams and reams of stuff but I'll get fewer reams of stuff than I would

124
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.840
have got if I didn't have I get ignored it gets ignored just make sure that the files that we don't

125
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.120
need to track because they're easy to reproduce for the computer don't get tracked.

126
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.860
So then what I can do is I can go ahead and put in a message and I do recommend you use some sort of

127
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:25.740
version control like this to keep track of keep a backup of the stuff that you're doing and keep regular

128
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.420
staging points so that if anything goes wrong you don't have to start from scratch.

129
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.460
You got somewhere to take off from.

130
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:37.110
So once I've given it a name you can go ahead and hit the commit button up at the top which is a little

131
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:43.020
tick and you can see that because I haven't staged any changes it's saying do you want me to stage them.

132
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.780
And if if I didn't want it to do that automatically I can just go to the changes that I want to stage

133
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:55.200
I can add them with the little plus button here and it goes and puts them from this changes category

134
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.960
to the staged changes categories and I can do that on all of the changes I can just add the plus button

135
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.960
next to changes that will take a little while and then I could go ahead and commit that way as well

136
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.190
and that's the first step to using version control really don't need anything else you don't need to

137
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.850
use get hard.

138
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.980
You don't need to do download another tool you could just use Visual Studio code as a starting point

139
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.290
and it's going to give you some of that safety of having those checkpoints that you could always go

140
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.030
back to if anything goes wrong.

141
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.030
But as I say using version control is an optional step.

142
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:32.810
And with so many assets in your repository it can be quite a slow step as you can see in my stage changes

143
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.430
are going to take probably about 5 10 minutes to add just in the same way as loading them up.

144
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.820
Took a long time.

145
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.620
That's all from me.

146
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.260
We've set up our project we put it under version control.

147
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.610
We'll see you in the next lecture.
