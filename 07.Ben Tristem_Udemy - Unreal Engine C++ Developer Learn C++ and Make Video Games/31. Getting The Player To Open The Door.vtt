00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.340
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:13.030
In the past what we've had to do is eject from our player character and assign ourselves as an actor

3
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.940
that can open our doors.

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:22.390
Well in this lecture we're going to learn how we can go ahead and assign our character in code so it's

5
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.430
able to open the doors and this thing gives us a lot of possibilities.

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.280
We've gone into the corner perhaps put a bit of a forwardness over there as well and we we've escaped.

7
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.370
Let's find out more okay.

8
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.240
So we're talking about how our players now starting to interact with the world.

9
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.320
Now we don't have a character in our in our code at the moment or in our scene and we're not going to

10
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.270
do that in this particular session because it's going to add a ton of extra code that we just don't

11
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.650
need at the moment.

12
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.340
And it will just complicate the project more so than is necessary now.

13
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.600
In the past we've used ghetto owner to search bottom up.

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.870
So we'll be with our open door and we will get owner to see what actor it's attached to.

15
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.650
However instead of doing that a bottom up approach we can do a top down approach so we can use the get

16
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.760
world function in order to search top down what's in our world what actors are in our world what characters

17
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.030
what classes can we gain access to and I should at this point just point out that get world would be

18
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.420
returning the level that we're currently in.

19
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.150
Of course a game can have multiple levels.

20
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.400
Now the game mode itself specifies that default porn class we've had a look of that briefly and we'll

21
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.420
have more detail once we start setting up our player in a bit.

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.040
Now the default porn can be considered your body.

23
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.990
It's transient.

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.460
It comes in and out when you press play and when you are not playing the game.

25
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.770
However the player controller your mind persists.

26
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.670
So we can access the player controller if access is the right word.

27
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.610
We can use the player controller in order to find the pawn that is your body within the game and the

28
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.330
player controller class has and gets porn as a function that will return as the porn that the player

29
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.070
controller is controlling.

30
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.270
Wow.

31
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.090
Deep breath there.

32
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.360
Okay.

33
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.600
So let's dive over into unreal and explore some of that and then we'll go back over into the code and

34
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
actually get this working.

35
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.870
Okay.

36
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.250
So over in the unreal just to demonstrate what I've been talking about how when we go ahead and press

37
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.510
play and then injects ourselves so we can just see what's going on.

38
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.190
This is like our body.

39
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.570
And of course us flying around is almost like our mind separated from our body.

40
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.020
This itself is the default porn that we can take control of or use.

41
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.280
But one of the ways we can get it is through the player control itself just because of the way that

42
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.910
these actors are structured.

43
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.350
So we're going to have to include a couple of header files not only because we're going to be going

44
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.120
for the player controller but also because we're coming from the top the get.

45
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.870
World we're not going to have access to anything within there unless we also include the necessary header

46
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.420
for that as well so let's go ahead over into the U.S. Code and we only need to look at the CBP file

47
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.870
the actual implementation itself at the top here we're going to require a couple of header files we're

48
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.890
going to require the world and the player controller and this would be a great time for your little

49
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.870
challenge.

50
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.730
So go ahead and find out which header files we're going to need for the player controller and get world

51
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.460
pause video now and give that a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

52
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.750
How did you get on.

53
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.410
Well let's dive back into the code and see if you were right.

54
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.940
Now the world itself.

55
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.910
So let's go at the top here and hash include them.

56
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.850
So again to hash include what do we need first well the world is under engine.

57
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.680
So if we go for engine forward slash world of course these are things you can look up as well.

58
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.950
And then we've got another hash include that we need we need to hash include I believe this is under

59
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:18.470
the game framework forward slash character controller character player controller player player player

60
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.100
controllers a player control H XOM.

61
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.730
So we've got those two header files there.

62
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.360
And then what we can do is underneath our pressure plate code or above it it doesn't really matter.

63
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.890
I'm going to just place it in line so it's kind of historical I might move it around later on.

64
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.610
OK.

65
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.370
So what do we need to do.

66
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.520
Well we need we need to search from the world itself.

67
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.080
So what we can do is get the world and then the parentheses.

68
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.660
And because it's a pointer we're going to use the arrow operator on it.

69
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.490
Now what can we do from here.

70
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.680
Well we need to get that first player control and our first player controller then you might have more

71
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.660
controllers in the scene you see.

72
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.840
So the first player controller is just the first player controller.

73
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.590
Now the first player controller sorry I interrupted myself there the first player controller is a single

74
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.100
player game essentially and then we go ahead and what we can do here is if we hover over we'll see that

75
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.110
it is a pointer again so we can go ahead arrow operator.

76
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.850
Now we can start looking a bit in a bit more detail and we need to get the porn itself.

77
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.880
So this is the porn that the first player controller is using.

78
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.890
Now what does this return.

79
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.250
Well this returns are porn which is useful.

80
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:47.840
And remember the pawns inherits from actors which means that the actor that opens we can set to this

81
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.810
because a porn is a subset of actors.

82
00:05:51.820 --> 00:06:00.120
So what we can say is that the actor that opens equals what this line returns.

83
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.990
Now incidentally whilst we're here if we hover back over get porn for a moment we can see that is also

84
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.810
a pointer.

85
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.340
So if we wanted to drill in a little bit further we can actually get other properties of our player

86
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.760
within our world as well if we wanted to which is pretty awesome.

87
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.460
But we don't need to do that at the moment.

88
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.360
So if we set the actor opens as what's this returns which will be the porn our default porn in this

89
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.870
case we save our implementation file and go back over into one reel.

90
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.850
Of course you need to compile our code and now all being well what we should be able to do providing

91
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:46.340
we've got it all right is walk into our collision volume and the doors will open OK let's go ahead and

92
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.930
press play and walk backwards.

93
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.430
Hey excellent we have our doors opening.

94
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.650
That's exactly what we want.

95
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.400
And of course now we can just stroll out.

96
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.820
There's no door closing to trap us back in the room.

97
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.140
So I think that's the next thing that we're going to have to sort out we're currently opening the doors

98
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.740
absolutely fine but really wants to close them as well.

99
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.990
How did you guys get on.

100
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.840
Have you got your player successfully opening the doors when you walk into the collision volume.

101
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.050
This is really exciting because we've almost completed our core game mechanic here of the door opening

102
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.460
is shutting with links placed in that volume and I'll see you will in the next lecture.
