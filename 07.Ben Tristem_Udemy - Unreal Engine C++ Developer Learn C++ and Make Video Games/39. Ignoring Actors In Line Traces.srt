00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:10,150
Hello and welcome in this lecture, we are going to be fixing those bugs with ray tracing so that we

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,530
can kill the character.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:18,280
They aren't killing themselves and we can run over the spot where they've been by disabling their capsule

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,880
collider.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,860
Let's dive in and see how to achieve this.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,460
So we've got some weird bugs going on at the moment.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:31,450
So we've got one where the enemy A.I. essentially seems to be shooting itself in the face, as you can

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,710
see, by the fact that it's soon going to sprawl out dead on the floor like so.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,270
But not only that, it carries on shooting a it is dead.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,270
So we're going to solve some of those problems progressively.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,310
Let's see what is going on.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,910
So, first of all, the shooting itself in the face, that could be quite easy to see what's going on.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,610
So if we go over into our gun, see peepee and have a look at how this is working, we're currently

14
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,730
doing this line trace single by channel to find the hit result.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,810
And we're doing it starting from the location that is the play of viewport the viewpoint, sorry.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,660
And with the A.I., we've already discussed this.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
It's going to be somewhere around the eye level.

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,920
That's where it's going to be tracing from.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,650
And you can see that there might be a little bit of an issue here.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,820
If you start tracing from his eyes, you're going to hit this capsule.

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,460
In fact, we have the problem ourselves as well.

22
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,830
The only distinction being that because we have this over the camera view, over the shoulder view,

23
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:37,420
then the we essentially don't get the issue because we circumvent that capsule and don't hit it.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,340
But we could be hitting our own capsule just as easily if our camera were in a different location.

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,050
So how do we stop that?

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,080
So if we go back and define this, will create a struct the F collision, queer parameters, I'm gonna

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,430
call Perens and then we can add some actors that should be ignored as part of our line trace.

28
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,540
We do this by doing prams, dot ad ignore ignored actor and then what are the actors we should ignore.

29
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,550
Well the first one is simply the gun.

30
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,340
So this and the second one is the owner pawn.

31
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,620
So Perens dot ad ignored actor get owner.

32
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,420
So basically the owner of the gun should not be hit by his own gun.

33
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,040
I mean obviously you might want to be able to hit your own porn's with the gun but the.

34
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,740
No not in this case.

35
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:34,480
So the parameters we are going to pass in as the last argument to our line trace single by channel,

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,200
and then we're going to save and build and see if this works.

37
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,930
So now, ideally, if we go and hit play, we should see the yeah, we're getting the particle effect

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,410
on our capsule, on our player, and eventually our health should go down to zero and we should end

39
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,630
up sprawled out on the floor.

40
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,580
There we go, sprawled out on the floor.

41
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,460
Some we seem to have fallen through.

42
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,480
I don't know where our actual player has gone, but we are still spawned on the floor.

43
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,100
But here is another bug.

44
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,680
You can see that he's still shooting at us and he's still shooting and hitting a capsule.

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,990
And the same thing actually happens.

46
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,190
If I were to kill this guy, let's go ahead and kill him.

47
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,930
They go getting me bear.

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,060
It's much harder without something to point at on the screen, but you're able to get him.

49
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,890
But he's still shooting.

50
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,820
Still shooting at me.

51
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,410
And what would have also seen is that his capsule is still active.

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,000
So there's a couple of things we want to do when our characters get killed.

53
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,630
Both the A.I. and the player.

54
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,350
So let's go to the shoot.

55
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,520
S.P. and let's find our take damage function.

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,890
And we basically want to add an if statement in here.

57
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,870
We want to say if is dead.

58
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,390
So basically, we've taken damage for the last time.

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,080
We're now dead.

60
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,070
We need to do some stuff to some cleanup.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,750
The first thing we need to do is detach the controller from this character.

62
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,900
The control is no longer in charge of this character.

63
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,710
The character's dead.

64
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,060
You can't do anything that's gonna stop us from being able to shoot.

65
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,820
So the A.I. will no longer be shooting when it's dead.

66
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,900
That sort of makes sense.

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,790
And furthermore, we're no longer gonna be able to try and move around in the world.

68
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,910
All of that is being disabled by doing a detach from controller pending destroy.

69
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,100
That's what we're gonna do.

70
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,850
Then the next thing is we want to switch off that capsule collision.

71
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:31,630
So we're gonna do the get capsule components and then we're gonna need to do a hash include up at the

72
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:31,930
top.

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,530
For the capsule components, so had to include components and the capsule component over there.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,910
Then scroll back down to our take damage, you can do an arrow operator and we're going to do a set

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,080
collision enabled.

76
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,900
So we kind of want to set it, not enable.

77
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,990
That's why we're doing a set collision enabled, weirdly enough, so it can be e collision enabled.

78
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,110
Kolon, Kolon, no collision.

79
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,300
So we're setting our capsule collider to no collision, which should help us right out.

80
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,290
Okay, so we're gonna go ahead and build and see if that's helped.

81
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,510
Well, the compiler at least was successful.

82
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,410
Go and hit play.

83
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,150
And so he's shooting at me.

84
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,680
I can shoot him till he's dead.

85
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,820
There we go.

86
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,360
He's dead.

87
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,040
I can go over his capsule and I'm no longer colliding with it.

88
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,600
You can also see that he is no longer shooting his gun, which is fantastic.

89
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,060
And let's also see if he goes and kills us.

90
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,840
What's the behavior?

91
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:31,020
So we just have to wait for the 10 shots and you can see I spruill out dead just as much as he did.

92
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,400
And he keeps shooting at me.

93
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:32,970
That's okay.

94
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,710
He's no longer hitting an empty collider.

95
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,150
And I can no longer control my camera because I am dead.

96
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,570
Awesome.

97
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,790
So we've got the basics of a first person shooter here.

98
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,640
We've got an enemy that follows us, shoots at us.

99
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,600
We can shoot at it.

100
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,800
Both of us have health.

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,630
Both of us can die.

102
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,470
So the next thing is to actually set up some game end conditions so that we can display a nice message

103
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,410
to our player saying that you've lost or that you've won.

104
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,250
If you killed all of the players in the level, then that will be the subject of the next lecture.

105
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:02,700
See you there.
