00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.430
So this is just gonna be a quick lecture on trying to understand why we're getting this weird glitch

2
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.120
here when we move from the right of this first spawn point.

3
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.110
Now, let's dive straight into this one without an introduction.

4
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.190
The idea here is that something must be going wrong with the collisions, collisions being those simplified

5
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.260
measures around the world that allow us to do fiscal physical calculations.

6
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.370
Basically, what can we stand on?

7
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.090
What can we not?

8
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.240
Because they're often simplifications of the measures that we can actually see for performance reasons.

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.650
So how do we see what the collision world looks like?

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.340
Well, fortunately, in our viewport, we can go to the lit mode, the button that by default says lit

11
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.150
at the top left and you can see has different view modes here.

12
00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.950
Some of them are things like unlit res lighting can see the wire frames of the mesh is the one we're

13
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.850
interested in.

14
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.380
Is either the play a collision or the visibility collision.

15
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.460
Now, the difference being that the visibility collision is the more fine grained meshes and the player

16
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.830
collision is that coarse grain motion.

17
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.200
You kind of see the difference that I think that's quite obvious.

18
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.490
When you click between the two, you can see the coarse grain and fine grain nature of things.

19
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.450
But if we move over here from this particular angle, you can see that there is a mesh just poking through

20
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.660
here.

21
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.970
A collision mesh that we do not want.

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.260
Where is that coming from?

23
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.810
Looks like an error in our asset pack.

24
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.620
We click on it, you can see it says floor filler 27.

25
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.180
Not very helpful.

26
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.250
That's the name of the actor.

27
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.050
But if we go and have a look at its static mesh component and the details pane and have a look at its

28
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.740
actual static mesh, we've got the s.m stairs, a one.

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.730
Now, if we browsed this asset using the little magnifying glass and open it up, then we're going to

30
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.080
get the static mesh.

31
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.320
Ed opened up in Unreal.

32
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.230
And what we're interested in is having a look at collisions.

33
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.190
So see collisions.

34
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.730
You go to this collisions button and you can click on both the simple and complex collision that shows

35
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.880
you.

36
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.320
There's two different measures here.

37
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.460
The complex collision is four when we're doing fine grained physics and it's often the same as the visible

38
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.940
mesh.

39
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.700
And then there's the simple collision, which is just a kind, of course, a grain version, as we've

40
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.480
been saying.

41
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.180
And you can kind of see that difference.

42
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.690
That's a nice, coarse grain mesh.

43
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.930
And what happens if we have a look, if we've got this coarse grain, simple collision selected and

44
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.980
go below the floor?

45
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.540
As you can see, there's this massive strand going off down there into the distance.

46
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.660
That's must be what was causing us our collision issues.

47
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.330
A little bit of an error in the asset pack.

48
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.120
A few ways that we could deal with this one might be if you go through the collision, Mannu can remove

49
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.850
collision, which is entirely removing collisions.

50
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.130
You can then regenerate it using a bunch of different options that are built into unreeled such as you

51
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.010
could add a sphere for simplified collision, a capsule box 10 Dopy 2016 P.

52
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.850
Lots of different options here.

53
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.260
Auto convex collision.

54
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.960
We're not going to do any of that because actually we can fix this up pretty straightforwardly.

55
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.220
Oh yeah.

56
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.800
One more option would be that we could set the complex collision as the simple collision, as an option

57
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.630
for that in the details pain.

58
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.100
But we're not going to go down any of those routes because actually you can do a little bit, of course,

59
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.110
grain mesh editing right here.

60
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.940
At least we can delete some vertices.

61
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.400
So if we go ahead and select it while the collision mesh, simple collision meshes visible, you can

62
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.380
select this set of edges or the face that goes all the way down here.

63
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.250
And you can see that's all that selected as anything that's changed to a lighter green color.

64
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.030
That's how I can tell.

65
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.220
And if we hit delete, then you can see that goes away and it doesn't actually affect the rest of the

66
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.420
mesh.

67
00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.280
The rest of the meshes pretty solid, still looks pretty much as we would want it to look.

68
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.630
And if we go even in this viewport, we can go over to the player collision view and you can see what

69
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.200
that mesh looks like.

70
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.340
It's a little bit funny in places, but it will work.

71
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.920
So if we go back to Lit.

72
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.510
And then go over into the sandbox, you can see now that little shard has disappeared from our player,

73
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.810
collisions can go back into Lette and hit play.

74
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.140
And now if I go over to the right and move around here, there are no collision errors whatsoever.

75
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.120
And because we modified that stair mesh, let's go down the hallway and try going up and down the stairs.

76
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.250
Yep.

77
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.700
The collisions that still seem to be functional are not dropping through the floor or anything.

78
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.960
I'm able to go up them and it's not kind of discontinuous, jerky motion.

79
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.460
So asked.

80
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.990
Their mesh is now fixed and you've learned as a result of it a little bit about how collisions are set

81
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.030
up against static meshes in Unreal.

82
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.950
The next lecture, we're gonna be going back to animations and understanding the animation blueprint

83
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.070
to create much more complicated animation behaviors.

84
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.900
I'll see you there.
