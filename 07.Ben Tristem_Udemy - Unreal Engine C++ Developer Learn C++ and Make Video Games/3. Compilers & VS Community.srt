1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:11,590
Welcome in this video, we are going to get Visual Studio Community 2019 set up and installed on our

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,190
computer.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,270
The reason we're going to do that is because with it comes a compiler.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,430
So I need to define what a compiler is.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,190
Well, we when programming our games in unreal engine programming in C++, we want to speak English

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,380
or something as close to English as possible.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,180
A lot of people have say C++ isn't very English at all, but we want to be as close to English as possible,

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,030
otherwise known as a high level language.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,250
We want to use words that are familiar to us.

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,500
But the computer wants to communicate in something very different.

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,360
Ultimately, it wants ones and zeros.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,150
It wants binary in order to perform its operations.

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,180
So the compiler, in very simple terms as a first definition, is something that converts R code on

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,480
the text of our code into ones and zeros that the computer can run.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,640
And this process overall is called compilation.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:54,850
Right.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,620
So the reason the primaries and we're installing Visual Studio Community 2019 is because it's the easiest

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,340
way to install a compiler.

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,420
Now, if you're on a Mac, hang with me for just a moment, because I'm just trying to explain a little

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,190
bit more about the unreal development environment.

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,200
Then you can skip forward to the next video where we'll show you how to install X code, which is going

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,430
to be the equivalent package on the Mac.

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,500
So this is the wider picture.

24
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,420
We want to make games in on real engine.

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,750
We also want to learn to code in C++.

26
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:28,360
So what we gonna do on the P.C. is install Visual Studio Community 2019 and on the Mac we're going to

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,740
install something called X Code.

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,470
We're also I haven't put it on the diagram for simplicity.

29
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,990
We're also going to install something different on both systems, which will also work on Linux called

30
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,340
Visual Studio Code.

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,450
And we'll see a little bit later how that's different and why we are using, in addition, as a second

32
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,080
option for you.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,570
But once you've got Unreal Engine and one of these two, what they call integrated development environments.

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,540
You also have behind the scenes a compiler.

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:59,170
This thing here and then that actually writes code and the code files to the disk system.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,280
So that's the folder there.

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,810
So you see an unreal engine.

38
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,700
It runs code from your desk.

39
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,580
Unreal engine and your integrated developed environment.

40
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,590
All talk to the compiler, which turns text that you've got on your desk into other types of files on

41
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,680
the disk, which executable, and that can be run by the machine.

42
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,430
So that's kind of the environment we're working in, again, at a very top level view, just so you

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,210
understand where we are.

44
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,240
So what I want you to do in a moment is to install Visual Studio Community 2019, literally just do

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,160
a Google search reveals studio whole, your favorite search engine being or whatever, and go and find

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,710
Visual Studio Community 2019.

47
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,930
You don't absolutely have to have a Microsoft account to get this running.

48
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,070
It will ask you to log in, but you least at the time of recording, can skip that.

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,340
Probably worth just grabbing a Microsoft account or using whichever one you've got.

50
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,300
Anyway, I'm not gonna take you step by step through the installation, but I am going to show you the

51
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,710
end result.

52
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,810
So you basically it's a standard software installation.

53
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,580
It's gonna change a little bit over time.

54
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,860
So there's no point in me showing you absolutely verbatim.

55
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,440
But go get Visual Studio at a time of recording.

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,210
It started off by downloading a 70 or 67 megabyte, an initial set of files.

57
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,360
Then it presents you with an installation screen, something like this.

58
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,850
Again, this is subject to a small amount of change over time.

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,870
But what we're looking for is the game development with C++ option.

60
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,530
If you scroll down, it's about halfway down the list and take that option.

61
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,380
It'll pre take a whole bunch of things that are required.

62
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,320
It'll give you the top three, maybe one or two other options.

63
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,450
But basically you want the default there.

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,540
Plus, it's important that you click Unreal Engine Installer, even if you already have unreal engine

65
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,190
installed.

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,910
So please make sure all these settings are set.

67
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,560
Game development, C++ on the left hand side there and then the four checkboxes that I've got on the

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,090
right and that will make sure that you've got everything you need and all of the dependencies that you

69
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,920
need installed.

70
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,330
So once you do that and set the download going, as you can say, it's up to seven gig of total space

71
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,720
required.

72
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,910
But the download on the next screen isn't seven gig.

73
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,860
It's like one point eight at the time of recording.

74
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,530
And that's gonna take what depends on the speed your broadband doesn't.

75
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,030
It could take minutes, could take hours.

76
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,050
It will helpfully also install while it is downloading.

77
00:03:59,370 --> 00:03:59,650
Okay.

78
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,980
And when that whole process finishes, you're going to end up with something like this, which is your

79
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,850
log in screen.

80
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,000
And one of the options will be I don't want to sign in.

81
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,040
I could sign in later.

82
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,220
So that's what I was talking about.

83
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,660
Now, if you're still on Mac, if you're on Mac rather and you're still watching, do skip over to the

84
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,820
next video, because I'm going to be showing you X code.

85
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,080
Obviously, you won't be doing still visual studio community twenty nineteen on Mac because it doesn't

86
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,130
exist on Mac.

87
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,390
So your challenge now is simply to catch up with where I am and install a visual studio community 2019.

88
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,930
Simply get visuals to the community 2019 stowed and help each other in in the community as required.

89
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,140
When I come back, I'll show you how the end of the installation looks.

90
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,790
And just make sure it all works for you.

91
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,660
So over here on Windows, I have started with a completely fresh installation of windows.

92
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,660
All I had before I started this process was a vast installed.

93
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,490
And I've used the installation options that I showed you in this slide here.

94
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,270
I take game development, C++, an unreal engine installer.

95
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,800
And where I've ended up is here.

96
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,630
But the epic games don't in my desktop.

97
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,420
And I'm ending up being able to choose my theme.

98
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,210
I think I'll go for dark and start Visual Studio.

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,380
Now, that might take a little while.

100
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,340
As it says to start, we're not going to dwell on Visual Studio at the moment.

101
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,970
We just need to know that it is working right.

102
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,960
So I could click, for instance, continue without code or create a new project.

103
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,520
It doesn't actually matter what we take.

104
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,320
We just want to make sure that the thing is installed and looks something like what's on the screen

105
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,310
when it is.

106
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:30,310
Then you can just close it and then you can close the installer and you're good knowing that you have

107
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,560
visual studio ready for later in the course.

108
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,160
We're going to use a different cut down version of Visual Studio for the beginning of the course to

109
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,770
keep things simple for you could visual studio code.

110
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,270
But you have it ready for later.

111
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,140
You have it as an option.

112
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,700
If you want to use it at any point, you can follow along in visual studio community.

113
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,560
This thing we've just installed if you want to.

114
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,680
I would only do that if you're somewhat experienced as a developer.

115
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,030
If you haven't ever used visual studio or visual studio code before, then.

116
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,220
Just follow along the videos verbatim.

117
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,210
And do what we do as we go along because it'll be a lot easier for you.

118
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:01,920
Awesome.

119
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,860
So we are in good shape to carry on with the course.

120
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,780
And I shall see you soon.
