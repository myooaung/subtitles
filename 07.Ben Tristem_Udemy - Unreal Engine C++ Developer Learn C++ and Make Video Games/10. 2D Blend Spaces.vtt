00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.050
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.960
We're going to look at this great thing called a blend space in this lecture and how it allows us to

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.980
smoothly move between different types of movement.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.570
Let's dive in and see it in action.

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.070
So, as we said, these BLENDE nodes are not a very good way of doing animation with at least locomotion

6
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.310
animation, which is what we call this moving around animation.

7
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.290
So what is.

8
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.500
Well, fortunately, in Unreal, we have got an asset specifically designed for this kind of thing when

9
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.800
we want to blend between things in a two dimensional space.

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.870
It's called a two D Blende space.

11
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.490
So what we're going to do is go over to our content browser and create one of these, and then I will

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.340
take you over what it is, what it means and what's the point.

13
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.160
Got to add new animation and blend spacing and see, there's also a variant that is one dimensional.

14
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.960
We're going to be going for the two dimensional.

15
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.660
One reason being, we got two dimensions which are going to be the forward backwards dimension and the

16
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.100
left right dimension.

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.140
So let's go for that.

18
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.720
We've got to pick a skeleton that it needs to be based off.

19
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.790
That's going to be the Wraith skeleton.

20
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.780
And then the prefix is gonna be B.S. underscore.

21
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.760
And we're going to call it locomotion because it's all about moving our player around.

22
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.040
So we open up our locomotion assets and you can see that right off the bat.

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.490
It is a new editor.

24
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.150
Yet again, it's actually creating a new type of animation, is making animation out of other animations,

25
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.770
but it's still sort of an animation.

26
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.830
And you can see that's displayed in the top right.

27
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.070
We've got details for this asset which are currently empty.

28
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.650
We've got asset details over on the left.

29
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.750
I'm not quite sure what the difference is there.

30
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.020
I think the details over on the right might be to do with the animation selected.

31
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.480
We've got a skeleton tree if you need it.

32
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.690
But the main area is this middle one.

33
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.780
We've got a viewport and underneath it we have got this two dimensional graph.

34
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.140
And what this is saying is that we could put a value along the bottom, which might be our left right

35
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.130
and a value along the left, which is going to be up and down perhaps.

36
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.870
And then this green dot, we can move around to any position on here.

37
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.170
And what we'd like to happen is if I put it over to the top.

38
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.800
Right.

39
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.950
Then we move forward and to the right at top velocity.

40
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.390
If I put over the left, we move forward and left or down to the bottom.

41
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.810
We go backwards and left at full velocity.

42
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.160
And anywhere in between.

43
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.010
So that's the idea here.

44
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.450
We want to basically be able to move between these BLENDE spaces and we want to be able to choose an

45
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.890
animation and blend between it.

46
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.630
So what actually happens?

47
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.170
Let's see if we can bring in a walk animation.

48
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.780
I'm going to bring in a walk left animation, a walk right animation over to the right here.

49
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.940
And then we've got forward and backwards.

50
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.570
So let's to put a backwards down here and a forward up here.

51
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.030
And then you can move this little green dots and you can see that it starts moving forward.

52
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.330
If I go up, starts moving backwards, if I get down and going over to the left and to the right, it

53
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.320
is essentially working as we would expect it to be.

54
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.520
Anything that's looking a little bit weird is here in the middle where we're kind of stomping on the

55
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.010
spot because we don't have an idle animation.

56
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.500
So we do need to introduce that.

57
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.770
But before we do any of that, we've got these axes that are labelled as none.

58
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.670
That's not particularly useful.

59
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.320
What should their labels be?

60
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.670
How do we change them?

61
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.390
Let's have a look.

62
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.940
We need to go over into our assets.

63
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.910
Details here.

64
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.710
And there are axes setting.

65
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.630
So got a horizontal axis that's gonna be our left and right.

66
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.910
So I'm just gonna call this right.

67
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.470
And it's minimum value I'm going to put as minus one.

68
00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.890
So going at minus one speed and maximum as plus one speed, we're going to update these based on the

69
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.650
actual values of the animations later on in the game.

70
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.540
Now, the vertical axis, I can go and edit to be forward.

71
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.880
And we're gonna go between minus one and one here as well, so minus one, two, one.

72
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.060
You can also select the number of divisions that you want in the grid.

73
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.200
Hey, we got four divisions.

74
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.940
But you could increase that if you want to put Animation's at different intervals.

75
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.130
And we'll be doing that later on as well.

76
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.880
So this is interesting.

77
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.570
And go forward and our left and right.

78
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.460
And I appear to have lost my little green nubbin there.

79
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.300
So I'm going to just close down the asset, hopefully bring it back up and see it again.

80
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.800
Make at the green nubbin is back.

81
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.990
So now I can go back forwards.

82
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.010
I can go back was left.

83
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.310
And right now we want this to actually be more complete so that we can run backwards.

84
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.050
So that we can run forwards.

85
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.970
We can walk forwards.

86
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.870
We can run left.

87
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.980
We can run right.

88
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.250
And we can have an idle animation in the middle.

89
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.180
Now, if we were to do that, we would find that we end up with a kind of cross formation.

90
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.340
And at these points in between, it wouldn't really know or behave very well.

91
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.490
So what we're actually and do is tweak these axes so that we get something a little bit different instead

92
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.560
of having right and forward, we're going to end up with having the angle.

93
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.300
And having the speed as the other dimension so that if we want to go backwards, you need to turn around

94
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.540
180 degrees on your angle and go at full speed.

95
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.820
So what should these values be?

96
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.500
Well, there should be a little bit different.

97
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:46.600
We're going to go from minus 180 to positive 180 on the angle.

98
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.860
Full circle.

99
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.440
And speed wise, we're gonna go from zero to it and let's say 100 for now.

100
00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.990
And then how would we be laying out these different animations that we've just laid out in one way we

101
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.070
can lay them out differently.

102
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.630
We've got a backwards animation that's going to go at full speed at minus 180.

103
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.450
It's also going to go full speed up positive 180.

104
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.020
So that backwards animation needs to be in two places.

105
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.810
So let's find out.

106
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.600
Walk.

107
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.170
For backwards and put it in this other place as well.

108
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.400
Now I'm walking, right?

109
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.920
That's going to go.

110
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.500
Actually, that's a walking left animation that should go over at minus 180.

111
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.990
Our walking right.

112
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.210
Should go over ATAP positive 180.

113
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.180
And our full walk should go there in the middle.

114
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.870
And as I said, we do need some sort of idle animation.

115
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.590
So let's go and look for the Idol combat animation.

116
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.270
Has the gun raised, I believe.

117
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.420
So go for idle combat and we're going put idle combat all the way along the bottom here in each one

118
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.840
of these slots to make the blend a super clear that no matter what angle you're at, if you're idle,

119
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.840
you want to be stationary.

120
00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.040
So let's try that.

121
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.930
I can now move my angle.

122
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.720
You can see I said start moving at a different angle, depending on where I bring that green nubbin.

123
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.660
And if I come down.

124
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.720
You can see it reduces my speed until I am idle.

125
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.710
So that's what it's doing, no matter where I start and I come up and it starts to move me over to the

126
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.200
left or to the right or wherever I am.

127
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.670
It is kind of making sense.

128
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.680
So my challenge to you is to complete this blend space.

129
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.440
We're gonna do that by adding JÖRG combat animations so that we can go faster as well as slower.

130
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.710
And where should they go in our scheme?

131
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.120
Whereabouts should they be put on this BLENDE space?

132
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.140
Post a video and have a go at that challenge.

133
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.650
Kay, welcome back.

134
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.190
So first of all, we're going to want to move down probably these blende spaces here, the walk left,

135
00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:01.340
the walk forward and right, because we don't want the JÖRG animations to go at faster speed at the

136
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:01.700
top.

137
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:09.880
Then we're going to go ahead and look for add jog and we're going to look for it.

138
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.310
Should be some of them are JÖRG combat, I believe.

139
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.950
Let's try and find them somewhere in here.

140
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.240
He again has a whole section down below that combat comes at the end.

141
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.290
So it's not very easy to search for, unfortunately.

142
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:27.280
But if we go and look for it, we should have a jog forward combat.

143
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.490
They go put that in the middle.

144
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.260
We're gonna need a jog backward combat, whereas that jog backward combat that's gonna go over to the

145
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.280
right and the left foot rightful left.

146
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.440
And we're going to need a left.

147
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.320
So jog left.

148
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.880
Combat's going at minus one eighty or minus 90.

149
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.530
In actual fact.

150
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.630
And the jog.

151
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.350
Right.

152
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.720
Combat is going at plus 90.

153
00:08:54.530 --> 00:09:01.220
And I just noticed I left a gap here where we had our walk backwards.

154
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.120
So that's fine.

155
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.750
Walk right, mouse button backwards over here.

156
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.460
And now we should be able to blend between these guys fairly accurately.

157
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:16.820
So going backwards, jogging backwards, jogging to the left, walking to the left.

158
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.970
My only problem appears to be that my idol animation has got all of this kind of looking to the left

159
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.580
and looking to the right business going on.

160
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.030
And if I go anywhere in between with this interpellation and exhibits frenetic.

161
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.470
So what I want to do here is actually find a different little animation.

162
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.520
I've used the wrong one.

163
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.050
So if we go, it's not idle combat that I want, but.

164
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.430
Right.

165
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.000
I think there's an idle ability.

166
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.480
Right.

167
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.340
Mouse button, which is more static.

168
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:52.430
So we'll go and bring that in over the top, which replaces we've bring over the top of those idle points

169
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.990
on our combat space.

170
00:09:54.260 --> 00:10:00.110
And now you can see if I bring that green nubbin around, you can see we don't have any that frenetic

171
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.830
moving around.

172
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:08.600
We just got a very nice blend space that smoothly blends between our walk animations and stopped animations

173
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.930
and are running animations in any direction.

174
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:18.470
And that hopefully gives you an idea of why blends spaces are just so awesome at doing things like locomotion.

175
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.830
In the next lecture, we're gonna look at bringing this BLENDE space in to an animation, blueprints

176
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.750
and how to hook it all up.

177
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.440
See that?
