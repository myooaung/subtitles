00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.890
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
So let's go ahead and get our new projects set up a couple of things that I want to show you about the

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.750
project manager itself.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.530
So for instance here I've got this test Linux it's just a little project that I created.

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.510
First of all when I set everything up to make sure that everything was working on a Linux based system

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.610
and it was and I don't need it anymore.

7
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.500
Now unfortunately there's no easy way of deleting on here if I right click.

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.660
It doesn't actually give me an option delete but it does give me an option to show in a file manager

9
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.170
if you go ahead and do that we can go upper level to unreal projects and just delete the folder obviously

10
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.850
be careful if you're doing this.

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.470
You do want to go ahead and inadvertently delete something you wanted to keep.

12
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.050
If we go back now it will still be there until even the next time we launch it or up in the top right

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.730
here we can refresh and we just get our two projects.

14
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.040
OK.

15
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.560
So just quickly hopped over to my P.C. and we see the same issue is present here we can show in Explorer.

16
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.620
However unlike Linux Windows and Mac both have the epic launch.

17
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.550
Let's go have a look at the projects there instead.

18
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.090
Excellent.

19
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.030
So if we have a look at the epic launch and go across to the library where we can launch our engine

20
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.480
down here we have our projects and you can right click any the clone to take a copy or delete.

21
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.630
So there are a few extra options right there for you if you don't fancy deleting it from the file system

22
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.350
itself.

23
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.860
There we go.

24
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.030
Now you may be wondering oh we'll not create a building escape.

25
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.530
Why if we got it there.

26
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.380
Well this particular building escape is the old one.

27
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.960
And let's go ahead and create a new one now.

28
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.160
Let's go to the new project tab.

29
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.420
OK.

30
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.840
So let's go ahead and first of all click the C++ tablet because that is the type of project that we're

31
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.100
doing.

32
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.940
And you can see it comes with a series of defaults.

33
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.960
As normal we can just go for basic code again.

34
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.120
In future you may decide to pick one of these other ones to get a leg up in a head start with setting

35
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.550
up where the camera is how the how the player moves etc. but for the moment we're going to stick with

36
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.270
basic code and create things ourselves.

37
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.260
Then we come down to our couple of options along the bottom.

38
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.730
Here is a well an option for you.

39
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.560
I'm not going to use the starter content however you might want to include it just to play and get familiar

40
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.290
again with the interface.

41
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.730
And so if you're not overly familiar with the unreal Ed interface do make sure you have the width start

42
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.570
to content turned on.

43
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.190
I'm going to turn it off because I'm going to import things and build up later on.

44
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.610
Now we've got where we're going to store things.

45
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.680
Now I've already created a folder in my repos which is just where I keep track of all of my project

46
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.450
changes.

47
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.570
If you use source control I will include a link in the lecture resources about the Gates ignore that

48
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.800
you can use to help manage an unreal project.

49
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.310
Now the name of the project I'm not going to keep it called my project I'm going to call it building

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.160
escape okay.

51
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.940
And with everything they're done I'm going to go ahead and create my project.

52
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.140
Now it may take your computer a few moments to do this especially if you have included the starter content

53
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.980
or all other packages or any other content that you wanted to include.

54
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.760
And with V.S. code now open that shows me everything's there.

55
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.500
There is an update to my extension helping me code in C++ I'm going to let that come down I'm going

56
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.830
to get rid of the welcome screen and I need to open up under source notice we're on the building escape

57
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.810
workspace here and then we've got building escape.

58
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.850
And here we have our building escape CBP and our building escape header file these are two that we're

59
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.670
going to be diving into almost straight away.

60
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.310
I'm going to reload my V.S. code.

61
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.790
Excellent.

62
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.870
So everything is now set up and ready to go and let's go into the projects and make sure it's working.

63
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.230
Excellent.

64
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.530
So we've got the building escape a blank project there.

65
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.330
Let's go ahead and open that up.

66
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.690
Okay.

67
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.010
So this is a great time to give you your challenge if you've already followed along.

68
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.900
Brilliant.

69
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.340
They'll just be one thing for you to do at the very end.

70
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.630
So what I'd like you to do is set up your new C++ project and create a new C++ project with or without

71
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.740
the staff content.

72
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.510
As I mentioned before if you're not that comfortable yet within the unreal editor then do include the

73
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.820
starter content so you can move things around and just get the general feel of it before we start designing

74
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.120
our level if using version control.

75
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.130
Do check out the gates ignore that I've included against this lecture really useful as it will mean

76
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.180
that you exclude any of the files that you don't need to use or keep track of things that unreal can

77
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.110
regenerate at any point.

78
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.520
And finally for those who have already got their project set up play about in your level and get comfortable

79
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.690
because we're going to be diving in and starting to create a new level.

80
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.930
So just feeling comfortable controls and moving things about and snapping them together is going to

81
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.790
be brilliant so it pulls a video now and give it a go Okay everybody Welcome back.

82
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.500
Let's go over into unreal it should have now all opened up for me.

83
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.960
Excellent.

84
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.290
So this is what you will see if you don't include the start content.

85
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.980
If you did include the start's content you will see a chair a couple of chairs a table etc..

86
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.250
So we've got a blank world that we can move around in.

87
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.530
And we also have a ground plane here.

88
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.710
We go ahead and press play now into the level and start to be able to move around.

89
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.610
Can we fly.

90
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.800
Yes of course we can but we can't pass through objects that have a collision on them and we'll talk

91
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.770
about adding collisions later on in the section.

92
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.170
So this is perfect we're able to move around a level.

93
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.590
I'm happy that everything's set up.

94
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.330
I haven't got anything to play with.

95
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.380
If you have and you've created a little scene for yourselves to share that get comfortable with doing

96
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.780
it and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
