1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,220
So this lecture will look at creating some materials for our models.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,420
We're going to set up some parameters we're going to expose those parameters to our material instance

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:20,500
so we can scale the texture and not just scaling it on both axes we can set it up so that we can scale

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,620
both the U and the v coordinates or the X and Y or the image accordingly which is great because it means

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,270
that if something is not quite square and we want it to be we can make it square.

6
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,950
So let's hop on over into one real and start transforming our materials textures.

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,390
Okay.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,830
So the first thing I want to do here is texture the floor using the wall texture.

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,770
Now in order to do that we're going to do the similar sort of things we did before and create the wall.

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:53,560
We're going to go to our original stone material right click and create a material instance and we're

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,310
going to call it stone.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,480
You probably guessed this floor okay.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,280
Brilliant.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,760
Now it's almost to the point where I think we can start.

15
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,330
Well not quite.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,750
But if we have much more in here it might be worth branching out so it's not just models but also materials

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,870
as well.

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,160
Okay.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,670
So we've got our stone floor here.

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm gonna open up that material instance and I'm going to dockets at the very top window here so I can

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,310
switch between building escape and the stone floor very quickly.

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,750
Now there's nothing here that I can use to adjust the scale of my material.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,130
So this is only going to be useful once we've exposed the parameters we need to use.

24
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,830
Let's go back to the building escape tab and open up our stone material now.

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:42,690
Yes.

26
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,680
That's opened up and it's opened up in the tab.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,760
Useful.

28
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,450
Okay.

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,030
So let's have a closer look at this.

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,590
We've got stone material here.

31
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,790
This is the output node.

32
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,010
This is the results we hover over it.

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,500
And as always these key tips here is the result node of the material so what is what's going to look

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,410
like we then have a texture sample node and that's the texture that we've got plugged in.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,560
That's fine.

36
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,550
Now we need to control how the U visa mapped there are there are a couple of ways that we can plug things

37
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,510
into these sockets of our nodes so we can go ahead and click and drag out and look that will place a

38
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,100
new node that's directly connected to you vs.

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:31,050
Let's do that now and search for texture coordinates REO texture coordinates pressed enter and it's

40
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:38,930
added that in and over on the left hand side you can see material updating that's because we've got

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,920
live preview turned on.

42
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:47,820
So it will compile the material and we can see here we've got the you tiling and the v tiling.

43
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,110
That's pretty awesome.

44
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,480
So what happens if we set this to five and five.

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,610
What what effect does a bigger number create.

46
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,490
We have to wait.

47
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,110
Oh look smaller brickwork.

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,490
Okay so now if we go ahead and save that what does that mean.

49
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:09,190
Well it's going to compile the material and save it and then we just have to wait for a while to for

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,120
it to be updated.

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,950
Brilliant.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,870
Now let's have a look at our stone floor material instance.

53
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,580
Nothing's changed there.

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,530
Let's go over to our world.

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:17,990
Oh.

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,390
Oh dear.

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,230
Look at the wall has gone all small.

58
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,810
So this is an example where we modify our original material.

59
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,490
We don't have any independent control.

60
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:36,860
The wall material the floor eventually that stick the stone floor on the floor.

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,490
And of course we've got the same material applied to the door frame and unfortunately it's changed all

62
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:48,790
of them so that's not the way forward and we certainly don't want to create tons of just the same material

63
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,950
but scaled differently that would be silly because we'd have to wait for it to update you saw how slow

64
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,010
it was every time we made the change it had to compile.

65
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:04,720
Well let's expose our first parameter so the type of parameter we want to expose is a scalar parameter

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,590
so another way of adding a node in like this texture coordinate node is just by right clicking and we

67
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,700
want scalar the SC A L and then we go parameters scalar parameter.

68
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,480
So it's just gonna be a number and we can call this text just scale.

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,470
And if you have a look over in the details of this case in the lower left we have a default value.

70
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,760
I'm going to set that default value to 1 and look that preview just disappears.

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,010
Now that's not annoying me at all.

72
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,060
I'd rather that actually be there.

73
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,370
So I can see what's going on but I just want to highlight how slow that is because when we start playing

74
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,750
with the material instance in the moment you see how much quicker that is.

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,840
Right.

76
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,650
How do we join these two things together.

77
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,750
We're going to need to multiply node so I'm going to right click in the middle of nowhere this time

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,520
and create a multiplying node.

79
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,390
So M you LTE I multiply that we go.

80
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,330
Now I need to join this together.

81
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,640
Now we don't have to disconnect this one go from the texture corner to the text to samples it will automatically

82
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,970
disappear the moment we plug something else into that socket like so which is pretty awesome.

83
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,430
However if we did want to remove this one manually we could hold down the old key while we clicked and

84
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,180
that all unconnected the sockets from one another.

85
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:30,230
So we're going to multiply our texture coordinates by our text to scale and then we can plug that into

86
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,340
the movies.

87
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,580
Now with the texture scale being 1 in this particular case we should have it looking exactly the same

88
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,020
as it was before.

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,870
But we do need to go back to attach coordinates and set that back to one as well on both for you and

90
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,890
the V.

91
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,870
Remember you a V is just a x and y of our texture itself.

92
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,640
If you imagine an image which is essentially what this texture is.

93
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,830
I'm going to save my material.

94
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:04,730
Now when we go to our stone floor we'll see that the texture scale is an exposed parameter.

95
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,300
Now let's go back over to building escape.

96
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,820
Excellent.

97
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:15,710
So everything's reset itself and the floor itself looks like the walls now are going to detach my stone

98
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,840
floor instance at the top here so that we can see it next to this.

99
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,130
In fact we may be able to dock it.

100
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,580
Is it going to allow me to dock this anywhere else.

101
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,470
Unfortunately not for the moment maybe up here next to the world outline to make sure we've got our

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,320
tab.

103
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,940
Now it's not allowing me to dock.

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,100
That's a shame.

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,340
OK.

106
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,780
So with the stone floor just detached here I'm going to put a tick in the text just scale.

107
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,910
That's our parameters name.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,390
Let's just make this a little bit bigger.

109
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,850
Look texture scale and we get texture scale currently at 1 but the great thing here is I can click and

110
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,830
slide and look at that.

111
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,480
So lower values make it larger and higher values make it smaller.

112
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,870
But look how much quicker that is updating.

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,050
Now if you push it negative it is going to invert the image not in its color but it's going to flip

114
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,470
it round.

115
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,460
So what was the top left will become the bottom right.

116
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,520
And so forth.

117
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,880
So going from one down to zero makes it larger and going higher makes it smaller.

118
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,830
So that is amazing how much quicker that is when I said that 2.5 for the moment no I think points to

119
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,370
make.

120
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:30,080
So these are nice large floor slabs now but then not quite square I want them to be square.

121
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,340
How do we go ahead and do that.

122
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,890
Well let's to save are instance there and slot it back at the top there.

123
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:44,120
Currently we've only got one parameter so we're only scaling the U.N. v coordinates by the same amount

124
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,990
each time we want them to be scaled differently.

125
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,000
How do we go ahead and do that well back over to the main material and instead of just the texture scale

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,970
here let's have two parameters.

127
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,610
Now instead of going ahead and creating a new scalar parameter I'm just going to go control and see

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,810
and then control them v it'll create a new scalar parameter that's called texture scale but that's no

129
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,300
good we need to have a unique name.

130
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:16,790
So I'm going to click on the top texture scale go to the details tab and call this the you texture scale

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,260
click on the next one and call this one the V texture scale.

132
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,800
Now the good thing about making sure that I've copied it.

133
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,350
In this case is it will inherit the default value I've already set up.

134
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:36,290
Now that's just one parameter in this particular case but in a more complex environment you may want

135
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,390
to make sure that you copy it.

136
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:45,080
Now we're going to keep the rest of the notes sets up here but we've got to join the EU and the v coordinates

137
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,340
together how are we going to do that.

138
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:55,010
Well what we want to do is add in an append node I'm going to go through the last way of adding something

139
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,300
here.

140
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,440
Over on the right hand side you've got a pallet with everything we possibly could have.

141
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:06,410
And I'm going to type in append and we want the top one here append vector and we can just drag that

142
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,280
into our scene.

143
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:19,400
I'm going to connect a M B to you and V and then this output into the B of the multiplier.

144
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:27,320
Now hopefully what this will enable us to do is now we should be able to save our material go over to

145
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,330
our stone floor and it will now be updated hopefully.

146
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,550
Let's just wait for a second.

147
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,370
There we go.

148
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,000
The you texture and the v texture scale and look it does look stretched here at the moment.

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,300
And if we scale that up we can see we can scale the horizontal and the vertical scaling independently

150
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,130
from one another.

151
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,010
That is brilliant.

152
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,270
That's exactly what we want.

153
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,170
But this sphere isn't particularly representative of the floor or brickwork.

154
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,940
It's a great way of demonstrating a particular surface.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,030
However down at the lower right we have some previews.

156
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,430
I just want a plane at this point.

157
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,560
Now you may end up with a view that looks like this which is no good.

158
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,250
I hear you say well that's because we've got a few issues here.

159
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,400
We've got black face coming so we actually need to look at it from this side.

160
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,320
Now this is something that will flummox some people so left click here.

161
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,220
We'll rotate around right click.

162
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,750
We'll zoom in and out.

163
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,930
So it's a slightly different view control than before but this on a plane is going to give us a much

164
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,990
better appreciation about what's going on.

165
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,610
And to pan around you can use the middle mouse button.

166
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,530
Okay.

167
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,150
Now I'm not sure what I need here so I'm going to zoom in with the middle mouse button.

168
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,530
Okay.

169
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,290
Let's make it square so let's lower this down.

170
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,990
Oh no.

171
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,450
We need to raise that up.

172
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,670
But we know that at the moment with it like this.

173
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:54,940
Mm hmm.

174
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,760
You know what.

175
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,190
Just looking at it here I'm going to detach the stone floor again so we get the general scale right.

176
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,010
Because that's not right that we know we were down at point to point a point to before.

177
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,280
Yes about point two.

178
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,160
So let's look down at the floor and zoom out here.

179
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,280
In fact he is not going to be such a great representation for us.

180
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,850
So this looks like it needs to be scaled vertically or horizontally.

181
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm going to scale it horizontally maybe point three by point so no that's too fast.

182
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,720
Maybe point two five.

183
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,770
Now that looks about right.

184
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,420
Look at that.

185
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,350
Perfect.

186
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,150
And of course you can tweak it by clicking and holding and just racking so maybe a little lower.

187
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,080
I think I might have stretch that out a little bit too far.

188
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,860
You know it's very difficult to get it right.

189
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,020
I think around there and I could tweak this all day to be honest right.

190
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,700
There we go.

191
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,690
That's the floor.

192
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,230
All done.

193
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,840
And the great thing here I can save and close down the stone floor material instance.

194
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:07,480
The great thing here is this is a shared texture so anything we do to change this material here.

195
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,060
Now bearing in mind we only have a color on this material at the moment which looks like this stone

196
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,610
if we were to go ahead and add a normal map ambient occlusion and all the other possibilities that we

197
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:24,520
can put on here the wall and the floor and the doorframe will all inherits it straight away.

198
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,850
And that's the power of material instances.

199
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:34,420
OK time for your challenge and your challenge is I'd like you to finish texturing your test level.

200
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,760
So just throw another texture on there perhaps use the wooden door that we've already got and apply

201
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,720
it to the ceiling and then stretch it out because I think that's also not square.

202
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,470
So you'll be able to copy and paste from one node setup to another that's something I'd like you to

203
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,200
try to texture the rest of your test level.

204
00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:01,570
Use only the one texture and scale appropriately for the objects you applying it to and in my case that's

205
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,260
going to be the ceiling at this point in time.

206
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,910
So go ahead pause video now and give that a go

207
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,420
okay.

208
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,550
Everybody welcome back.

209
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,950
Let's go ahead and finalize all texturing Okay so it's just the ceiling at the moment.

210
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,540
I'm going to give ourselves a wooden ceiling so we've got the texture already applied to the door which

211
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,500
is great.

212
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,560
Let's bring this up slightly we've got our dorm material and our metal wood which is the base material

213
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,690
we're starting to get these asterisks on all of our materials and one of our models here.

214
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,520
I'm just going to highlight all of my stuff making sure of course I've selected something down here

215
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,390
first right click and I'm just gonna go save to make sure that everything is in fact saved.

216
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:51,060
Okay now the broken concrete is a material that came in as part of the naming structure part of the

217
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,320
materials that were added to the door frame itself.

218
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,870
Now because I'm not using that it's brought it in.

219
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,960
Is a dead material.

220
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm going to kill that by deleting it now because I'm deleting it and it's not attached to anything.

221
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,770
It's not referenced anywhere.

222
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,020
We don't get any warning that it is referenced elsewhere in our project.

223
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,080
So I can go ahead and delete it nice and safely.

224
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,940
Okay.

225
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,460
I'm also going to delete my sample queue.

226
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,840
I don't need it in my scene.

227
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,130
It's not in my safe and all it's doing is cluttering up my view.

228
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,040
Okay I'm now going to create a new folder and I'm going to call it materials and I'm going to create

229
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,280
another one called textures.

230
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:37,100
No I'm going to call this materials and textures materials and textures.

231
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,910
Excellent.

232
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,290
And then we've got our models separate from everything else.

233
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,550
We're gonna move them there not take a copy.

234
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,160
It's gonna take a while to move.

235
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,560
There we go.

236
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,000
So materials and textures we've got the door material that's the one I'm going to share something with.

237
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:57,380
Take an instance of the metal would create a material instance and cool this sealing for the moment

238
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,400
because I spell selling it will do.

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,020
And let's slap it to the ceiling.

240
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,270
Oh did I miss it make sure we aim it correctly.

241
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,370
There we go.

242
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,990
And it's not quite the right shape at the moment.

243
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:21,510
Now this is where we can go into our stone material and grab this node group here.

244
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm going to copy that and then you'll go back to building escape and open up the metal Woods.

245
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,770
The source material that's opened up on another screen let me bring that down.

246
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:41,460
Let's zoom out with the scroll will pull this across and paste that in so that's a very quick way or

247
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:49,990
miss the socket there click away try and reconnect it and save so it is really useful if you've got

248
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,520
a node sets up like that that you can just copy and paste it to the next node available which is brilliant

249
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,400
that's now done.

250
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,280
But we do need to remember.

251
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,240
Let's just close those two down.

252
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,830
Yes we do want to save any changes that we've made.

253
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:12,490
And then with the sealing here when we go to it we need to make sure let's just bring it down so we

254
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,680
can see what's going on that we put a tick in these two boxes.

255
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,440
Otherwise we won't be able to scale it accordingly.

256
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,800
Now I want to go four point five to begin with.

257
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,010
So it's bigger.

258
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:32,630
And then what do we need to do here we need to increase this or increase the you or decrease the V.

259
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,010
Something that go with point five there and try.

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,920
Point four here which is I get that the wrong way round point two.

261
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,580
Yes I got about the wrong way round.

262
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,730
Silly me right.

263
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,020
Let's go back to point three here.

264
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,450
Let's try.

265
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:54,350
Point three and point so hole pretty much spot on but I confess I think I could do with just a tiny

266
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,780
bit more tweaking.

267
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,290
There we go.

268
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,780
That's looking pretty square to me.

269
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,630
Okay.

270
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:06,130
Now you could spend the time lining everything up with the ceiling in the corners but going back to

271
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,270
just remembering that this itself is a test level it does not have to be perfect it just has to be representative

272
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:21,390
to be quite honest trying to match the ceiling perfectly is going to be a real challenge to do.

273
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,450
And this is not really the place to do it.

274
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:30,800
You need to even do it in blender or another 3D editing package with the movies there and you can manipulate

275
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,680
them and fit them exactly to whatever the ceiling would be which uses be a squashed cube essentially.

276
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,240
But there we go.

277
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,800
My level is now all textured and quite happy with how it's working out.

278
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,170
We've got a couple of lights or a couple of spotlights in the corners look really nice looking forward

279
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,460
seeing how you've textured your level and also the textures you've used.

280
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:59,360
Now this is obviously just two textures in here and this yellowy brass knob on the door itself.

281
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,770
So this is a really simplistic setup.

282
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,920
I'll be really interested to see if you've gone the extra mile and included extra textures especially

283
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,230
as we progressed through and create create more of our level.

284
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,040
So do share your work over in the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
