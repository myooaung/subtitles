00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.130
Hello everybody and welcome.

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.000
We're going to dive straight into a challenge.

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.250
I'd like you to go ahead and close the doors.

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.740
Now what do I mean by that.

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.890
Well I'd like you to go ahead and create the necessary code to close the door when you've done that.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.470
The doors should be closed whenever the player is not in the trigger volume.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.750
There are there are a couple of ways that you could go ahead and do this at the moment.

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.420
I would suggest trying to remain with the initial your as being the starting point of whether it is

9
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.360
opening or closing doesn't matter which one.

10
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.230
However if you wanted to have different angles for open and shut then of course you may want to consider

11
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.430
separating that out.

12
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.570
That's entirely up to you.

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.320
I'm going to keep mine relatively simple.

14
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.760
So go ahead Paul's video now and give us a go OK.

15
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.580
Everybody welcome back.

16
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.210
Let's go ahead now and create the code needed to close the doors.

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.430
OK so back over MVS code let's have a look at how open door because that is essentially going to be

18
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.680
a mirror almost for what's going to happen with closed door.

19
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.190
So despite what I'd usually warn people against with copying and pasting code when it comes to open

20
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:26.650
door and its similarities to closed door I think we can be excused by copying this chunk of code and

21
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.890
repeating it further down and changing the closed door.

22
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.590
Now this won't work straightaway.

23
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.510
There are going to be some other things that we need to do.

24
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.890
However that's a good start.

25
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.540
Okay.

26
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.020
So we've got that there we need to call closed or somewhere.

27
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.790
And we also need to add it to our header file so we've got our open door on line 26.

28
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:57.170
So let's go ahead and once again I'm going to just copy that and change open door to closed door.

29
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.770
So there we go.

30
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.020
Those are those two things done and dusted.

31
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.810
Where are we going to call this.

32
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.300
Well in this statement we say that if something is on our pressure plates then we want to open the door

33
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.720
and we could say else closed door.

34
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.420
I think that would be that would be fair enough.

35
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.800
But there is going to be a bit more code needed in order to for that to work.

36
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.260
Let's go see what happens at the moment.

37
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.610
If we go ahead and do this now because closed door is exactly the same as open door or we need to pass

38
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.330
delta time in the course because closed door and open door are the same at the moment.

39
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.240
There's going to be no difference.

40
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.300
But instead of going to a target you're which is really an open angle I'm thinking of changing target

41
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.320
your to open angle to be a bit more descriptive.

42
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.360
But instead of going to the target you're we're going to go to the initial your.

43
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.160
Let's say that and see what happens here.

44
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.800
In fact I'm also going to make the door close significantly quicker.

45
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.200
I'm going to make it close twice as fast or at least that's probably going to be more than twice as

46
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.700
fast.

47
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.990
Anyway let's go ahead save our work go over into unreal click compile.

48
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.340
OK.

49
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.280
The compile is complete.

50
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.810
Let's go ahead and press play.

51
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.400
Let's see what happens here so we're gonna walk into the corner.

52
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.060
Our doors open and when we go away they don't do anything.

53
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.350
Okay.

54
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.000
So what are we missing there.

55
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.970
I'm just going to compile again in case that didn't work.

56
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.690
I'm pretty sure my code closed door.

57
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.270
We're going to close or Yep that should be working.

58
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.260
Let's just hope it does now.

59
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.490
OK.

60
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.210
The compiles complete let's play go back.

61
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.630
Okay.

62
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.270
Doors opening and doors shutting.

63
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.610
Okay perfect.

64
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.080
So now we're in a position with that door opening.

65
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.460
Let's see if we can make it out of the room.

66
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.580
Go go go go go.

67
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.830
Okay so we've got the perfect trap at the moment and we really need to play test this.

68
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.940
That's the key thing here.

69
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.180
So there were a couple of ways in which we can go ahead and start altering this particular value.

70
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.600
So we have a look in our code we can change how quickly it's shutting and in fact you may want to expose

71
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.080
these as parameters that the game designer can fiddle with.

72
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.350
However it would be better if we could just hold the door open for so many seconds so that these values

73
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.720
don't have to be tweaked depending on the size of your room.

74
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.750
It'd be silly to have the door open and shuts at different rates just because of the distance you are

75
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.490
from it.

76
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.230
It makes more sense that the door is held open for a certain number of time.

77
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.120
And this is really the open door and closed door is really basically the animation working through code.

78
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.220
OK.

79
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.720
So that's what we're going to focus on in the next lecture and I'll see you over there.
