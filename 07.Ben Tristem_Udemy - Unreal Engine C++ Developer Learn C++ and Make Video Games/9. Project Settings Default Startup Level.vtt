Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.290
A real quick one for you.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.690
But I know some of you will get this.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.030
And if you're working on multiple levels and you want to open up on a default one it can be quite infuriating

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.710
having to do that every single time.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.140
So what you can do is obviously go to your content browser as I've been doing and double click on the

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.710
level you want to load up.

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.310
Great.

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.300
Now because we're only really working in the one level the best thing we can do is just by default open

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.890
up that level.

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.000
So instead of having to do this what we can do is go up to edit and then go to the project settings

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.860
we go to the project settings we'll have this option on the left hand side there's a lot here but we

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.380
have this option to go to maps and modes.

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.250
We click on that.

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.000
We've got two options with the default start map.

16
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.620
Now we will revisit the project setting several times throughout this course as we need to change things

17
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.040
rather than go into a deep dive of everything that's in here.

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.710
Let's use them when we need to use them.

19
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.850
So here we go.

20
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.630
We've got the editor startup map so all I can do here is go ahead and select the building escape.

21
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.680
Now whenever I open up my project it will open up on the building escape level rather than just the

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.720
plain default level that I have been opening up on.

23
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.150
OK so let's test that now.

24
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.180
OK.

25
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.200
Open up building escape and there we go.

26
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.510
It loads up our building escape level.

27
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.360
So that's how you go ahead and change that's over in your project settings.

28
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.310
And we will revisit that ASM when we need to.

29
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.690
I hope you find that helpful.

30
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.790
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
