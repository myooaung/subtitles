00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.700
Hello and welcome and this lecture.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.110
Something somewhat overdue.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.080
We are going to have a cross-hair in our game which will allow us to heasley to Amy.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.760
We're also going to remove that cross-hair, which is part of a hot general hejab display that we have.

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.330
And we're going to be able to remove that when we're displaying our lose or win.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.960
Why?

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.170
Let's dive in and see how that happens.

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:32.150
So we'd like some UI to be in our world to show us how much health we've got, but also to give us a

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.040
reticule because at the moment or reticule or cross-hair, because at the moment when we're trying to

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.800
shoot at someone, it's really hard to do without that reference point.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.440
So we're gonna go over to you.

12
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.090
I fold up against right.

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.470
Click in here to create a new user interface widget elements and we're gonna be a WCP prefix and just

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.870
McCoole HQ D for heads up display.

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.200
Now go ahead and open that up.

16
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.980
I'm going to go ahead and create first of all I cross ham and you could do this with a cross-hair graphics

17
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.970
if you've got one.

18
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.950
So you could use the image component there or what I'm gonna do is just gonna add in text components

19
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.690
and I'm going to put in a plus sign.

20
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.570
And that's gonna be my cross-hair.

21
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.270
Quite simple, really easy to prototype with.

22
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.040
So what I'm going to then do is align my text so that it's justified to the center.

23
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.860
Then I'm going to go up to the slot canvas panel area and I'm going to check size to content like so

24
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.500
so that everything is nice and tight around that cross-hair.

25
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.710
Then I'm going to set up my alignment to be point five and point five.

26
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.720
So that we're lining it to the center of that cross-hair.

27
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.300
And then finally, we want to set up an anchor.

28
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.540
So we're using the centering default.

29
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.910
And then I'm going to set up my position to zero zero so that cross-hair is right smack bang in the

30
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.240
middle.

31
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.950
We don't change the color to red.

32
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.450
So that's nice and easily visible.

33
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.620
There's a cross-hair there.

34
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.000
And maybe I'm also going to increase the size of that cross-hair a little bit.

35
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.830
Let's play see how that feels.

36
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.190
One problem we aren't actually seeing at this cross-hair in the world so that I'm going to have as a

37
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.270
challenge for you, because it is stuff that we've done before in our player controller.

38
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.730
We've created widgets and we've added them to the viewport.

39
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.230
And I want you to do the same again to spawn some heads up display UI.

40
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.020
You're going to add on the player controller begin place and can have to go ahead and add to begin play

41
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.310
to your player controller.

42
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.220
Add configuration to the header file so that you can configure the widget blueprint that you want to

43
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.720
use for the heads up display.

44
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.670
You need to spawner added to the viewport.

45
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.690
Again, this code for that in the play controller that you can borrow from and then you're going to

46
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.550
configure in your blueprint which class that it should be spawning.

47
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.490
So pause video and have a go at the challenge.

48
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.210
Hey, welcome back.

49
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.970
So let's give this a shot, shall we?

50
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.790
Over in the header file for the shooter, player, controller, you can see we've got this setup for

51
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.730
our windscreen Lou's screen and it just above these two.

52
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.240
Well, I want to do is add in a new one, which is going to be at H, you D or HUD class.

53
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.310
So we're gonna have it as a T subclass of the you use a widget.

54
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.240
Then we're going to have to add in our begin play for that.

55
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.800
I'm going to go over to the Gundotra H and copy the declaration from there and take it over to our shooter

56
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.300
player controller Dot H.

57
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.800
And add in the protected section as well.

58
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.580
And go and implement begin play.

59
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.390
And remembering that in begin play we must call to super begin play.

60
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.180
Otherwise things aren't going to work properly.

61
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.580
And finally, I'm going to move this begin play above.

62
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.680
Our game has ended as logically.

63
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.330
That is the order things will happen in.

64
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.450
Then next up, we're going to have to set up the widget well, for that, it's going to be pretty straightforward

65
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.010
because it's going to be exactly the same steps as we've done for setting up the windscreen and the

66
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.570
loose screen are going to copy that over into begin play.

67
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.110
And we're going to give this a shot, basically, instead of using the windscreen class, going to use

68
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.400
the HD class.

69
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.710
And instead of creating a windscreen here, what we're going to do is create a h.

70
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.030
U.

71
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.700
D.

72
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.620
So that's what I'm just gonna call HD.

73
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.420
In all these cases, if HD is not null, then we're going to add it to the viewport.

74
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.210
Let's go over to the editor, compile and see if we can now configure things over in our player controller.

75
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.440
So I'm going to go and open up the BP Chuter player controller.

76
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.320
Open up the full blueprint editor here.

77
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.820
And once your compilation is finished, you should see the HUD class pop in as a variable we can set

78
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.300
at the top.

79
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.800
Right.

80
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.200
So if we click that dropdown, you can see WP, HUD.

81
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.430
That's when we want to select.

82
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.780
Let's go ahead and hit play.

83
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.270
And sure enough, we now have a big, massive Red Cross here, probably too big showing up in our screen.

84
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.750
So let's go and make that for a slightly smaller font, maybe around 47 or something like that.

85
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.370
Go and hit play now.

86
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.710
And that's about.

87
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.090
Decent sized cross has still a little big, in my opinion.

88
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.640
So I'm going to bring that down to about 30.

89
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.040
Try that out.

90
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.800
Yes, that makes sense, too.

91
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.270
Mike.

92
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.470
We're shooting through the center of the screen, then the next thing you'll notice is that if we go

93
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.450
and give our rifle damage again.

94
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.400
So I'm going to go over, open up its full blueprint.

95
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.770
Ed sets damage to 50 so that it kills us off quickly and go and hit play.

96
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.960
Is that we get killed.

97
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.910
Crosshair stays there.

98
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.100
So we want to be able to remove the crosshair.

99
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.830
Now, fortunately, removing is fairly easy because this is all inside the player controller class and

100
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.660
we already get game is ended here.

101
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.590
Well, we want to do is basically remove that HUD from the viewport, whether or not we are the winner

102
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.140
because we're replacing it with other UI here.

103
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.180
However, we can't get hold of that HUD widget that we've created because we created it here and begin

104
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.510
playing.

105
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.380
We didn't save it anyway.

106
00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.840
So over in the head of file, I'm going to create a new private variable down near the bottom here.

107
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.800
That is going to be a you use a widget, HUD.

108
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.250
So it's a private variable that we're going to set and begin place.

109
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.960
I'm just gonna remove the type from there, which is going to make sure that we're setting the variable

110
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:20.550
against the class, which then means that we should have access to that variable over in our game has

111
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.060
ended.

112
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.940
I just noticed that I added the HUD unfortunate to the game and to the gun header rather than the shooter

113
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.610
player controller header, which is actually what I wanted to do.

114
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.830
So now if we go and have a look at game has ended at just before the if statement, I want to remove

115
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.330
it from the viewport so we can do HUD, which we now have access to.

116
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.690
Arrow remove from viewport, which is just going to make it invisible.

117
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.990
Let's go over to the engine and compile and try it out.

118
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.290
And once it's finished compiling, let's hit play, get ourselves killed.

119
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.630
And sure enough, we've got our HUD disappearing there.

120
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.270
Once we restart the level, it will reappear because Begin gets called again.

121
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.300
So that's it for this lecture.

122
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.950
In the next batch, we're gonna set up the actual health balls on our HUD as well as that cross-hair.

123
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.820
But you can see we started to pay off dividends for managing our UI within the player controller.

124
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.790
Because now when we've added more UI that the player controller also manages, it's able to jostle between

125
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.430
those two.

126
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.220
UI is in one class.
