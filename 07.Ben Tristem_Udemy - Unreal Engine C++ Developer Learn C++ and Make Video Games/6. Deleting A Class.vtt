Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.220
In this lecture I'd like to have a closer look at deleting a class is not as straightforward as going

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.300
down into your content browser and trying to delete it.

4
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:22.270
Now you may have noticed the eagle eyed amongst you that I have this position in world component as

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.990
well.

6
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.020
That was me just doing a bit of testing before and I inadvertently forgot to delete it or I thought

7
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.510
I had but it was still there.

8
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.930
I got caught out in the same way you guys are going to get caught out yourself.

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.070
So let's run through the process of making sure that the position in world in my case here is deleted.

10
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.510
Now you you probably don't have something that you need to delete at the moment.

11
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.880
If not just carry on watching and I can guarantee at some point you will do.

12
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.420
In which case this will become incredibly useful.

13
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.530
Now the first thing is here to make sure that it is not a component of any of your objects.

14
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.340
Now this can be quite onerous.

15
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.020
However in this particular case I don't have it on any of my two objects that I've attached anything

16
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.880
to in the scene.

17
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.400
So that's absolutely fine there.

18
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.270
Now one thing I would mention at this point is if you don't do that when you try and delete it it will

19
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.850
still be there when you open unreal back up.

20
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.570
And even after you redo V.S. code even though everything else to do with it won't exist anymore.

21
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.210
So first of all make sure that none of your actors have that component on it.

22
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.030
Then we can go ahead and we can't delete it from here.

23
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.330
But what we can do is go over into the file browser and start deleting things there.

24
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.260
So I'm gonna close down on real now.

25
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.500
After saving my work and I'm going to go now to where I have my building escape project.

26
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.680
Now there are a couple of things that we need to do here The first is to go into the source folder find

27
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.910
the Oh I've gone too far.

28
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.680
No I haven't position in world and position in world CBP.

29
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.570
Both of these need deleting.

30
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.590
So I'll go ahead and do that now.

31
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.250
So if that's out of the way the next thing I need to do is go to the building escape folder.

32
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.530
Okay.

33
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.430
So now we're in this area we can delete the binaries folder.

34
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.080
That's one of those derived folders.

35
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.900
We don't need to save anything here but now that with delete that we can go ahead and relaunch unreal.

36
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.550
Excellent.

37
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.580
Now once this is launching onto the project manager we can open up our building escape again.

38
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.280
And you may see this a message.

39
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.870
He certainly will when we deleted the binaries.

40
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.170
And then after a few moments when the level reloads we should see that we no longer have our position

41
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.020
in world class.

42
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.730
There we go the binaries has just been rebuilt.

43
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.100
We can see that there and there we go.

44
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.820
We no longer have a position in world there.

45
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.670
Now one thing that you'll notice is also the sphere and the cube have gone.

46
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.230
That's because at the moment I'm viewing an untitled level.

47
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.890
What I'm gonna do here is go to my content folder and double click on building escape just to load that

48
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.910
level up.

49
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.570
And there we go.

50
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.280
This should have our components on it.

51
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.510
Our well position here and our world position there as well.

52
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.530
Perfect.

53
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.030
Okay.

54
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.710
So there is one final thing to do now that all of that is sorted and is to refresh the Visual Studio

55
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.580
code projects.

56
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.260
So let's do that now.

57
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.830
Excellent.

58
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.040
And when we go ahead and open Visual Studio code what we should then find if the file explorer is open

59
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.860
which is perfect we no longer have our position in world here as well.

60
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.700
There we go.

61
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.950
So this is one of these moments that is a bit of a head scratcher when you first come across it but

62
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.380
being able to delete a class if you've missed.

63
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.130
Name something if something needs to be removed you now know how to do it.

64
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.480
So if you've got any questions with that please reach out.

65
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.670
In the discussions and I'll see you all in the next lecture.
