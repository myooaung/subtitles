00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,380
Hello everybody and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:12,740
In this lecture we're going to create our own array a list of words that we can pick a hidden word from.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,300
Now we've talked about and looked at the tea array before when we were talking about the individual

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,420
characters that make up strings.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,270
Now when it comes to a tea array it's got a certain format to it.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,740
We'll run through it and then do an example MVS code.

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,630
So we have a concert t array and then we define its type.

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,060
Then we give it a name and then we need to make sure that the array contains something you can't have

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,280
an array that doesn't contain anything.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,880
So then we open our curly braces and we put elements into that array that match the type that we've

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,990
declared.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,000
And those elements have to be the same type that you've declared.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,420
And there's no mixing or matching of types a t array only holds one type.

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:06,410
Anything that you give it must be that type or directly implicitly convertible to that type as well

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,030
so that's the theory part's over let's dive over into V.S. code and take a closer look okay.

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,010
So overinvest code the first thing that I'm going to do is actually create a new file where we're going

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,010
to keep all of our words.

18
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:26,830
So let's go ahead and go to file new file and we're going to save it straightaway so we can reference

19
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,070
it.

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:27,960
So here we go.

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:35,890
We can save as well we could pick save leave it in the same place and let's call it hidden word list

22
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,710
dot H.

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,920
It's gonna become a header file.

24
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,150
It's a separate file.

25
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,800
There's no point put in all of those words so that could be the hidden word in the code that we're running.

26
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,920
Now this not only makes our code a lot easier to read because otherwise it's adding a lot of noise into

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,960
the code and it does of course allow us to swap out the words that we're using quite quickly because

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,970
they're all within one file.

29
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,260
So go ahead and save that.

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,440
And we've got our new hidden word list had a file.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,860
Now before we do anything else we cannot just type in at the moment.

32
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,560
Well let's try.

33
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,020
If I type in t array it doesn't know what we're talking about.

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,090
So we need to make sure we include the minimal requirements in order to do that.

35
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,300
So we hash include and then open quotation marks.

36
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,130
Call is it going to give it says on the list.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,910
Yes here we go.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,300
Call minimal dot H and what that's going to allow us to do is type in things like t array.

39
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,910
There we go it's right there.

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,470
Okay.

41
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,210
So first of all it's going to be a const T array.

42
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,220
And why is it const.

43
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,800
Well in this particular case we need to make sure that our array and the elements within that array

44
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,870
are not going to change.

45
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,080
We don't want that to happen with way through it protects us.

46
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,080
So the concert there make sure that we're not going to break that promise.

47
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,200
Now we need to give it a type.

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,050
We need to say what does this array contain.

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:05,410
For this example we can fill it with integers and because it's in 32 I think a good name will be numbers

50
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,930
we could call it integers as well as entirely up to you.

51
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,630
And then we need to put some values and we can't just leave it like that.

52
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,250
So we need to open up some curly braces and let's say one comet to come a three Come a four so we can

53
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,560
separate our elements of our array with commas.

54
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:29,080
Now I would also space these out to make it more readable and of course we need our semicolon on the

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,730
end.

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,510
So this here is an array.

57
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:38,010
It's called four integers in it and just like before we need to access individual elements of the array

58
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,350
we would access index zero to access element one of our array.

59
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,880
Much like we've been doing when we've been checking letters of the word against one another.

60
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,120
Now when it comes to formatting this if we had words in here instead that would be slightly different

61
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,950
I would formats it's like so.

62
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,730
So I'd make sure that these were on their own line and this probably indented back like so.

63
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,170
And then each word I would probably put that on its own line as well just for readability because you're

64
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,360
going to have things like the text Grover.

65
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,270
So is going to be very difficult to read if they stretch along the screen will end up scrolling horizontally

66
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,710
which is not what we want to do.

67
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,340
Okay.

68
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:30,790
So that's a great stance with arrays and this leads us nicely onto our challenge OK so your challenge

69
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,790
is going to be to create a hidden word list now include the hidden word list or h the header file that

70
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,140
we've just made in the bull cow cartridge.

71
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,420
Include five words for testing.

72
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,320
And remember that the text macro is required.

73
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,990
Now don't worry at the moment about a bigger list to choose from.

74
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,380
This would be great for testing and what we will do in the next lecture is show you some advanced B.S.

75
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,300
code cursor manipulation so you can handle lots of elements.

76
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,110
Say we go in grab a word list from the internet and just cut and paste it in.

77
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,840
We need to be able to quickly wrap things in our text macro etc. supposedly are now and give that a

78
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,130
go

79
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,550
Okay everybody Welcome back.

80
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,860
Let's go ahead now and create a hidden word list of five words.

81
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,190
Okay everybody Welcome back.

82
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:28,330
The first thing I'm going to do here is just change this from an int 32 to f strings.

83
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,180
That's important.

84
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,290
Otherwise it's not gonna work numbers.

85
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,110
That's not a very good name is it.

86
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,540
What should we call it instead.

87
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,970
We could call it words.

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,800
It's as simple as that.

89
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,920
And then of course we've got a series of numbers here that won't work.

90
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,740
So we need to have text open our parentheses.

91
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,160
And then we've got the string that we want to put in here.

92
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,220
So we have cakes as one to write one of our examples to see a k s and then.

93
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,020
Well do I want to keep typing text and then adding things in.

94
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,160
The answer is no.

95
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,180
So I am going to copy this a couple of times.

96
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:16,030
One two three four so that will take us up to five and it's happily indented when I didn't want to.

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,510
So shift and tab to bring them back 1.

98
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,160
Now we don't need the comma on the end there that will fail if we do that.

99
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:30,200
So let's think of our five words we can have cakes we can have water I'm going to stick with five letters

100
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,930
I think for the moment we can have plums kings and knife.

101
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,500
So those are going to be my head and words check in there all I saw grams.

102
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,800
Is quite hard to think of ice grams.

103
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,020
I wanted to put apple in there and thought No I can't do that in bubble and now you can't do anything

104
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,300
that's got repeating letters.

105
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,060
So that's fine.

106
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,170
We got everything set up there.

107
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:57,670
I'm going to make sure I save that and we do need to include it in the bull cow cartridge CBP farm.

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,190
So I have the top here we've got hash include bull cow cartridge H.

109
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:09,920
So hopefully you guys did not have any issues going on including the hidden word list the H.

110
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,820
Excellent.

111
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,690
And now I think we've got everything sorted perfect.

112
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,120
How did you guys get on.

113
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,750
Did you remember to change the type that's all elements will be in the array.

114
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,580
That's something easy to forget.

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,700
And up the top here make sure you've included your hidden word list the h file.

116
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:35,150
So when we go ahead and pick a hidden word from that list we're able to access it.

117
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,710
Which words did you decide to place in there.

118
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,470
Did you make a mistake like me and think of a couple of non ISO grams.

119
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,340
Make sure you have ISO grams in there.

120
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,960
Otherwise it's not going to work.

121
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,120
And I'll see you all in the next lecture.
