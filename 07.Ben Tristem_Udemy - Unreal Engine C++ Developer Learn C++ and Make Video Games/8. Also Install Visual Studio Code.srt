00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,060
Hi and welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,090
So the engine is going to take some time to download but that's absolutely fine.
2

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,260
We've got plenty to do.
3

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,190
So we are also going to install something called Visual Studio code.
4

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,730
Let me address why we're doing that at this stage in the course.
5

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,780
Well it's a fast free and familiar development environment.
6

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,330
It is supported in Unreal since four point one eight so I'm giving you a sensible alternative.
7

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,370
Importantly for the beginning of this course it's exactly the same on Windows Mac OS and Linux.
8

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:37,190
Otherwise if we demonstrate using a different development environment you're going to need a different
9

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,460
thing on Windows namely Visual Studio community MacOS namely Xcode and Linux namely Well you've got
10

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,780
to go and pick something.
11

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,290
The only thing out there that works on all those platforms that isn't Visual Studio code is something
12

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,470
called CLion not as in the aquatic animal that goes *aw aw* but is in C-L-I-O-N.
13

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,000
But that's not free that software and it's unnecessarily complex for a beginner course like this.
14

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,440
It's also about 10 times smaller to download than Visual Studio community which is a bonus.
15

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,290
But please install both of these things on the same drive.
16

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,580
So if you installed the VS community or Xcode on one drive particular on windows whatever drive you
17

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,280
installed VS community on please install this VS code on the same drive and we can extend this to our
18

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,040
needs later.
19

20
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,160
So we're gonna be using VS code as the demonstration program in the beginning of the course so that
20

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,470
everybody on MAC, PC and Linux can follow along saying the same thing if you already know Visual Studio
21

22
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,460
community or Xcode you can use those too.
22

23
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:30,770
Okay.
23

24
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,860
It's an option for you but if you're unfamiliar and uncomfortable use VS code and we may switch to
24

25
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,700
visual studio community later in the course but a similar program to me starting with the simplest thing.
25

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,190
All right so I'm gonna get you to install VS code but I'm just gonna get you started so that we're
26

27
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,240
in the right place.
27

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,440
Pretty easy really we just go VS code into our favorite search engine and code dot visual studio dot
28

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,590
com is what you want.
29

30
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,060
It should detect your platform if it doesn't you've got options for Windows Mac and Linux both Debian
30

31
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,550
and others for Linux and let's go ahead and download that much smaller download.
31

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,140
As I said then VS community I'm going to run it directly and once that's going we'll get it installed.
32

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,970
So your challenge is simple install VS code get it installed and then once we're in there we're going
33

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,420
to add something called the Microsoft C/C++ extension.
34

35
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,800
Now if you want a challenge and you want to look around VS code yourself before I talk you through
35

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,260
it then try and do that yourself.
36

37
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,470
If you're lost doesn't matter.
37

38
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,520
Just keep watching and I'll show you how to do it in a second but if you can find where extensions are
38

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,430
and find the Microsoft C/C++ extension that's a great little challenge for you and watch on after
39

40
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,980
the challenge for tips and testing.
40

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,970
So pause the video see if you can get VS code in that extension installed now and I'll be back in a moment.
41

42
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,220
OK.
42

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,790
Welcome back.
43

44
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,480
So I am going to accept license agreements and just install VS code.
44

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,370
Now it's in a very similar place on MAC and PC by the way on
45

46
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,230
PC I am going to say open with code action to both of these things.
46

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,780
The windows file explorer context and directory context menus just can be useful.
47

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,510
It's not vital but I'm just gonna do that because it's useful sometimes.
48

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:03,930
All right.
49

50
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,550
So while it installs close the web page in the background Linux people MAC people very similar it's
50

51
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,830
just a straight forward software install.
51

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,550
Okay there's nothing complicated about the initial installation of the VS code may spawn up on Microsoft
52

53
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,260
Web site the getting started document probably worth a look.
53

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,270
And actually on that getting started document look they've given you that one of their top extensions
54

55
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,430
is the C/C++ extension.
55

56
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,790
So if you click that and click install from the website that would be one way of doing it.
56

57
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,070
Right.
57

58
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,470
Windows is asking me if I can switch apps.
58

59
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,960
So that's one way of doing it.
59

60
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,280
I'll show you another way of doing it as well.
60

61
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,390
Either way you end up here which is it the extensions control panel where you click install.
61

62
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,490
Now another way of doing this is to click extensions on the left hand side and just to search for C++
62

63
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,320
and when that comes up you pick this one here make sure it's from Microsoft it should have millions
63

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,250
of downloads.
64

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,260
The actual code of the extension is ms-vscode.cpptools
65

66
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,820
That's the right extension and we install it.
66

67
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,350
What is an extension an extension is something that does exactly what it says it extends the functionality
67

68
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:14,170
of this basic editor for us so that it helps us visualize C++ a little bit better and helps us do a
68

69
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,210
few things within C++.
69

70
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,590
So that's pretty cool.
70

71
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,460
So once that's done you can toggle on and off your extensions thing on the left there.
71

72
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,150
There's a debugger on the left which we're not really using for the moment is something to do with version
72

73
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,930
control on the left.
73

74
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,950
We're not gonna be using that.
74

75
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,760
This is search facility and then there's a file facility.
75

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,270
The thing that we do want open is the file explorer which is the top tab on the left hand side.
76

77
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,650
All right.
77

78
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:41,560
You can agree to any usage data as you wish etc. and we are most of the way there.
78

79
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,320
So it's open now I'm going to give you some survival tips for VS code preferences.
79

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,970
You can get to the color theme if you want a different color theme.
80

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,960
A couple of ways you either go to the cog down the bottom left let me move this so you can see cog down
81

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,140
the bottom left and then color theme.
82

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,440
That's one way of doing it.
83

84
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,390
There is another survival tip which is if you go to view and then command pallete within visual studio
84

85
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,700
view command palette and there is a keyboard shortcut it will bring up something is very rich.
85

86
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,000
It's got a lot of stuff in there.
86

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,250
If we now search we can also get to say the color theme settings from there.
87

88
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,250
So all of the settings in visual studio code are available through view command palette.
88

89
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,390
You want to find anything that's a good place to go it's kind of a tiny little portal into a lot of
89

90
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,270
settings porthole or portal portal I think.
90

91
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:23,730
OK.
91

92
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,970
We also want to tick file auto save to save your sanity.
92

93
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,210
So if we go to the File menu and then auto save and then when you click it again just make sure there's
93

94
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,320
a tick against auto save down here.
94

95
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,450
What that will do is make sure that your files are saving because it's a very common beginning mistake
95

96
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,070
to be writing code and then for them not to be saved to the disk and then to wonder why things are out
96

97
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,460
of sync.
97

98
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,180
So I think auto save is probably a good idea overall.
98

99
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,420
What's the next step.
99

100
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,100
OK.
100

101
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,440
We'll see later I just want you to bear this in mind when you want not only when you're watching my
101

102
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,790
videos but when you're watching Gavin's videos and later Mikey's videos that compiling code is a
102

103
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,780
separate issue to running the code.
103

104
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,740
Okay so the three step process that we are going to go through is we're going to create a code file.
104

105
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,160
We're then going to compile a code file into something the computer can run and then we'll run that
105

106
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,490
code.
106

107
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,550
I just want you to bear in mind the compiling code is separated to running it and as I said earlier VS
107

108
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,840
community or Xcode are optional alternatives for you here now as it happens my epic games launch has
108

109
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,950
finished at this stage those might take a lot less or a lot more time and it wants to make some changes
109

110
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,000
so I'm going to let that go ahead.
110

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,960
This is it installing the engine in the background.
111

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,320
You don't need to be using the engine right now so we can close the Epic Games don't show whatever stage
112

113
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,400
in the course you get to when your engine installs you can close the Epic Games launcher and you're
113

114
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,880
good to go.
114

115
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,350
OK.
115

116
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,240
So Linux and Mac people we are done you should now be able to follow through our basic C++ coding videos
116

117
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,100
in VS code how about  Windows people what I want you to do is close VS code.
117

118
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,540
You only need to do this in windows.
118

119
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:54,290
I want you to go and find your developer command prompt which you search in windows for developer developer
119

120
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,590
for developer command prompt or developer command prompt for VS 2019 open that I would suggest you
120

121
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,090
now pin it for the moment to your taskbar so you've got it available and then what we're gonna do is
121

122
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,220
we're gonna use the command prompt to open VS code rather than opening it from windows and the way you do
122

123
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,810
that is you just type code.
123

124
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,670
So we go to the developer command prompt doesn't matter what's on there and we just hit code.
124

125
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,310
Okay.
125

126
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,740
That'll spawn VS code within Windows.
126

127
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:26,000
The reason we do it that way is that we can now compile our code where is if we didn't open VS
127

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,840
code this way we wouldn't be able to compile our code and that would be a real pain.
128

129
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,440
We can test that that's worked by going to terminal and new terminal.
129

130
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,750
It may come up blankets can be a bit buggy but if you just hit return you get a terminal if you try
130

131
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:46,610
Try typing C L that is the compiler the C++ compiler you should get this Microsoft optimizing C++ compiler
131

132
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,390
version something you can share that version in the community with this if you like and you celebrate
132

133
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:57,080
that you are ready to go this is your sign in windows that you are good to go if you're on MAC and Linux
133

134
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,820
and still watching Die Hard at just trying to see if you can grab any value then on MAC you would have
134

135
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,810
a command MAC and Linux you have a command called a g++.
135

136
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,310
All right but cl is what we need on windows and that tells us the compiler is working.
136

137
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,560
This is how we want to launch coding as a recap.
137

138
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,450
You open the develop a command prompt here and then you type code.
138

139
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,620
Okay simple as that.
139

140
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,590
And then we're in the right context without doing any complicated setup.
140

141
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:21,960
Okay.
141

142
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,500
And the final thing we want to do here on Windows is just to change our default shell from powershell
142

143
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,870
to command and this is so that when we run our programs later they just run without having to mess around
143

144
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,610
with putting top forward slashes and things in so the way you do that if you open your terminal if it's
144

145
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,670
not open already so terminal and new terminal you click where it says powershell and you go to select
145

146
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,340
default shell that is only on windows and then we're going to choose command prompt.
146

147
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:55,220
Okay so we want command prompt to be our default shell let it do any whirly gig its wants to do and when
147

148
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,970
it's finished closed the terminal just open a new terminal and it should say cmd if it does we're
148

149
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,770
all good to go.
149

150
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,470
And then when you come to run your programs later they should run without any fuss.
150

151
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,130
Awesome.
151

152
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,730
We're ready to go.
152

153
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,580
We're ready to start doing basic C++.
153

154
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,030
Thank you very much for bearing with me.
