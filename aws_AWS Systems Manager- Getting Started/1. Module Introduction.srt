00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,890
Hello and welcome back to Pluralsight and this module,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,840
Gaining Insights via AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,740
where we will discover this service and its potential for Globomantics

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,410
to more deeply understand events in the environment and respond to them

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,840
much faster than they were ever able to.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,690
My name is David O'Brien, and in this module,

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,120
we will cover the following topics.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,290
We will introduce AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter and how it can support

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,790
companies like Globomantics that want to leverage as much of AWS's managed

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,580
offerings as possible for the operations teams.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,180
We will then discover the process that integrates

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,480
our AWS account into OpsCenter, how it works,

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,340
and the resources the process creates.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,450
When that is done,

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,300
we will understand what role CloudWatch plays in all of this

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,770
when creating OpsCenter OpsItems and how we can work with

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,280
OpsCenter to create custom rules.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,720
Systems Manager OpsCenter is the one central location

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,550
where operations teams can go to view, investigate,

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,940
and resolve work items.

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,230
Work items are also known as OpsItems in the context of OpsCenter.

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,460
OpsCenter aims to reduce the Mean Time To Resolution,

23
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,280
also known as MTTR,

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,740
by giving deep insights into what happened leading up to an event.

25
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,380
It leverages other AWS services, mainly CloudWatch and CloudWatch events,

26
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,440
but can also leverage Systems Manager Automation runbooks to help

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,170
automatically solve OpsItems and any issues that arose from the

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,710
events that caused the creation of an OpsItem.

29
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,240
These OpsItems are based on events that happen on our AWS

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,240
platform or even inside our applications and are either

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,440
created automatically or manually.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Operations teams can use OpsCenter for investigation and remediation purposes

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:26,000
and integrate into existing case management systems via its public APIs or use OpsCenter for their complete case management.
