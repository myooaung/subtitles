1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,740
We're going to talk about virtual machines or EC2 a lot during this course.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,190
So we will need to take a look at how to onboard EC2

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,910
virtual machines through Systems Manager.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,140
And for that, we need to talk about the SSM Agent.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,940
It's preinstalled pretty much on most Windows and Linux Amazon machine images,

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,540
which are also referred to as AMIs.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,210
But make sure that whatever AMI you're using does have this SSM Agent installed.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,050
If not, don't worry.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,040
It is available as a standalone installer as well.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,730
The important thing, however,

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,240
is for it to be able to communicate with the Systems Manager APIs.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,990
This IAM policy here needs to be attached as a bare minimum.

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,740
You might be wondering, by the way,

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,270
why I called the agent and the policy as the same.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,660
Well that's because back in the day,

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:11,240
the service was called as the same service, standing for simply Systems Manager.

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,990
But AWS chose to rename it to just Systems Manager.

18
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,940
It's now just a relic of the past really.

19
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:26,660
So once the SSM Agent is installed and the policy applied to the EC2 instance,

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,750
that's it, we're done.

21
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:35,240
That's all we need to do to onboard an EC2 to Systems Manager in theory.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,030
So why don't we take a look at actually doing this in practice now

23
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,520
in this demo here and look at deploying an EC2 virtual machine and

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,440
registering it to Systems Manager.

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,140
Here we are now in the AWS Management Console.

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,470
Before we do anything else,

27
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,960
we want to make sure that we are in the correct region,

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,370
whatever region we want to be in.

29
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,110
We can do this up here in the upper‑right corner.

30
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:09,840
And in Globomantics's case, the region will be Sydney.

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,940
First,

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,520
we want to deploy a virtual machine. And as they are part of the EC2 service,

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,140
we need to browse to that one first.

34
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,630
We're going to type ec2 in here into the search box and

35
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,540
hit Enter to get to the EC2 dashboard.

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,070
As this is a brand new account to us,

37
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,220
we're not going to see any instances here yet.

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,240
So you probably don't have any either.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,380
But if you do expect some to see here, they should show up.

40
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,320
If you expected to see some here, but can't see any,

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,960
again,

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,380
make sure you're in the correct region or you have the correct permissions.

43
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,740
First, we want to launch a new instance now.

44
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,610
So the next thing we have to do is after clicking this button

45
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,740
here to search for an AMI to deploy from.

46
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,040
We want to deploy a Windows Server 2019,

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,140
so that's what I'm going to search for here.

48
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,640
I'm going to pick the first image,

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,140
which is the default Windows Server 2019 AMI and click Next.

50
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,080
Next thing,

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,190
make sure you select an instance type that's applicable to your situation.

52
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,440
I'm going to pick the free one here as that's sufficient for our use case.

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,890
Click Next and configure more instance details.

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,640
In this demo, I'm going to go with the default values for almost everything,

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,810
especially network‑related choices.

56
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,620
Make sure that that works in your environment though.

57
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,490
I'm going to pick the default VPC and a random subnet in that default VPC. And

58
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,740
I'm going to assign a public IP to this virtual machine.

59
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,530
The public IP is not actually being used by us to access the virtual machine,

60
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,040
but more for the virtual machine to be able to communicate to the internet.

61
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,740
The next step is where we need to select an IAM role.

62
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,370
Remember,

63
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,380
I mentioned a specific IAM policy and role needs to be attached to

64
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,370
the EC2 instance. This role will allow the EC2 to communicate with

65
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,780
the Systems Manager APIs. Looking at the dropdown list here though,

66
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,940
we don't have an IAM role yet.

67
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:50,640
So we click on Create new IAM role here, and a new tab opens up in our browser.

68
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,840
We can create the new role straight from here.

69
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,640
So just click on the Create role button.

70
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,810
We need to select the EC2 servers because we want to

71
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,940
attach this IAM role to an EC2.

72
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,240
Next, we need to add the permissions.

73
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Remember, the policy was called something with SSM.

74
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,240
So let's type that in here,

75
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,570
and yep, there we go, that's the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy. We

76
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,490
select this and click Next. In a production environment, I recommend you add

77
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,470
tags to your resources obviously. But in here, we're just going to skip that

78
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,420
for now and move on to the next page.

79
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,660
Give the role a name, any name really that's easy to identify.

80
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,100
But if you have naming conventions,

81
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,040
please follow them obviously. We'll change the description just to make it

82
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,310
a bit clearer that it allows EC2 instances to access AWS Systems Manager

83
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,640
on our behalf, and we click on Create role.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,960
A new role has been created now, and we can now go back to the previous

85
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:13,440
tab. Hit the Refresh button here, and we can now select our new role. We'll

86
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,560
leave the rest as it is and move on to the storage page and also leave this

87
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,790
on default. Again, as before, I recommend adding tags. And as always,

88
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,640
depending on your situation,

89
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,650
the tags might be different. But for now we skip this and

90
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,040
move on to the security group page.

91
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,210
We're going to select an existing security group instead of

92
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,460
creating a new one, and we're going to select the existing

93
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,100
default security group here.

94
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,430
The important thing about this existing default security group

95
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,860
is that it accepts all traffic on all ports and protocols that

96
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,390
originate from within itself.

97
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,960
So even though the virtual machine has a public IP attached, we can't

98
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,510
actually talk to that VM via its public IP and connect to,

99
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,910
let's say,

100
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,590
an RDP port on that virtual machine unless the origin has

101
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,740
the same security group attached to it.

102
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,980
So let's go to view this and launch, and this will give

103
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,840
us an overview of what we have done.

104
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,280
Clicking Launch will pop up this dialog here.

105
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,040
Normally, this is where we create or select an EC2 key pair.

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,440
This key pair is used to later on connect to the EC2 via SSH or RDP.

107
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,250
Because we don't actually have to connect to this virtual machine with a

108
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,850
username and password in these traditional ways,

109
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,640
we would proceed without a key pair.

110
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,180
We need to acknowledge that we understand that we won't be able to

111
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,330
connect to the switch machine via RDP if we don't already know the

112
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,740
password for that machine baked into the AMI.

113
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,000
However, later on in the course,

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,910
we will see that we don't actually need to know the

115
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,840
password to connect to that VM.

116
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,490
But for now,

117
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,640
we'll just accept this warning, click Launch, and view the

118
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,480
instances and wait for a few minutes.

119
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,310
Let's jump ahead, and we can see our new instance has begun to being spun up.

120
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,710
The instance state shows pending, and the status

121
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,970
checks are currently initializing.

122
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,060
Let's jump ahead again, and the instance state just turned to

123
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,730
running. We just have to wait into the status checks are also

124
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,340
showing the two positive checks.

125
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:57,090
One more jump, and we can now see that it's done and changed over to these

126
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:04,730
Systems Manager service. Pull this list down here and start typing until we

127
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:12,350
see Systems Manager. In the Systems Manager console, we're now going to

128
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,440
scroll down all the way to Managed Instances.

129
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,670
Let me just clean this frame up here. And here, as expected,

130
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,390
we can see our instance with the instance ID.

131
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:32,000
It says it's online and shows us all the other information that we would expect to see from a managed virtual machine.
