1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,600
Enough talk.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,720
Let's look at the Session Manager Service and use it to connect to

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,890
our AWS instances. In the Systems Manager console, we scroll down

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,330
to the Session Manager tab. And the first thing we will do is check

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,540
out Configure Preferences.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,840
In here, we can see a few options we can configure.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,880
For example,

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,130
for Linux, we can configure a different user to use

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,140
when logging into an instance.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,940
We can configure encryption between the instances and the user's local machines.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,740
And we can configure where information about every single command a user

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:55,140
executes while connected to an EC2 is sent to, either to an S3 bucket,

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,810
CloudWatch, or even both. For this demo, we just want to focus on the

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,540
functionality itself and leave all these options disabled,

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,370
but understand that they're here when we want to use them. In the

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,940
Sessions tab, this is where we can find all active sessions.

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:24,140
Right now there aren't any, so let's change that and start a session.

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,510
First, we will select our EC2 instance,

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:35,370
the Windows Server 2019. Once we started the session, a new browser tab

20
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:41,610
automatically opens, and we are presented with a PowerShell prompt in just a

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,000
few seconds, almost no time. From here, we now have full access to the

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,040
PowerShell command‑line. Query a service.

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,440
Easy. Maybe check what Windows features are installed.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,840
Yep, sure.

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,230
Maybe we expect an issue with the Amazon SSM agent,

26
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,890
and we want to tell the log file.

27
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:16,560
Just browse to the correct directory, Get‑Content on the errors file,

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,940
and, yep, it can be easily done just like this.

29
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,540
Remember, there's no public IP required on those instances.

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,110
All communication happens via internal AWS APIs, and we,

31
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:40,580
as the user, really only see images presented to us in the browser. As an

32
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,800
administrator, we can now go back to the Session Manager tab and refresh the

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,940
session's overview to see our currently active session.

34
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,440
From here, we can select the session and then click Terminate.

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
We might have a valid reason for that,

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,890
or we just want to terminate the session. Over on our

37
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,650
active Sessions tab, as the user,

38
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,440
we only get a notification that our session was terminated.

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,730
In the session history, we can now see our previous session

40
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,740
and some information about it.

41
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,340
Right.

42
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,540
So this was us connecting to an AWS EC2 instance,

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,730
but I mentioned that we can also connect to non‑AWS machines on‑premises, on

44
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,240
other clouds, as long as we on‑boarded them to Systems Manager.

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,340
For this, we need to enable the advanced tier,

46
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,640
which will incur costs per machine, if you remember.

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,540
Let's see what this looks like.

48
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,260
We'll start another session, but this time we select

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,040
the managed Ubuntu instance here.

50
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,330
Once we click on Start session, we get this popup saying that advanced

51
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,130
tier needs to be enabled, and it asks us to accept that this will change

52
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,270
our billing model for Systems Manager to the advanced tier. We read and

53
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:16,830
accept this, and click Change setting. We can then see the confirmation

54
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,340
of this action up here in the green ribbon, and we can now click Start

55
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,840
session again.

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,800
As before, this opens a new tab and connects us straight into our Linux

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,170
terminal on our on‑premises VM. Just like on Windows, we can do many

58
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,650
things here on the command‑line to assist us with troubleshooting any

59
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:48,000
issues we might have. Again, note that we did not need to connect any networks for this to work.
