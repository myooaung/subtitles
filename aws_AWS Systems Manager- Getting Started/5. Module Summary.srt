In this module,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,630
we introduced Systems Manager Parameter Store to Globomantics, and with it

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,340
a way to manage secrets and other values without any service that they

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:20,470
need to manage, in most cases without any added cost even. We learned how

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,580
to create and work with parameters in addition to using them in

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,640
combination with other AWS services.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,740
Thanks for watching this module, and stay tuned for the next module where

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:44,000
we will look at how Systems Manager OpsCenter can make the management and operations of an AWS environment a lot easier.
