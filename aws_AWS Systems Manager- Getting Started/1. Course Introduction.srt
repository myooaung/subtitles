Hello, and welcome to this course, AWS Systems Manager: Getting Standard,

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,880
and to this module, Onboarding AWS EC2 Virtual Machines.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,420
My name is David O'Brien.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,030
I'm a cloud architect and Microsoft MVP working on all things

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,440
around modern cloud infrastructure and security.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm going to be your guide through this course and hope you

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,840
enjoy learning about AWS Systems Manager.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,240
Without further ado, let's start with an overview of this module.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,940
First, we're going to have a look at who this course is for,

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,840
what should you bring as a prerequisite to be successful in this course.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,410
We will then look at the course scenario and what we're going to work

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,840
through over the course of the next couple of hours.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,440
Next, we will introduce the AWS Systems Manager suite,

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,340
what it is, and the components that it is made up of.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,640
After that,

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,680
we will start deploying AWS EC2 virtual machines and their supporting

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,940
resources that we will need throughout this course.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,220
We'll also look at then subsequently onboarding those

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,740
virtual machines into AWS Systems Manager.

20
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,840
So, who is this course for?

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Well, you're most likely infrastructure focused.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,690
You're just about to start off with the cloud,

23
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:44,160
and you do probably also have some scripting or programming experience,

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,140
whether that's PowerShell, Bash or Python,

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,670
or other programming languages like C#,

26
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:58,740
it really doesn't matter as long as you do believe that automation

27
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,240
is key to being successful in a cloud world.

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,220
Additionally,

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,710
you're also more interested in Infrastructure as a Service

30
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,480
right now because most of your infrastructure,

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,840
currently and for a while, will likely still be virtual machines.

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
So if that's you, or close to who you are,

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,790
then welcome to this course and let's see what we are

34
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,540
going to deal with in this course.

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,540
So, we're part of Globomantics, a highly specialized

36
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,540
company for global flight planning.

37
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,990
They have infrastructure all over the world that is critical for airlines to

38
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,120
do their flight planning, and they're currently just starting off on their

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,420
cloud journey. The business decided that AWS, Amazon Web Services, would be

40
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,640
their strategic cloud platform of choice,

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,740
and they want to go all in wherever they can.

42
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,640
From an infrastructure point of view, they are really a mixed bag.

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,970
They have some Windows virtual machines and some Linux virtual machines.

44
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,620
Really, it's more of a 50/50 mix.

45
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,660
And going forward, the business understands that Infrastructure as a Service

46
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,810
is going to be there for at least the first 12 months,

47
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,180
or even longer, as their main focus initially is not to transform to any

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,740
Platform as a Service, or even Software as a Service offerings.

49
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,200
However,

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,780
overall, the goal for Globomantics is to reduce the footprint

51
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,400
of traditional management software without losing visibility

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,240
into what is actually happening.

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,300
As an example,

54
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:56,000
one of the management software platforms that they want to remove is their whole software deployment and server management suite.
