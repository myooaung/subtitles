00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Now let's talk about premium fonts and why should

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.985
we buy these premium fonts and what are the gems hidden in them?

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.840
Now, first thing is great quality, okay?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.270
They are really great.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.710
They have great kerning.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.390
They're designed by great typographers and typographic companies, type foundries.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.315
Kerning is great, and they have a lot of linkages and few extra options.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:32.040
Anti-aliasing is good.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.725
They don't have any jagged edges,

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:36.605
their web fonts are great.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:42.570
Now the biggest edge you have is custom look, okay?

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.615
Now you have a brand,

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:49.565
you have a team in your mind so if you use a premium font,

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:54.810
it is going to give a lot of impact on your viewers and users, okay?

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.110
Choose wisely, you can buy premium fonts and you can use them in your branding,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.830
in your websites, in your mobile apps everywhere.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.210
Customers are going to instantly recognize your firm

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.950
or company or product from its type, okay?

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.000
Now there is some cons associated with this.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.080
The problems we have is that they are expensive.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.625
Some fonts if you tried to buy them,

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:27.235
they are $700 the whole family so it is very costly.

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:31.700
Even, I like few phones that are four or $500 and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.585
sometimes I think that someone should give me such fonts because I cannot buy them.

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:43.515
Okay, so the other thing is they might not be hosted for free, okay?

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:46.005
If you buy a fonts from this site,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.130
myfonts.com, this is my favorite site.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.150
You can see over here,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.410
I am logged in.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.750
I have bought a lot of fonts from here,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.680
a lot of families you can see over here.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.985
Now the benefit of such sites is that you can

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:03.470
find or match your team exactly what you are looking for.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.300
You can see over here different letters, there's shapes, okay?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.760
There uses that you can see over here.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.430
Britannica, then storytelle, okay?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.840
There are a millions of themes.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.800
You can look for great artists,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.170
you can look for special offers.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.615
You can buy them on some discount.

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:28.705
Also, you can look for some free fonts if you want.

00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:32.590
I really suggest that you should subscribe on

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.200
this website and they will send you some free fonts.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.350
If you want to search some free fonts you can such over here and add them to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.240
your cart and use them on web or your designs.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.735
This is how I have a lot of collection of free premium fonts.

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.600
Anyhow, this is the site I really love.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.570
There are a lot of design ideas too.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.230
If you look at these typefaces and their presentation,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.025
there are a lot of ideas too,

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:13.105
so do purchase some good fonts from here and purchase them wisely.

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:19.105
Maybe you need just one or two or three style not all the font family.

00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:22.960
This is how you get started with premium fonts.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.360
There's another one which is Typekit,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840
which is related to this photo-shop license.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.925
You can also purchase Typekit,

00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:36.915
it's subscription-based website with a lot of fonts.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:40.010
I don't know it is typekit.com or whatever,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.620
but I think it's from Adobe company and there it is.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.330
I think I am logged out of it, I guess.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.950
Anyhow, now I'm logged in.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.560
Okay, now you can see over here there are a lot of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.340
classifications you can select anyone over here and like mono handwritten,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.565
decorative scraped slabs out if this is very good and you can add them.

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:07.190
You can use this fonts in your web bar,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.475
mobile apps or even your designs inside Photoshop.

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:11.630
I have right now,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:19.040
I guess some 276 fonts and if you operate to another plan,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.190
you might be have a lot more options.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.155
This is another way.

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:31.155
These fonts are hosted on Adobe Typekit so they also work like Google, I guess.

00:04:31.155 --> 00:04:36.600
This is how there are different options to use premium fonts.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.375
There might be more websites like this.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.385
We have this Adobe Typekit.

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:45.635
This is where you purchase different fonts and web fonts.

00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:48.950
Okay, so then you can see over here web fonts,

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.655
even if you go to any font like this one.

00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:56.270
You can see their web fonts right away.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.395

00:04:57.395 --> 00:04:59.570
you can see, if you click over here,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.595

00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:05.590
here it is and you can see over here.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.960
If you want to buy,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.135
you can see in the buying choices.

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:10.850
We have Desktop and web fonts,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.110
so you must always click web font if you are going to use it in the web,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.300
if you are going to use it in app or publication like book or something like this,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.640
then you need to purchase more licenses.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.680
This is all about premium fonts and

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.290
their different methods of purchasing subscription-based or you need

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.950
to purchase the whole font their licenses so

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.030
you might have got good understanding and let's move on to the next lesson.
