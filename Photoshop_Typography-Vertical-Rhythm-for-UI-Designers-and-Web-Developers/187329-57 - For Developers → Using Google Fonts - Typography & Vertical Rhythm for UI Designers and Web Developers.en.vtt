00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
The first and foremost choice for every developer is to use Google Fonts.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.500
Even designers love to use them because they can easily be hosted

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.495
and they can be easier to use for designers and for developers.

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:18.840
You just need to embed them with just one line

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.750
of code and you are ready to go right now there

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.320
are 804 for families which are totally free and hosted for you.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.350
Hosted means they are on another server on Google's servers.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.450
Also, the problem with these Google Fonts is the font quality.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.190
Sometimes that Kerning is off, sometimes anti-aliasing issues.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.755
Anti-aliasing means edges might be jagged and they are not smooth.

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:51.040
This happens with a lot of Google Fonts.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.750
Sometimes most of them are good quality,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.065
but some of them, they have jagged edges.

00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:01.295
There are few more of the good things about Google Fonts.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.210
Let's switch to Google Fonts,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.245
now, there is one more thing,

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:12.350
you can easily select a family and if you go to customizing it,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.810
you just need to embed this line of code and you are ready to go to use this family.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.570
This is the code also shows you the load time, which is fast,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.230
if you try to customize it,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.665
it only have one [inaudible] right now.

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.950
Let's try another one, like this,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.845
one with this, we are going to select few more.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:40.865
You can see it shows you what is the load time will be.

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:42.530
Even if you are a designer,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.290
you should choose your fonts easily from this Google New Fonts Preview.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.345
One more thing is if you try to select this view specimen,

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.095
you can really see a lot of great things over here,

00:01:57.095 --> 00:02:00.515
like all the different styles,

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:04.325
so different styles over here then we have bearing,

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:05.675
which is very nice.

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:08.825
Why bother spending hours,

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:10.730
try to match different fonts.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.600
Why shouldn't we use just built-in or already matched forms,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.305
choose one you like overhere or which is really closer to your projects.

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:29.225
Try to use this one also it is showing you usage

00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:33.665
how much it is used in different countries or different areas,

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:37.955
and this is how many websites it is serving.

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:41.605
It is a great tool to get you started,

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:43.910
copy one line of code,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.250
get baring from here.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.100
There are a lot of good things about it.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.735
But still you can see,

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:52.640
if you see some of the fonts,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.040
they might have, some of the jagged edges like you can see over here,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.080
this is not very smooth on my screen.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.155
Also you can see or hear Merriweather Sans,

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:06.880
you can see between A and M darkening is a bit off.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.494
So these are few things,

00:03:09.494 --> 00:03:12.740
and still I think it is a very good option to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.445
start with Google Fonts because developers are going to love it,

00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:19.535
because it is very easier for them to use it.

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:23.290
Just copy one line of code and they're ready to go,

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.649
if you are a developer,

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:28.430
you should communicate with your designer, if you're a designer,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.965
you should communicate with your developer to

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:34.340
get started and know what are the possibilities.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.350
Let's move on to the next lesson.
