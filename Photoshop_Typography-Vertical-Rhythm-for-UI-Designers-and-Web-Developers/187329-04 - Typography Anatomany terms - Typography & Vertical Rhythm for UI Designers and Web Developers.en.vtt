00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Now, in this lesson we are going to learn some of

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.770
the typography terms and a bit of about type anatomy.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.485
So these are very crucial because we

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:18.250
can easily pair force by learning these typographic terms.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.050
So let's get started.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.590
First of all, we are going to learn about base-line, mean-line, and cap-line.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.585
Cap-line means capital line,

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:29.010
so it is the line,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.605
imaginary line sitting at the top of capital letter.

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:37.650
Then we have base-line, which is very important.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.505
Base-line is the line on which all of our letters they sit on it.

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:52.430
The mean-line is basically at the top of our small letters or we can say x-height.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.140
This is basically the height of our small letters.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.525
So this is basically mean-line.

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:02.960
The most important is this baseline.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.920
So make sure you know what this baseline is.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.695
One more thing that some of

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:16.930
these letters go above this capital line and some like these y,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.955
p and other, they go beyond this baseline.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.935
So just keep in mind.

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:28.895
Let's learn about the x-height and capital height of any font.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.855
So basically, the height of

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:37.060
the small letter x is basically the x-height of any font or any type.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.320
The capital letter height is basically the capital height.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.910
Now, x-height is very important and the ratio between x-height and

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.890
capital letter is also very important factor in legibility of font.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.119
So now if we have good x-height,

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.050
it can be easier to read on small devices or small booklets or something like that.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.690
So if you are designing for mobile apps,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.915
you need to consider a font with larger x-height.

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:13.370
Also the efficient fonts like Helvetica and few others,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.730
they have x-height from 67 percent to 69 percent of capital height.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.955
So they are almost 65-70 percent of the height of a capital letter.

00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:33.200
So this is also another factor also,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.740
this is a factor between different font classifications.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.850
The older font types,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.950
the old font families,

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.520
or old fonts like Garamond,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.685
they have low x-height.

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:49.640
Now, let's learn about ascenders and descenders.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.350
Ascenders basically are the letter portion that is extended above

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.370
the mean line or you can see over here the top of the d. Then we have descender,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.200
which is basically extended downwards from the baseline.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.510
So everything that drops from the baseline is basically descenders.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:19.130
Counter is another very big factor in recognizing or legibility of any font or type.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.080
So there are two types of counter, open and closed.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.020
Open counter is basically the open portion of funny letter like this.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.970
It is not totally closed from all sides.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.720
The space in-between this letter e

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.230
is basically the open counter and then we have closed counter.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.930
Closed counter is basically the space enclosed in any letter like this

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.260
o and the top portion of this e. Why we are learning about this?

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.775
Because they can help with legibility if we have very big counters,

00:03:55.775 --> 00:04:00.745
that font or that type or style is very legible.

00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:05.570
Now this is also another factor to letter to this x-heights.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.790
So these two play a very big role in legibility or fonts counter and x-height.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.795
Let's learn few other typographic terms,

00:04:15.795 --> 00:04:18.950
so we can easily identify any type.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.190
So here we go we have this beak,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.795
which is a bit pointy end off any capital letter or small letter.

00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:32.525
They are found normally at the start and the end of the letter.

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.505
Then we have this stroke.

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:37.055
You can see the top portion of this p letter,

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:39.125
there are two varying strokes.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:44.555
One is very slim at the start and at the middle it is very thick.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:48.965
So basically this is called the stroke difference seem to take

00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:53.870
and it is very important part in identifying different classes of fonts.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.535
Then we have the lower loop,

00:04:55.535 --> 00:05:00.300
which is basically the lower part of g. You can see over here.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.530
Also different classes of fonts.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.135
They have different this loop style.

00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:06.380
Then we have ear.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:14.595
Ear is basically this pointy ear style knob getting out of this from g letter.

00:05:14.595 --> 00:05:17.450
This is also very important factor.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.275
It is different in different fonts.

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:22.740
Then we have this apex.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.480
Apex is basically the top part of any letter where we have

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:39.375
this pen style remainder of something like gut neighbor over here or something like that.

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:41.010
Then we have tail.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.235
This is basically the lower portion of letter y.

00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:53.780
Then we have this terminal which is also like tail,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.910
but it is not extending at the bottom.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.055
It is basically extended at the left or right side of one letter like this a.

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:02.360
Then we have serif.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:10.954
Serif is basically any line or anything which is basically separate the font types,

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.610
like we have this serif fonts,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.330
they have these slabs at end of their letters like this.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.509
You can see over here y.

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.295
So also at the bottom of y letter.

00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:26.435
So this is basically serif,

00:06:26.435 --> 00:06:31.025
and this is all about different typographic terms.

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:33.815
I hope that you have enjoyed your lecture.

00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:36.960
Let's move on to the next lesson.
