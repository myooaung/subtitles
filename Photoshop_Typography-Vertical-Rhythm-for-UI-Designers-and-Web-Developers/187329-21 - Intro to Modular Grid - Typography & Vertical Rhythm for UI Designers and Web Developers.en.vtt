00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
In this lesson, we are going to learn about modular grid,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.985
and we will see how to use it,

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:11.390
what are the different parts of it,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.160
and how to use modules, margins,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.665
scatters, and grid lines to create awesome looking designs.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:24.810
Our first step is that we already know about baselines.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.705
This is our 30 pixel baseline.

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:32.915
What I did is that I created this document with the size,

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:37.785
which is multiple of 30 pixels.

00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:47.035
Height is 810, so height is basically multiple of my 30 pixel baseline.

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:49.580
You can see in the layers panel,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.185
I have created a layer which is named 30 pixel baseline.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:59.285
So as I've shown you in previous lessons,

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:02.320
created a pattern with 30 pixel baseline,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.790
and I applied it to one layer.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.000
From here, you can see that we already knew this baseline stuff,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.295
this is first step.

00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:20.990
The second step is that we are going to divide

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.115
this design into horizontal and vertical portions.

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:31.250
So here comes the gutters.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.830
How I created these gutters,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.260
you can see over here,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.810
this is basically my grid.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.010
If I turn on my grid lines controlled column on Photoshop.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.600
Grids are basically spaces between different columns.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.145
You can see over here the white portion is the column and the gray one is the gutter.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.880
So gutter is basically inner margins between different columns,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.740
this is just to space out different items to each other so they

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.035
don't touch each other's ears or nose, etc.

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:12.340
So if I am designing something and I placed something over here like this,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.215
the next thing is that I am going to place another one over here like that.

00:02:20.215 --> 00:02:23.635
This is basically the margin between them.

00:02:23.635 --> 00:02:28.810
It really creates an elegance in your design if you follow this.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.880
If you are a web developer,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.335
you already knew about 12 column or 60 column grid lines.

00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:37.255
They are also based on this.

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:41.425
Even Bootstrap uses 30 pixels gutter.

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:46.490
So this gutter in Bootstrap is equal to 30 pixels.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.855
How I created these gutters in Photoshop,

00:02:50.855 --> 00:03:00.165
I just went to this new guide layout and I have got 30 pixels gutter and eight columns.

00:03:00.165 --> 00:03:04.340
Right now, I have divided this layout into eight columns.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.160
You can use 12, 16, whatever you want.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.270
Also, the third part which I am using in my design,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.740
which is very important,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.645
is that you leave some margin around your design.

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:20.490
So let me just first clear the margin,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.570
show you the margin.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.649
So this yellow portion is basically my margin.

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:28.830
So if you view it over here in grid line,

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.919
you can see I have 90 pixel top margin,

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.230
left 30, 90 at bottom,

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.300
and right at 30.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:45.500
Here is the secret: Why I am leaving 30 pixels and 90 pixels margins,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.420
the secret is our baseline.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.070
Our baseline is 30 pixels,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.000
so I have set everything around that number;

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.070
30 pixels, then 90 pixel,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.940
multiple of our baseline.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.845
So this is how I've set up everything.

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:06.080
We have setup our baseline grid, this is it,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.215
and then we have gutters,

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:10.305
then we have margins,

00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:12.885
and then the next step.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:19.305
So next step is that we have the space inside this area,

00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:26.085
we have divided it into horizontal columns and vertical columns,

00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:31.760
eight columns, but now we are going to create another thing which is called modules.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:39.304
We are going to subdivide this into separate different boxes or modules.

00:04:39.304 --> 00:04:43.850
You can see over here that this is one module,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.295
this one is one module,

00:04:46.295 --> 00:04:49.150
and this one is another one,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.850
or we can also use modules like this;

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.470
like we have 1, 2, 3,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.675
4, something like this,

00:04:56.675 --> 00:05:02.555
but the height we will be using will be equal to this module.

00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:08.300
So actually what we did is we are dividing whole design into

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.720
different portions which are mathematically calculated

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.290
so it brings harmony and elegance to your user's eye.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.040
So for example, if I'm using these two for my image like that,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.010
then I am going to use, for example,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.350
first four modules like that or maybe this portion for my text.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.935
For a less spaced Lorem Ipsum over here like this,

00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:42.990
let's change the size,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.555
maybe 72 is good.

00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:56.175
Let's change this line height to 72 and increase the size to 100, maybe like this.

00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:59.055
Line height should be 90,

00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:04.600
and let's use 10 over here like this.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.385
Still, I think we are having some problem with the line-height.

00:06:11.385 --> 00:06:13.740
This one looks good,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.865
just create a simple layout like this.

00:06:17.865 --> 00:06:21.579
So this was our image,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.540
let's hide this one.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.975
Where is the image? Okay, this one.

00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:36.630
Let's lock these layers which are our baseline and everything,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.995
let's lock them up.

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:40.780
Gutter, I'm going to lock it, margins,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.290
I'm going to lock this one so we don't select them by mistake.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.485
This one was a bit hideous so I'm going to

00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:56.390
convert it to this color and we are going to remove its border.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.175
Where's the properties?

00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:02.090
Here we have the shape properties,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.130
we need no borders.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.870
We have created a simple layout.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.325
Let's just hide these margins and everything so you can

00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:17.690
see how we are doing with the word design.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.140
Let's hide this and everything.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.780
So you can see how we are using margins and

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.410
everything to lay out our stuff and everything.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:34.530
Let's create one other text layer over here.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:43.115
Now, I'm going to use all this area or maybe this whole area to create text over here.

00:07:43.115 --> 00:07:45.755
Let's space Lorem Ipsum,

00:07:45.755 --> 00:07:53.060
and this time we are going to use very small size,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.505
like maybe 24 pixels.

00:07:55.505 --> 00:08:00.630
Let's use the height of 30 pixels like this,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.995
we are going to use zero or maybe less than zero,

00:08:04.995 --> 00:08:07.725
minus 10 like that,

00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:18.195
and we are almost there with our margins like this.

00:08:18.195 --> 00:08:25.475
Let's change the color to some black or something gray-ish like that,

00:08:25.475 --> 00:08:28.500
let's hide our margins, gutter,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.950
and everything else to see what it look likes.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.045
This is how our design is looking right now.

00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:39.400
There is one more thing we can do,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.660
we can use the margins a bit more

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.705
over here so it doesn't look like it's touching on the right side.

00:08:48.705 --> 00:08:57.480
So maybe we can reduce its size to like 30 pixels.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.935
With 30 pixels, let's create a bit of more margin over here.

00:09:02.935 --> 00:09:05.030
On the right side,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.000
I've created a box of 30 pixels over here.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.040
So this is 30 pixels,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.400
then I'm going to duplicate it with my alt key.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.455
This is again 30 pixels,

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:18.740
so we have now 90 pixels margin over here.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:24.965
So let's size this paragraph again to this 90 pixels margin like this,

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:31.210
and let's hide these margins and everything else.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.050
You can see how we have created the layout like that,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.660
you have seen these kinds of layouts in magazines.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:47.370
Even if we can make it a bit bolder, something like this,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:53.785
maybe a bit less space between letters,

00:09:53.785 --> 00:09:59.610
less space between 72 like this.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.670
You might have seen these kind of layouts in magazines

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.610
so you know that the magazines designers,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.920
they are very good at creating these layouts or these modular grid.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.550
Keep in mind how to use this grid.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.205
These are the basics.

00:10:17.205 --> 00:10:23.565
We have gutters which are in between our different columns.

00:10:23.565 --> 00:10:27.850
You can see my content is not inside any gutter.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.430
I wide them like here,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.385
let's touch it at the left of our gutter like this,

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:40.910
and you can see even my content is not touching any margin,

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.350
it is away from the margin.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.640
There are two things you should keep in mind while designing.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.080
One is that use modular grid,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.090
and in the next exercise we are going to create

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.260
a lot of different themes like you can see over here,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.925
this one, this one,

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:02.060
and this one using our modular grid.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.585
Now, you have learned all about modular grids,

00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:08.670
so let's move on to the next lesson.
