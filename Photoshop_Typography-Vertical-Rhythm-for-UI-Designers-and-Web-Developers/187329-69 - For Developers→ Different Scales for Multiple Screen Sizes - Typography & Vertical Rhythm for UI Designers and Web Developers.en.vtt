00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
In this lesson, we are going to use

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.269
the second secret ninja technique for our font sizing,

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.390
for responsive web design.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.010
What it is is actually we are going to just change the scale factor

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.540
because our font size looks very big on small screens.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.250
Previously, we were using 1.44 as our scale factor,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.325
now we are going to use 1.22.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:31.590
What we are going to do is,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.240
we are just going to copy everything from here.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.075
Let's change it to pixel and then REM,

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:42.750
just to see that sizes have updated.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.160
I'm going to copy from here to the top,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.810
CTRL+C, and what I'm going to do is,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.150
I am going to go to my small screen, which is this one,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.570
so media only screen, this is small screen,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.460
I'm going to remove this HTML percentage controlling system,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.450
and we are going to paste it over here.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.590
Let's replace this with our 18 pixels.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.910
For the line height we used 27 pixels,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.530
sorry, it was 27.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.080
I cannot see my keyboard from the back of my mic,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.900
it is just in front of my face.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.350
HTML.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.025
This is really bad.

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:48.650
The first step is, I always try to use my font size to HTML element.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:58.055
It is better for me and sometimes I think it is recommended by most of the expert users.

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:00.140
If you are more expert than me,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.880
you can write about it in the question or anything you can suggest about it.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.730
Now, what we are going to do is,

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.720
let's see how it is going to look on our small screen.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.510
First what we are going to do is we are going to remove

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.650
this HTML font size and shift on our medium screens,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.485
because we don't need it.

00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:31.780
Let's see how our fonts are looking and sizes are.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.360
Shift with this large, okay,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.190
medium, it is the same,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.760
we not need anything to change.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.940
Let's go to this.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.890
Here we have the small one.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.180
You can see the size is shifted dramatically,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.890
but our line heights are looking something strange.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.210
Also, there's a lot of distance between these two paragraphs.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.225
Our heading two is good,

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:04.480
heading three is also good,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.030
but heading one have a bit of problem.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.730
Let's fix that.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.950
Let's go to the heading one in our media query,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.230
so this is our media query start,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.070
and this is our heading one.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.310
Font size is this one,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.715
line height is a bit above the font size so I think it should be similar.

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.860
Maybe you can use something like this,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.160
just line height one.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.270
Let's save it and refreshed it.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.970
It's looking better now,

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.385
but we have now another issue which is,

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:43.930
this paragraph got too closer to this heading one.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.280
Let's move it away from heading one.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.690
We are going to use this one.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.250
We are going to copy-paste margin,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.530
bottom, and top are the same.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.490
Right now, don't worry about vertical with them,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.945
just we are going to go with our gut feeling,

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:07.410
so don't worry about it right now. It's looking better.
