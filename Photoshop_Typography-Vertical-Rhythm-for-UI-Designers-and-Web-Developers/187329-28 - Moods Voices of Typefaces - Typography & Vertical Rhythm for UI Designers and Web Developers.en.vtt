00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.550
In this lecture, we are going to train your gut feeling about the fonts and topography,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.830
what the font is saying,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.265
what your gut is hearing,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.570
and your feeling about this font,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.835
we are going to increase that scale and I will tell you how to get used to it.

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:28.090
So each typeface has different voices or moods.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.330
If you are designing for some maybe harbor or organic product,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.560
you will select particular typeface

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.605
which is conducting the mood of that brand or something like this.

00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:51.570
So first, you need to find the mood whether this font's mood is related to your project,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.190
is it good for your business site or your fashion magazine or it is elegant?

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.585
Is it fun?

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:01.730
Is it good for reading?

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.450
So these are different situations where you need to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.115
see what mood different typefaces have.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:13.489
Now, I am going to show you different moods,

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:18.860
I have selected randomly few fonts from my collection and I will

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.510
show you how to get used to them or you can say,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.540
train your eye for the moods of typefaces.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.655
So let's get started.

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.680
First one is fun theme.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.090
Now, you can see all this fonts I have selected,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.010
some are splash fun for your kids,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.985
eat healthy, have fun with olive oil.

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:43.955
They are not too much edgy,

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:49.100
so they don't have very sharp edges or something like this.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.530
So this is a bit fun theme, a bit relaxed.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.815
Top one is a Sans Serif font and second one is a bit Slab Serif font,

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:05.385
but its corner are a bit rounded.

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:07.440
Then at the bottom,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.515
we have again Sans Serif font and its corners are also round.

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:17.340
Even you can see in the edge of the school, back to school,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.430
word school, it has a very curvy touch to it at the end.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.330
You need to see few things,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.650
you need to write it in some color that is fun,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.705
so this is first step and try to,

00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:35.070
I try different fonts,

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.330
if you like one, then move on to the next one.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.585
I don't think it's matching my theme,

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:45.570
so then move on to the next one.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.700
No typeface designers, maybe there are

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.590
few experts who are very expert in this typography matching exercise.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.120
But for me, normally I try to keep on iterating

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.875
different fonts till the time I find the one which looks perfect for my theme.

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:06.510
Next is love theme.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.900
You can see I have selected few different fonts over here,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.500
few are very curvy and scripty fonts, handwritten fonts,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.585
and one is Slab Serif and the top one is

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:28.915
a bit transitional font which have a very distinct style.

00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:33.060
So this all depends about your situation.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.830
If you are writing for some marriage ceremony or something like that,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.735
you might go for script font,

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:43.205
maybe just like I have in John and Jenna are getting married.

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:45.290
If you are in a happy love theme,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.360
you might go to the last option which is everything can be achieved with love,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.880
so it is also showing some hope to it.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.080
So these are different themes.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.725
If you see the sweetest sensation theme I have,

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:06.395
love is the sweetest sensation I'm using,

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:10.710
cyan or greenish blue color to it and you can

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.710
see even it's a very slim Slab Serif font but it's looking very nice.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:22.190
The top one is some theme like losing love or

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.860
maybe having it forever or something

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.860
like that which is related to time or something like that.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.375
So I have used it,

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:34.235
a theme where some of the portions of my fonts are removed,

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:37.180
so this is maybe related to time.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.615
Just like we have love memories or something like this.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:44.105
So this comes with practice,

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:46.550
you need to iterate a lot of fonts,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.370
write the line, you want the theme,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.120
for example, I have this love is the sweetest sensation in my heart.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.830
So this is the theme line Write

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.080
the theme line and then keep iterating different fonts one-by-one,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.110
till the time you find the best one.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.260
Here is the health theme,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.030
first one is candy sweets,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.485
you can see that selected to kids and candies,

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:13.035
it is very different font,

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:16.185
have big slabs, very funny touch.

00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:19.340
Then, we have cupcakes are the sweetest sensation for kids.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.940
You can see this is the same font I used in last exercise which was love theme.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.070
Now, here we have again little to sweet,

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.660
so it is little to sweetness,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.810
so we can use it with cupcakes too,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.350
then we have fruits and vegetables are healthier than junk food.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.005
Now, fruits and vegetables,

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.645
this is a very wide font.

00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:46.520
It have some integrity to it or you can say

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.840
some weight in showing you that this thing is good.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.915
So it is descent,

00:05:53.915 --> 00:06:01.190
I can say or very roundy where I have some very regular shapes which is related to,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.515
you can say geometric Sans Serif font,

00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:07.440
perfect geometry, and it looks good on this theme.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.570
Then we have all natural, organic,

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.010
GMO free candies for healthy kids.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.460
Although it have very edgy corners,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.880
like you can say that k and h and everything.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.625
But the angles are very different.

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:27.080
So it looks like a kid style font,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.685
so it can really work well for natural organic and something like this.

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:34.889
Then we have pure, organic,

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.170
GMO free health tonic 500 ml,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.015
you can see at the bottom.

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:46.220
Also, keep in mind that I'm using colors with mix with my theme.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.335
So the pop up better than just simple gray or black color.

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:55.350
Here we have again organic theme but it is different,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.220
maybe it's a tonic for adults or something like that,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.005
so I have used a font.

00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:04.890
Again, it has very roundy shapes,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.620
it is Sans Serif and it is looking good with this theme.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.185
Next we have technology theme drone rover version this 2.5 great for teenagers,

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:21.980
you can see the difference between x-height and capital height is great,

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.270
so it is looking good for technology websites,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.120
maybe modern techs, something like this.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.715
For kids or maybe teenagers,

00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:33.095
then we have another,

00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:36.035
like modern tech is dangerous for kids, says me.

00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:38.290
This is just our fun heading.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:45.240
So it is also some geometric Sans Serif with very roundy shapes,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.010
not perfect rounds, but oval type roundy shapes.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.460
Then we have at the bottom,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.750
we are most innovative design studio in New York.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:02.930
This one is a bit serious and geometric Sans Serif and it is related to design studio,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:10.430
so maybe we want to say some seriousness with our work innovation, something like this,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.875
so I use this font maybe,

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.420
you might choose another font,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.880
so this depends on each designer and its taste but this is just to train your eyes.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.210
Now, we have business theme.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.910
Business is related to seriousness or maybe power or something like this,

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.140
so these fonts, even they are looking very similar to each other,

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.550
they are Sans Serif.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.074
They have very serious theme,

00:08:39.074 --> 00:08:41.820
they are not showing any much roundness,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.505
you can see over here the edges are totally flat.

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:49.520
I have seen a lot of new designers that are

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.670
using very modern type of fonts with business themes,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.010
so this is just your judgment,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.010
this is just to train your eye if you want to.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.175
Go with some modern type of font,

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:04.600
you can go with it, that's not a problem.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.825
This is the fashion theme,

00:09:06.825 --> 00:09:11.585
some elegant looking fonts or typefaces here,

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:16.530
some are very slim and dull just like models, supermodels.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.450
Although I don't personally like very slim models,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:26.075
they look like sticks and maybe clothes hanging on the sticks,

00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:28.115
so that's my own opinion,

00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:30.790
don't take it personally.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.990
Now, the second one is a bit classical,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:39.690
maybe wrist watches, so I am using some humanist font,

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.115
you can see the e in the watches and the latest,

00:09:44.115 --> 00:09:46.890
you can see e is very slanted,

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.190
it has a very slanted slope.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:56.620
So it is basically a humanist font and it is related to classical old type,

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.180
so we've used this one.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.055
Then, we have very geometric font at the bottom,

00:10:04.055 --> 00:10:08.635
which is fashion design is not just about clothes, it's about you.

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:12.230
It is related to some geometry,

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.695
it's very geometric, very thin and slim,

00:10:15.695 --> 00:10:19.415
the dots are what you can see,

00:10:19.415 --> 00:10:26.764
the dots on the eyes are vertical and just like slim rectangles.

00:10:26.764 --> 00:10:31.505
So this is how I choose different fonts for different themes.

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:34.040
Let's see some more examples for fashion theme,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.090
you can see again,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.010
I'm using Bodoni modern fonts,

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:41.000
you might have seen it on a lot of websites.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.240
Bodoni fonts are modern fonts like this one,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.145
fashion designers these days are idiots.

00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:53.370
They're not idiots, it is just what I think sometimes.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.825
Super models are very thin just like broomsticks, yeah, that's true.

00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:01.430
Vivaldi 2.0, the latest in classical wrist watches on sale.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.340
So I try to use different fonts this time,

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.005
most of them are Bodoni,

00:11:06.005 --> 00:11:10.730
they have very thick and thin alteration of strokes.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.660
So this is how we use Bodoni fonts in fashion themes.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.925
Now, we have sports theme.

00:11:16.925 --> 00:11:24.720
So you can see here I have four different theme lines.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.040
Can you run like a cheetah?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.200
It is very slim,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.420
slanted to run like a cheetah,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.745
so it is showing me speed when it's italic.

00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:38.025
Then we have 69 pushups to get your belly slim today,

00:11:38.025 --> 00:11:41.820
so it is very hard exercise, pushups.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.985
I think I can't go more than 10 in my current condition.

00:11:47.985 --> 00:11:57.500
Now, so I am using very hard or very tough textured font on this one.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.100
Then we have, if an elephant can get slim, you can too.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:08.250
Now, you can see how I've used [inaudible] in this line to show my theme,

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.390
it is a fun theme but you can see if

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.335
an elephant is bold and then slim is a bit more slimmer.

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:19.775
So this is how I used different weights to convey my message.

00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:22.655
Then, we have Fantasy Football is here.

00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:24.770
This is an announcement.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.590
So it is in very thick bold letters.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.275
I saw this font used on

00:12:31.275 --> 00:12:38.890
Yahoo advertisement on yahoo.com,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.560
so I just tried this one over here.
