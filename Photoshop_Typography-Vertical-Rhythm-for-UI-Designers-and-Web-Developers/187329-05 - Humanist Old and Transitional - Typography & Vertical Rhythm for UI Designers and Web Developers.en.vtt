00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.510
In this lesson, we are going to see

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.565
different classification of types so we can use them effectively.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:12.510
Before going into seeing different classes of types,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.435
we are going to learn about diagonal stress.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:17.625
You can see at the bottom of here,

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:21.510
the O, I have shown a diagonal stress.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.060
You can see this O has varying rates of strokes,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.970
so here on the sides it is a bit thick,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.575
and where I have put the diagonal stress,

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.875
it is basically the slimmest stroke.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:39.380
Where the stroke is slimmest,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.110
you just draw the line from slimmest to slimmest and it shows the diagonals stress.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.330
This is one of the factor in identifying different fonts.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.365
Now the first one is humanists.

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:56.010
Humanist, as the name suggest,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.395
it is basically how humans write with the pen in the old times.

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:07.630
You can see the strokes and the writing style looks like human writing with a pen.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.425
Now, it has two basic factors to identify it,

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:21.840
one is this very sloping cross bar of e. You can see it is like 30 or 40 degree angle,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.090
and you can see here in the letter Bear how it is written.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.310
Second is, you can see the serifs at the bottom of this n I have pointed out.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.370
You can see the serifs are bit curved like a human foot,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.790
so this is one other factor.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.425
So this is three factors.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:47.955
It has a very good diagonal stress,

00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:55.035
very slanted, and then we have sloping cross bar and then we have foot style serifs.

00:01:55.035 --> 00:02:00.730
Now I have shown you old style or garalde.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.875
These are two different classes,

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:09.430
old style and transitional.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.130
Old style was a bit old and transitional was built upon,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.460
or you can say,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.005
improvised version of this old style.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:26.280
Now, the old style have very few factors to identify it,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.795
one is this diagonal stress,

00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:30.080
it has a good diagonal stress,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.880
less than the humanists,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.700
but it has good diagonal stress.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.810
Then the top of these you can see these ascenders and descenders,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.155
they have this slope serif end,

00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:48.600
and then we have this W,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.310
it is very unique property of this old style or garamond garalde style.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.060
You can see over here the W have crossed version,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.255
so they are overlapping,

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:05.520
it's like two V's,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.710
V letters are overlapping with each other.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.480
You can see I have highlighted this e. Inside the e,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.650
it is basically counter,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.675
so they have very less counter space.

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:23.720
You can see here we have inside the e letter,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.660
then they have at the top of the T,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.115
you can see there beaks are somewhat slanted,

00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:36.605
and then if we look at the serifs,

00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:44.210
you can see at the end of the h letter they are not totally straight,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.550
they are a bit curvy.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.420
This is all about old style,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.290
main factors are this W and the beak,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.550
and these slanted tops of d letter and a bit

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.520
of this diagonal stress in all you can see over here.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.465
Also you can see that the R letter have a caving stroke at the end,

00:04:10.465 --> 00:04:14.040
and if you look at transitional,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.685
there are a lot of differences with this.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:19.835
You can see at the top of the d,

00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:26.250
the serif is a bit very pointy,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.235
then diagonal stress is almost straight.

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:33.770
You can see diagonal stress is almost straight,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.165
and also you can see inside this e letter,

00:04:38.165 --> 00:04:43.850
the counter is a bit wider or a bit more bigger than the old style,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.225
then we have this W. W is not overlapping,

00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:48.935
it is a bit different,

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:52.010
and then also the beaks of this T letter,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.425
they are also pointing downwards a bit structural.

00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:58.075
You can say a bit structural.

00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:02.870
Also, there is one more difference I forgot about.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.090
If you see the stroke difference in the old style,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.650
stroke difference is that if you see this letter h,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.250
you can see here at the end of the h,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.095
we have a bit of less stroke contrast.

00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:24.965
The thick and the thin are very close to each other,

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:26.870
but in the transitional,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.530
you can see the strokes are very a lot,

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.120
thin is very thinner and the thick is a bit more thicker.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.515
This is also one difference between old style and transitional style.

00:05:39.515 --> 00:05:42.485
Here are some examples of old style.

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:46.000
This is adobe devanagari font,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.455
and you can see over here how this font has laid out,

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:53.885
it is an italic version of the font.

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:58.120
Still you can see that T is a bit slanted,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.775
and in this font you can see it is maybe a different version,

00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:06.840
so that is why in different fonts some features cannot be found.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.320
Like here we have W. W is just like the transitional font,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.090
so sometimes these typhus designers,

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.290
they mix different properties of two fonts.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.720
Then we have this Minion, Pro,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.450
it is also old style font.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.170
You can see over here still the W is different,

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:40.575
but other properties like this ending of this r and the top sluts and top serifs,

00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:45.940
they are almost like the old style.
