00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
Let's talk about responsive typography for those who

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.915
are coders and front end designers or coders they know that this is a very big problem.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:16.545
There are two ways there might be a lot of

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:20.160
few plugins available from jQuery or something like that,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.610
but I normally use these two solutions.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.480
Responsive topography means that your font sizes should adjust according to screen size.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.260
If you have a very big font size like

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.470
80 pixels or 61 pixel font or maybe 70 pixel font on a large screen.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.370
Do you think that on a small device like maybe

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.915
480 pixels wide it is good or relevant size?

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:56.885
No, because your font size will be too big for that small screen,

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:02.005
maybe the whole screen will be filled up with just your heading.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.470
Do you really want that? No, okay.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.605
We are going to see what are the solutions for that problem.

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:16.490
The first solution I am going to talk about is using HTML font size percentage value.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.820
What we do here is that we fix the font size

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.365
our base font size and line height in HTML element.

00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:28.355
HTML basically is the top element.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:34.820
It is going to control everything the size of every font or every text on your page.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.290
For small screens or maybe medium screens you set

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.950
the font size to some percentage so that is relevant to your desktop screen.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.870
If you have like 18 pixel font on your desktop screen or large for

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.460
large screens for small screens you set them to 80 percent.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.830
You can set on medium screens to 90 percent.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.725
It is a bit cheap solution for this one because our paddings,

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:15.320
margins and everything else will be the same it might generate some problem,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.975
but it is a good solution.

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:21.980
Reduce the font size to 80 percent from base size.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.510
If your heading is like 60 pixels it might

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.630
become 50 pixels or maybe less than that on small screens.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.990
This is one way.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.910
I will show you examples coding examples for both these solutions.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.560
This is the first solution.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.360
Let's have a look at the second solution.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.980
Second solution is more advanced or you can

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.120
say it is more efficient than the previous one.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.080
Here we use two separate type scales for our different screens.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.240
For my mobile screen or small screens,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.950
I might be using type scale which scales less when

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.600
upgraded from 18 pixel to some other heading size.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.050
For desktop screen I might have

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.740
a very abrupt scale which scales with a lot of change from one font size to another.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.365
Let me show you an example with using modular scale website.

00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:31.890
Here we have the modular scale website.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.390
I am going to use 18 pixel and my base.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.440
My first ratio will be 1.5 or you can have

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.330
1.44 which we were using in our previous exercises.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:52.470
What you can do is you can use the second one like 1.2 to something like this.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.145
You can see B size and A size these are two different sizes.

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:07.004
On mobile screens our first font size will be 18 pixel then it will be 22 pixels

00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:14.780
then it will be 27 pixels approximately,then it will be 32 pixels or 33 pixels.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.675
Or if you want to go more ahead of this you can go to 40 pixels.

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:25.590
But you can see our top ratio which was blue one over here.You can

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.620
see 18 pixel is our base which is in black and the next stop is 26 pixels,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:41.400
then 37 pixels, then 54 pixels or maybe like the 77 pixels.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.785
We have a very big range of change in one ratio and in

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:51.470
the other ratio which we are going to set for

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.555
our mobile or small devices we are going to use less or smaller ratio.

00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:06.695
One other advice is I have seen on different websites or experts they say that if

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:16.050
your ratio is 1.5 try to get the other ratio which is like with the difference of 0.25.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.730
This is basically not going to abruptly change scaling issue,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.730
so it is basically a step-by-step change,

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.360
one step is going to be 0.25.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:41.775
We are basically increasing or decreasing the ratio with 0.25 which is the half of 5.5.

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:45.265
If I have like 1.44,

00:05:45.265 --> 00:05:50.300
I might go to something like 1.2 to something like this.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.425
It seems more rational and this is

00:05:54.425 --> 00:06:00.500
how there are two modulus scales for different screens.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.320
You can have a third one but I think for tablets and

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:13.300
large screens one ratio is enough and one is good for your mobile and smaller screens.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.370
These are the solutions we use for responsive topography.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.905
You might find a lot of JavaScript tools or maybe plug-ins.

00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:26.720
I will share one resources document containing all the links or

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.250
maybe the JavaScript plugins I found on this topic,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.170
but right now I'm more concerned on CSS solutions rather

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.530
than including another JavaScript extra file.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.920
This is all about responsive topography.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.700
In the next two lessons we are going to see the examples for both of them.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.400
We are going to use these scales,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.830
so let's get started and move on to the next lesson.
