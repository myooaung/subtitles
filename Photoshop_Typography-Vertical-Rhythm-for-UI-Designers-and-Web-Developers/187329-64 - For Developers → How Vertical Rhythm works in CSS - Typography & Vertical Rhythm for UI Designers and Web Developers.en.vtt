00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Now you are familiar with vertical spacing or vertical rhythm,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.985
but how these calculations are going to actually work in CSS.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.690
To control your vertical spacing in CSS of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.655
different typographic elements or even your other graphic elements,

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:19.950
images or buttons or something like that,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.275
you need to use margins,

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.555
padding, and line height.

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:29.670
Now keep in mind all these things will be relative to our baseline height.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.540
If you have a baseline of like 27 pixels,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.490
your margins and paddings and line heights will be

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.975
multiples of 27 pixels or maybe half of these baseline height.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:44.750
Now how this is calculated is we need a total height

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.210
which must be a multiple of our baseline.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.610
Here you can see that margin top is 27 pixels as my baseline is 27 pixels.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.534
Margin bottom is also equal to baseline,

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:02.245
and the line height is also equal to baseline.

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:05.280
Total height will be 81 pixels.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.370
If it's a single line,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.100
our line of text it will be equal to 81 pixels height.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.150
This is how the height is going to be calculated in our browser.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.600
It can be multiple of this baseline height,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.315
or it should be multiple of baseline height or

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:26.445
equal to baseline height that can also work.

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:27.930
Here is another example.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.065
Sometime you can use half of your baseline height.

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.860
If you are using half of your baseline height,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.675
I don't recommend using these 13.5 pixels or half pixels values.

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:45.425
You can use instead 13 pixels and 14 pixels.

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:49.605
The total height will again be 54 pixels.

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:52.730
Fifty four is also a multiple of baseline,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.965
so we are not going to worry about it.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:59.255
It is going to fit in our vertical rhythm very nicely.

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:05.390
Make sure you don't use these 0.5 or 0.5 half pixel values,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.635
you can use 14 pixels and 13 pixels.

00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:13.100
One more thing. Sometimes, if you are trying to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.960
achieve maybe some tagline or some headlines,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.540
something like that and you don't want to use

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.430
the same font size you have already used in your scale factor,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.750
you want to deviate from here how you are going to vertical space that element.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.250
For example, I change the line height.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.475
I don't like the line height of my tag line.

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.640
You can say very spacious.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.605
Maybe taking too much space.

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:44.840
I am going to set it to 32 pixels.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.890
I have changed the line height and I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.465
actually need the total height which must be equal to the multiple of baseline.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:57.020
What I'm going to do is 54 minus 32,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.000
and I'm left with 22 pixels.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.345
I divided them into top margin and margin-bottom,

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:04.715
which is 11 pixels, 11 pixels.

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:07.490
Total is again 54 pixels.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.895
We achieved the word equal rhythm again.

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:14.240
Here is an example of vertical spacing,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.300
how we are going to use this technique.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.250
If you can see my heading,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.375
I am using margin top and margin-bottom for the heading and the line height.

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:30.130
Add all these three and the total block is where everything is gray.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.965
This is that space that is going to take.

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:36.470
Then we have our paragraph text.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.300
You can see it is all red,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.585
so one line height is equal to 27 pixels.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:47.250
It is going to be 27 pixels for each line.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.835
The margin bottom, I'm only using margin bottom over here.

00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:57.125
Some experts they suggest that you should only use

00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:02.790
margin bottom for all your elements to achieve vertical spacing.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.720
In this situation, I am using only margin-bottom and I'm not using

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.555
margin top because margin top is basically I'm getting from my heading.

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:18.680
Heading already have a lot of padding or margin at the bottom,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.185
so I don't need more space over here.

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:24.730
This is how we use different calculations.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.885
Let me show you an example.

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:31.270
Here is Bootstrap Custom Typographic Scale.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.164
This is the last exercise we are going to do with Bootstrap.

00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:37.280
Although it is very,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.390
very difficult to achieve vertically them in

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.685
Bootstrap because there are too many elements to chain the padding and everything.

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:52.650
Bootstrap really sucks at typographic scales or typographic rhythm.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.765
Here I have this heading at the top. It is heading one.

00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:59.479
If I right-click and inspect element,

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.365
you can see the spacing around it.

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:07.590
Its height total is 135,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.465
which is also a multiple of 27 pixels.

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:19.675
Right now my typographic scale baseline is 27 pixels.

00:05:19.675 --> 00:05:24.185
You can see I have padding top which is 27 pixels,

00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:26.795
and then I have padding bottom,

00:05:26.795 --> 00:05:29.335
which is also 27 pixels.

00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:35.450
This is how I have used padding top and bottom in this heading one.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.190
My line height is equal to 81 pixels.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.890
This is basically the height.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.820
If you see over here computed styles,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.520
you can see font size is 61 and line height is 81.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.640
You can see over here.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.290
Then we have no margin top and bottom.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.910
We have padding bottom and top margin,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.890
which is equal to 27 pixels,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.750
which is my baseline.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.800
Now, as you can see at the bottom all these elements,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.780
our paragraphs heading 3,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.025
this one is heading 2,

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:18.540
they're all perfectly aligned with our vertical rhythm or baseline.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.940
You can see even the image I have used,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:29.040
the height of the image I have set to the baseline multiple 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.630
27 multiplied by nine,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.115
I don't know what is it,

00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:34.900
but it's equal to this one.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.290
Now, this is how I have used my margins and everything else.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.339
Let me show you one other example which is offbeat example.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.810
This is 32 pixel,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.105
line height text 32 pixels.

00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:52.925
Let's see how this is laid out.

00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:55.505
Font size is 32 pixels,

00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:57.275
line height is 32 pixels,

00:06:57.275 --> 00:07:00.730
margin bottom is 27 pixels.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.490
You can see padding bottom and padding top is 11 pixels.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.950
You can see over here 11 pixels.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:14.790
This is how I have used my own custom settings to achieve the vertical rhythm,

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.115
you can say in the same context.

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:26.190
So 11 and 11 and 32 is equal to 54.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.425
Basically 54 is again the multiple of our baseline,

00:07:32.425 --> 00:07:35.500
which is 27 pixels.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:42.705
Let me show you one other example where I have eliminated, this one.

00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:44.460
This is also 54,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.030
but here what I am doing is I am not using any padding,

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.980
any margin or anything,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.535
just the line height to achieve this.

00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:56.910
Now, why I have used line-height?

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:03.365
Because I didn't want to get too close to this paragraph.

00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:10.195
I use line height to achieve this rhythm or this spacing, vertical spacing.

00:08:10.195 --> 00:08:14.490
This is how you use your margins,

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:20.480
padding and line height to achieve vertical rhythm and vertical spacing.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.675
This is how we use CSS to achieve vertical rhythm or vertical spacing.

00:08:25.675 --> 00:08:29.230
Let's move on to the next lesson.
