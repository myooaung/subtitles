00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Now, let's start creating its logo first,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.860
we are going to select Text Tool or type T on the keyboard to select this tool.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.030
We are going to select Aleo font.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.055
I think it was bold,

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.940
and size must be 36 points,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.370
and color will be this one,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.570
I think aaafb2, press "OK".

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.760
Click anywhere and write F-A-S-T. Fast is basically the firm name,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.565
we just imagined it.

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:39.345
There was something below it,

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:43.560
a orange line just to emphasize that it's a logo.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.190
It's a dummy logo, so don't worry if you worry too much that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.780
why and where this logo has came from.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.565
Just drag a line below it.

00:00:56.565 --> 00:01:03.460
Just remove this stroke and use this color orange.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.150
This orange color we used over here,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.260
it is a bit of flat orange but a bit sharp like that.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.490
Right now, don't worry about the placements.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.475
Just create a group over here called Logo so everything is organized.

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:23.200
This is our main container,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.055
so name it Container.

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:27.240
This is our background,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.885
so make it Background.

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:34.340
Always use naming convention which is meaning-able and easy to understand.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.670
Otherwise, it will create a very big mess in the end.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.775
Now for this top navigation we are going to use font, which is Aller.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:47.665
So basically we are using two fonts; Aller and Bitter.

00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:53.710
I'm going to use Aller regular and font size will be 18 points,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.820
shift it to 18 and color will be a bit more dark grayish color,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.560
maybe this one, I think it was not this one,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.870
it was this one, 333683, press "OK".

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.675
First one was About us.

00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:17.430
Why I cannot see because I have can move it up, About us.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.660
Then we had Case Studies, Recent and Contact.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.030
I advise you that you use another copy.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.900
Case studies, now all these have been created.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.070
Let's move the last one which is Contact to the end where we need it.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.700
Highlight your rows and columns by clicking "Control Semicolon",

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.840
select all of these and we are going to align them like this.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.210
This is basically distribute it horizontally.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.850
Sometimes still it doesn't distribute it horizontally very nicely.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.335
You can see About us,

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:03.525
has been moved over here.

00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:06.980
I need it to be over here, and then again,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.070
I'm going to select it like that.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.390
I need Case Studies to be over here.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.905
Let's arrange it again.

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:22.650
No worries if Recent is over here,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.950
so let's keep it like that.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.730
Now, we are going to create these three bars over here.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.645
For that, we are going to use this rectangular tool,

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:36.015
which is our rectangle.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:39.875
You can also use this rounded rectangle if you want.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:44.920
I think I have used rounded rectangle may be like this.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.860
It has some grayish color like that.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.730
Over here, we are going to select the color,

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.810
maybe this one, maybe lighter grayish color.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.695
Duplicate it, one, two. Like that.

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:15.520
Group them and we have our navigation over here.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.820
If you want to move it up,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.265
you can move it up over here.

00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:21.350
Just keep the distance,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.075
which is going to be 1,

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:26.380
2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.460
We can also add a few more,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.930
maybe six more, 1,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.280
2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.960
The total distance from top is 30 pixels.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.475
I'm not right now,

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:51.410
considering my baseline, so right now I am free of my baseline.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.840
Sometimes when you are designing,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.810
you don't need to think too much about baseline when you

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.810
don't have a very long paragraphs or

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.800
very long texts to edit or you need to design for blogs or something like that.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.170
Right now I'm designing for the header.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.965
So I am just using my blocks of legos to arrange everything.

00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:18.020
Four rows or four sections,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.384
horizontally and vertically, I have 12 columns.

00:05:22.384 --> 00:05:26.450
Let's name it Menu or Nav, navigation.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.765
Let's move it up, align with this.

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:36.335
Why I'm using groups because I can easily align them with each other.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:39.995
This one has been aligned with this easily.

00:05:39.995 --> 00:05:42.935
Also, you can double-click it and you can

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:46.010
change the color of the whole group simultaneously.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.935
Color Overlay, and we are going to use some color overlay over here like this,

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:56.960
this looks great rather than too dark grayish color.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.310
Also, this is called Hamburger menu.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.790
Our tab bar is almost ready.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.370
Let's align the logos too with these.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.380
Maybe I need to have 1, 2,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.775
3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:06:20.775 --> 00:06:24.710
I guess 16 multiplied by 2 is equal to 32.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.590
So let's move it four pixels over here,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.740
1, 2, 3, 1, 2.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.660
So 32 pixels, I have moved it from top.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.810
Let's move them two pixels below, one and two.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.210
A great design is basically very calculated.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.130
So don't think that

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.590
you need to be very creative to design this.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.330
I think you need to be very analytical to design this.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:08.194
Let's hide this and see what are the distances between our elements.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:12.875
I still think that there is much more distance between About and Recent.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:19.670
Let's use our inner gut feeling to align these.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:27.725
I am going to move it over here and move the Recent over there.

00:07:27.725 --> 00:07:30.020
Let's move it like that.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.200
Let's move the Content two times over here.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.850
Now, it is looking perfect.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.970
You can see how I used my inner sense,

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.475
or gut feeling to align these.

00:07:45.475 --> 00:07:49.985
Don't always rely on these grids.

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:54.610
Right now I'm using this area for the navigation, 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.810
5, 6 columns, and two columns for this logo.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.760
This is how I am lining everything up.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.640
Now, I need the text over here,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.860
which is going to be in Bitter.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.590
I'm going to use this whole block,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.550
1, 2, 3, 4 columns.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:21.525
Let's paste some texts over here,

00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:22.695
which was this one,

00:08:22.695 --> 00:08:26.280
see how Woo-Commerce and everything.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.080
I am using Bitter over here,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.729
and the font size is 43,

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:34.675
as I mentioned earlier in our typographic skill. Let's copy it.

00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:40.320
I am going to use Notepad to paste it because it will paste the whole style.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.995
I want you to see me while styling this text.

00:08:44.995 --> 00:08:47.720
Let's paste it over here.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.905
This one is fake layer,

00:08:49.905 --> 00:08:51.735
this one was real.

00:08:51.735 --> 00:08:54.120
This is our text.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.050
What we're going to do is we're going to select Bitter over here.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.930
This will be Bitter Bold.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.840
I don't know, was it bold or whatever?

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.690
Let's see. No, it wasn't bold, it was regular.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:14.770
Now 43 and I selected the line-height to be 60.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.600
You can see over here.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.545
Now the space looks a bit less over here.

00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:23.680
I don't know why it is not fitting up over here.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.415
Let's expand this to the next one.

00:09:27.415 --> 00:09:29.260
So 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.485
5 columns, right now we are using over here.

00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:38.335
Now I'm going to select this and I'm going to use some darker color over here.

00:09:38.335 --> 00:09:40.850
I think it was this one.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.560
Is it getting below some layer?

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:54.465
I think it was inside this group and I had applied color overlay on this navigation.

00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:56.770
So I have moved it out.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:04.450
I'm going to use a bit of dull bluish-gray color over here.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.060
I think this looks great.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.470
I'll be a bit less.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.330
This looks great, now I am going to use this.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:22.915
Select this first and I'm going to use this dull grayish-blue color.

00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:24.430
This area is ready.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.740
Now let's create our button over here.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.330
So for the button I'm going to use rounded rectangle,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.040
and we are going to use some size.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.545
Let's use 240 by 36.

00:10:41.545 --> 00:10:43.600
Let's try this one,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.510
and our radius will be 30.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.730
Let's use 30 over here,

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.130
and 30 over here,

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.415
and 30 over here, and 30 over here.

00:10:54.415 --> 00:10:56.185
So it is very slim.

00:10:56.185 --> 00:11:00.580
Let's create a bit more height,

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.770
a bit more big button.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:09.400
Maybe we can use 16 multiply by 3 is 48, I guess.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.175
Yeah. I think 48 is closer.

00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:15.085
Let's see what was the size I used over here.

00:11:15.085 --> 00:11:24.400
Control D, and the height was 60 pixels.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.360
So I think 64 will be in our range for our baseline height or everything.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.930
Let's use it over here.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:39.080
So I'm going to use 64 pixels.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.250
Let's color it something else right now.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:54.055
Now we have some problem with roundness.

00:11:54.055 --> 00:11:57.160
I have shifted it to 32 pixels.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.320
Now it's perfectly round.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.010
We have created our button.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.670
Let's move it a bit down below,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.535
maybe in this area,

00:12:09.535 --> 00:12:12.430
or maybe if we need to space it out,

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.915
we can use 1, 2,

00:12:13.915 --> 00:12:16.240
3, and 1, 2.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.315
So 32 pixels away from this area.

00:12:19.315 --> 00:12:21.940
Let's see how much of it it was from this area.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.290
I think it was in the middle of these two, top and bottom.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:31.870
Maybe you should need to use your inner gut over here, so don't worry.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.890
Also, I think you can see over here I have fixed it in two columns.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.905
So right now it is extended from this column.

00:12:38.905 --> 00:12:44.575
We are going to contract it from here.

00:12:44.575 --> 00:12:50.935
We are going to fix it in two columns, like that.

00:12:50.935 --> 00:12:57.535
Let's move it a bit more below 10 pixels and one, two.

00:12:57.535 --> 00:13:01.960
It is right now 48 pixels away from the top.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:08.420
So we are going to use Aler over here,

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:19.795
so 16 pixel points, Learn more.

00:13:19.795 --> 00:13:22.945
It is looking really cool.

00:13:22.945 --> 00:13:29.360
Let's change its color to white, like that.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.860
What is happening with me?

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.790
For the icon over here, the arrow icon,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:45.100
I have used this plug-in called Font Awesome PS.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.265
I'm going to search over here arrow,

00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:54.330
and it will show me all the arrows inside this Font Awesome.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:59.430
This is the arrow I have used because ultimately I'm going to give it to coders.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:05.895
So this will be a very big help if they can use this arrow over here.

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:08.660
Let's move this arrow.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.810
It places a very small arrow,

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:17.170
so don't get confused where is my arrow or it has been kidnapped somewhere.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.345
Let's use white right now and move the size up.

00:14:22.345 --> 00:14:26.800
I'm going to zoom in and Control T,

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.500
and let's press "Shift" and "Alt Shift Option",

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.000
and we are going to increase the size like that.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.520
I think the size is almost perfect.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.540
Now we have created our button.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.010
Let's put the text over here.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.440
Right now don't worry about this button color.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.620
We are going to give some final touches in the end.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.765
So this is the text.

00:14:52.765 --> 00:14:57.625
I think I should have copied it before starting this course;

00:14:57.625 --> 00:15:00.970
somewhere like that, somewhere here.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.045
This is a bit of inconvenience for you,

00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:07.015
but I think you should bear it with me.

00:15:07.015 --> 00:15:09.700
Now you can see over here,

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.830
this is the area I'm using.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.040
Now as soon as this area ends over here,

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.970
this block, I am going to put my text over here.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:28.090
I'm going to put text over here like that Control V. These are two layers,

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.140
let's color it with this gray right now.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:39.730
I think they have a lot of separation due to this line-height.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.205
So I have fixed the line-height to 24,

00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:48.145
and I think we need to make this one a bit more grayish like that.

00:15:48.145 --> 00:15:51.380
So I've used this button color.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.935
If you are designing,

00:15:53.935 --> 00:15:57.865
it is better and wise that you first use gray colors.

00:15:57.865 --> 00:16:02.920
So try to use shades of grays on all your design rather than using any color.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.630
Then in the end,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.300
use one or two colors to highlight everything.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:13.285
This is another great tip to get you started and create a very great design.

00:16:13.285 --> 00:16:15.835
Let's move on to the next lesson where we will be

00:16:15.835 --> 00:16:19.790
giving some final touches to this design.
