00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.575
Hello guys. This is the same design we did in the last lesson.

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:08.789
I just did some of the fine adjustments.

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.660
I guess that I should share them with you.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.820
First thing is that I moved all these elements in the center.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.560
I reduce the size of this text from 50 points to 45,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.820
just a bit bigger than this button.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.930
If you want to align it with the button, I think it's okay,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.565
but it feels better to me like there.

00:00:34.565 --> 00:00:37.135
Also follow this background,

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:39.720
it was something closer to this area.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.655
Grayish and orange.

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:47.440
I moved it in a bit more top portion where it is more peachy color.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.995
Something closer to this,

00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:52.305
or maybe this one.

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:59.955
Then the third thing I did is I edit some effect,

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:04.640
you can see here it is orange and here it is a reddish peachy color.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.685
They are like peachy color scheme altogether.

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:11.970
Reddish and orange colors,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.110
if you ever seen a peachy,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.150
all these colors are from the peachy,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.995
I guess yellow, this color and this button color.

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:26.100
What I did is I added an inner shadow with this color, e55f50.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.860
What I did is I just moved the slider a bit down and this is all I did.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.280
I use the settings distance 81 because I need a very good area covered over here.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.560
You can also do it with gradient overlay.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.200
There are many things you can do to apply the same style.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.180
The size is 128.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.465
This is what I did.

00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:56.045
Also, I changed the size of this one,

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:58.040
I think a bit 81 points.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.585
I moved it from 83 to 81 points.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:04.560
That is all I think I did.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.955
I think it is looking perfect.

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:13.430
I showed you this because I believe that design is progressive thing.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.145
You try and try to improve it again and again.

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:23.375
If you are designing something and it is not looking very good,

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.630
get up from your seat and maybe come back

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.595
later after 30 minutes and start your design again.

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:34.205
I added few things over here.

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:36.320
I'm going to share this PSD with you,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.344
don't forget to download this PSD.

00:02:40.344 --> 00:02:42.840
This is all about this design,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.120
in the next lesson we are going to design the alternative version of this one.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.950
Just we are going to change some colors.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.620
That's all, all the design will remain same.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.050
Let's move on to the next lesson.
