00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.305
Let's see what we will be covering in this course,

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:09.345
and designing in this course,

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:11.610
and developing in this course.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.130
These are not Dribbble shots,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.130
these are actual exercises of this course,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.150
so let's see them.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.020
This is one of them. Another one.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.915
Let's hide the grids.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:29.295
There is another one, and another one,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.140
another one, another one,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.440
another one, and also this one.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.799
Few more ads, we will be designing like these,

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.750
and there is one more theme for this ad,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.905
you can see over here.

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:49.550
But how we are going to achieve this,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.975
we are going to learn the effective use of typography grids using white space.

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:02.505
We will master the time and space skills for designers,

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:05.550
and actually it's called white space.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.220
This is all for designers.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.430
We will also learn how to match different font,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.480
how to pair them,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.090
how to select effective fonts,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.450
how to convey your message using typography.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.040
How to effectively use grids to design different layouts and a lot of great stuff.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.010
Even for developers, I have a lot of interesting stuff like this VW unit,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.585
you can see over here how it expands and contracts with the responsive web design,

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:39.440
and we will discuss a lot of

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.630
responsive web design typography or it is called basically responsive topography.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.640
You can see over here it in action, large, medium.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.645
You can see how the font size is shifting.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:56.210
For small, you can see the heading size just shifted.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.435
Then we will discuss how to use custom typographic skills in Bootstrap.

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:05.060
Also in Bootstrap, how we are going to use

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.040
custom typographic skill with a blog post like this.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.260
This is also called vertical rhythm.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.160
We have also implemented vertical rhythm in this exercise.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.755
So to learn all about these techniques and standards for typography in CSS and HTML,

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:28.390
you are going to really enjoy this course.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.775
There is more exciting stuff in this course like

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:39.895
mobile screens and their font sizes and PT, SP, DPI, DIP,

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:46.730
all different screen resolutions mess and how we are going to design with this mess.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.985
So these are few IOS devices,

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:54.980
all different devices having the same blog post designed for them.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.585
This is one of the exercise.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:59.540
Also, we are going to look for Google Android

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.080
typography skill and how to use it effectively.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.780
Also, I will share with you a secret how to connect your screen or how to see

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.689
this design on your mobile screens so you can easily choose and select fonts,

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.285
and design, and colors, and everything else.

00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:19.550
So seeing is believing.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.824
If you can see your design directly on a mobile screen,

00:03:23.824 --> 00:03:26.180
you can design a lot better.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.980
Okay, now the question is,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.680
who should take this course?

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.020
I don't recommend very novice designers or designers who

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.410
have just started using Photoshop to take this course.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.350
This is a medium level difficulty course,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.960
so all the designers who already know a bit of Photoshop and they know how to use it,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.525
they know the shortcuts,

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:47.910
they should take this course.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.090
Also, all the developers who know basics of HTML and CSS are welcome.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.730
If you just started learning CSS and HTML,

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.115
I think this course is not for you.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:00.125
You might not understand few things.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:04.850
Also, I need you to download and install latest version of Photoshop CC.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.305
Any designer who think that his design have something missing or something strange,

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:16.024
then he should really take this course to improve your design.

00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:19.685
I am sure that this course is going to improve

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:25.370
your designs a lot even to the Dribbble level or Behance level designers.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.809
So let's dig in and get started,

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:33.060
and I will see you in the course.
