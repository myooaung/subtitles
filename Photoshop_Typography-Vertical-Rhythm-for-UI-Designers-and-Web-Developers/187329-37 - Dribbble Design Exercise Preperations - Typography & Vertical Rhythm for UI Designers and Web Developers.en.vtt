00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.685
In this exercise, we are going to create something similar to this one.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:08.970
First, I'm going to show you the resources we are going

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.210
to use and the fonts we're going to use.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.925
Let me show you the resources.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.335
For the background image,

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.780
I have used this pixabay.com.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.450
You can see over here iPad tablet.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.590
You can search over here,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.085
iPad tablet and I think this image will appear.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.100
For the fonts, I am using three fonts.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.845
One is Bitter by Google fonts, this one.

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:33.315
You can search over here.

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:35.265
Then, we have Aller font,

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:38.280
which is a free font from Font Squirrel.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.165
I really like this font.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:44.060
Then, we are using Aleo font just for the logo.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.810
So it is not going to be used in the design,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.040
just for the logo.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.810
Then for the modulus scale,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.560
actually, I didn't use any modulus scale.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.710
I just used 42,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.605
16, and 18 pixel, three values.

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:02.360
But actually, I found a scale which is related to this ratio,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.635
16 pixel base and 1.15 ratio,

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:09.285
and you can get the same values I have used 16,

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:13.380
18, and 42 or 43.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.210
So you can use this scale.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.195
In the end, we are going to use this Galaxy hand mock up file,

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:23.105
free file from graphicburger.com,

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:25.310
and we are going to use it in our design.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.395
You can use any of this,

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:30.340
as we don't have any mobile app right now,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.310
so we are going to use the same preview over here.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.520
Let's get started.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.115
First of all, we are going to just set up our canvas.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:42.230
Let's go ahead, new file.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.200
I'm going to select 1,920 by 1,080 full HD.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.455
Don't color manage this document,

00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:54.405
square pixels, and we're going to click "OK", like that.

00:01:54.405 --> 00:02:01.130
Then, we are going to drag over this image into our Photoshop like this,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.230
and just try to expand it so it covers the whole canvas like that.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.310
Then in the middle, we are going to create a rectangle.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.885
Click over here once,

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:21.965
and the rectangle width should be 1,360 by 784.

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:26.600
So 784 is basically divisible by 16 pixels,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.740
so I am considering this size in height.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.390
Let's create this.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.335
Let's hide its border.

00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:41.615
Select an grayish styled color over here,

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:47.260
and we are going to move it in the middle, like that.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.140
Now, the first step is we're going to create some guides, columns,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.865
and some gutters and all the stuff around this layer.

00:02:55.865 --> 00:03:01.585
The best way in this situation is I'm going to use a plug-in called as GuideGuide.

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:03.960
First, I'm going to make a selection,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.805
control click around this layer,

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:07.860
and our margin is 0, 0,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.485
0, and 0, 12 columns.

00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:17.280
Number of rows, I am going to divide it into four sections.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.020
Here we have 1, 2, 3,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.585
and 4, so four sections.

00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:30.645
Then, we have no width and here is our gutter size 20 and let's add the guides like that.

00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:34.905
Now, if you don't have this plug-in, don't worry,

00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:36.675
you need to create,

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:39.255
first, the document size.

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:45.820
In this instance, you are going to create 1,360 and 784.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.850
Just create this document first and build some guides around it,

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.950
like this, New Guide Layout,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.680
12 columns, 20, and leave the margins around it like that.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.220
Press "OK". So if you don't have this plug-in,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.455
your first step will be this one.

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:08.600
So first, you need to create this document,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:16.575
then go to this canvas size and expand your canvas size to 1,920 by 1,080.

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:18.450
Press "OK".

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.235
Now you can see your canvas has been expanded and your guides have over there.

00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:28.295
So you can use these guides like that.

00:04:28.295 --> 00:04:30.590
But right now, I'm using this plug-in.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.870
So just to ease the steps,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.845
I'm using this method.

00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:42.015
Let's make a bit more white color, whitish gray color.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:45.935
Now our modular grid has been created.

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:50.630
We have a lot of columns and four rows.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.565
We are going to use all these rows to create our design.

00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:58.250
In the next lesson, we are going to design over this canvas.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.230
So let's move on to the next lesson.
