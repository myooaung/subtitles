00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.955
In this lesson, we are going to learn another very basic trick to match font,

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:12.030
which is to match the features of two different fonts.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.310
What does mean features?

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.055
Let me explain it with some few examples.

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:23.460
Because this technique can only be learned by showing you a few examples.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.145
Otherwise it is not easy to learn.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:31.755
Here I have, this is a blog stored.org.

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:35.100
I found this example from this website.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.050
This is typ.io.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.485
You can see here we have one font in the heading.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:44.735
It is just led letter two heading.

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:49.165
Then we have copy font, here we have it.

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.240
If you look closely,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.085
even you'll think that this font has a very thick stroke.

00:00:56.085 --> 00:01:00.200
But if you look at the features like the E,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.430
the slope of E,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.900
and the X, how it is written.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.305
Also the I, everything they match a lot with that font below.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:18.425
The font over here you can see if you even look at the Q letter.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:22.220
If I go below a bit here,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.010
you can see at the end, you can see that Q,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.650
you can see that the Q is almost similar to this one,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.285
just the difference of a bit of stroke and style,

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:37.940
the shape and the placement,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.165
everything is almost the same.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:45.855
Also, if you look at A, this is A,

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.375
and here we have A again,

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:53.985
the slant of this counter area of A is almost the same.

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:56.900
So they have same features.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.035
You can see over here.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:02.495
If we can zoom in a bit more,

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:06.300
maybe we can see that easily.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.505
You can see the similarity between A's,

00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:15.430
also the T, the ending of this T. You can see over here.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.260
This is almost the same like this one.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.005
It is also has the same ending.

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:23.930
These are few features you will be looking for.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.785
They have matched these fonts with similar features.

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:36.815
Although I still believe that you should train your gut or eyes to match the fonts.

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:41.265
These features can be sensed.

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:47.630
You cannot look them like this and analyze them mathematically.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.520
Let's see another example.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.275
Here we have another example.

00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:54.735
This is one font. It is very bold.

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:57.810
I think it's circular,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.520
font's name is circular.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.400
Then we have here another font in the paragraph which is fried text.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.330
Now coming to the similarities, let's zoom in.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.315
If you see both fonts,

00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:17.165
some of the curves, they have like this,

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:20.155
it is almost the same.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:22.935
Then we have T's.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:26.440
You can see the top of the T,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.775
how it is meeting over here in this area.

00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:34.060
It is almost the same with this T. These are

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.800
few features that are similar in these two fonts.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:47.245
It seems very close to each other with regards to some of the curves and some features.

00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:49.975
This is another example then we have,

00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:53.645
let's see, few more examples.

00:03:53.645 --> 00:04:00.130
Now, if you look at Google Fonts specimens where Google Fonts share some font pairing,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.475
let's go to the new Google pairing.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:04.515
I think it's better.

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:07.080
Maybe we can look at it over here too,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.670
so it's not a problem.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.830
Now if you look at this first pairing,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.140
they suggested Open Sans and Roboto,

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.155
you can see there is a lot of similarity between these two.

00:04:18.155 --> 00:04:19.955
Both are Sans Serif,

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:24.180
you can look at the A's in the paragraph,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:32.355
and they are almost the same Robot is a bit slim or the O,

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.575
O's of Robot are a bit,

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:37.815
you can see it has less counter and

00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:43.590
a bit vertical rather than this open Sans open counter,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.125
we have more counters in the O's.

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:48.710
Still they look very similar,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.239
although I think they share too much similarity,

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:58.400
but still they have showed it as a pair.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.950
Then I like this Open Sans and Source Sans Pro,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.340
they also share a lot of similarities like

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.565
the curves you can see N and A's an N's and also the O's.

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:19.050
They're very similar.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.340
From my point of view,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.405
they make a very good pair.

00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:28.595
Last stop is that this website,

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:35.730
it is typeconnection.com and I tried to pair two fonts with similar personalities.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.920
One font is this Adobe Garamond Pro,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.750
and second one is Chaparral Pro.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.745
It also shows some of the physiques of like a trenchant,

00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:52.005
trim, solid, durable, agile with defined forms.

00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:55.545
We don't known that much about it.

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:58.395
I'm not that of an expert.

00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:04.120
But what I want to show you guys is this matching graphic over here.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.505
It is very interactive and very nice.

00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:10.625
Right now I have clicked this Garamond Pro and you can

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:15.585
see this highlighted one is Adobe Garamond Pro font.

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:19.430
You can see the pit in the background,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.675
very light, that is basically Chaparral Pro.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:28.370
You can see the counters are almost the same and thus

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.780
labs are serifs they share the same length.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.190
Although these Adobe Garamond Pro have rounded slabs,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.645
sorry, serifs they have rounded ends,

00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:44.415
they are not sharp or edgy.

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:48.330
But the shape or the angles are almost the same.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.425
You can see the L over here,

00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:53.950
it is almost going in the same angle and direction.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.000
Also you can see over here it shows wedge-shaped head serifs.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.240
They are wedge-shaped for both fonts.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.460
Then we have small counters.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.545
Then we have sweeping lag.

00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:07.700
I don't know what it is,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.365
but they have showed it over here.

00:07:10.365 --> 00:07:14.550
Now, horizontal crossbar.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.235
We have horizontal crossbar very straight.

00:07:18.235 --> 00:07:21.300
Then we have smooth transitions to foot serifs.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.950
Smooth transition mean that there is very smooth angle for the stem to this foot serif.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.600
This is what they're showing.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.840
Now switch to this Chaparral Pro.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.970
Now, Chaparral Pro is at the front,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.990
which is a bit dark.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.020
You can see the endings are a bit thick and slabish.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:51.140
But still it is very similar to Adobe Garamond Pro or some features,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.940
the shares in the same features.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.350
Like you can see,

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.745
O has small counters.

00:07:55.745 --> 00:08:00.650
They both have small counters than they have slight modulation.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.385
I think this is what they are trying to say about the angle.

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:07.530
Then wedge-shaped head serifs.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.765
This is the same, then unbracketed slab serifs,

00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:13.790
it is different from the other font.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:23.310
It has slabs rather than this curvy serifs over here like this Adobe Garamond Pro.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.230
But this is a very nice site if you want to try

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.040
to connect different fonts with similarities,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.860
you should check out this site.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.960
I will share all these sites' links in the resources.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.330
You can try them out, play this game.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.565
It is very nice and very cool.

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:45.810
It will improve your eye for matching fonts.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.190
Also, I want to show you one more example.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.375
Bebas Neue and Din Condensed Web.

00:08:53.375 --> 00:09:00.965
The first thing when I look at both these fonts is that they are tall.

00:09:00.965 --> 00:09:03.485
This one is a bit tall.

00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:08.700
Also this is very tall font.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:16.395
Although it is thick but it look a bit slim and tall.

00:09:16.395 --> 00:09:18.750
The built is tall,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.480
the X-height is good.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.825
That's why they look very similar because this is also thick and tall.

00:09:26.825 --> 00:09:29.480
This is also thick and tall.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.375
This is the only similarity I can see because right now the Bebas Neue Font is in

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:41.480
all caps and I think it's available only in all caps.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.485
These are few examples I wanted to share with you guys,

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:49.085
Adobe Garamond Pro, Chaparral Pro, and few others.

00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:53.630
You can search the web sites, this typ.io,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.060
and look for similarities just to train

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.545
your eye and keep improving your typography skills.

00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:04.440
Let's move on to the next lesson.
