00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.260
I have seen a lot of designers who have never used typographic hierarchy or scale.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.605
Now, this happens with a lot of

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:15.540
novice designers or designers who learn from different tutorials or something like that.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.620
So the typographic hierarchy basically

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.805
comes from visual hierarchy where we have concept of like,

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:27.090
important things get bigger sizes.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.885
So if you have headings or subheadings or taglines,

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.605
they will be bigger than the normal or paragraph texts.

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:40.810
So keep in mind that size will differ with importance.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.995
Let's see how we are going to create a scale.

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:50.270
Coming to the step that how to create a typographic hierarchy or scale.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.420
So first of all, what we are going to do is we are going to select one base size.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.250
For example, you consider like 16 pixels should be my base size

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.170
or paragraph size or the base of my typographic hierarchy.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.640
Then you are going to select a scale ratio or how much you are going to scale it.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.010
Like in each step,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.200
you are going to scale it by 1.5 or 1.25,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.730
or the golden ratio,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.550
which is called 1.618.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.800
So at the bottom,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.660
I'm giving you a simple example of the how to calculate it.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.775
For example, my base size is 18 pixel.

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:41.750
So the next scale step will be 18 pixel multiply by

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.155
1.5 which will be 27 points or 27 pixel font size.

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:53.105
So keep in mind that this is how we are going to calculate scale.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:54.410
So this is the first step.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.880
If you want the second step,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.145
then you are going to multiply 27 by 1.5 to get the next step.

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:05.535
So let me show you an example.

00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:07.880
Now here we have example of hierarchy.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.990
At the right side, I am showing you that we have a scale ratio of 1.44,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.970
and you can see using this ratio,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.300
we have heading at 54 pixels and then subheading is 37 pixels.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:32.500
Heading four is 26 pixels and heading four is 18 pixel and small text is 13 pixel.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.860
You can see on the left time using this scale for the tagline,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.290
I'm using heading three size which was

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.150
26 pixels for the heading 54 and for the body text,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.295
I am using 18 pixels.

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:53.080
So this is basically the concept how we are going to harmonize basically each step.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.090
This is calculated so it will look good.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.100
If you just select random values,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.110
they are not going to fit together.
