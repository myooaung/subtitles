00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
Every designer should be familiar with some of the typographic terms like font,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.790
font families, and what are font style.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.060
Let's see what is basically a font.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.675
Font is basically a set of characters of specific style and size.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.045
Actually, in the old days,

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:26.770
the size was relevant to font or type style or type face.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.380
Nowadays, one font is available in different sizes,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.145
so you can use any size like 72 points,

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:43.260
12 points, 100 pixels or whatever you want the size, because it's digital,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.550
you don't need to make a block of metal piece of font character.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.685
In the old days, the fonts and characters were made with specific metal blocks.

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.180
Let's see some of the examples of fonts.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.940
I am showing here two different fonts,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.735
one is Amsi Pro family and the second one is Crique Grotesk font.

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:14.340
These are different sizes,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.230
we can use any size,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.020
there is no limit to sizes.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.935
We can use from one point to unlimited,

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:26.635
size is not relevant these days with fonts.

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:28.875
Now, what is a font style?

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:32.100
Or we may call it font-face also.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.380
For modern usage, you just keep in mind that it's font style.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.465
Specific style of a font,

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.255
you guessed it right.

00:01:40.255 --> 00:01:43.590
Now examples are Bold, Italic,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.505
Regular, Medium display, Condensed,

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:55.075
Black, Semi Bold, Bold Black, and the Extrabold.

00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:59.860
There are a lot of different styles of fonts these days.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.615
Here are few examples of font styles,

00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:05.970
I'm using Amsi Pro Ultra Style,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.445
which is ultra bold, right now.

00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:10.580
There is one more style over here,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.435
which is Amsi Pro Light 48 point size,

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:18.005
and we have Proxima Nova Condensed,

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:23.810
the characters are condensed or pressed together,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.785
and then we have Proxima Nova Extrabold.

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:30.260
These are different styles,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.330
like this one is condensed style,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.205
this one is Extrabold,

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:35.780
this one is pro,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.810
ultra pro, and this one is light style.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.100
Now what are font families?

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.820
So font family means that there should be a big family of the same font,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.875
so it is basically different font styles

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:59.575
that are designed on a same geometry, shape or style.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:02.520
For example, Helvetica is a very big family,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.100
it has condensed to styles and it has

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.050
a lot of bold styles than a lot of rounded styles.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.980
Helvetica has more than 30 or 44 different fonts in a single family,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.050
it's a very big family.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.480
You can also find

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.855
different big family Google fonts from this site I'm going to show you right now.

00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:36.225
This is site better Google fonts,

00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:41.035
and you can see here we have this Raleway family,

00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:43.350
and you can see we have 1,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.510
2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.165
10, 15, 16, 17,

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:51.630
18, different styles of a single font.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.500
This is basically a very big family,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.800
a lot of styles you can see over here,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.350
this Source Sans Pro is also a very big family,

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.000
Roboto, also a very big family.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.935
Also if you can see that we have Roboto condensed to,

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:11.100
if we have over here you can see this one Roboto Mono,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.485
this also belongs to this Roboto family.

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.170
It has different style,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.500
but they are actually the same family, they are cousins.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.830
Then we have Source Code Pro,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.015
which is also related to the Source Sans Pro,

00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:31.845
and we have this Roboto Condensed,

00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:35.580
it is also related to Roboto family.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.450
These are different Google fonts that have very big families.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.400
Look and see over here EXo,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.740
EXo 2 and Kanit,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.140
they also have very big families,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.150
a lot of different styles.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.440
The advantage of a big family is that you can use

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.560
a single family and you can have a lot of

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.575
different styles to choose from when you are designing.

00:05:01.575 --> 00:05:03.630
This is all about font,

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.390
font size, and font families.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.970
Let's move on to the next lesson.
