00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Let's have a look at another typography matching or pairing technique,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.770
which is called x-height matching.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.335
You already know about x-height.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:14.340
If you can match the small letter x-height of two fonts,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.490
they are likely to go very well together.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.805
I am going to show you few fonts matches I came up with just to train your eyes.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.624
It is not voodoo magic or something.

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:28.400
It is just hard work.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.390
You need to match one x with another x of another font.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
So keep on iterating and selecting different fonts till

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.105
the time you get the x-height almost exactly matched.

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:46.250
So you can easily combine those fonts.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.080
This is the first one.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.450
These are the fonts on the right side,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.745
Andron and Chaparral Pro Regular.

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:55.620
This is the first combination.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.440
I am bidding Old Style font or Garamond style font with Slab Serif.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.660
At the top left,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.380
you can see that both x's are at the top,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.730
they have the same height.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.735
Only they differ in the stroke and the Serif endings.

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:14.730
So the Serif endings,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.120
one is Slab Serif style, one is old style.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.845
It has a bit of curvy slabs at the top.

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:25.250
You can see at the bottom left,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.870
I have matched these.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.250
One is used for heading.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.325
The other one is for body text and they are looking good together.

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:42.600
It doesn't always seems that they are really perfect or they are looking great together.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.450
Sometimes they might look normal together.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.210
They might surprise you that,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.340
"That's awesome. They're looking great."

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.590
But sometimes when you are matching x-heights of two fonts,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.755
sometimes they match very perfectly.

00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.665
Let's look at another example here.

00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:04.905
Again, I have the same x-height.

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:09.690
One is old style with Slab Serif and old style thickness.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.285
You can see it has a very thick and thin alternation.

00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:18.730
In this example, I am using Chaparral Pro with

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.540
Garamond font and you can see they are looking great together.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.270
If you want to vary,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.650
you can go ahead and choose other styles

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.045
like I have used in this Chapter 25 over here at the left in the heading.

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:38.535
I have used italic over here.

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:42.695
So this is how you can introduce a third font.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.875
Use another style of the same font.

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:48.875
If you have selected Chaparral Pro as your heading,

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:53.660
you can use Chaparral Pro italic as your sub-line or subheading,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.730
or date, or showing chapter number, or something like this.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.155
So this is a very basic trick.

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:01.295
Here is another one,

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:03.335
transitional with old style.

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:10.970
They, again, share the same x-height and you can see one is this Plantagenet Cherokee.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.950
Another one is MM Times,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.805
which look like it's a bit of transitional font to me.

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:25.800
Here I am using transitional one as my heading and the other one as my body text.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.105
Here is another pair.

00:03:27.105 --> 00:03:31.890
I am using MM times bold as my heading and Inconsolata Medium,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.930
which is a bit of monospace fonts just like typewriters at the bottom.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.610
They're looking great together.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.890
They share the same x-height.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.890
One is transitional, one is Sans-Serif,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.410
or you can say much of a monospace typewriter font rather than Sans-Serif.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.105
So let's look at another example.

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:54.255
Here we have a very great match.

00:03:54.255 --> 00:03:57.260
I don't know, maybe you feel some other way.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.045
I'm feeling this way.

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:03.860
This is from the same font or same typist family,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.220
Droid Sans and Droid Serif.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.450
Again, the x-height is the same.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.745
Just their bold is different.

00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:16.605
One is Slab Serif or one is Sans-Serif and they are looking great together.

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:20.430
I am using one italics style for variation.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.770
You will learn more about variation in the next section.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.920
Now this is the last example.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.610
I got this example from googling around and I found it very useful.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.795
One is Georgia and other is Proxima Nova.

00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:43.830
Really they look great with each other, and why?

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.430
Because their x-height matches perfectly.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.780
So you can see not even a single pixel is up or down.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.210
They are perfect match of each other.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.710
So I am using Georgia as my heading and Proxima Nova as my body text.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.870
So this is all about matching fonts with similar x-heights.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.700
You need to find them.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.115
They will not come to your door.

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:14.840
You need to find them.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.480
I tried different font combinations.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.055
In your spare time,

00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:23.240
try to use this technique and try to pair some fonts.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.480
So this is all about this x-height matching technique.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.130
So let's move on to the next lesson.
