00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
In this exercise, we are going to design something similar to this.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.680
You can call it a social media ad or a discount ad or a print ad.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.525
You can design it even in Illustrator or Photoshop or whatever tool you like,

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:19.125
but the basis of this design will stay the same.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:24.330
What I'm going to do is I am using a one pattern at the background.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.025
Then I have this overlay background on top of this pattern.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.025
It is a bit transparent.

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:38.940
Then we have text in three different fonts and few colors like this,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.920
pale orange and this yellow color.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.160
First of all, I am going to show you all the resources I have used in this lecture.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.220
Let's view the resources and where you can get

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.145
all these fonts because I have mixed three fonts over here.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:03.885
One is a bit you can say very wide and very tall like this one.

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:09.150
It's Aileron, and therefore a bit,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.795
you can say script-ish font,

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:15.725
and then we have this rounded,

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.185
very bold font Signika.

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.695
Let me show you all these resources.

00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:24.390
First, we are going to see what other fonts I'm using.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.875
This one is Google fonts Signika Negative.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.600
This is the top one I'm using.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.115
You can see over here,

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:35.000
it is very curvy and very playful nature.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.330
Then we have this Antre font,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.400
which is from some guy,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.500
Taner Ardali, Istanbul, Turkey and it really connects with the next letter very nicely.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.605
You can see over here.

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:52.875
This is another one.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:57.350
Then the third font we are using is by TipoType Aileron,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.460
and it's a free font,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.305
you can download from here,

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:07.965
type 'zero' over here and Add to Cart and you can download all its greatness.

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.720
These are three fonts.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.200
Then moving to the other elements.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.530
I have used this sweetly splash type thing over here,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.880
this floral art or whatever you can call it.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.290
Then there's this background over here, this pattern.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.015
I downloaded them for free and I'm going to show you

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:37.775
one site where you can download all these things for free.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:40.220
It is basically this site.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.440
Creative Market always shows you six free downloads every week and gives you these free,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.920
awesome great looking backgrounds,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.460
icons, sometime brushes, fonts.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.700
This is this week's bundle.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.840
I downloaded these few weeks back like this one,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.005
this Ditsy Floral Digital Pattern by,

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:13.485
I don't know, by JSquarePresents,

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.380
and then I downloaded this one.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.090
I got them for free so I don't recommend that you purchase them,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.620
but you can subscribe or create an account on this site and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.250
you can get free downloads every week.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.195
Maybe you can find such things on online on Google by searching.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:36.600
Maybe you can find them free,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.830
but I use these two elements.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.845
Ditsy Floral Digital Pattern and Hand Drawn Flower design elements.

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:48.675
Let's get started.

00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:54.805
Let's move on to the next lesson where we're going to start this lesson and design.

00:03:54.805 --> 00:03:58.390
Let's move on to the next lesson.
