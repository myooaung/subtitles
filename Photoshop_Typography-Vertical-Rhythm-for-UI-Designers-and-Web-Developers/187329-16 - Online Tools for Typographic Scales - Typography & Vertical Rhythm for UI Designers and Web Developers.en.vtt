00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Now I'm going to show you some of the online tools to

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.000
create this hierarchy automatically or get the values.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.385
Even if you're a developer or a designer,

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.005
it will help you a lot.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.860
Let's see what those hidden gems are.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.135
The first site I'm going to show you is this modularscale.com.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.310
You can see here we have, at the left,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.830
is base and then the ratio.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.915
You can set the ratio from this.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:30.520
This is major third and these are based on, I think music.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.350
I might be using this golden ratio.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.340
You can use this one or you can set your custom.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.250
I can set like 1.35,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.085
something like this or maybe 1.4,

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:49.590
which is even number.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.225
For the designers, they might be confused what these em values are.

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:57.105
Basically, it is a relative measurement.

00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:01.830
So 1em is equal to basically 16 pixels.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.605
You can multiply all these values by 16 pixels,

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:11.440
like 7.53 multiply by 16 to get your pixel value.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.649
The other method is that right over here, 18 pixels.

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.935
You can see along with this em,

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:27.285
it is showing you with the base size of 16 that the pixel value is basically this.

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:33.080
Now, 18 pixel, then 25 pixels,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.270
35 with this ratio.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.380
If I change the ratio,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.185
you can see this is going to increase.

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.340
I'm going to use 54.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.805
Something like this. Maybe 618.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:49.260
This is golden ratio; 18, 29, 47,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.975
76, 123, and so on, and so forth.

00:01:54.975 --> 00:02:01.910
The benefit of this site is that we can go in the smaller sizes too.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.204
After 18 pixels, we have 11 pixels.

00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:13.145
I normally like it to be closer to this 1.33 or something like this.

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:16.175
It gives you a lot of good range like 18,

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:19.785
then 24, 32, 42,

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:21.725
56, something like this.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.525
Also in the small sizes,

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:25.030
it is not very small.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.635
I have 14 pixels over here.

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:32.870
Now this is how we are going to use this modular scale.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.990
Then there is another one which is this one.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.750
It is also very cool and you can easily grab the CSS.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.710
It generates automatically.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.180
For developers,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.260
it is a very nice tool.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.450
It can easily generate the relative measurements and everything for you.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.190
Again, the base size is 16 pixels equal to 1em.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.985
It is showing you. Then you can use these.

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.000
I think I like this one.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.500
Then you can also see a very nice view of how it will look like.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.060
Here is the heading and then we have the paragraphs and heading 1,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.320
2, 3, 4, I guess.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.935
Here we have the small text or maybe caption.

00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:19.920
This is another tool.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.380
This is very cool tool.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.630
You can see here we have the values in em.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.400
If you want in pixels,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.260
you easily multiply it with 16 pixels.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.045
I'm going to set it to 18 pixels right now.

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:37.800
It has shifted again with 18 pixels.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.730
Now my text is a bit bigger.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.970
The last tool, which is also very nice

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.720
and it have one other factor which is this line height.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.195
If you are using this scale like I'm using 1.33,

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:58.460
there is another factor to control here, which is line height.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.070
You can see it shows you how this line height will look like.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.215
I have set it to 1.45.

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:10.620
Let's preview it.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.110
Very nice. Close the preview.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.740
There are some good things about it and some few cons about this site or this tool.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.145
It can create the code in pixels values.

00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:29.110
You can see over here font size, line height, everything.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.410
In the RAM unit,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.800
which is meant for developers.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.100
So if you are a designer,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.640
don't worry about it.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.210
Just use this pixel value over here and you will be good to go.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.340
Here we have body texts,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.380
which is paragraph 18 pixel,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.080
then heading 1 is 42 pixels.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.750
If you are a developer,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.370
you can easily copy all this code over here and use it in your development.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.010
Here's the HTML they have used, here is the CSS.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.830
These are all the tools I wanted to show you guys about how to use

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:20.930
grid scales or typographic scale in a good manner and to improve your designs.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.195
I hope you have learned some good lessons in this lecture.

00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:29.520
Let's move on to the next lesson.
