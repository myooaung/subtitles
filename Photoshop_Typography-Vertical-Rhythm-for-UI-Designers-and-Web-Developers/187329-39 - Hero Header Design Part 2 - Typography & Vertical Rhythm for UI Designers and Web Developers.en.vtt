00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Okay, now this is the last session.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.965
We are going to first bring our mobile phone screen over here.

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:10.200
Let's go to the mobile screen we have downloaded.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.840
Let's extract it over here.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.810
We are going to use this first one.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.865
This is the first one.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:25.260
What I am going to do is just hide this background.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.560
You can bring everything like this,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.170
Control G and group this,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.010
Window Arrange and go to Tile Up Vertically and move it over here like that.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.800
We are going to close this 1.psd.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.550
Let's arrange the windows back.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.930
Consolidate All To Tabs like this.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.755
Now, this is very big.

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:01.335
Let's keep it mobile,

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:04.665
zoom out, Control T,

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:12.120
Okay, and we are going to move it like this.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.950
Press "Enter".

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.320
Now, I'm going to sorry.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.480
Now I'm going to select this group.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.235
We are going to use our shift and arrow keys to move it around like that.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:35.080
Now, what I'm going to use is I'm going to use 1,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.740
2, 3, 4, 5 columns for this phone.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.835
Right now, I'm using almost six, so don't worry.

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.435
It is almost going to be here.

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:54.190
I think the size is almost perfect. Like that.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.550
Now, you can see I have extended the hand at

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.270
the bottom a bit and you can see the hand is coming out.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.260
What we are going to do is,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.840
we're going to convert it to smart object,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.165
move it down to the container.

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:13.010
This white background is specifically the container and clip it like that.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.560
This hand has been fixed.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.050
Let's hide [inaudible].

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.580
Everything is looking fine right now.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.870
There are few things like we need to fix the area over here.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.505
What I'm going to do is we are going to select this button,

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:33.800
Learn More button background,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.045
go to Layer Styles Gradient Overlay.

00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:44.250
I am going to use this orange to not multiply but normal.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.155
This is going to be orange to yellow.

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:51.180
It should not be radial,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.800
it should be linear.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.285
I am going to use 180 from the left,

00:02:57.285 --> 00:02:58.940
the angle is from the left,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.835
so this color is coming from left.

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:06.800
You can use this method to whatever you like.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.725
I'm right now using it like that.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:12.800
If you want to fix the colors,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.700
you can go ahead and use more saturation over here like 95 maybe.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.765
Also for this color maybe,

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:23.070
it is very light,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.055
let's make it a bit dull.

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:31.410
Maybe 95 and saturation 100.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.470
No, I think it is very close to this color,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:45.020
so I'm going to use some other color maybe in the yellow area like that.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.395
A bit more yellow. Okay, now it is looking great.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:53.270
Basically, I am combining yellow with orange color.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.985
They are very close in the spectrum,

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.139
so they look really nice and vibrant.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.170
This is basically how I created this.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.990
Let's use 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:16.190
6 and 1, 2,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.425
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.080
I have used 24 over here,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.635
so let's create 24 over here too.

00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:29.005
So 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:35.660
So 24 from both sides.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.250
If you want, you can use your own imagination and your own gut feeling to align these.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.120
If I try to move it over here maybe 1,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.710
2, 3, 4 pixels,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.255
it is looking good.

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:54.275
Also, this arrow, if you want to shift it up,

00:04:54.275 --> 00:04:57.660
or maybe on the left,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.640
maybe on the right.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.430
It is looking more better now.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.560
If you want to get some shadow around this button,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.035
select this one and I'm going to use some diffuse shadow over here, so like that.

00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:18.595
What I'm using is I'm using

00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:24.400
20 percent opacity for

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.030
the shadow and let's create the shadow a bit closer.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.910
Distance is three pixels.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.625
You can use nine or whatever if you want to shift that distance at the bottom like that.

00:05:37.625 --> 00:05:43.805
I think maybe six will be good enough or maybe eight,

00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:50.810
it is the medium of your baseline height, so 16.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.715
Now, it is looking great.

00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:55.040
If you want to shift the color more subtle,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.410
you can go like this.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.560
Very subtle shadow, very light, very diffuse shadow.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.480
Press "Okay".

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.570
I think we have finished this exercise.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.265
Still, if you feel that this area has less space than this one,

00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:16.205
you can shift this button down a bit.

00:06:16.205 --> 00:06:19.040
Let's create these alignments.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.640
We are going to use our inner gut feeling to shift this.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.035
I'm going to use over here,

00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:34.950
1, 2, 3, 4,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.430
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.755
It is almost aligned with this area or this mobile phone bottom over here.

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:50.610
Also, we can shift this arrow and this button.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.745
Let's group them to button.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:55.480
Let's move it to the bottom,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.635
or a bit down, 10 pixels down.

00:06:58.635 --> 00:07:01.155
So this is better now.

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:02.820
You can see over here,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.750
still if you feel,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.915
you can move the button down like that,

00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:11.810
I think it was better over here.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.145
Maybe 1, 2, 3, 4, pixels down.

00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:28.320
Open your imagination, don't fix your thinking that we are going to use baseline,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.000
and it is not going to be in the baseline.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.890
Just use your imagination.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.780
Just make sure that this is going to be in this whole area,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.575
and also you can play with the line height if you want.

00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:48.880
If you want, you can play with the line height light 64 or maybe 68,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.530
something similar to this.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:08:01.560
You can use more space over here and you can send the button a bit down more like that.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.455
This is one way. One other thing is,

00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:12.225
you can see over here that our visual alignment is a bit off.

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:16.665
Why? Because these have edges and this is round.

00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:18.300
If you look at it,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.685
you can see it is looking a bit inside this area,

00:08:23.685 --> 00:08:28.005
so they don't look aligned with this line.

00:08:28.005 --> 00:08:30.660
How you can correct this,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.960
you can shift this paragraph and this over here.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.080
I think it is a bit more.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.600
I'm going to use 64,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:51.660
and I can also shift it eight pixels down.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.775
I've shifted it eight pixels down,

00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:55.515
it is just my liking.

00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:57.870
I want to create more space over here,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.070
so I'm shifting it down.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:04.890
Also, if you want to select this mobile phone

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:12.090
and and we are going to shift it down a bit more like that.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.420
Maybe move the Samsung inside.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:24.645
Let's move it a bit up and a bit left.

00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:29.820
Sometimes you need to hide your grades and guides to see

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.720
what the design is coming up and move the things around freely.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.835
Now, to fix these two issues,

00:09:37.835 --> 00:09:42.680
we have our this two text areas,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.900
we are going to ship them over here like that.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.855
It was 10 pixels,

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.550
so let's move them back 1,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.665
2, 3, 4, 5.

00:09:52.665 --> 00:09:54.810
I think five pixels,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:03.300
or maybe four pixels will be more than enough to make them show in your visual alignment.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.265
This is basically called visual alignment,

00:10:05.265 --> 00:10:08.010
although they are mathematically aligned,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.080
but visually to our eyes,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.910
they don't look very aligned.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:17.160
Also, I think I used a bit regular font over here,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.245
so let's shift it to regular.

00:10:19.245 --> 00:10:21.825
If you want to use bold, it's your choice.

00:10:21.825 --> 00:10:23.970
I think this is a great exercise.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:29.640
I have shared a lot of my very special designing tips or secret tips with you,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.260
like how I design,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.225
how to hide grades.

00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:37.875
Sometimes you need to see your design from far away.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:41.190
Zoom out and see how it is looking.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.585
You can that this text is looking too much apart.

00:10:45.585 --> 00:10:52.125
Maybe I need to change its line-height back to 60.

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.525
It is better now.

00:10:54.525 --> 00:10:57.945
Maybe I can move it down.

00:10:57.945 --> 00:11:00.270
Right now, you can see there is a lot of distance

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.150
between this orange button and this text.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:08.010
I can move it down over here or maybe I can move the button a bit up.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.330
This is all your choices. Like that.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.445
I think now it is looking better.

00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:16.995
This looks like a block,

00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:21.210
this one is continuous. This is separated.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:27.210
This is how we create designs that are closer to dribble level.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.754
Keep practicing, don't lose your focus.

00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:39.450
I think this one has a bit of blurred because I used this other technique.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.650
I think next time if you want to move it over here,

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.545
you can see it is clearer over here.

00:11:46.545 --> 00:11:50.805
Don't use this drag the whole layers,

00:11:50.805 --> 00:11:54.900
but copy and paste over here. Let me show you.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.440
I think it's better if I show you like that.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.275
Hide this, Control A,

00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:06.450
Control Shift C or Copy Merge basically.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.150
This is our design right now,

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.740
and let's paste it over here.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:19.670
Hold F5, convert it to smart object.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.800
Lets hide the first one, which is blurry.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.515
Let's move it around over here.

00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:28.080
Your design should be perfect,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.050
so you need to move it like that.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:39.790
That's shift it with the container.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:53.805
Also, you see I'm aligning it with this area almost in the middle.

00:12:53.805 --> 00:12:58.050
Let's see where our hand is right now.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:03.340
Let's move it a bit at the bottom like this.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.289
Now, I think it is perfectly balanced.

00:13:07.289 --> 00:13:11.370
If you want to add anything to it or try to create something similar to it,

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.945
you can see now it is not blurred from areas over here.

00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:19.140
This is how you create a very cool design,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.830
a design closer to dribble level design.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.550
Now for this four selection,

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.740
this is the main topic over here.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.550
Now you can see I have selected this beta font, which is a bit,

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:37.290
you can see curvy and have very slabs.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.340
It shows solid form.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.420
We have a very solid form and very innovative

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.699
like we have a very good curves, curvy surfaces.

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:53.565
It looks very modern,

00:13:53.565 --> 00:13:58.935
solid and very adjustable and maybe flexible company.

00:13:58.935 --> 00:14:01.185
That's why I have used this one,

00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:03.300
I tried to use Aleo,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.500
I think before A-L-E-O I guess, yes.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.200
I also tried to use Aleo over here.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.310
If you want to shift,

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.315
you can see how the whole message just shifted up.

00:14:15.315 --> 00:14:20.410
You can see now it doesn't look very solid or bold company.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.195
If you try to use regular,

00:14:24.195 --> 00:14:26.895
you can see over here the effect.

00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:31.515
If I jump back to the font I selected,

00:14:31.515 --> 00:14:36.585
the beta you can see have more weight and more value.

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:42.615
This is how I selected beta rather than Aleo for this exercise.

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:47.330
Also you can see this Aleo font it has very rounded surface,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.745
is well rounded corners,

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:52.195
and it is very legible.

00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:57.260
I tried this font and I think it is looking perfect.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.425
Let's move this recent a bit over here like this.

00:15:02.425 --> 00:15:06.695
I see the space a bit off in between these two elements.

00:15:06.695 --> 00:15:13.320
Let's save it exercise ultimate 1.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.030
I think you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.180
I'm going to create a lot of such exercises.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:25.520
Stay tuned and keep watching the updates.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.710
I will send you the updates,

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.270
so watch for them.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.130
Let's move on to the next lesson.
