00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Now, in this lesson,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.275
we're going to create something similar to this.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.620
We are going to start off from our previous design.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.600
This is totally different theme,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.640
it is very business-like elegant,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.140
or business premium theme.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.235
This is a bit energetic and creative theme,

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:19.710
so there are few differences like the text,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.885
the colors, and the fonts.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:23.400
The curves of the fonts,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.010
I have selected very different fonts.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.840
In this situation over here you can see they're very straight,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.625
you can see sometime bold,

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.325
and a bit serious,

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:37.230
like technology-based fonts very serious.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.270
Let's get started, and change this theme into this one.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.285
First of all, we're going to change the background,

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.230
we have this image background.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.405
I got this background from somewhere I don't remember.

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:53.955
Here is my background.

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:56.290
It was from a free websites.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.980
I'm going to drag it and drop it into my Photoshop over here like this.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.415
It is almost perfectly fit and I'm going to just move it around like that.

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:12.670
Shift and Alt, to make it in the center like this.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.235
You can get some pointy things all here if you want to.

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:27.965
The second thing we are going to do is we're going to add some opacity to this container.

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:31.085
I'm using 90 percent of this container.

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:37.945
Let's zoom in and make some other changes like changing this fonts over here.

00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:43.580
First we're going to change this logo and change the font of this logo which was Archive.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.555
Archive Regular is the font and the size is 36.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:51.430
I'm going to change it to Userable.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.590
This is going to be in the red,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.650
so I'm going to change it to this red color which is dull red ae5240 color.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.650
You can get it a bit sharper, like that.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.900
May be increase the saturation a bit up.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.385
I am using this color,

00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:13.405
then remove this orange line from here.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:16.520
Then the second thing is that we are going to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.700
change the fonts of all these texts over here,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.210
this text links or navigation.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.160
I'm going to select character and I am going to change all the links at once.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.610
The font we're going to use is Clear Sans Regular.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.225
It is going to be 18 pixels,

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:39.360
don't forget about this line height,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.160
and then we are going to change few text over here,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.670
few buttons, and few other things over here, also this image.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.020
The final adjustment of fine-tuning will be done in the next step or next lesson,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.150
so don't worry about it right now.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.340
The distance and everything we are going to adjust them in the next lesson.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.375
The text we're going to paste over here is going to be

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:07.365
the text I have already written for that exercise.

00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:08.870
I'm going to copy that,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.775
we provide powerful solutions,

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.630
copy and I'm going to paste it over here.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.940
Control+V or Command+V, double-click to

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.280
highlight and I'm going to change it to Amsi Pro Light,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.685
and the font size was 36,

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:32.370
and the line height is 48.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.660
Like that. Now we're going to go to this button,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.650
remove the gradient, so we have this.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.545
Then go to these properties,

00:03:43.545 --> 00:03:47.195
and we're going to use four pixels for the roundness.

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:49.835
Good to go, looking good.

00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:52.010
Learn more, the font is Aler,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.349
so I'm going to change it to Clear Sans,

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.425
which is our font for body text.

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.320
Then for this area,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.939
we are also going to change the font to Clear Sans Regular,

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.895
and we are going to change the text also.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:11.090
Let's go to the text or content over here,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.290
and we are going to copy this,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.870
and we are going to paste it over here in the Photoshop.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.835
Paste it like that.

00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:28.265
Then we are going to underline this because it is a link,

00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:30.270
this is another step.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.680
It is going to be a link,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.740
I'm going to use dull blue, grayish color.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.950
We are using basically dull colors over here, this is 376899.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.835
Also we are going to underline it.

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:47.480
I'm using this textile to underline it.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.760
You can also use underlining by putting a line under it

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.580
and I think it is more effective right now you can

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.155
see it's a bit blurry line by Photoshop.

00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:07.920
The better way is that you use a line tool over here and draw a line manually like this.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.375
Right now its size is 10 pixels,

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:17.525
so I'm going to change its height to one pixel.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:21.290
Lets remove the underline from this text,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.820
you can see over here.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.070
Now change the color to this,

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.650
and you can see it is looking more live and more accurate.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.055
I'm going to select this,

00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:37.040
move it around a bit like that,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.920
you can see it is looking more sharp,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.765
and also you can change the color of this one.

00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:52.300
This text to this,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.165
also for this I think something messed up.

00:05:57.165 --> 00:06:02.925
Now we are done with most of the changes.

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:08.045
We are going to change the image over here if you want to change the image,

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:13.820
or you can put anything over here like maybe right now I am going

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:21.230
to copy this area over here and I'm going to copy it,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.470
copy merged, and I'm going to paste it over here.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.855
Just to get you a demonstration,

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.925
it is another app I designed.

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:33.815
I'm not really proud of it,

00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:39.645
but it was a very strange line of work.

00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:44.190
This is how we have changed the image over here.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.205
Actually this image really matters.

00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:49.070
Whatever you are designing,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.300
the theme you are designing,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.995
this image should have some colors or color scheme similar to this theme.

00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:58.775
If I am designing in blues and reds,

00:06:58.775 --> 00:07:01.010
you can see this is our blues and reds.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.510
This is really matching with this.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:09.320
This is the main reason we are using everything over here.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.415
You can see this is the exercise we are designing,

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:15.635
I think I should close this one.

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:17.600
To avoid mistakes, I've closed that one.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.505
We are working on this area.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:25.040
In the next lesson, we're going to fine-tune and change all the spacing around,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.690
and I will show you how I'm going to use this grid to space these three areas.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.910
These three are very important.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:39.395
Also we are going to use some spacing around this and this area.

00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:42.930
So let's move on to the next lesson.
