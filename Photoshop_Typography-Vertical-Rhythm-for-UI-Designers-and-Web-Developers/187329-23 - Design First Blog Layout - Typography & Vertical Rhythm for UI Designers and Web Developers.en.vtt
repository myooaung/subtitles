00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Now, first, we are going to create this layout,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.295
so at the top we are going to set our heading,

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:11.100
at the left, our date of this article,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.860
and at the right side, 147 likes.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.924
At the left, we are going to use Lato,

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:20.250
a slanted italic version,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.210
italic style of Lato to have some quote or quote text over here, quoted text.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.090
This is, we are going to use 1,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.365
2, 3, 4 blocks,

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:36.300
four columns to layout the first introductory paragraph,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.525
and for the next text we are going to use these three blocks.

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:46.640
Three and blocks, or three rows and columns for this one,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.120
this module for this image.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.855
Basically what we are trying to do is we are balancing out this layout.

00:00:56.855 --> 00:00:59.405
Let's discuss some of the balance over here.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:02.315
Like you can see this blue color,

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:07.265
normally the color gets more attention and it is heavier.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:13.280
This is how we are balancing out with this image and this color over here.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.800
This empty space is basically balancing with all this text over here.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.375
In the middle we have text,

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:23.680
at the left we, again,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.880
have color to balance out the design overall weight.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.500
It is just like you are balancing or weighing things in your two hands

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.080
or maybe like you balance on the seesaw.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.695
Here we have more heavier small object,

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:45.350
and here we have less heavier big object,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.830
like a bag of air balloons or something like this.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.530
Here we have two stones.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.280
This is how I try to balance my design.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.605
This is a very, you can say,

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:05.575
basic tip which a lot of designers might not know about.

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:09.130
This is how we are balancing our layout,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.820
this is the basic technique between behind this design.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.365
Let's get started.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:20.970
First, we are going to use the scale, if you remember,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.405
the heading size was 44 pixels,

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:27.210
and the text size was 20 pixels.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.295
Right now I am going to use these two sizes.

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:32.345
I'm ignoring all others.

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:37.875
Let's make our modules more dull or more into the background,

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:42.130
so we can see how we are going to lay out different things.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.655
First, I am going to use these three lines to create my headings,

00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:50.550
maybe this whole block,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.270
and I am going to use again Real Ipsum.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.875
Let's see where it is.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.000
Here is the Real Ipsum.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.840
Let's copy all this and paste it over here like that.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.360
The text size I'm using 44 points and Source Sans Pro bold.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.280
If you want to go with black,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.710
you can go with black too, like this.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.400
Just to fill the space,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.700
don't worry about what text I'm using.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.320
I'm going to set its line-height to 44, like that.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.070
If we want to go above 44,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.840
we can go like 50, like this.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.320
Just make sure it is in between these three lines like that.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.930
Also it is touching,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.615
you can see this column over here.

00:03:48.615 --> 00:03:51.600
This is the gutter, we're not inside the gutter,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.790
we are inside these 1,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.260
2, 3, 4 columns.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.715
This is how I am using this,

00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:01.975
if you want to expand this,

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:05.075
maybe you can use five like that.

00:04:05.075 --> 00:04:09.735
Not expanded much, because it is a heading,

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:13.665
so we need less space between the letters.

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:17.500
Now we are going to use some text over here,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.554
maybe we can leave this row,

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.075
this row over here,

00:04:22.075 --> 00:04:31.755
and start our text and use these maybe four columns in this module,

00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:37.160
and we are going to paste it over something like this.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.750
This is our start paragraph or intro paragraph.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.630
I'm going to use 20 pixels over here.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.350
We can use a bit of more line-height, maybe the 45,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.490
something like this, and we are going to use regular,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.460
and this is going to be Lato,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.055
not Source Sans Pro.

00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:09.565
Lato not hairline, but we are going to use regular.

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:18.205
Now you can see I can set this block of text at the top of this module,

00:05:18.205 --> 00:05:21.430
or maybe at the bottom, it is up to you.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.170
Now if we set it up like this,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.995
may be like this,

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.055
or maybe at the bottom.

00:05:30.055 --> 00:05:36.230
I think I am going to set it to the top.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.720
Let's create another text block like this one,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.205
the same one, Control J. I'm going to copy this one,

00:05:45.205 --> 00:05:48.620
and we are going to double-click this

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.855
and adjust the width and the height of this three columns,

00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:56.450
and we are going to use this or maybe you can go

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.755
beyond this because it is a continuous web page.

00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:04.310
I'm going to use 30 pixel line-height,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.590
and we are going to use these two paragraphs.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.290
First copy this one,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.000
paste it over here.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.205
I think it is a very long paragraph.

00:06:20.205 --> 00:06:24.670
Maybe we need to shift it a bit down,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.700
or maybe on the line like that.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.040
It doesn't matter while you are designing,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.370
if you want to set your texts on the baseline,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.370
you can make it happen,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.255
but when you are coding,

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.865
I think it is not possible easily,

00:06:43.865 --> 00:06:47.330
so maybe we can set it like this,

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:53.850
and also this one I am going to use it like that.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.215
Let's hide it, it is looking not very good,

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:05.240
maybe we are going to use some different settings.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:14.650
This is Lato 20 and maybe we can also use the same line-height over here,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.970
or maybe change the color to some darker color like this.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.995
Make this introductory paragraph look nice.

00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:29.380
If you want to separate with two lines, it's okay,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.900
but I think two lines between this introductory and this paragraph is too much.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.055
Let's leave it right now,

00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:39.770
let's put the image and other texts over here.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.915
We are going to put some text over here.

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:45.600
First we are going to put over here.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.665
Let's copy it from here.

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:53.130
Friday 30th, September 2010,

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.290
I am going to paste it over here,

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.860
and we are going to change the color to this gray color,

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.770
maybe a bit darker gray color like this one.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.240
The next step was, I guess 15.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.704
If you want to size it to 15,

00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:14.640
you can size it to 15.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.510
Right now what I'm trying to do is I'm using

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.820
these two columns and centering this text over here.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.830
Now this date has set all set,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.750
so we are going to use this 147 likes over here,

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.775
so 147 enter and Likes.

00:08:33.775 --> 00:08:36.300
Let's make it close together,

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:43.445
and I am going to use center line for this because it is a very small piece of text,

00:08:43.445 --> 00:08:46.980
it can be easily read with center align.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:52.515
Reduce it's to auto,

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:58.230
and I'm going to use 34 pixels over here.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:05.870
The font will be Source Sans Pro.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:15.490
If you want to go to this "Light," you can go to this Light one and just select this one,

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.950
use the Color, maybe this one.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:25.425
I'm going to center it in this column, like this.

00:09:25.425 --> 00:09:28.755
If you want to go with Bold,

00:09:28.755 --> 00:09:31.805
I guess we can use Bold or maybe Semi bold.

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:34.315
"Semi bold" is looking good.

00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:37.945
We have set our 147 likes,

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:41.785
our date and our heading, and our text.

00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:47.695
Let's put some more text over here because it is looking very odd.

00:09:47.695 --> 00:09:55.640
Maybe we can "Copy" one line from here and "Paste" it over here like this.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:02.770
Remove some of the text to make it look good like that.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:10.945
Let's use some dull color for this one because it is looking all the same.

00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:15.520
I'm using color for this variation.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:22.690
Maybe "50 percent" and I'm going to go towards the bit of gray color.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:27.140
"Dark gray" like that.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.385
It's looking great now.

00:10:30.385 --> 00:10:36.190
We can add some image over here and at the left side we're going to add some quote.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:41.920
It will end the first design iteration.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.095
Lets get the image.

00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:46.210
I have a lot of collection of images.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.670
Let's use any of them from here,

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.655
rather than downloading and wasting time.

00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:57.320
Maybe use this boy over here with a football.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:04.825
I'm going to "Drag" it over here and "Size" it like this.

00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:09.920
I'm going to use these three modules over here.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.195
I have pasted it over here like that.

00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:19.900
If you want this image to be exactly in this module,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:25.105
then we are going to clip this inside this box over here.

00:11:25.105 --> 00:11:31.600
Create a box bounding box and we are going to "Clip" this image,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.745
press "Alt" and "Clip" it.

00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:37.195
This is how we are going to clip this image like that.

00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:43.285
Let's "Hide" our modules and everything to look how this is going to look like.

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:46.390
This is how it is looking right now.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:51.970
Looking great, spaces are great and everything looks fine.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.490
Let's add some quote over here.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:12:01.165
I'm going to use my grid again and "Drag" it from here like that.

00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:08.680
I'm going to use these three rows for this quote,

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.915
and I'm going to use some text over here may be like this.

00:12:13.915 --> 00:12:16.435
This is the quotation.

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:19.630
"Copy" and "Paste" it over here.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.640
It's very small.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.710
Maybe we need some more text.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.550
Make something like this.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.400
It's a long quote, I'm changing the text to

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.120
balance this design so don't worry right now about it.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.050
Lets "Remove" the quotation marks,

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.500
because we're not going to need them.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:50.260
Maybe we need to squeeze it a bit because I'm going to use some blue bar over here.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.060
Let's use these three rows for this one and I'm

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.650
going to use blue bar over here like that.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:08.990
Ten pixels. I am going to "Change" the color to this Lighter blue.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.410
Most of these colors are flat,

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.455
so don't worry if you don't understand what colors I'm using.

00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:17.995
You can see I'm using very few colors.

00:13:17.995 --> 00:13:24.325
Mostly grays and blacks and blues. Nothing else.

00:13:24.325 --> 00:13:32.560
This is how I'm going to lay out this quotation.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:38.140
If you remember, we have Italic headline.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.845
Maybe we can use headline Italic or maybe Light Italic.

00:13:41.845 --> 00:13:44.470
I think "Light Italic" looks great.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:50.180
It's a bit difficult to read so maybe "Regular Italic" is good.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:58.630
Maybe we can change the Color to this blue or this white,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.480
or maybe this gray color.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:10.090
I "Double Modules" and these lines and you can see how this is looking.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:16.290
Once you have set your design elements try to hide everything else to see how it

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:23.910
is looking or what result it is getting so you can Change the "Color" of over here.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:28.245
I just shifted it to this "Grayish" color.

00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:31.260
I think this is great.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:37.030
Maybe use the same "Gray" over here like this one.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:50.455
Now you can see this is how we use modules and baseline grid to lay out our design.

00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:54.460
We are going to create more layouts from the same design

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.395
by rearranging our modules or rearranging our design elements.

00:14:59.395 --> 00:15:01.150
This is the first element.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:08.090
You can see over here how I have used all these modules if I Turn-up the grid like that.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:17.900
This is the end of the first exercise and you can see how good it is looking.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.710
If you want to change few things like moving this image a

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.490
bit below because our text is not lined up with this image.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.350
These are few settings.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.360
You can go with that end.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:38.305
You Select this image and this Rectangle and move it a bit down like this

00:15:38.305 --> 00:15:42.520
and reduce your rectangle size a

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.930
bit so this image looks almost parallel to your paragraph.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.955
Hide this lines and all the modules.

00:15:51.955 --> 00:15:54.640
This is almost perfect.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.755
This is the first layout.

00:15:56.755 --> 00:16:01.040
Let's create some more layouts in the next lesson.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.175
Stay tuned and I will be doing a lot of these exercises.

00:16:06.175 --> 00:16:10.480
Don't worry, you will get a lot of great things from here.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.000
Just remove this quotation.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.760
It is irritating me like that.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.770
Stay tuned and let's move on to the next lesson.
