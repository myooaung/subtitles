00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
Now in this lesson,

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.480
we are going to create this layout using only this gray and

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.365
this red color as our highlight color and also,

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:23.250
I think we are going to replace the image and this quotation places with each other.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.585
Let's get started and see what we are going to come up with.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:31.275
This is the last part where we left.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:33.000
What we're going to do is first,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.835
we are going to create another group.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:43.660
This is our design second,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.490
so that was first design.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.880
Now what we're going to do is we are going to change few things over here.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.380
First is that I'm going to use not all caps,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.410
but I'm going to use, Sunday,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.650
do you like that,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.540
and select this th,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.710
and go to this text panel and use this subscript or superscript,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.480
whatever it is called.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.860
Also we are going to change the size to 20 pixels like this.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.170
Also we are going to use italic over here.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.375
This is going to be a lot of shift in corrector, and few things.

00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:36.440
Now we are not going to highlight this one.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.945
We are going to use a grayish color for this 147 and use,

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:45.550
likes, the same color like this one.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.555
I guess it is the same, no.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:57.015
What we're going to do is we are going to use 44 pixels for this top one, use bold.

00:01:57.015 --> 00:02:00.080
What we are trying to do is we are trying to match

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.485
the width of this one and with the second one.

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:06.945
You can use this tracking value.

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:13.020
We can set 30, 50, 150.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.540
I think 150 a bit more.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.095
So 100 is looking good, 147 likes.

00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:26.135
If you want to change the width of likes,

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:30.120
you can use zero over here like this.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.630
This is all set.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.360
Maybe we can reduce the line height.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.435
This is the 30 and we can shift it to 45.

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:59.640
I think it's looking not very good,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.030
maybe we can use 30 instead.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.555
Also change this color to this one.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.970
So they looks the same though.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.000
Now the next step is,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.730
we are going to replace this image with another image of a smiling woman or girl.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.840
I'm going to select this image and we are going to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.545
move the image and the container over here like this.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:34.410
Let's turn on our grid.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.770
Right now I'm ignoring my margins and I'm going to set the size of this

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:48.880
to all these three modules over here or rows,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.650
I think four rows.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.450
Let's see how many are these;

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.920
one, two, three, four,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.675
five, six, six rows,

00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:02.260
I'm setting the size and everything over here.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.955
Let's move it a bit down,

00:04:04.955 --> 00:04:08.400
equal to this text over here.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.785
This one is our quotation,

00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:17.115
so let's move all this over here.

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:18.920
Now for the quotation,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.305
we are going to use this area,

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:25.920
these two columns and these three rows.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.650
This is how I arrange everything over here.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.760
Let's copy this image.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.425
This one, drag it over here,

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.770
and copy it like that.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.025
We are going to drag it over here,

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:48.435
remove this, and select this one.

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:52.320
It is here, move it at the left.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.690
Sometime you cannot see the image when you paste it

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.160
because it is outside of the container,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.200
you have clipped in it.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.130
I'm going to press "Shift and Alt" to resize this image like this.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.050
Let's hide the grid,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.475
it's almost perfect, but here we were using something else.

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:20.875
So let's change the style.

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:24.615
Use some quotation marks over here.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:32.285
This is how we are going to use some quotation marks with italic,

00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:36.395
and let's use a bigger size,

00:05:36.395 --> 00:05:40.610
which was the size 74 pixels.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.490
So I'm going to use 74 pixels.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.480
Add the quotation marks like that.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.560
Let's rotate it.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.000
I pressed "Shift" to rotate it in some specific angle.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.880
Let's put it over here like this.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:25.180
Let's make it a bit more closer to each other, like this.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.570
Now, is there anything else left over here?

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.720
So maybe we can change this text to italic.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.040
Just a style change, maybe.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:46.960
We can also expand it a bit, 15, looks good.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.185
Now, is there anything else we need to change?

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:56.090
Let's add few more details.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.605
There was a line after this text over here.

00:07:01.605 --> 00:07:03.255
Let's create a line,

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.265
slim line, Line Tool.

00:07:05.265 --> 00:07:10.030
I'm going to highlight this area,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.575
this is our line.

00:07:13.575 --> 00:07:18.640
It should be this color maybe.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:31.560
Let's move it on the left and make it two pixels in height, like that.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.445
Also we are going to use some other color, highlight this text.

00:07:37.445 --> 00:07:44.070
We're going to use this color to highlight this area just to balance it.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.875
Also we are going to use a dull color for this area.

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:54.820
Maybe this 7a7d80.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.540
Also I'm going to use

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.175
two separate paragraphs over here because it is looking very strange.

00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:13.180
Let's create two paragraphs by giving some space over here,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:22.855
like that, I pressed "1" enter over here and we have two paragraphs now.

00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:26.390
Also if you want to be more specific,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.950
you can use something like this,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.720
but I think this is also good.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:39.670
Now, we can make some more here and use 20 over here like this.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:44.325
Also in this text too,

00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:51.670
use 15 or maybe 20 like this.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:09:00.620
Remove one line so we have good balance of our design.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:08.645
Maybe we can use some color over here to represent our link like this.

00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:16.310
It is looking great and I think this sums up our second iteration on this design.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.995
Also I guess there is a line over here.

00:09:20.995 --> 00:09:23.650
I think we forgot over here.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:32.470
Let's put some block of line over here like that.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:44.970
Let's use it like this, inside our grid.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:51.945
This looks great and I think this sums up the second design.

00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:54.915
This is the iteration I came up with.

00:09:54.915 --> 00:10:02.580
I think this is it and we should move on to the next lesson.
