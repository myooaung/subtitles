00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
You might have heard different designers saying, okay, these,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.415
faults or this type kerning is a bit off,

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:11.010
or these two words need to be kerned.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.210
So basically, kerning is the space between two individual letters of any type,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.340
or any font, or any word.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.700
So you can see over here the space between o and t,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.220
it is basically the kerning.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.460
If we look at this word,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.810
I have increased the kerning,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.610
so basically, they have a bit bigger space between the two letters,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.305
or even all the letters.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:46.820
Basically, what it means is that sometimes some of the letters,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.495
if you can see over here in the word topography,

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:54.590
some letters like g and r are a bit closer to each other

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.385
than few other letters like p and o and other letters.

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:04.830
So this is basically called Kerning.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.025
Let's see how this kerning is going to affect our typography.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:18.350
So what does it means is if we try to have good space among our different letters,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.500
then it is more airy, openness, modern,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.780
elegant, stylish related to technology.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.020
If we have less letter spacing,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.110
then its mood is towards intimacy,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.304
and you might have seen using the very close letters to each other in different logos.

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:46.320
Basically, less letter spacing is used mostly in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.015
logos because it really creates a problem in legibility and readability.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:56.165
Let me show you some of the examples of letter spacing or kerning.

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:59.585
I'm going to show you the bad example and the fixed one.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:03.875
Here we have written the FedEx in two different forms.

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:08.585
In the left one, you can see the e and x are very close to each other.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:13.610
I have not changed any letter spacing.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.170
It is the font's default.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.310
In the bottom, you can see I have adjusted the space between e and x,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.020
so kerning is basically the space between two separate letters.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.840
I have fixed the kerning between E and X.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.450
In the right side, you can see the E, D,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.200
and E, they look like they have more space.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.080
So in the bottom, I have fixed that.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.050
I have reduced the kerning between

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.700
these three letters and it is looking more even to our eyes.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.860
So this is how we use kerning.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.650
Mostly, it is used in logos.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.315
You have seen FedEx logos,

00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:58.120
it is basically very tight kerning,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.830
most letters touching each other.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.760
This is how they made the FedEx logo.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.715
But this is how we fix kerning and what are the bad and good examples of kerning.

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:14.950
Let me show you how you are going to access this kerning in photoshop.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.530
In Photoshop, if you don't see this A character panel over here,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.520
you can go to window and click on this character over here,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.905
and this will appear over here.

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:29.690
You can see here,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.930
we have this V/A and there is a bit gap slash in between two letters.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.675
This is basically the kerning.

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:42.070
We can have two options like optical.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.840
You can see this letter spacing kerning has shifted.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.940
So optical is basically related to your eyes,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.200
what your eyes sees,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.340
and metric is basically machine kerning,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.880
so this is software based.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.430
Then we have zero and other options are not available for this fault.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.370
These are two options right now.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.810
If you want to change the spacing between specific letters,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.575
then select this letter and use this control instead, like this one.

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:20.190
Now, if I increase it to 200 percent,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.890
you can see that the spacing between a and c has been increased.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.230
This is how I use this Character panel to increase kerning.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:39.170
Select one letter, and you can use this tracking control,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.050
but I use it for single letters like that.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.239
This is all about how to use kerning in Photoshop.
