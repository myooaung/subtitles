00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Today we're going to talk about quotation marks.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:08.250
Now, a lot of people I have seen they don't know the proper usage of quotation marks.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.040
Now, we are going to see in this lecture,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.110
how to use quotation marks properly like a pro.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.680
Now, the first thing you need to know is that all the fonts,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.905
they don't support curly quotation marks.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:27.655
In the first example, you can see these marks are not curly at all.

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:30.270
In the second they are purely curly,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.600
and in the third they are a bit like typewriter style curly quotes.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.465
Make sure you are using a font that supports curly quotation marks,

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:46.370
and curly quotation marks are basically used in good typography.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.580
Here you can see I have shown few examples.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.170
"Hello there", she said.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.980
The curly quotation marks are properly used over here.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.484
I have seen a lot of designers and developers

00:00:57.484 --> 00:01:00.290
that they don't know the proper usage of quotation marks,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.030
and the types of quotation marks.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.070
There are two types of quotation marks.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.900
One are straight quotation marks,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.350
and other are curly quotation marks.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.035
Now, the straight quotation marks are normally used for feet and inch,

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:17.495
and also they are called feet and inch mark or second and minute mark.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.230
These are basically straight,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.490
and the curly quotation marks are basically

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.190
used when you are showing that someone is talking.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.680
This is the proper use.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.230
You can see in the first example,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.365
I am using curly quotation mark opening and closing at the end and start.

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:41.630
Six feet is shown with just one straight quotation mark,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.680
and inches is shown with two quotation marks which are straight.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.050
The other two are the wrong usages of quotation marks.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.415
Now, on the screen I'm going to show you

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:56.960
the shortcut keys for showing these or using these quotation marks in Photoshop,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.995
or any other program, Word editing program,

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:04.410
opening single quote, Alt plus 0145.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.790
We need to press that while pressing Alt key.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.965
For Mac users, Option plus right bracket.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.445
Also the closing single quote,

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:17.580
Alt plus 0146, and for Mac,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.565
Option plus Shift plus right bracket.

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:23.370
Now, for the double opening quotation marks,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.435
you need to use Alt plus 0147 in Windows,

00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:32.310
and in Mac, you need to use Option plus left bracket.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.945
For closing double-quotes, you need to use Alt plus 0148,

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:41.445
and on Mac you need to use Option plus Shift plus left bracket.

00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:45.680
This is all about using quotation marks properly and when to use which one,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.465
straight one or the curly one.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:49.850
If you have any questions, ask me.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.890
Let's move on to the next lesson.
