00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
Now, let me show you I made few just adjustments to this design at the end because I was

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.980
not feeling good about this area over here.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.160
So what I did is I moved this a bit below,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.770
and moved this line on this baseline.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.255
So that this line,

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:20.445
placed it on our baseline.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:22.260
Also, you can see over here,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.985
I used this quotation marks in between these two baselines,

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:31.395
and also I moved it a bit inside this gutter.

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.830
If you want to move it more,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.670
you can move it too like over here, like that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.985
I think we need to change this text over here.

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:50.820
We are going to use Source Sans Pro Regular for this,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.255
and we are going to use italic basically.

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:57.650
These are few settings or changes I have done to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.985
this design because I was not feeling very good with this area.

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:05.630
Also, if you want to switch back to regular,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.490
you can switch back to regular,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.600
and maybe we can use

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.375
more space between different letters and have something similar to this.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:18.920
Also if you want,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.905
you can change its color and make it a bit darker like we did in our first exercise.

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:28.895
Let's see and hide our modules and everything.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.325
See what it is going to look like.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:36.650
It looks more balanced now because I have moved this portion,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.850
this quotation mark a bit below because

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.230
we need a good amount of space in between these two paragraphs and this portion.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.705
It is almost perfect.

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:53.285
I think this line is getting too much attention, so if you want,

00:01:53.285 --> 00:02:02.070
you can change its color to maybe this red or something gray,

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.380
I think, that looks also good.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.825
Maybe this one, and change the quotation marks color to red just to grab attention.

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:14.880
I think this looks better,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.820
and it is good and better rather than the design before.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.300
Also, I think it is looking very dull,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.045
so I'm going to use a bit dark gray color to show this date.

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:38.140
Now, why I have used a bit darker color because readability is our first priority.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.015
So use a bit darker gray color.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:48.345
This is how I adjusted the last design and shifted and changed a few things.

00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:52.835
Always make sure that design is a progressive thing.

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:54.785
If you design something once,

00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:58.375
you need to open it and refine it again and again,

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:01.049
until the time you find the perfect balance,

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.915
and perfect colors, and the perfect sense.

00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:09.425
This is all about how I have refined the second part.

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.820
Let's move on to the third part.
