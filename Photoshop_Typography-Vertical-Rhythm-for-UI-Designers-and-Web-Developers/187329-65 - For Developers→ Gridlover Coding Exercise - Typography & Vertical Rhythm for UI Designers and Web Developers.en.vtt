00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.665
In this lesson we are going to create something like this.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:08.190
We are going to create vertical rhythm using this tool

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.335
Grade-Level and fan [inaudible] this Basehold.it.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:17.070
So let's get started and we are going to create something like this.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.870
I'm going to use Sublime Text.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.100
You can use whatever coding data you have,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.585
you can even use notepad.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.075
I'm going to quickly use Doc,

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:32.625
which is a shortcut for HTML document and I'm going to save it,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.060
use Control S, so I'm going to use it

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.550
and save it on desktop right now just for practice purposes.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.390
This is our vertical rhythm HTML.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.480
As soon as I use HTML,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.100
you can see over here.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.665
Now I'm going to remove this bootstrap we don't need bootstrap right now.

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:03.945
What we are going to use is we are going to use style sheet

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:10.605
and few other things like link rel.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:14.720
We are going to use style sheet for normalizing purpose.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.685
So we are going to use CDNJS normalize.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:24.860
Let's see what is going to come up with this one.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.135
I'm going to normalize my CSS,

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.925
copy and go to this one.

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:41.505
Here we have our normalize CSS and we need some sample text.

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:46.060
I'm going to open up my secret toolbar,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.650
and I'm going to use this HTML Ipsum to get some code over here.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.630
So what we need is maybe we need some headings.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.165
Where are the headings?

00:01:58.165 --> 00:01:59.925
Here we don't have headings.

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:04.380
This is a bit gold one.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.630
It's headings and everything else.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.840
I'm going to remove it over here and paste it like that.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.975
Maybe we need more paragraphs over here like this,

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:28.666
and maybe heading level three.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.940
Maybe we can use a container.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.890
I'm using MX.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.380
So this is why it is getting everything in shortcut and I'm filling everything else.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.090
So if you know CSS,

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.310
you will get the idea.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.105
What I'm trying to do is I'm just filling this up and I'm using this

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:57.795
normalize and I'm going to link and then also link other style sheet.

00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:03.900
I'm going to use it as, style.css.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.630
I'm going to create another file actually it's the first one.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.270
So this is the CSS file I have created over here.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.560
Now we are going to use something from here, Grade-Level.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.550
So this is my settings 4 size is equal to 18 pixels,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.910
line height 1.5, scale factor 1.44,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.100
and I'm using pixel values.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.900
You can also use REM or M. So what we are going to do is we are

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:44.490
going to copy everything from here, 1.44 yes.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.160
This works better in Chrome.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.670
Some functions are not working in Firefox.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.325
I don't know due to what reason.

00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:57.050
So I'm going to use REM and I'm going to copy everything

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:06.240
and Copy and Paste

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.805
it into my CSS.

00:04:08.805 --> 00:04:13.915
Let's see how it is going to look like in our browser.

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:18.615
This is how my right now headings and everything is working.

00:04:18.615 --> 00:04:22.985
Let's see whether it has been applied or not.

00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:27.825
Let's apply the vertical rhythm using our Basehold.it,

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:30.765
and our vertical rhythm is 27.

00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:37.360
I'm going to use 27 over here like that.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.610
This is how our current typography rhythm is.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.110
So it is looking nice.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.250
Maybe I need more space around this HTML Heading 1.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.395
You can see how this all is looking really nice in this setup.

00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:11.830
So let's see, maybe Heading 1 needs some more twicking.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.660
Maybe I can add a margin bottom of 1.6,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.580
a trim like this.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.785
It is looking better now.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:37.045
Then we can also use something for the paragraphs.

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.530
With the size for the paragraphs,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.360
I think it's taking the body size.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.390
Now for the font size in the body,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.195
I'm going to fix it to 18 pixels.

00:05:47.195 --> 00:05:51.450
Line height will be according to this font size.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.560
We can leave it like that or we can also use

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.235
27 pixels over here and leave everything rest like that.

00:06:02.235 --> 00:06:10.845
This is how we use grade-level to get our vertical spacing and alignment and everything.

00:06:10.845 --> 00:06:14.060
This is your next assignment,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.990
which is you are going to create me something like this one.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.395
Make sure it is vertically aligned to your baseline.

00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:29.555
You can use grade-level and create something similar to this one.

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:33.905
Also you can see over here at the top I am using this header,

00:06:33.905 --> 00:06:37.250
which is the height of my three baselines.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.979
So it is almost 81 pixels.

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.480
If you want similar, over here,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.160
you can use header and you can use that thing over here.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.390
What I use is there are only three things I have used.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:57.475
One is that normalize.css just to keep your settings style sheets cool,

00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:59.495
so embord that at the top,

00:06:59.495 --> 00:07:02.270
then we are using our custom style sheet,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.255
which is this one where we just copied and pasted,

00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:11.670
our grade-level RAM code.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.525
So this is the code it generated and we use it over here.

00:07:16.525 --> 00:07:23.174
Then we used Basehold.it to show us 27 pixels baseline,

00:07:23.174 --> 00:07:27.300
and this is all we need to use,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.900
a nice looking vertical rhythm.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.510
I'm not going into importing different Google force.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.525
If you want some force you can import that.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:45.885
This is how we use vertical alignment in our code,

00:07:45.885 --> 00:07:49.610
and to achieve vertical alignment in HTML and CSS.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.390
Your next challenge is to create something similar to

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.650
this one or this one you can use dummy text or whatever,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.830
just show me your skills and I will be waiting.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.150
So let's move on to the next lesson.
