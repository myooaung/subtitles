00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.010
We have already learned about typographic hierarchy and what it is.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.200
Now, we need to know how many hierarchy levels do I need?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.410
Maybe it depends on your project,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.965
but normally 4-6 levels are more than enough.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:19.710
Now what does 4-6 levels mean?

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.220
I'm going to show you in the next few minutes.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.755
Now, you might have seen that small headings like heading 5 or heading 6.

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:30.210
If you are a developer,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.920
you might understand what I'm saying right now.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.520
So if you are a designer, don't get worried.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.315
I'm going to show you in a few seconds.

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:41.885
Small headings are rarely used,

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:45.680
like heading number 5 or heading 6.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.040
Some people might agree or some might not agree with me,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.490
but I think that six levels of hierarchy are more than enough.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.130
Now, first of all,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.540
we might need headings,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.460
which are heading 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.509
So four levels for headings or four different sizes for different headings,

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.390
like heading 1 and then subheading and the sub-subheading, something like that.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.860
Then we need one size for body text,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.420
which could be 18 pixels,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.160
20, or 16 pixels.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.180
Then we need a small text.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.880
Sometimes we need to write a very small text,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.030
like captions or very grayish text,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.210
somewhere like you might have seen

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.000
some dates written in very small numbers or very small size.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.880
So from my point of view,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.925
six levels of hierarchy are more than enough,

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:46.100
if you are designing for mobile and web.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.780
I'm not talking about books.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.935
Book or magazines might needs more than these levels.

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:55.450
Let's see how I have used five levels of hierarchy,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.035
or you can say five different sizes of

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:04.700
the scale ratio into my hierarchy and how I have implemented it.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.860
You might have seen this before.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.590
This is the same exercise.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.150
You can see on the right I'm using five different sizes;

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.525
54, 37, 26, 18 and 13.

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:22.085
Now on the left side I'm using a tagline and a heading and a paragraph text.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:26.125
So you can see for the heading 4 and body text,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:27.470
the size is the same,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.945
just the heading is a bit bold.

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:35.880
Heading is in bold and the body text is a regular typeface.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.950
Then I'm using 26 pixel,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.715
which is heading 3 size for my tagline.

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:45.165
So if you are designing,

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:48.860
you are the designer or a web designer or mobile app designer,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.340
you should keep this in consideration.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.290
So you can use the same five levels into your taglines,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.530
headings, body text, lists,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.105
or something like that.

00:03:02.105 --> 00:03:04.970
So this is about levels of hierarchy,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.900
or how many levels do we really need in our web or mobile design.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.540
I hope you have enjoyed this lecture.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.580
Let's move on to the next lecture.
