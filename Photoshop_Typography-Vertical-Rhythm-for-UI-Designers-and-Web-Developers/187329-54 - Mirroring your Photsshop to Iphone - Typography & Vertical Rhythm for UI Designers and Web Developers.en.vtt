00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to connect your Photoshop with

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.695
your iOS device to view this art board on your iPhone.

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:14.760
First you are going to go to this edit and remote connections.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.040
What we are leading is this server service name.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:28.280
It is depart by written like this like Photoshop server and make some password over here.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.780
It must be six characters long.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.640
Don't make it very complex,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.165
just a simple one.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:37.380
Then you are going to need this IP address.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.030
Copy this or keep this in your mind that you are going

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.025
to need this password and this IP address and the service name.

00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:49.020
Let's get started.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.345
Now I'm going to switch to my iPhone screen.

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:55.640
The app I'm using right now is this one.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.370
This is iTunes Store,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.830
Apple Store, Ps play for Photoshop.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.965
I'm going to show you this app,

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:10.775
and also I'm going to show you this Photoshop device proved preview app.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:14.390
These are two apps you can use to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.820
connect your iOS device with your Photoshop and view your designs.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.720
Let's switch to the iPhone screen.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300
This is my iPhone screen,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.030
and as you can see in the third row,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.965
I have this app Ps play.

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:31.730
You can click on it and you can see it has already been connected.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.305
So I am going to go back and show you how you are going to connect it with your iPhone.

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:43.100
It is showing discovered connections and some saved connections.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.955
So most probably you are going to go with this discovered,

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:48.860
it is going to connect with it.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.954
It will require the IP address or password,

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:56.225
but you need to copy and paste it over here.

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:58.180
I'm going to add new.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.805
For some reason on my computer,

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:04.325
it is not showing me.

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:09.380
It is not letting me connect to this iPhone server with new connections,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.460
maybe it is my firewall.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.515
So if you have such problems 79.1,

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:22.130
and here you are going to enter your password, mine was microsoft.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.295
When you have entered all this information,

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:32.180
press Okay and it will be connected to your screen.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.460
Right now I already have a connection,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.900
so I'm going to use this one.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.010
You can see it is updating and showing me the screen.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.405
If you tap once you can see all these functions have gone.

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:46.450
You can take a screenshot,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.960
expand it and also there have some this option of 101,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.390
one by one ratio,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.055
I think screen ratio.

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:57.740
Also you can refresh it if you want to.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.060
I don't use this app to take screenshots or do other things.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.160
I just use it to,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.500
you can say view my design over here and to see how much spaces I need,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.165
or maybe I need to move some element over here or over there.

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:18.510
This is how I use this app.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.585
Let me show you another app,

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:24.785
which is going to be our Photoshop,

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:28.275
Adobe Photoshop app, which is this last about preview.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:31.640
You need to be signed in to Photoshop server,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.700
which is basically Photoshop CC.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.015
You can see it is already connected.

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:40.430
It is showing me the art board one.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.550
So it is showing the art board name two.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.490
This is how this app is connected.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.585
Normally you just need to sign in your Adobe account,

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:52.340
your Adobe CC account,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.830
and it will be connected to your Photoshop server.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.200
I don't remember how I connected it and it is

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.570
not showing me any options. You can see over here.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.480
It is just giving me this iPhone art board five and document Canvas, this one.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.990
These are two methods you are going to connect your iPhone with your Photoshop.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.360
Make sure your Wi-Fi is running because it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.900
uses Wi-Fi connection to connect to this server.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.060
So this sums up this lecture on how you can

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.160
connect your devices with your iPhones or Android devices.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Somehow on my Android phones due to my firewall settings,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.555
I think it is not letting me connect to the Photoshop server.

00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:43.520
So only I was left with this option to show you on the iOS devices.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.515
So I think it will do the trick.

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:48.755
So if you have some problem or run into any problems,

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:52.565
just let me know and make sure you don't have any firewall.

00:04:52.565 --> 00:04:58.625
This is how you use different apps to connect to your iPhone and show those screens.

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:00.665
This ends up this lectures,

00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:05.130
and let's move on to the next lecture.
