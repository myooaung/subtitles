00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.295
Let's design a simple screen,

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:05.370
maybe something very simple.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.130
Now we are going to start with a file of 320 by 480 height.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.330
You can increase the height,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.930
maybe 600, and press "Okay."

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.030
Leave the resolution to 72 because

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.965
our scale independent pixels are going to be the same size.

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:28.910
This is the size we are going to develop, which is MDPI.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.910
You can also change it to 40 if you want to,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.395
but 320 by 600 seems good to me.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:39.245
Press "Okay," don't color mine this document,

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:41.330
and this is our size.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.720
Let's zoom in a bit.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.580
Now, for the heading,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:56.155
we are going to use Google's font, which is Roboto.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:01:03.390
Let's use this Roboto bold maybe, and 56 point.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.325
I think they have 56 in there.

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:12.400
I'm going to use 56 over here.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.310
This is a very big heading for us and we are going to use 56, same.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.800
Let's leave it to Auto like that,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.705
or maybe we can use 56 over here, 56.

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:35.105
They haven't specified any tracking,

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:38.465
so we are going to use our own eyes and gut feeling.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:44.145
Basically gut feeling or maybe we can use zero over here,

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.940
maybe they have developed a font like that.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.215
This is heading and then we are going to go to the subheading.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:56.715
Subheading should be something 24 headline,

00:01:56.715 --> 00:02:01.100
24 sp, so this is going to be 24.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.115
Calculation is very easy like this.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.880
Let's move this up.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.535
We are going to use not Bold but maybe Light font for this one.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:22.175
Now maybe we are going to use this gray color like that.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:25.220
Let's move it closer to this.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.610
Zoom out to see how it is going to look like.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.840
We_can _do _it, this

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.960
is our big heading and we can also say Yes,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.540
just to make sure it is looking good.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.840
This is our big heading and then we are going to paste some text over here like this.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.900
We are going to use type Lorem Ipsum.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.150
The size we are going to use is we're going to 40 sp,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.740
so 14 sp is for body 14 points.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.650
Let's use 18 points for the leading, like that.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.000
Maybe, I guess maybe more than 18 is good, 20 is good.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.985
We have set our leading everything on this screen size.

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:34.455
For this MDPI, it is four MDPI.

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:37.320
All the sizes are the same.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.910
Maybe we can reduce this 56 to 45 because 56 is looking too big.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.240
This one is 56, let's move it back to 45.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.650
Yeah, I think it's better, 45 and 45.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.560
Keep it simple like this,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.210
maybe red is good.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.235
Let's move it a bit below like that.

00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:20.125
Move the text more at the bottom like this.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:29.130
Let's change the color for this one to this dark blackish color.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.045
This is our art board.

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:34.565
Let's move the heading at the top,

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:38.100
maybe like this. Looking good.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.920
Now we have moved our heading, subheading,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.085
and everything according to the scale of

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:50.420
this typographic scale by material design, Google Material Design.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.620
I think that's it.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.600
If you want to design for a bigger screen,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.885
I think you should adjust your font sizes and multiply them

00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:04.020
with the respective resolutions.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.155
Let's see if they have some sizes over here.

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:11.950
This is HDPI which is 800 by 480,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.370
so let's design for this one.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.975
Or maybe we can increase our image size to that 150.

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.350
I think it is 150.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.895
It is going to be 150 by 150,

00:05:26.895 --> 00:05:31.490
and this is how we have gone to the other screen size.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.900
Now if you go to this, you can see the pixels.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.515
The height is 900,

00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:39.690
and the width is 480.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.265
It is very easy to switch from one to another.

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:46.865
If you want to go to the next one,

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:50.675
you can also go to this 720.

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:54.760
Change 720 in the width over here, like that,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.230
and you can see this is how we are shifting

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.220
towards the next screens XXHDPI, 960 by 1600.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.415
Basically it is the width,

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:10.575
don't worry about the height.

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:15.400
We are going to switch to 960.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.960
Now you can see all our text sizes are also increasing with it.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.960
We should not be worried about because we have point sizing in our Photoshop settings.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.385
How you can set it, you can go to this Preferences,

00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:35.295
and go to Units & Rulers,

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:37.890
and set your Type to Points.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.440
It is good practice to set it to Type to

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.455
Points because of you when you are designing for mobile screens.

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:56.030
This is how we have switched to different screen sizes and this is 100 percent.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.710
You can see how it is looking very nice.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.935
It's Roboto font.

00:07:01.935 --> 00:07:06.755
You can use other variations of Roboto if you want to,

00:07:06.755 --> 00:07:10.075
but I'm right now sticking with only a Roboto font.

00:07:10.075 --> 00:07:13.815
This is all about DPIs and sps,

00:07:13.815 --> 00:07:17.460
scalable pixels, and different sizes.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.030
You should give your developers these sizes.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.770
Right now we have, I guess this one is okay.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.915
I think I should go back to my original format.

00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:36.225
Step backwards, step backwards, step backward.

00:07:36.225 --> 00:07:39.180
It's not working like that.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.310
Maybe we should change the image size to 320 again,

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:50.045
and this is how our text actual size is basically laid out.

00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:53.920
Let's see which was that.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.220
It's 14 points, then 24 points or basically 45 points.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.455
We are going to tell them that 45,

00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:04.965
24, and 14 sp are used.

00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:10.640
This is all about the typography on your Android Apps and mobile phones.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.330
I have told you how to do that in Photoshop too,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.880
and how to cater for different screen sizes. This is it.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.550
If I come up with something else or you need my help,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.640
always ask me questions.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.690
I think we should now move to the next lecture.
