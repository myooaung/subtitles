00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
Let' s create an art board with all these different sizes.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:08.390
We are going to create a new file with this art board.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.930
We are going to use our size is 320 by 480.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.320
Press "Okay". Now we are going to add another screen over here.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.185
This is iPhone four or old iPhones.

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:24.920
Then we're going to click this plus icon and we're

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.015
going to select iPhone five over here and click ones over here.

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:31.930
This is going to be iPhone 5s screen.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.570
Then we are going to add another one over here.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.870
Let's create another one over here.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.315
I'm going to click at iPhone 6 and click over here once.

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:46.640
Then I'm going to create another one over here,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.085
which is iPhone 6 Plus.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.770
The last one was selected.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.465
I am going to click this one and I'm going to press or highlight like this.

00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:01.849
Now zoom out and you can see these are all the screens.

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:04.350
Let's line them up.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.165
This is a line to this one seclect this one.

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:14.165
I'm control flicking these to align them up.

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:17.390
Then, so all our art boards are ready,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.205
so let's get started.

00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:24.605
First I am going to start with our most small screen, which is 1x.

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:29.455
I am going to use my San Francisco UI text.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:34.595
First I'm going to draw some margins around it.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:37.460
Now I'm going to use photoshops, default,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.340
GridLayout and let's remove the columns.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.565
We are going to use some margins at the top,

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:46.840
20, 20, 20 and 20.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.960
This is our frame.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.475
We are going to design in it.

00:01:50.475 --> 00:01:55.655
I have hidden all the other art boards so we can easily design in it.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:58.195
I'm going to select the text over here.

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:02.290
I'm going to click and drag like this.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.120
This is our main heading.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.279
Our heading should be 32 pixels or 32 points.

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:20.135
I'm going to set the 32 point size from here,

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:27.360
here we have a different point size is 32 and 12 points tracking.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.115
Here I have, let's zoom in to a 100 percent.

00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:34.760
Now our document is ready,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.410
we have set the margins around it.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.025
We are going to use the text tool and draw some line over here to get our heading.

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:48.830
We are going to use 32 points with the San Francisco UI display.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.430
We are going to use semi bold.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.005
I'm going to write over here this,

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.870
my big and long,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.720
long heading, and it is just for fun.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.895
I'm going to shift the line height to 1.5.

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:11.640
I think if tracking was 12th,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.675
I guess tracking was 12 points.

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:17.390
Tracking is set to 12,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.435
and I am going to set this to 36 pixels as my line height,

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:25.750
so this is my heading.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.520
Let's change the color to this blue color.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.190
Now we are going to add some more text over here.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.510
I'm going to select this Lorem Ipsum, Lorem Ipsum.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.085
We are going to use 14 points with 21 point line height,

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:53.340
and it is minus 11 in

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.045
San Francisco IS human interface guidelines.

00:04:00.045 --> 00:04:07.895
We are going to set it to maybe we need a bit of dull color, something like this.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:18.960
Now let's zoom in a bit more so we can see the spacing.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:28.820
one more text which is published on 6th May, 2016.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.040
I'm going to select this t and h,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.300
and I'm going to use this command to make it superscript or subscript.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.175
I don't know what this said.

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:48.165
It superscript. Now we are going to change the color for this heading.

00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:53.030
This date. They've changed the color to a bit dull gray.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.620
Let's align it to this line, like this.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.950
Mode, now we are going to use 12 points over here

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:11.640
for the date and I'm going to see what are the specifications for tracking for 12.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.760
We are going to use zeroover here, like this.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.730
Let's see how this one is.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.835
I think for 14 points,

00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:26.509
it's minus 11, so it should be minus 11.

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:31.980
Everything is set up so let's copy these to our other art boards.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.160
Now we are going to use all these settings and all this text,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.870
and we're going to duplicate it to our other art boards,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.785
so let's zoom out.

00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:49.390
I'm going to drag my this art board over here,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.430
align them with these.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.115
Now I'm going to select all the text,

00:05:57.115 --> 00:05:59.965
delete this empty layer, also,

00:05:59.965 --> 00:06:03.860
this one into a group.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.295
You just name it text,

00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:12.710
and I'm going to use Alt and dragging it over to the next one.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.735
Let's hide other, all other art boards like that.

00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:24.025
Just zoom into this 100 percent.

00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:25.940
Now if you remember,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:33.885
we are right now in iPhone 5. iPhone 5,

00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:37.100
now what we're going to do is we are going to

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.490
size these texts and we are going to "control T".

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.980
We are going to change the width of this too.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:52.350
Let's make it percent and we are going to change it to 200 percent.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.690
This is how we are going to fit everything over here.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.760
Like this, and if you want to set the margins,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.320
you can set the margins overhead.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.260
Now if you check the sizes of all the force,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.020
you can see it is perfectly doubled.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.390
The 64 points and everything else is the same.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.715
If you want to, because we have more height,

00:07:19.715 --> 00:07:22.675
you can drag this over like this,

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:25.335
and we can have more texts over here.

00:07:25.335 --> 00:07:30.010
This is how we are going to use other screens with this,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.000
so we have completed two screens.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.190
I am not using any margins,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.690
you can use the margins,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.640
you can use margins on each of these screens.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.110
Maybe double the margins or increase them by 10 pixels,

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.640
whatever you like the best.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.800
Now let's move on to the next one,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.100
which is iPhone 6.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.920
Now we are going to again copy this and we are going

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.310
to drag it over here on our iPhone 6 screen.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.130
You can see the size of our text should be the same.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:16.460
Just we have a bit of more screen size in pixels or physical screen size.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.835
We are going to just increase our sizes,

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:26.945
paragraph sizes in the width and also in the height.

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:36.105
Also we can go to the heading and we can drag it and make it equal to our paragraph.

00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:40.385
Now we have more space over here so we can shift it up.

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:45.140
Now you can see how this is going to change on

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:50.750
different screens because our screen sizes and screen dimensions,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:56.160
we have more space on some screens and some on some scheme we have less space.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:02.310
Let's keep everything same.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:08.060
Try to copy all the distances between different elements the same.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.970
If you want to apply vertical rhythm,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.175
you're going to apply it because if I try to apply vertically then no,

00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:16.850
I think this lecture will be 30 minutes long.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.070
I don't want it to be that lengthy.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.495
Here we have the last screen,

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:27.470
which is iPhone 6 plus.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.145
Now I am going to again select this

00:09:31.145 --> 00:09:36.060
and I'm going to press "Alt" and drag it over here like this.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:44.265
Now, this is our iPhone 6 Plus.

00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:47.590
I'm going to rename this art board.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:54.710
Now here you can see these headings and everything is looking a bit smaller,

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.685
so we are going to increase it to 150 percent.

00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:01.100
Why 150 percent?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.805
Because this one is 200 and this one is 300 percent.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:10.240
We are going to increase it to multiply to 150 percent,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.660
so change the width to 150. Wait a minute.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:20.270
First, make sure that you have "control T" and press

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:25.640
this lock because we want everything to be increased in proportion.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.860
Let's make it 150 percent.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:35.160
This is how our text is going to fit on the screen,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.870
iPhone 6 Plus screen.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.880
Now, you can adjust everything accordingly,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.420
if you want to adjust the heading and spacing,

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.470
you can adjust it like that.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:01.430
All our screens are ready right now you can see how I

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:07.580
used all these techniques to copy everything.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.469
We did a simple calculation of multiplying

00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:19.305
our iPhone dimensions and pixels resolutions.

00:11:19.305 --> 00:11:22.685
We have come up with all this design.

00:11:22.685 --> 00:11:24.215
For one next hour.

00:11:24.215 --> 00:11:26.465
Everything was same for 2x.

00:11:26.465 --> 00:11:28.100
It was multiplied by two,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.040
we increase the size then this is also 2x,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.065
so no size difference. This is 3x.

00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:39.645
We multiply this 2x with 1.5 to get this 3x size.

00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:43.790
Also you can copy this text and drag it over here and multiply it

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.405
with 300 percent shift it to 300 percent.

00:11:48.405 --> 00:11:50.760
It will give you the same effect.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.160
Now if you check the font size.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.930
This one should be 96.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.890
This one should be 64.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.725
This one should be 32.

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:08.120
If we go to select this one, this is 32.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:17.660
His is how we use text sizes because an iOS app developer,

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:23.365
he is going to need the distances and text sizes in points.

00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:26.135
You are going to give him something like this.

00:12:26.135 --> 00:12:31.730
Line height, this points and font size, font.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.050
You have used this one color,

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.130
you have used this one.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.515
spacing between elements is this much.

00:12:36.515 --> 00:12:45.835
This is how you are going to design iOS devices and use typography in iOS devices.

00:12:45.835 --> 00:12:51.395
This is all about this iOS practice in this lesson,

00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:58.655
we have created four different screens iPhone 6 plus iPhone 5 and iPhone four.

00:12:58.655 --> 00:13:03.890
There is a challenge that I want you do design something similar to this one.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.405
Tried to design, create four art boards like this.

00:13:08.405 --> 00:13:12.265
Try to replicate your design on all of them.

00:13:12.265 --> 00:13:16.640
Show it to me. You can post it in the questions.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.095
Ask a question, show me your work and I will try to improve it.

00:13:21.095 --> 00:13:23.510
If you want to apply vertical rhythm,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.660
you're going to apply vertical rhythm,

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.205
you can set baseline and everything.

00:13:28.205 --> 00:13:31.024
Even if you want to design just one screen,

00:13:31.024 --> 00:13:35.260
then you can select just one screen and design it properly.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.010
I just wanted to make sure that you

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.330
understand that if you have to design iOS app in different sizes,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.390
how you are going to manage it.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.505
This is the most difficult thing in,

00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:55.505
while you are designing your iOS app or Android app or something similar to this.

00:13:55.505 --> 00:13:58.350
Let's move on to the next lesson.
