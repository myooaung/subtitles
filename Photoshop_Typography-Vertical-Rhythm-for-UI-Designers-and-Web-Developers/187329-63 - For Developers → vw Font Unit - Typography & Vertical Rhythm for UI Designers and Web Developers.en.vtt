00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Here is a bit of introduction to this VW awesome unit

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.995
and I really love how it expands and contracts on responsive websites.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:14.235
Here are three headings and then we have

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:18.030
a paragraph over here and you can see paragraph is very big.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.655
Let me explain why it is very big.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:28.005
Now if we move on to this container, sorry, style CSS.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.360
So, what is happening over here?

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.260
First thing is HTML font size a 100 percent,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.105
also this container width is 80 percent and font size

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:42.735
in this parent container is also 24.

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:46.850
So you can see over here this VW unit,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.970
is relative to the size of this browser window.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:59.625
So it has no effect of this 100 percent or this font size 24 pixels.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:06.860
So what is happening is I have set for a paragraph font size to 4.5 vw.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.930
You can experiment with it.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.110
So you can see it is very big.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.490
This paragraph size also the headings are very big.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.190
Heading sizes are also in vw 15 viewport width and then we have line-height,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.905
other things, margins and setup everything.

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:31.040
Also, heading two, heading three and small text is in RAM

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.090
or you can see if I try to use this vw,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.900
then maybe we can use 2.5 vw over here, like this.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.510
Let's see how it is going to look like our small text.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.040
So, small text is like this.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.340
Now for headings, it is very good,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.590
but for paragraph text it is not really nice.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.960
So, let's shift to our responsive view.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.040
Now, you can see as I expand and contract my viewport size,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.429
you can see over here at the top 623 pixels,

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.100
I press "Control+Shift +M" on my Firefox.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.375
If you are using Chrome,

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:26.790
I think you can "Shift" and press "F12" and select this one Toggle device.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.865
It is also "Control", "Shift, M".

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:32.300
So you can see it on different sizes like this,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.190
like this, and like this.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.260
So right now I'm using this Firefox browser.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.140
Now you can see our heading size is relative to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.870
our viewport width and it is really responsive as soon as we contract it.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.500
Let's move on to this 320 pixels width,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.260
which is iPhone five or four, I guess.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.680
Okay, so this is how our text is going to look.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.680
But you can see the small text is really suffering.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.590
It is very small and heading size is good on small devices,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.930
but it is very large, sorry,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.425
paragraph text is very large on large screens.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.885
So this is not a very good practice.

00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:20.735
So when you are using this VW try to use it just on the headings,

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:26.645
like Heading 123, not the small headings because they are going to get very small.

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:30.875
So very big headings can get good firm benefit.

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:32.915
If you are using a paragraph,

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:37.415
I think you should use RAM value or something closer to this,

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:40.950
like 1.2 RAM over here.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.800
So it is going to look good also for the small text.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.290
We are going to use RAM over here.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.485
So I'm going to use one RAM over here for the small text.

00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:56.000
There's three Facets.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.880
So this is how we can use this VW unit and try to avoid the things I mentioned over here.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.140
Do not use it on paragraph text.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.360
Okay So let's move on to the next lesson.
