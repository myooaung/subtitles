00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
Now, let's talk about what is vertical rhythm or baseline grid.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.290
Some of you might be using baseline,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.150
but I know that most of the designers even who are using Photoshop from past few years,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.855
they don't know what a vertical rhythm or baseline grid is.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.770
Basically, we are going to create harmony into

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.860
different design elements by using an even vertical spacing.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.790
This is basically to layout our text.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.460
Even you can apply it on different design elements like buttons,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.025
graphics, and few other things.

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:46.865
It basically creates a vertical harmony between our design elements and our type.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:49.835
Now, how to calculate baseline grid size.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:53.570
Basically baseline grid size is based on

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.440
your base font size multiplied by your line height.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.750
So if I have a base font size like 18 pixels and my line height is 1.5,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.760
you will get 27 pixel baseline grid size.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.705
Now, this is basically baseline grid size.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:16.610
You can also use multiples of your base font size,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.540
like if you have 27 pixel baseline grids,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.940
you can also use nine pixels or maybe 18 pixels.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.100
Sometimes you might need to use nine or maybe multiple of 27.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.890
This baseline grid is basically the unit of harmony.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.340
So if you want to use it,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.230
you can use it in all your design elements.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.315
Like if you want to size a button,

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:47.520
so you can size it like 27 multiply by 2,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.160
it is 54, I guess.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.270
Now, you can use the height of 54 pixels for your buttons.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.445
Same applies to the width.

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:00.665
This is basically vertical rhythm,

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:07.320
so it will be more applied to the height of the items rather than the width of the items.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.570
This is how you apply it to your design,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.260
your type, and everything.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.785
Let me show you the example of baseline grid of 26 pixels.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:22.040
On the left side, I am using a word without vertical rhythm.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.315
I'm just spacing out with my instinct.

00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:28.190
You can see on the left side,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.345
they are not aligned vertically very well.

00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:35.660
Also the paragraph is a bit misaligned.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.210
Then on the right side you can see I am using the baseline grid and I

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:48.315
am vertically aligning everything according to my vertical rhythm and baseline.

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:52.830
You can see the subheading Roboto Condensed 26 pixels on

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.320
the right side is aligned in between,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.295
in the middle of the two baselines.

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:06.665
Also, our main heading is aligned between three baseline units,

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:13.960
and our paragraph is also sitting inside each baseline and in the middle of it.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.665
You can also align it with the bottom of your text.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:26.180
So you can just rather than aligning paragraphs in the middle of these baselines,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:35.695
you can put them or you can make them sit on the bottom of your force baseline.

00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:39.390
Match the force baseline with the baseline grid

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.924
and that can also help you aligning everything perfectly.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:49.535
In this section, I'm going to show you how you can use the multiples of baseline grid,

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:53.930
forward margins, spacing, and/or other design elements.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.935
As I have told you before in the previous slide,

00:03:57.935 --> 00:04:03.030
you can see on the left I am using the 26 pixel as my baseline,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.220
so 13 pixel is also a unit of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.560
this baseline a multiple of this baseline then 52,78,104, and 130.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.045
How I got this,

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.730
26 multiplied by 2 is 52,

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.890
and then multiply by 3,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.515
78, multiply by 4,104.

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:29.005
On the right side, you can see I am using this same multiples to space out two sections.

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:33.500
The top one paragraph and heading and new section at the bottom you

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.075
can see I am them with 104 pixels,

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:42.330
which is also a multiple of 26 pixels.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.820
This is basically how to create harmony and vertical rhythm in your designs.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.110
This will really enhance your design to the next level.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.210
If you are using a very good typographic skill along with this baseline grid,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.200
then even only the type of your design,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.000
just the type, heading and texts can really impact the user,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.370
so use them wisely and let's move on to the next lesson.
