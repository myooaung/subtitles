00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.815
First of all, we are going to create our heading,

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:07.830
which will be in Signika negative. Select the font.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.765
You have already installed the font,

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.150
search over here Signika.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.420
There are two font, Signika regular and Signika negative.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.315
I'm going to use Signika negative bold,

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:22.140
and size will be 170 points.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.960
This is not hard and fast rule,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.895
don't worry where I came up with this size, actually.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:33.510
I just experimented and I found out

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.260
that this is the best size that matches the next line,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.085
let me show you 35 percent OFF.

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:42.740
Now, in this exercise,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.900
I am not going to contract this size.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.370
I'm not going to move it a bit smaller.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.490
Let's move it in the middle.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.360
Let's create another layer and we are going to use the font Andre regular.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.995
We are going to use

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:10.889
the line summer surprise

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:16.005
and the size should be 83 points.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:21.140
Now, you can see it is almost the same size as the top.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.970
You can see the edges are a bit off,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.235
it is happening because of this tracking, I guess.

00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:35.595
We are going to set it to zero.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:42.375
Now, they are actually met the next letter.

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:44.510
This is good, so far,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.990
so good, we are going to create another layer.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.130
This is going to be the text HURRY.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.705
What was the text? HURRY Expires July 31st.

00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:01.280
We are going to write over here, HURRY.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.220
The third font we used was

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:16.400
Aileron Regular and we are going to reduce its size to 50 points.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.640
You can see over here it is almost the fit size over here,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.500
it is actually equal to the size above summer surprise.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.590
Now, the next line which was summer coupan code,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.990
some says coupon code.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.520
I say coupan code,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.720
so don't worry about it.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.755
Summer16. It will be wide and we should move it above this button.

00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:51.320
I am going to use a lighter version of this font right now.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.900
This must be all caps,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.610
so we are going to use this one.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.870
Let's move it around in this,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.570
I'm going to align it in the middle.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.330
You can use these.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.340
I have created custom shortcut keys which I explained in my other course,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.824
where I created a lot of custom keyboard shortcuts for Photoshop.

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:16.820
There's one more thing,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.250
we need to make it superscript.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.200
Do we call it superscript?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.715
Yes, superscript.

00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:29.075
Now, just to make sure that it is going to align with all the top ones,

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:32.730
we are going to increase its tracking,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.105
it's almost equal to the top.

00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:38.120
Summer surprise.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.910
Why we have to summer surprises over here?

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.790
Let's line them up and use this vertical spacing.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.010
Still it is a bit off,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.840
so we are going to move everything in the middle like that.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.520
It's up to you, you can leave this message closer to this one,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.475
or you can separate them with the same space.

00:04:07.475 --> 00:04:10.140
It's up to you whatever you want.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.120
You can also create something like this,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.725
like I have two main promotion message at the top and then the action at the bottom.

00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:26.810
So I have separated both of these into two different areas.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.070
Also if you want to round this rectangle,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.575
you can go to this properties panel and get some roundness.

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:37.800
Maybe it is closer to this team.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.764
It is actually summer surprise,

00:04:40.764 --> 00:04:45.335
or you can say summer sale.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:48.250
I'm going to add one more thing.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.510
I'm going to add some drop shadow to this pattern.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.910
It is going to be closer to this pattern.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.680
Like this, you can see over here,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.295
a bit of shadow coming out and you can increase opacity of this shadow.

00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:13.350
Maybe this is good enough.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.615
We have almost finished this exercise.

00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:22.130
If you want something change into this,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.835
sorry, I have the wrong spelling of the summer.

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:33.960
Now, it's summer surprise and maybe we need to shift the size to 81 points,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.305
adjust according to your needs.

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:39.810
One more little detail.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.970
I left the swoosh thing.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.569
This is the one I used.

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.055
It is the clip art.

00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:55.735
I showed you the resources before so I'm going to just drag it in Photoshop like that.

00:05:55.735 --> 00:06:00.595
We are going to reduce its size.

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:03.370
Rotate it like that.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.025
I am pressing shift so it is rotating with the angles I have specified in Photoshop.

00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:11.920
If you don't know this,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.100
then you should go to this preferences and you should set the sizes over here.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.100
We have over here,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.230
I don't remember right now but I think it's in this settings.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.510
You can find them over here.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.900
My Photoshop is slowing down.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.320
It is looking very big,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.110
so I'm going to squeeze it a bit more.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.080
This is looking almost perfect.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.985
We are going to give it color overlay because we don't want a black swoosh around here.

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:50.265
Color overlay, maybe you can use this one.

00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:55.315
It's up to you. You can use white or gray or whatever you like.

00:06:55.315 --> 00:07:00.260
Make sure that color opacity is 100 percent.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.060
This is one Control J,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.790
and I'm going to move it over here.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:12.025
I am going to Control T or Command T on your Mac.

00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:14.995
So replace, whenever I say control,

00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:20.785
you replace it with command flip horizontal and press Okay,

00:07:20.785 --> 00:07:24.685
and make it a bit more closer to this one.

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:31.089
Now one thing, make sure that this space from this line,

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:32.950
this border to this,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.750
this space is equal to space around here.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.720
This is one thing you need to make sure.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.990
Now, you can see we have almost completed our exercise.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:56.215
Maybe we need a bit of bigger button because it is looking a bit smaller to me.

00:07:56.215 --> 00:07:58.330
Also, if you want,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.295
you can make them closer or maybe more spacier,

00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:05.875
it's up to you like this.

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:09.505
So maybe make it more spacier.

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:13.195
Also, I think the button is looking

00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:17.785
a bit smaller to me so I'm going to increase its size.

00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:20.170
I think it's too much.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:26.365
Maybe height is going to be 120 pixels, it is good.

00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:28.840
Now, maybe I need to move it.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.730
These are just the final details.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.030
You can use them whenever you like,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.000
or try them out and just lock this.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.280
I'm going to select this one,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.855
move it a bit up,

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:42.925
or maybe closer to this.

00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:45.519
So it makes sense.

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:51.310
I'm also going to move these two a bit more up like that.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:57.410
So let's create a group of all these top elements.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.955
Move them up a bit.

00:09:00.955 --> 00:09:04.180
I think here we have the perfect balance.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.265
Now, if you want to add something more to this design,

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:11.065
you are free to go.

00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:17.575
This is just an exercise to create something similar to,

00:09:17.575 --> 00:09:22.810
you might have seen a lot of social media ads like these,

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.925
so you know how to create them.

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:30.610
Now you can see, I see that there is less space over here than this over here.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.980
So you can see here it is balanced.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.720
We have more space over here.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.960
I added this intentionally,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.065
so we are going to add it over here.

00:09:41.065 --> 00:09:44.140
So make it a bit more bigger like this.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.700
So you can see is a bit of more balanced space.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.675
We need maybe more increment in size like that.

00:09:53.675 --> 00:10:03.665
So this is how we use our own judgment and gut skills to align things and design things.

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:10.165
So maybe we need more sharper orangish color like this.

00:10:10.165 --> 00:10:15.610
This is better, I guess.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.235
This one is better.

00:10:18.235 --> 00:10:21.085
Also, we need more earth tones,

00:10:21.085 --> 00:10:25.540
so maybe we need to move around a bit.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.185
Maybe over here, this one looks good.

00:10:29.185 --> 00:10:31.435
So this comes with practice.

00:10:31.435 --> 00:10:33.445
Color sense is not easy to develop.

00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:38.380
Also, this typography matching skills are not easier to develop.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.980
You can see all these fonts are looking well together.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.200
This one is a bit serious,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.910
or you can say a bit legible,

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:54.385
more legible because I wanted the user to read this exactly what it is.

00:10:54.385 --> 00:10:56.350
This is very big,

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.515
so I can get creative with these areas.

00:10:59.515 --> 00:11:03.820
So summer surprise as it is used in a very big font.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.830
So it is good to go with the script font, so easier to read.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.220
Make sure you don't have too much tracking in the letter.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:18.475
So it should always fill a script rather than some broken script font.

00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:25.030
So now, we have this inner content area.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.830
So let's make them all together.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.640
Also this one, move this one over here.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.575
So let's group them together.

00:11:38.575 --> 00:11:42.370
Again, I'm pressing Shift.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.475
So this is our main design content.

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:53.690
I always do this because we need to move this around and align it.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.640
So I don't know what is happening,

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.835
why it is not aligning with our background.

00:12:02.835 --> 00:12:05.465
So let's move it up.

00:12:05.465 --> 00:12:09.805
So we have one locked layer inside this one.

00:12:09.805 --> 00:12:15.950
So just unlock this and we are going to move it around.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.290
Now, it's almost perfect,

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.230
so it is very closer to this design.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.590
I think I had more peachy color over here.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.660
What is the color, what is this color?

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:36.445
B10. So it is more in the orangish shade and it is in grayish orange mix.

00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:38.740
So you can see over here,

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.155
here we have color slider.

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:45.670
So here we have a bit of more darker color.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.510
I think it is not always perfect,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.860
say that copy everything from the same design.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.835
So I try to create something different every time.

00:12:57.835 --> 00:13:01.280
So this looks a bit more.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.640
Maybe I need a bit more lighter color like this one.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.750
So we have created this exercise.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:19.030
We are going to create a new alternation or new variation for this one,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:24.175
which was, I guess this one.

00:13:24.175 --> 00:13:26.725
So we will do it in the next lesson.

00:13:26.725 --> 00:13:29.185
We will be using this Sian,

00:13:29.185 --> 00:13:32.485
very Sian sharp color.

00:13:32.485 --> 00:13:34.945
So we will do it in the next lesson.

00:13:34.945 --> 00:13:42.220
So stay tuned for such exercises and keep on collecting different fonts,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:49.135
try to combine them and create some designs using this background pattern technique.

00:13:49.135 --> 00:13:53.080
So just add some context in your design.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.010
So this looks like a pattern of

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:03.190
clothes or your shirt or women's shirt, something like that.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.835
So let's move on to the next lesson.

00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:11.620
One more thing, don't forget to download the exercise files,

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.575
PSD files, original files I'm going to include.

00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:17.710
So also, I will include all the links to

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.940
all these design resources like all these fonts I've used.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:27.410
So let's move on to the next variation in next lesson.
