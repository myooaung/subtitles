00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
Today, one of my students asked me about iOS solution and it was a really good question.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.250
I never thought about it that this is going to be coming from one of my students.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.400
Let me show you the question.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.450
He asked that why you are designing at one x,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.210
which is 32 pixels on a iOS with the four specs at 2x.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.130
I'm basically using 32 points here and he's asking that why

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.495
I'm using 32 points instead of 16 points on 1x.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:39.290
So to clear all this problem or concept,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.370
I think we designers should experiment first.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.430
We always learn with experimentation.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.420
What I'm going to do is I'm going to show

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.560
you in Photoshop that how we are

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.315
going to tackle this and how to understand all this mess.

00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:06.095
Let's get started. I'm going to open up a new Photoshop file.

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:07.865
File and New.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:12.590
What we are going to do this time is we are going to select artboard from

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.840
over here and we are going to select iPhone 6 or maybe iPhone 5,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.135
which are basically high resolution or 2x devices.

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:26.270
Now, what I'm going to do instead of using 72 points solution,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.125
which is our standard, I'm going to use 144.

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:34.910
Basically what I did is I shifted this 144 to 2x.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.165
Now my document is already retina.

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:40.785
It's 2x, so I'm going to press "Okay."

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:43.245
This is our artboard.

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:47.015
Now, for this problem to be solved,

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:51.110
I'm going to select my heading size to 32.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.330
You can see over here this is one of the scale of iOS devices.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.025
What is your game?

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:12.825
Let's have something like this one and I'm going to align it in the middle.

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:15.765
Let's just shift it to point size,

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:22.660
convert to point size to align it better because it's a single line.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.665
Now you can see it is 32 points at 2x screens.

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:30.740
If you go to image, image size,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.280
you can see, just ignore these inches.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.830
Our resolution is basically 144 pixels per inch.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.650
Now, what we are going to do is we're going to uncheck this resample and we are

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.225
going to revert back to basically our 1x solution which is 72 pixels per inch.

00:02:52.225 --> 00:02:58.430
This is just to clear your mind that how we are going using our point size.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:07.185
Basically, our developers should be using this 32 point iOS font size.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:10.340
But while we are designing just for simplicity,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.575
we normally use 72 resolution pixel documents in all our different screens.

00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:19.770
Just press "Okay."

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.080
If you now select your font,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.120
you can see it is shifted to 64 points. Why is that?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.530
Because we converted back from 2x to 1x resolution.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.330
Now we have less pixels per inch,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:48.180
so that is why our font size just expanded and because on the larger screens,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.730
this is going to be contracted.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.175
On a larger screen,

00:03:53.175 --> 00:03:57.110
this 64 will be 32 points.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.945
Why? Because we have more pixels to show per inch.

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:09.365
So more pixels are pressed against each other in less space in retina screens.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.210
This is going to be,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.685
you can say compressed to 32 points.

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:17.985
That is why on 72 pixels,

00:04:17.985 --> 00:04:21.640
the full size is enlarged.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.050
You can see over here that is how this has been enlarged.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.914
Sometimes when you design,

00:04:29.914 --> 00:04:33.230
like he asked that why I

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:41.615
used 32 points on this screen because if I try to use,

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:47.160
you can see 64 over here, let's use 64,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.620
this is my heading,

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.780
just head is enough.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.270
I think we cannot fix it over here.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.615
If we try to use something like this and then we shift our image size to 144.

00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:10.965
Let's change the pixels values to where the pixel is.

00:05:10.965 --> 00:05:15.085
I'm going to resample it.

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:17.915
Let's have the pixels.

00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:20.525
I think it was 750,

00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:24.690
around 750 or 760 something like this.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:32.005
Let's see the size of our iPhone 5 because I don't remember them.

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:34.555
640 by 1136.

00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:38.940
I'm going to change the width over here to 640.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:46.485
Let's have resample over here, 144 and pixels.

00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:50.295
It is already shifted to 640,

00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:54.590
so I just changed the resolution and you can see it is 640.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.420
If you want to change the height,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.535
you can change the height by using 1140 over here, like that.

00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:06.975
I think you should stick with it like this, 144.

00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:10.740
We are shifting up in our resolution so press "Okay."

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.230
Now you can see this is already shifted to 64.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.635
It doesn't shift in size.

00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:22.170
This is very strange.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:28.185
Always try to use font size that is,

00:06:28.185 --> 00:06:30.555
you can say realistic,

00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:35.520
and I think 64 is too big over here.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.920
Maybe we need 32 points.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.810
This is, I think,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.865
a good heading size.

00:06:41.865 --> 00:06:47.440
Let's try 32 with our 1x screen like this.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.530
This is my heading size.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.335
I'm going to use 32 points.

00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:00.725
Let's just leave it like this right now.

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:02.855
Don't worry about it.

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:06.875
In the image size, I'm going to shift up to 144.

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:09.930
Let's see what it is going to do.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.415
Again it is 32 points.

00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:19.855
Basically what it means is that at 1x,

00:07:19.855 --> 00:07:22.265
if you are using 32 points,

00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:24.920
it is going to be 32 points.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.010
If you shift your image size to 2x.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.280
In this example, as you can see,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.955
I shifted up to 144 resolution on which

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:43.230
the iOS specs are and our font size shifted was the same.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.825
This is the real problem,

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:50.655
the student which his name is Antonella,

00:07:50.655 --> 00:07:53.430
I don't know he is a he or she,

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.675
but Antonella asked me that,

00:07:57.675 --> 00:08:02.065
why I'm using 32 points on a 1x screen?

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:05.045
This is the answer. Let's repeat it again.

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:09.915
I'm going to use 320, 480, 72 pixels.

00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:13.110
This is the 1x iPhone 4 screen.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.930
Press "Okay", and I'm going to use 32 points over here for

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:24.950
my display size and hello Antonella.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.750
What was his name?

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.110
Antonella.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.720
Let's use

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.980
auto over here.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.625
Now you can see we are using these settings,

00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:50.954
320, 480, 72 pixel resolution,

00:08:50.954 --> 00:08:53.285
and I'm using 32 points.

00:08:53.285 --> 00:08:57.845
Now we are going to shift up to 144 resolution and press "Okay",

00:08:57.845 --> 00:09:01.355
it is basically Retina screen at 2x.

00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:05.310
Press okay and if you select this size,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.850
you can see it is still 32 points because we shifted our resolution.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:19.745
This is how we are going to tell our developers that we are using 32 points for size.

00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:22.055
In my previous example,

00:09:22.055 --> 00:09:24.650
I was not shifting sizes like this,

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.730
we were using only 72 pixel resolution.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.170
We were using like 32 over here.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:41.040
Let me show you this example. This is heading.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.990
If we try to create a new artboard over here,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:57.140
if we go to this artboard and try to create a new one over here with this size,

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.155
this is basically iPhone 6 size,

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:06.390
and I think it is a midsize.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:16.650
Let's just delete it, iPhone 5.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.760
Let's create this iPhone 5 over

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:29.955
here and press this plus and click this one over here.

00:10:29.955 --> 00:10:33.440
This is iPhone 5 and it is a readiness screen.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.370
If we try to drag it over here,

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.520
you can see it is basically 32 points.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:46.490
What we are going to do is we are going to multiply it with 2 and it is going to be 64.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.435
This is basically the actual size.

00:10:49.435 --> 00:10:53.870
If we move it back over here in this artboard,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.760
it should be 32 points.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:06.890
Here is the rule that if you are designing with the 72 pixels per inch,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:14.460
you need to multiply your font size in larger screens like retina and 3x screen,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.620
which is iPhone 6 plus.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:22.620
On 1x, you will be using this point size.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.195
Whatever you use on your 1x screen,

00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:31.085
while designing with this 72 pixel resolution,

00:11:31.085 --> 00:11:33.030
this will be your actual size,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.415
you are going to tell your developers that we are using 32 points,

00:11:37.415 --> 00:11:40.610
display size, heading size,

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:48.310
and for the ease of work we were designing at 72 pixels per inch,

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.255
so we don't need to shift pixels everywhere or resolution.

00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:56.360
They are all in the same resolution.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.705
This font size was actually on,

00:11:59.705 --> 00:12:07.730
this one was for 144 so we multiply it with two because we are designing at 72,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.580
which is half of this revolution.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.040
Our specs were at 144,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.200
but we are at the half,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:22.540
so we've multiplied it with two to get it equally to our specs.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:33.760
I think this have got your mind clear about this resolution and this screens mess.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.705
I think that's it.

00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:40.280
If someone else have some problem like this,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.295
I'm willing to create a new lecture or video for that.

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:50.400
Don't try to rate my course bad like two or three stars.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.930
First, ask questions.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:57.590
I have seen a lot of students who ask questions,

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:02.195
they have a lot of great improvements in their designs,

00:13:02.195 --> 00:13:06.200
and the students who do not ask questions and sometimes read bad,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:13.080
and then I messaged them that what was the reason and surprisingly,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.235
they say, "We had this problem."

00:13:17.235 --> 00:13:22.925
I say, "Why didn't you ask me first this problem before rating

00:13:22.925 --> 00:13:31.390
my course badly and giving me a heart attack?"

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:38.550
Before rating my course badly or getting frustrated,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.040
you should first ask me questions.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.590
I always try to answer as soon as possible,

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:51.650
and if needed, I will create a new video for you.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.790
So take care and let's move on to the next lesson.
