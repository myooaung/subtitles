00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
One of the biggest factor about readability is line-length,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.535
it really affects your readability.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:07.320
Now the question arises,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.340
how much length a line should have in a paragraph for optimal reading?

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.700
Now, some say it's 65,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.565
70 characters per line and 40 characters per line, something like that.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.955
I have seen a lot of articles and different books,

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:32.445
and the range is from 45 to almost 85 characters per line.

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.065
They are optimal.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:38.025
Now, why this optimal line-length?

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:41.675
The problem is if you have too long lines,

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:47.120
then the user or reader needs to move their head from left to right to read that line.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.190
Now if you have a very short line,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.105
then they have to jump from top to bottom,

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:54.995
line to line again and again.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:01:00.200
This is going to produce fatigue in your user,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.060
even their eyes or head or maybe some of their muscles.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.490
From my experience if we translate characters to words,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.630
then almost 10-17 words per line is optimal.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.440
They might be 19 or 20 depending on the length of the word,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.010
but it is almost the average.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.420
Now, one other factor is font size.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.740
If you have good a line-length and you switch the font to the smaller font,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.920
then you have a lot of words

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.585
in the same space and you need to change the line length again.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:36.610
Now, if you try to switch to small font,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.850
then the line length is very big and you need to read the long lines.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.280
This is one other factor so choose your font size wisely,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.695
so the line length is optimal.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.075
Now, what about mobile and websites?

00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:58.340
The mobiles have small screens,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.330
so I think generally the text should be a bit more bigger,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.790
body text should be bigger.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.750
Now, normally on mobiles the body text or the paragraphs are basically

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.140
120 percent of the size of the paragraphs on our desktop websites.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.460
If you're developing a website and showing different views of that website on mobile,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.945
on desktop and tablet,

00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:25.495
then you should take care of these.

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:30.950
Also on mobile phones the lines will be less longer because we have less space.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.325
Some of the line-length principle don't apply there.

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:38.775
Also, you need to shift the heading size and the line height too.

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:42.520
All these factors you need to cover for the mobiles.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.040
On desktop, if you are a developer,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.320
you need to use media queries to adjust

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.095
the size for the optimal line-length and readability.

00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:56.750
This is all about the optimal line-length and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.560
how we are going to use it on mobiles and desktop designing,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.665
if you are designing for mobile or desktop.

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:05.990
We will dig in deep into all this stuff on

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.360
mobile and desktop sizes in the last two sections of our course.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.540
Let's move on to the next lesson.
