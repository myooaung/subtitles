00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
In this series of lessons,

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:06.570
we are going to create this awesome looking fresh and juicy,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.495
healthy meal recipe header.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:12.480
I will do a lot of variations,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.330
so let me show you the variations.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.445
You can see this is the one I showed you.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:22.185
Then we have this with the Oval Button and different font over here.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.440
Then we have the third one which is

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.215
with another font like this shared by Venessa Malik or something like this.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:35.580
These are basically four different fonts combined

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.065
together and I still am not sure about the fourth one,

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:45.600
but I am very much- like this combination, these three combination.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.860
One is very fat and you can say squeezy type,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.100
rounded corner and playful and funny,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.670
fun-looking font, this one.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.475
This is looking good for this theme,

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.245
which is fresh and juicy.

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:06.310
So remember the exercise I told you about,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.140
I have a previous exercises where we had this themed font selection.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.860
This font selection is based on this theme.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.915
Then we have healthy meals,

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:25.850
so it is just to be more open and authoritative that these are really healthy meals.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.930
Then we have this script font used over here for Browse Recepie.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.110
Maybe it is for intimacy or maybe closeness to your customer or something like this.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.640
So it is basically looking really nice with these three combinations.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.150
I am going to show you in this lesson that,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.990
where the resources I got for this exercise?

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.760
All these are free fonts,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.410
I'm going to show you these three.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.630
Okay, one font is this Blenda Script.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.875
I have used this font,

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:01.130
this is a free font and you can see over here,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.350
license; Free for personal and commercial use.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.060
You can download this font and install it.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.165
Then we have this Damion font,

00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:12.170
so also download and install this one.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.730
I am going to share the links for these resources, so download them.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.290
This one is Gilroy,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.595
It is a premium font,

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:23.360
but they have two free fonts along with it.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.770
If you browse down,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.870
you can see this one is zero,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.230
Gilroy Light and there was one more,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.110
Gilroy Extra Bold, this is also zero.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.470
So download both these fonts or you can go to Font Squirrel and download these Gilroy.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.620
It also has these same two fonts.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.545
Then we have this image.

00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:50.770
I got it from picjumbo.com and this is the link,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.530
fresh oranges on small farmers market.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.970
I think one more font was this Dozen Free Font and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.040
I downloaded it from this freedesignresources.net.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.320
So you can see over here personal and commercial,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.750
it is free and designed by Kenny LKC.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.620
So download all these resources before starting this exercise.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.700
Let's get ahead and dig into designing this awesome looking exercise.
