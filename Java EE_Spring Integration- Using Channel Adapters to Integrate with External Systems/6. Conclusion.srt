00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,440
In this section, we're going to review what we learned.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,730
We reviewed how to integrate with two databases. MariaDB,

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,900
which uses JDBC. What you learned here should be applicable to

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,010
any relational database that supports JDBC,

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,680
such as Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL. And MongoDB,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,750
which is a documentâ€‘oriented NoSQL database.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,930
We saw commonalities between how databases implement Inbound and

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,650
OutboundChannelAdapters. For InboundChannelAdapters, we saw that we create a

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,530
message source with a poller that queries the database and publishes the

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,380
results of that query to a message channel. And for OutboundChannelAdapters, we

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,290
saw that we create a message handler with a service activater that receives a

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,560
message and writes it to a database.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,620
At this point,

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,220
you should understand how to integrate with databases using JDBC, you should

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,440
understand how to integrate with MongoDB, and more importantly,

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,020
you should understand the Spring integration model

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,040
for integrating with databases.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,000
In the next module, we're going to review how to integrate with RESTful Web Services.
