00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
Now that we have seen a prediction,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.800
let's see how to use selection.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.940
Now the concept is the same thing.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.890
You have to specify an object representing conditions.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.730
For example,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.190
if I want to get all the contract from City off Chicago so I can do the same thing like db

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.110
dot contact,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.280
start find the first argument would be the selection,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.550
and the second argument would be the prediction.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.890
Let's say,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.560
for example,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.610
I don't want to include the i.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.910
D.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.750
I can simply say I ve zero.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.470
However,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:39.320
we want to specify a condition here on that condition would be city in Chicago on Save it

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.050
on,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.340
Let's go and run the same thing Mongol exit afford RGs You can see that we got some records

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.070
now just to make sure that we see the data property that's also called the pretty function

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.070
.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.890
Save it Onda.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.520
We execute the same command and this time you can see we got some documents where the city

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.440
property equals toe Chicago giving a key value.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.450
Pairs like this is equal and off saying city equals to Chicago,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.510
so the same thing can also be represented using city on.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.550
Then we specify an operator,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.630
which is given in the form of another object,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.780
said Dollar e.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.320
Q.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.950
And then we give Chicago.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.500
So now we are saying that city equals toe Chicago so outward should remain the same thing

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.850
on we got the same thing.
