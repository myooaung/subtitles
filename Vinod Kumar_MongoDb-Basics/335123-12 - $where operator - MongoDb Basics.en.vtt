00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
There is also a simple mechanism toe work with conditions.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.030
This can be done with the help of a dollar.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.050
Were operator which takes a string representing a condition.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.040
However,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.950
these conditions would operate on the properties using the JavaScript notation.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.650
Let's take an example.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:30.280
Did our sales start find dollar were onda strength and here the properties must be access

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.540
to with the help off this Cavor,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.570
where this represents the current object,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.170
our current to document being processed.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.520
So what mongo DB does is mongo db going to take every document in the sales collection one

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.350
by one and checks this condition?

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.210
Is it true for the current to document?

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.320
And if that is true,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.360
for the current document that is prepared for the airport,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.670
if not its signal?

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.010
So if I do hear this start quarter equals two equals to one north,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.030
is that double quotes?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.440
Because it is javascript.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.870
And then I can say our I can say this start quart of equals two equals to treat.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.210
This has the exact same condition as in the dollar operator,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.420
where we said quarter equals toe one,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.880
our quarter records to tree.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.750
So let's give it a try and see how Maney documents match this condition.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.260
So I'm gonna go type here.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.820
Mongo e x 09 dot Js andi It's coming back with 138.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.420
So if I go and change this to say,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.150
for example,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.510
for now,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.280
I should see a different result.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.830
We can also say something like they start sales underscore amount greater than R equals to

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.180
fight.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:57.350
Chosen on they start sales underscore amount less than r equals to 6000.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.120
So this is a very simple mechanism.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.510
Toe executor quietly.
