00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.510
Mongo DB is one of the most popular no SQL database management systems today.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.570
No SQL sent for not only SQL.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.950
The name Mongo DB is direct from humongous TV.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.840
As against the traditional arguments,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.350
it stores the data in an unknown blessed way in a former Caldas Beason,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.550
which turned for binary Jason in 2007 s after Chemical Engine began developing Mongo DB.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.180
And in 2009 the company shifted to an open source development model,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.150
with the company offering some commercial support.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.980
Onda some other services among good DVD device contains data in the form off one or more

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.750
collections.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.800
Collections are equal into tables in an R D B.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.250
M s.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.400
What do you call it?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.850
Accord are growing and arguments here it's called as a document.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.400
Unlike reports of a table with share similar column structures,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.350
documents of among would be be collection may contain different structure.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.100
The document,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.800
simply put,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.550
is a bunch off one or more key value pairs.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.250
The keys can be called US properties or freeze as well.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.350
Here is an example of a valid Mongo DB document.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.170
As you can see,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.650
name and email are two fields.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.990
Andi corresponding to that.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.250
There are some string values.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.850
Here's another example off to documents being part of a single collection,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.140
nor that they both have some fields in common on DSA.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.160
Um different internally mongrel in the stores.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.160
These documents in Beeson format,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.230
which stands for bind marriages on As I mentioned earlier,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.550
a document is a group of field value piers.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.700
Fields are equal int off columns in a table value of field.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.550
Maybe string number Boolean arrays are even another object.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.130
Each document of a manga TV collection must have an underscore 80 field.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.050
And if you don't provide one mongo DB itself,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.650
Alassane on art originated value off the type called Objectivity.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.240
A collection in a manga TV database has a dynamic schema,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.820
such that the documents in the same collection may have different structures in arguments.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.530
Joints are expensive,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.280
and hence in Mongolia be they're not supported.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.410
Acquiring manga TV operates only on a single collection.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.140
Mongol David does not support transactions,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.870
either each entered update deal it individually,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.590
are transactional in nature.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.200
On this is because all related data are stored in a single document and there is no need to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.440
use multiple inserts.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.490
Update delete operations at all.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.940
Unlike our Deb Amos,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.350
data duplication is encouraged here so that all related data is in the same document,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.450
alighting unnecessary joins and step qualities.
