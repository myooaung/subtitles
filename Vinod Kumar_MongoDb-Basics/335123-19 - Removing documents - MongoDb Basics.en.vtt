00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
way.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.920
We may also have to delete a couple of documents.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.730
This can be done by calling the remove engine on a particular collection.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.550
For example,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.950
if I want to delete a document whose idea is 85 so db dot products start fine.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.930
I d.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.340
Is 85 so you can see that it has this data I can give a command db dot product start

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.310
removed on the creditor.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.490
Being idea is 85.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.290
This actually most the document once for all so you won't be able to do an undue operation

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.290
.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.160
So you should be careful when you're doing this.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.250
Deal it.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.090
We will say the same command again to retrieve the data.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.280
We don't have the data,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.750
so we don't see Suppose if we give devi dot products dot removed.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.150
We're brand happens to be fresh old.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.450
You can see that it d leads 55 documents,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.050
so that means all the documents that master condition got deleted.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.890
Sometimes if you want only one document to be deleted,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.530
which is very unlikely,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.080
you can also include just 21 as true against a DVD art broader start every move and then

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.150
the similar condition brand happens to be muller,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.210
and then I can see just one.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.900
It's true,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.000
this actually removes on your one.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.230
But as you can guess,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.500
we don't know which one has been deleted.
