00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
We can also import data from external fights that RCs we are.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.320
Yes,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.780
we are Jason Place.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.270
So Mongo DB comes up with a bunch of tools for these things.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.870
For example,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.980
if I go to the Mongol TV installation folder,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.040
there is a file called Mongo Import.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.350
Are dxy now the Mongol import,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.450
as the name suggest,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.150
Import a file into among body be collection off a particular date of it.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:38.070
So if I have to go to a client found and it's your command Mongol import pastors hope it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.750
would give me a bunch off options that I can use while importing.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.900
So it says Mongo import few options on and one file.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.910
The data can be represented.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.690
A CSP comma Separated values RTs three tab Separated values are Jason JavaScript Object

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.020
notation format.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.500
We can also import.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.550
If the data is just a collection off mongo DB documents.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.890
We'll have a look into each one off this.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:19.370
I have a friend call Contact State or chase on on that contains 1000 contact information

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.390
with similar fields.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.360
Now it is also possible in practice that the fields may really that we have already seen,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.790
but in this particular case,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.930
I have all of them off the same structure now.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.330
Another important is all I have to do is to come to the clan front Andi,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.150
then say Mongo import,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.190
and then I have to give a few options.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.050
The number one option is what kind off data that I have now I have a Jason Addy.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.000
The second important option that I might have to specify is the DB.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.200
In our case,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.450
it's called Test Devi,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.470
and in the best debated of is what is the name of the collection toe,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.750
which you want to import.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.400
If the collection named Very Hard Given is not available,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.610
it gets created.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.580
If it's already there,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.650
it's going toe on these documents into the existing collection.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.850
If you don't mention the collection,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.550
the name of the file itself will be considered as the collection.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.120
Now,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.850
since the name of the finalists context data on already have a collection called Contacts,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.960
it is good to get the name of the collection.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.650
So it's a doctor's collection,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.440
and then I say contacts.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.900
I know the last option,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.070
which is the name of the file.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:40.070
The part that I'm giving here is related part because I'm already in the sequel and users

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.670
we don't fold.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.570
It related that there is a folder called esta Andi.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.900
There is a context underscored it our Jason.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.280
So if everything is OK,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.490
you should inboard 1000 documents.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.410
And now we can go and have a look at that.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.130
You know her mongo shell eso I can just give a command db dot Contact starts,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.140
for example.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.120
I can say count and then they will give me 1004 because four documents we added earlier and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.350
now closing documents have been inserted,

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.090
uh,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.350
through the import command.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:24.050
I forgive here db dot contact Start find You will see that I see only 20 documents on.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.850
Then it says here,

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.980
type it for more Now it is a short term for literate,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.150
so I can not.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.350
I eat and I should see 20 more.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.300
Ultimately,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.750
you can assign the fine functions Return value to a variable,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.560
for example against our data equals toe david or contact.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.440
Start fine now.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.980
Data here is an iterated A If you simply press data,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.550
it is as if you wanted to see the 1st 20 documents you can also look through that are.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.100
You can also say you are Contacts equals toe data.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.770
Dart toe may toe convert that into another object.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.030
Now I can say contacts off zero and that's the first contract contracts off.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.190
1000 on.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.350
That would be the 1001st to document Andi like where they can go on access all data.
