00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
in order to install Mongo db on your Windows machine.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.020
First,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.950
don't load appropriate installer,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.160
so that's good.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.130
A mongo db dot com and in the home page on the top,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.350
right corner somewhere you'll see here that there is a download link.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.250
Let's kick that,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.280
and that gives us few options.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.730
Andi,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.910
I would like to go with the communities there were and in the community server.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.780
Since we're using with those mission here,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.180
we have a couple of options,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.200
and the one that is shown by default is the one that we want to install.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.400
Let's like the dongle butter.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.050
The don't load will take a few seconds.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.850
It's another.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.860
The doughnut is done,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.250
so let's open the folder.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.910
And here is the installer.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:01.050
So let's go and double click that and complete the Wizard by choosing the most appropriate

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:23.950
options by default.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.570
It has been installed in See Dr Program files Long would be Server 3.4,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.850
so they're the location and in the BIN directory will see some applications are executable

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.850
.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.820
The one executable that we're interested right now is the Mongo D,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.550
which is a sort of our process.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.350
There is also claimed application So one thing is,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.990
you can just double click this Mondo Di,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.660
but it fails to start that because it looks for a folder called data slash db.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.500
In your Cedric,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.810
I don't have this folder ends when we run this weekend supply and ultimate folder way Mongo

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.420
DB will use that as a temporary folder.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.940
So,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.170
you know,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.030
testes,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.350
Let's open a command front and then did the command mongo D with probably destined abortion

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.860
on it gives me another saying that mongo D is not recognized as an internal or external.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.090
Come here to make this munger de command available on on command fronts were to add this

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.080
folder location to our part environment variable.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.870
So I'm gonna copy that and then a right click this PC properties at once.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.950
System settings,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.190
environment,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.910
variables.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.570
Andi,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.250
I can are either here,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.540
but I can up into an existing part.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.370
You're so it's going out a new environment variable called Fought on base.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.150
That location that we copied once they said Okay.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.150
Okay on.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.750
Okay,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.420
it's with all the windows.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.360
And then I opened a new command prompt.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.970
Take the same command mongo de their stash watchin on.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.430
We get this Washington,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.500
which means you're successfully installed the Mongol Devi's after the next step is to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.050
create a data folder for Mongol Devi.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.080
So I'm gonna open,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.550
say,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.990
Dr Uncleared,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.850
a new folder.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.010
Now the name can be anything.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.350
Have you mongo db Dutch data.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.590
And then I can use this part when I run the server to run the server,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.900
issue this command from any command front now,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.450
which is mongo D best BB Pot sequel in mongo DB Ducks later.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.980
You can also optionally change the port numbers are the location off the server,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.850
etcetera.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.590
But I would like to live it to the default on a presenter.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.050
It starts the server,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.980
and you can see that there is a message that comes up waiting for connections on portal

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.250
7017 Now that happens to get the default report number.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.990
If you got this cream,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.110
that means you're mongo DB Insulation is successful and it has been started.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.440
No,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.050
let's minimize this and open a new command front.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.820
This time.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.630
I want to connect to the server using among go client,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.050
and then check if I can issue some commands.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.120
For example,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.830
I take mongo on impressed Ender,

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.940
and you will see that it connects toe A Server six is connecting to mongo db slash slash 1

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.890
27 001 which means the local host and then the porters to 7017 which is where our Mongo DB

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.350
is running.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.110
Through this command prompt,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.190
I can issue some mongo DB specific commands.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.050
For example,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.450
Show de BCE will give you the list of databases that have been created Andi visible.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.070
Now I can create a new DB by just typing.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.800
Use for example testily be now it's a switch to the TV test baby.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.340
However,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.090
if I against a show de BCE,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.510
it will not be listed because it doesn't contain anything so it gets lazily created,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.460
which means only when you add some data into your database,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.250
the database comes to existence,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.450
so we can also assure command called a DB to check what is the name of the baby.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.200
And it says that the current database is tested et on a recommend that can be used at this

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.540
time is show collections.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.180
Now,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.020
since this DVD is empty,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.950
there are no collections at all.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.910
However,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.060
we can add a new collection on reissue.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.950
All these comments to see a different result.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.950
So let's get a new collection by adding a new document to that.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.520
And it's very simple.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.000
Just how today db dot on imaginary collection name,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.620
for example.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.540
I can say contacts,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.550
dart,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.710
insert,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.670
and then I can pass on a J phone document.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.430
So with the name value picks,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.930
for example,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.880
I can say name.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.860
We know female.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.250
We know that we know Dark seal.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.450
No.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.340
If I complete this,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.130
you'll see that it is right.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.650
Result number of records inserted.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.650
Here's one.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.370
And if I know issue the commands,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.750
show DVDs,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.420
you'll see that there the new database called testily be.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.650
If I also say show collections,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.680
I can't see my collection,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.910
which is the contacts and no to see the data which is stored in the context.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.750
I have to assure command db dot contact.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.210
Start find one.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.400
You can observe that there is another field inserted called Underscore 80 which has to be

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.590
there for every document off any collection.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.020
Now the value for this can be user different also,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.280
but if you don't mention an object off a class called object,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.630
I d will be created.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.480
Onda.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.750
We will talk about this object early in the future lessons
