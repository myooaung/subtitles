00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.080
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:08.880
R programming and by now you've

3

00:00:08.880  -->  00:00:11.880
probably typed up the word ggplot about

4

00:00:11.880  -->  00:00:13.830
a thousand times. Now, I'm sure it's not

5

00:00:13.830  -->  00:00:16.379
as many as that but still we use ggplot

6

00:00:16.379  -->  00:00:18.420
so much that the section that I'm quite

7

00:00:18.420  -->  00:00:21.480
confident that you are now able to use

8

00:00:21.480  -->  00:00:24.840
it on a very intuitive level and also we

9

00:00:24.840  -->  00:00:26.340
learned so much about movies.

10

00:00:26.340  -->  00:00:28.230
Personally I learned so much that I feel

11

00:00:28.230  -->  00:00:31.380
like a movie ratings expert right now and

12

00:00:31.380  -->  00:00:33.420
today we're going to quickly recap on

13

00:00:33.420  -->  00:00:36.149
what we learned in this section of the

14

00:00:36.149  -->  00:00:38.610
course, so in this section we learned,

15

00:00:38.610  -->  00:00:40.829
number-one grammar of graphics and

16

00:00:40.829  -->  00:00:42.899
ggplot 2. So we have that interesting

17

00:00:42.899  -->  00:00:44.340
presentation which started off with

18

00:00:44.340  -->  00:00:47.670
Charles Minar's visualization of the

19

00:00:47.670  -->  00:00:50.940
French going into Russia and coming back

20

00:00:50.940  -->  00:00:53.969
and how he combines using layers. All

21

00:00:53.969  -->  00:00:56.730
sorts of different information on this

22

00:00:56.730  -->  00:01:00.239
one small two-dimensional chart and that

23

00:01:00.239  -->  00:01:02.460
kind of started off this movement of

24

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:04.949
plotting or inspired this movement of

25

00:01:04.949  -->  00:01:07.470
plotting visualizations using layers and we

26

00:01:07.470  -->  00:01:10.020
talked about the seven different layers

27

00:01:10.020  -->  00:01:13.290
that we're going to use in R plots  and

28

00:01:13.290  -->  00:01:15.659
can you recall those layers? Those layers

29

00:01:15.659  -->  00:01:18.479
were data aesthetics, geometries

30

00:01:18.479  -->  00:01:22.920
statistics, facets, coordinates and themes

31

00:01:22.920  -->  00:01:25.560
and so then we proceeded on to discuss

32

00:01:25.560  -->  00:01:27.210
those layers in more detail

33

00:01:27.210  -->  00:01:29.610
throughout this section. So the next

34

00:01:29.610  -->  00:01:31.590
thing that we learned in the section was

35

00:01:31.590  -->  00:01:35.189
factors in R and factors are basically

36

00:01:35.189  -->  00:01:37.380
categorical variable so we already

37

00:01:37.380  -->  00:01:39.119
touched on factors previously in the

38

00:01:39.119  -->  00:01:41.220
course but here we actually covered them

39

00:01:41.220  -->  00:01:43.079
off. So we totally understand what

40

00:01:43.079  -->  00:01:45.060
factors are now and they're very simple

41

00:01:45.060  -->  00:01:46.979
is basically a way that our stores

42

00:01:46.979  -->  00:01:48.990
categorical variables and we also

43

00:01:48.990  -->  00:01:51.899
learned how to convert non-factor

44

00:01:51.899  -->  00:01:54.060
variables or columns that should be

45

00:01:54.060  -->  00:01:57.000
factors into factor. So we had an example

46

00:01:57.000  -->  00:02:00.390
of the year column which was recognized

47

00:02:00.390  -->  00:02:02.610
as a numeric column but we wanted it to be a

48

00:02:02.610  -->  00:02:04.740
factor so we learned how to very quickly

49

00:02:04.740  -->  00:02:07.829
convert that to be what we want it to be.

50

00:02:07.829  -->  00:02:10.110
Then we talked about aesthetics and

51

00:02:10.110  -->  00:02:13.480
ggplot so we started

52

00:02:13.480  -->  00:02:15.970
using our data to create

53

00:02:15.970  -->  00:02:18.069
visualizations and we learned about

54

00:02:18.069  -->  00:02:20.650
different aesthetics so how to set the x

55

00:02:20.650  -->  00:02:22.750
and what data or what information is

56

00:02:22.750  -->  00:02:24.640
going to go into the x-axis, what's going to

57

00:02:24.640  -->  00:02:26.709
go in to the y axis, what's going into the

58

00:02:26.709  -->  00:02:29.409
color, what's going into the size. So all of

59

00:02:29.409  -->  00:02:31.330
those things are aesthetics as we

60

00:02:31.330  -->  00:02:35.049
discussed in this course and then we

61

00:02:35.049  -->  00:02:37.959
talk about plotting with a layer so in

62

00:02:37.959  -->  00:02:40.629
this tutorial we discussed that you can

63

00:02:40.629  -->  00:02:44.079
control which layer goes on top in your

64

00:02:44.079  -->  00:02:47.230
image based on how you specified in the

65

00:02:47.230  -->  00:02:49.900
code. So the layers that come to the left

66

00:02:49.900  -->  00:02:52.239
will come earlier in your code. They will

67

00:02:52.239  -->  00:02:55.510
go lower on your image. So the latest

68

00:02:55.510  -->  00:02:58.299
layers, the layers that are to the most

69

00:02:58.299  -->  00:03:01.090
right or to the end of your code to that

70

00:03:01.090  -->  00:03:03.129
chain that you're creating chain of

71

00:03:03.129  -->  00:03:05.019
layers is creating a code using the plus

72

00:03:05.019  -->  00:03:07.209
side. The layers on the very right will

73

00:03:07.209  -->  00:03:09.129
go to the top, layers on the left will

74

00:03:09.129  -->  00:03:11.530
go towards the bottom of your

75

00:03:11.530  -->  00:03:14.109
visualization, so it's a very handy tool

76

00:03:14.109  -->  00:03:16.209
remember that visualization that we had with

77

00:03:16.209  -->  00:03:18.340
lines and the same time scatterplot so

78

00:03:18.340  -->  00:03:20.079
did we want the lines on top or did you

79

00:03:20.079  -->  00:03:21.819
want to scatter plot on top very easy to

80

00:03:21.819  -->  00:03:24.910
control using your coat. Then we talked

81

00:03:24.910  -->  00:03:26.590
about overriding aesthetics, very

82

00:03:26.590  -->  00:03:28.599
powerful feature as well, so if you

83

00:03:28.599  -->  00:03:30.250
already have some aesthetic sets for

84

00:03:30.250  -->  00:03:32.200
instance you might have an aesthetic for

85

00:03:32.200  -->  00:03:35.650
size but then in and in a certain layer

86

00:03:35.650  -->  00:03:37.359
of your plots you want to change that

87

00:03:37.359  -->  00:03:39.819
you can easily override that aesthetic

88

00:03:39.819  -->  00:03:42.639
ggplot2 allows you to do that so it's

89

00:03:42.639  -->  00:03:45.220
always good to keep in your mind that

90

00:03:45.220  -->  00:03:47.530
you have controlled these things as well.

91

00:03:47.530  -->  00:03:50.349
Then we talk about mapping vs setting a

92

00:03:50.349  -->  00:03:53.109
very powerful tutorial or very powerful

93

00:03:53.109  -->  00:03:55.930
concept I should say on the difference

94

00:03:55.930  -->  00:03:58.389
between the two so do you want to map

95

00:03:58.389  -->  00:03:59.680
an aesthetic so for instance we have

96

00:03:59.680  -->  00:04:02.169
colors, do you want to map color to a

97

00:04:02.169  -->  00:04:05.109
variable? Like what what did we use like

98

00:04:05.109  -->  00:04:06.609
Sean here for instance right? Do you want

99

00:04:06.609  -->  00:04:08.680
to map the color that's called mapping

100

00:04:08.680  -->  00:04:11.500
when you're attaching a certain variables or

101

00:04:11.500  -->  00:04:13.569
certain column in your data set to

102

00:04:13.569  -->  00:04:14.739
an aesthetic.

103

00:04:14.739  -->  00:04:16.479
The other option is you can set the

104

00:04:16.479  -->  00:04:18.039
aesthetic, you can actually say I just

105

00:04:18.039  -->  00:04:20.739
want the color to always be blue and that

106

00:04:20.739  -->  00:04:22.300
way you're not mapping it you're just

107

00:04:22.300  -->  00:04:25.210
setting it and the ways to do this in

108

00:04:25.210  -->  00:04:26.650
ggplot are bit different.

109

00:04:26.650  -->  00:04:29.199
So for mapping because it's a like the

110

00:04:29.199  -->  00:04:30.610
way to remember it because it's a bit of a

111

00:04:30.610  -->  00:04:32.500
more complex operation for mapping you

112

00:04:32.500  -->  00:04:35.530
need to use that aes function so to map

113

00:04:35.530  -->  00:04:37.660
an aesthetic you need the aes function. To

114

00:04:37.660  -->  00:04:39.850
set an aesthetic, you don't need the aes

115

00:04:39.850  -->  00:04:42.100
function and people who are starting off

116

00:04:42.100  -->  00:04:44.020
with R sometimes forget about it and

117

00:04:44.020  -->  00:04:46.780
they use the aes function for setting

118

00:04:46.780  -->  00:04:49.570
and that can cause serious issues in

119

00:04:49.570  -->  00:04:51.520
your visualization so just remember the

120

00:04:51.520  -->  00:04:52.870
difference between the two and always

121

00:04:52.870  -->  00:04:54.880
ask yourself am I mapping this aesthetic

122

00:04:54.880  -->  00:04:56.620
or am I setting it and based on your

123

00:04:56.620  -->  00:04:58.630
answer, you will know how to proceed with

124

00:04:58.630  -->  00:05:00.669
your code. Then we talk about histograms

125

00:05:00.669  -->  00:05:02.979
and a density charts had some very

126

00:05:02.979  -->  00:05:05.949
lovely examples some good visualization

127

00:05:05.949  -->  00:05:08.350
of histograms and Density Charts. So

128

00:05:08.350  -->  00:05:10.840
remember that histograms have a

129

00:05:10.840  -->  00:05:13.449
parameter called feel which is the

130

00:05:13.449  -->  00:05:16.090
inside color and they also have just

131

00:05:16.090  -->  00:05:18.940
color which is the colour of the border

132

00:05:18.940  -->  00:05:21.490
of histogram and also to create a

133

00:05:21.490  -->  00:05:23.349
histogram you only need one variable

134

00:05:23.349  -->  00:05:25.060
because the beans are created

135

00:05:25.060  -->  00:05:28.539
automatically for you by ggplot it's

136

00:05:28.539  -->  00:05:31.030
actually that smart, so in that way

137

00:05:31.030  -->  00:05:33.039
histograms is kind of combining both

138

00:05:33.039  -->  00:05:37.389
geometry and statistics because in the

139

00:05:37.389  -->  00:05:38.979
background some statistics are being

140

00:05:38.979  -->  00:05:41.500
around for you and that's how they been

141

00:05:41.500  -->  00:05:42.760
combined and also we talked about

142

00:05:42.760  -->  00:05:44.560
density charts you might not end up

143

00:05:44.560  -->  00:05:46.570
using them quite a lot but it's also good

144

00:05:46.570  -->  00:05:49.150
to know that you do have the opportunity

145

00:05:49.150  -->  00:05:51.370
to use density charts if you need them

146

00:05:51.370  -->  00:05:53.530
and how to create them using ggplot.

147

00:05:53.530  -->  00:05:56.380
Alright then we talked about starting

148

00:05:56.380  -->  00:05:58.000
later tips so I just give you some tips on

149

00:05:58.000  -->  00:06:01.210
where do you specify certain things in

150

00:06:01.210  -->  00:06:04.630
your visualization? So do you should

151

00:06:04.630  -->  00:06:07.360
specify your data in the very starting a

152

00:06:07.360  -->  00:06:09.580
foundational layers just specify it later?

153

00:06:09.580  -->  00:06:11.949
Should just specify your aesthetics at

154

00:06:11.949  -->  00:06:14.260
the start or further on and ultimately

155

00:06:14.260  -->  00:06:16.030
it all depends on what you want from

156

00:06:16.030  -->  00:06:17.409
your visualization. What are you going to

157

00:06:17.409  -->  00:06:18.370
be changing if you're going to be

158

00:06:18.370  -->  00:06:21.010
changing your color aesthetic a lot

159

00:06:21.010  -->  00:06:22.690
throughout your different layers then

160

00:06:22.690  -->  00:06:24.430
maybe it's not a good idea to specify at

161

00:06:24.430  -->  00:06:26.409
the start or for instance if your data

162

00:06:26.409  -->  00:06:28.419
set is set in stone and you're going to

163

00:06:28.419  -->  00:06:29.770
be changing throughout your different

164

00:06:29.770  -->  00:06:31.840
layers then it's good idea to specify it at

165

00:06:31.840  -->  00:06:33.880
the start of your visualization. So just

166

00:06:33.880  -->  00:06:36.219
you know think strategically about how

167

00:06:36.219  -->  00:06:38.500
you're going to create this plot and what is

168

00:06:38.500  -->  00:06:39.790
going to be constant

169

00:06:39.790  -->  00:06:41.320
and what's going to be variable and from

170

00:06:41.320  -->  00:06:43.570
that you can decide where to specify

171

00:06:43.570  -->  00:06:46.030
those things in which layers of plots

172

00:06:46.030  -->  00:06:48.670
to specify those things. Then we talked

173

00:06:48.670  -->  00:06:50.740
about statistical transformations so we

174

00:06:50.740  -->  00:06:52.300
have a look at a couple we talked about

175

00:06:52.300  -->  00:06:54.790
the smoother or geom smooth. We talk

176

00:06:54.790  -->  00:06:56.980
about the jitter the box plot and

177

00:06:56.980  -->  00:06:58.900
those are just a few examples but already

178

00:06:58.900  -->  00:07:00.760
we were able to create some very

179

00:07:00.760  -->  00:07:03.100
powerful visualizations with those box

180

00:07:03.100  -->  00:07:04.600
plots and oh just with those

181

00:07:04.600  -->  00:07:06.280
statistical transformations I really

182

00:07:06.280  -->  00:07:08.830
like that. Box plot visualization because

183

00:07:08.830  -->  00:07:11.620
you could identify which genres of

184

00:07:11.620  -->  00:07:14.260
movies are more likely to be successful

185

00:07:14.260  -->  00:07:17.410
all things being equal and I think we

186

00:07:17.410  -->  00:07:19.690
had finally found that horror

187

00:07:19.690  -->  00:07:21.280
no not horror movies are the least

188

00:07:21.280  -->  00:07:24.220
successful ones and the most successful

189

00:07:24.220  -->  00:07:26.590
ones thrillers, thrillers have the highest

190

00:07:26.590  -->  00:07:29.230
chance of being successful if you create

191

00:07:29.230  -->  00:07:32.230
kind of like a statistically average

192

00:07:32.230  -->  00:07:34.510
type of movie then it will probably have

193

00:07:34.510  -->  00:07:36.400
a higher rating with your audience and

194

00:07:36.400  -->  00:07:38.320
also had a mini challenge for you there

195

00:07:38.320  -->  00:07:41.560
to create the box plots for the critical

196

00:07:41.560  -->  00:07:44.260
ratings. That one also was looked a

197

00:07:44.260  -->  00:07:45.430
little bit different you probably

198

00:07:45.430  -->  00:07:48.550
noticed that it was much more stretched

199

00:07:48.550  -->  00:07:52.300
out. So less some more variance in the

200

00:07:52.300  -->  00:07:54.970
box plots for the critic rate. Then we

201

00:07:54.970  -->  00:07:56.740
talked about using facets, this was quite

202

00:07:56.740  -->  00:07:58.270
a long section we're already up to point

203

00:07:58.270  -->  00:08:00.610
10. So we talked about using facets,

204

00:08:00.610  -->  00:08:02.860
facets allow you to create lots of

205

00:08:02.860  -->  00:08:04.870
different plots within 1 plot. So basically

206

00:08:04.870  -->  00:08:07.000
recycle your plot for different

207

00:08:07.000  -->  00:08:09.490
categories whether it's years or whether

208

00:08:09.490  -->  00:08:10.420
it's

209

00:08:10.420  -->  00:08:14.050
genres or something else and that allows

210

00:08:14.050  -->  00:08:16.330
you to drill into the separate

211

00:08:16.330  -->  00:08:18.220
categories or the into these categories

212

00:08:18.220  -->  00:08:19.990
separately. So sometimes you might want

213

00:08:19.990  -->  00:08:21.940
to use facets sometimes you might decide

214

00:08:21.940  -->  00:08:24.910
not to but in some cases they are quite

215

00:08:24.910  -->  00:08:26.920
handy and we saw a few quite a few

216

00:08:26.920  -->  00:08:30.460
examples of when facets should probably

217

00:08:30.460  -->  00:08:33.010
be used even in our challenge and then

218

00:08:33.010  -->  00:08:34.780
we talked about coordinates. So

219

00:08:34.780  -->  00:08:37.990
coordinates are how is it's the up at

220

00:08:37.990  -->  00:08:41.020
the top so I think it's a six-layer of

221

00:08:41.020  -->  00:08:43.270
the visualization that's how you can

222

00:08:43.270  -->  00:08:45.130
zoom in to chart, you can specify

223

00:08:45.130  -->  00:08:47.770
whether you want a XY coordinates, you want

224

00:08:47.770  -->  00:08:49.450
polar coordinates or maybe you want to

225

00:08:49.450  -->  00:08:51.280
map all these different types of things

226

00:08:51.280  -->  00:08:53.290
but we were using coordinates

227

00:08:53.290  -->  00:08:55.930
predominantly for zooming into parts of our

228

00:08:55.930  -->  00:08:59.019
chart and finally or we talk about

229

00:08:59.019  -->  00:09:01.600
themes. So themes are your non data ink

230

00:09:01.600  -->  00:09:03.790
they're just ways to make your

231

00:09:03.790  -->  00:09:07.209
visualization look pretty and more

232

00:09:07.209  -->  00:09:09.339
appealing to the eye. So I hope you

233

00:09:09.339  -->  00:09:11.199
enjoyed this section, we definitely

234

00:09:11.199  -->  00:09:13.779
covered of a lot about ggplot but as

235

00:09:13.779  -->  00:09:15.759
you can see it's all quite simple stuff

236

00:09:15.759  -->  00:09:17.500
and that's why I really like ggplot 2,

237

00:09:17.500  -->  00:09:19.870
this package because it's all very

238

00:09:19.870  -->  00:09:22.930
logical and very straightforward stuff.

239

00:09:22.930  -->  00:09:24.579
So there we go,

240

00:09:24.579  -->  00:09:26.380
don't forget to do the quiz for this

241

00:09:26.380  -->  00:09:30.399
section to assess your progress and also

242

00:09:30.399  -->  00:09:32.829
I have another exciting challenge for

243

00:09:32.829  -->  00:09:35.620
you, it's going to be even more movies even

244

00:09:35.620  -->  00:09:38.350
more information, more columns about

245

00:09:38.350  -->  00:09:39.160
movies.

246

00:09:39.160  -->  00:09:40.990
I'm sure you're going to enjoy that as

247

00:09:40.990  -->  00:09:42.639
well and I look forward to seeing you

248

00:09:42.639  -->  00:09:43.420
next time

249

00:09:43.420  -->  00:09:55.580
until then, happy coding.
