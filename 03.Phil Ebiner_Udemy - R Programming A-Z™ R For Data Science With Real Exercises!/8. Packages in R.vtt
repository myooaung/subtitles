00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.500
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:07.500  -->  00:00:09.750
R programming and today we're talking

3

00:00:09.750  -->  00:00:12.900
about packages. So what are these

4

00:00:12.900  -->  00:00:16.230
mysterious packages that everybody keeps

5

00:00:16.230  -->  00:00:18.390
going on about? What's inside them? That's

6

00:00:18.390  -->  00:00:19.560
the most important question.

7

00:00:19.560  -->  00:00:21.660
Well I think by now you can guess it.

8

00:00:21.660  -->  00:00:24.269
What's inside the packages is of course

9

00:00:24.269  -->  00:00:27.689
blenders and in fact some packages come

10

00:00:27.689  -->  00:00:29.670
with prepackaged fruit

11

00:00:29.670  -->  00:00:31.590
however odd that might seem maybe these

12

00:00:31.590  -->  00:00:33.390
packages are going international or

13

00:00:33.390  -->  00:00:35.430
something that, but let's just stick with

14

00:00:35.430  -->  00:00:36.059
it.

15

00:00:36.059  -->  00:00:38.100
These packages can come with blenders

16

00:00:38.100  -->  00:00:41.430
and with fruit and these packages have

17

00:00:41.430  -->  00:00:42.899
their own designations for instance

18

00:00:42.899  -->  00:00:45.719
these blenders might be designed to work

19

00:00:45.719  -->  00:00:47.910
with ice. These blenders might be

20

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:50.610
specifically designed to process very

21

00:00:50.610  -->  00:00:53.969
rough fruits or even vegetables and

22

00:00:53.969  -->  00:00:56.160
maybe these of blenders are designed for

23

00:00:56.160  -->  00:00:57.780
something else. In terms of R

24

00:00:57.780  -->  00:01:00.000
programming that basically means that

25

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:02.789
there are packages that have functions

26

00:01:02.789  -->  00:01:05.369
and maybe some data that are relevant to

27

00:01:05.369  -->  00:01:06.750
certain tasks for instance you might

28

00:01:06.750  -->  00:01:09.060
have functions that are good for

29

00:01:09.060  -->  00:01:12.299
plotting charts and creating graphs then

30

00:01:12.299  -->  00:01:14.280
you might have a package with functions

31

00:01:14.280  -->  00:01:17.369
that is a good for processing very large

32

00:01:17.369  -->  00:01:19.560
data sets then you might have a package

33

00:01:19.560  -->  00:01:22.830
that is full of functions that are good

34

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:25.770
for processing data frames and working

35

00:01:25.770  -->  00:01:27.689
with them and it might come with some

36

00:01:27.689  -->  00:01:30.210
prepackaged sample data to allow you to

37

00:01:30.210  -->  00:01:32.850
experiment with these functions that you

38

00:01:32.850  -->  00:01:34.799
are installing. So there you go, that's

39

00:01:34.799  -->  00:01:37.950
all there is to these packages. Basically

40

00:01:37.950  -->  00:01:40.049
they allow you to expand the

41

00:01:40.049  -->  00:01:43.200
functionality available to you in your

42

00:01:43.200  -->  00:01:45.869
R programming and so now we're going

43

00:01:45.869  -->  00:01:48.000
to jump into R studio and we'll have a

44

00:01:48.000  -->  00:01:50.310
look at one of those packages but before

45

00:01:50.310  -->  00:01:53.100
we do I wanted to bring up a quote, quote

46

00:01:53.100  -->  00:01:56.159
from statmethods.net and this is

47

00:01:56.159  -->  00:02:00.210
to get one thing out of the way once and

48

00:02:00.210  -->  00:02:02.280
for all so packages are a collection of

49

00:02:02.280  -->  00:02:04.979
R functions data and compiled code in

50

00:02:04.979  -->  00:02:07.170
a well-defined format the directory

51

00:02:07.170  -->  00:02:08.729
where packages the store is called the

52

00:02:08.729  -->  00:02:10.410
library so a lot of people get this

53

00:02:10.410  -->  00:02:13.280
confused packages and libraries

54

00:02:13.280  -->  00:02:15.230
and you'll see why in a second but

55

00:02:15.230  -->  00:02:16.910
basically what we're talking about is

56

00:02:16.910  -->  00:02:19.850
packages library is simply that folder

57

00:02:19.850  -->  00:02:22.610
where packages are going to be stored so

58

00:02:22.610  -->  00:02:24.950
just remember that packages is what we

59

00:02:24.950  -->  00:02:25.700
are after.

60

00:02:25.700  -->  00:02:27.950
Alright so now let's jump into R

61

00:02:27.950  -->  00:02:30.560
studio and what we're going to do is

62

00:02:30.560  -->  00:02:32.569
we're going to open up this tab over

63

00:02:32.569  -->  00:02:35.420
here which is called packages and what

64

00:02:35.420  -->  00:02:38.360
you'll see here is the list of packages

65

00:02:38.360  -->  00:02:41.870
that are currently available to so the

66

00:02:41.870  -->  00:02:44.690
packages that have being downloaded and

67

00:02:44.690  -->  00:02:46.670
that are sitting on your computer and

68

00:02:46.670  -->  00:02:48.320
the blue ones are the ones that are

69

00:02:48.320  -->  00:02:50.660
checked are the ones that are currently

70

00:02:50.660  -->  00:02:53.690
running in this r session, so the ones

71

00:02:53.690  -->  00:02:56.300
that are you can think of it as their

72

00:02:56.300  -->  00:02:58.190
they've been activated so packages that

73

00:02:58.190  -->  00:03:01.340
you can actually use right now so you

74

00:03:01.340  -->  00:03:04.160
can use the functions from them and what

75

00:03:04.160  -->  00:03:06.920
we can do is we can activate additional

76

00:03:06.920  -->  00:03:08.780
packages if we want to and then

77

00:03:08.780  -->  00:03:11.510
deactivate so for instance ggplot2 is

78

00:03:11.510  -->  00:03:13.489
activated now might not be on your

79

00:03:13.489  -->  00:03:15.860
computer or right away so if you want to

80

00:03:15.860  -->  00:03:18.230
deactivate it just uncheck it here or

81

00:03:18.230  -->  00:03:21.350
activate it just check it again and in

82

00:03:21.350  -->  00:03:23.570
fact as you recall we have already used

83

00:03:23.570  -->  00:03:27.140
ggplot2 in the very start of the course

84

00:03:27.140  -->  00:03:30.260
in the intersection we activated this

85

00:03:30.260  -->  00:03:33.140
package and we install it. However back

86

00:03:33.140  -->  00:03:36.170
then we did it very quickly and we

87

00:03:36.170  -->  00:03:37.310
didn't really understand what we're

88

00:03:37.310  -->  00:03:39.380
doing let's talk about it in a bit more

89

00:03:39.380  -->  00:03:42.200
debt to get into the nitty-gritty first

90

00:03:42.200  -->  00:03:43.489
thing we're going to do is we're going

91

00:03:43.489  -->  00:03:46.010
to delete this package all file computer

92

00:03:46.010  -->  00:03:47.359
so I just uncheck we're actually going

93

00:03:47.359  -->  00:03:49.280
to do it let's do that just go to the

94

00:03:49.280  -->  00:03:51.380
right over here and just click click

95

00:03:51.380  -->  00:03:53.269
this cross button it'll ask you, Are you

96

00:03:53.269  -->  00:03:55.130
sure you want to delete this packages and you

97

00:03:55.130  -->  00:03:57.650
say yes and there we go so now the

98

00:03:57.650  -->  00:04:00.739
package has been completely removed from

99

00:04:00.739  -->  00:04:02.810
your computer it's a nowhere to be seen

100

00:04:02.810  -->  00:04:05.600
and what we're going to do now is we're

101

00:04:05.600  -->  00:04:08.269
going to reinstall that package. So one

102

00:04:08.269  -->  00:04:09.530
way to do it is you could click this

103

00:04:09.530  -->  00:04:11.750
install button and you could search for

104

00:04:11.750  -->  00:04:14.930
the package or we're going to do it

105

00:04:14.930  -->  00:04:16.370
through the console just like we did

106

00:04:16.370  -->  00:04:19.130
before but before we do let's explore

107

00:04:19.130  -->  00:04:21.620
what this cran abbreviation stands for

108

00:04:21.620  -->  00:04:23.840
what is cran? Where are these packages

109

00:04:23.840  -->  00:04:26.030
coming from? So it's a saying install from

110

00:04:26.030  -->  00:04:27.950
cran and what does it mean? So in order to

111

00:04:27.950  -->  00:04:29.810
do that we're going to need a browser.

112

00:04:29.810  -->  00:04:32.930
Alright let's open one up and now if in

113

00:04:32.930  -->  00:04:34.700
your browser you go to the following

114

00:04:34.700  -->  00:04:37.639
webpage crand.r-hyphenproject.org,

115

00:04:37.639  -->  00:04:40.100
you'll be presented with

116

00:04:40.100  -->  00:04:43.310
this page and this page is called or

117

00:04:43.310  -->  00:04:45.620
this portal is called the comprehensive

118

00:04:45.620  -->  00:04:48.290
R archived network or basically cran

119

00:04:48.290  -->  00:04:50.750
and that's where the abbreviation comes

120

00:04:50.750  -->  00:04:54.230
from and here basically users of R

121

00:04:54.230  -->  00:04:56.750
because our is a open source program

122

00:04:56.750  -->  00:04:59.330
language anybody can contribute to it,

123

00:04:59.330  -->  00:05:02.030
anybody can look at it and change things

124

00:05:02.030  -->  00:05:04.070
that they want about it so basically

125

00:05:04.070  -->  00:05:07.790
users contribute their packages to this

126

00:05:07.790  -->  00:05:10.430
comprehensive R archived network and

127

00:05:10.430  -->  00:05:12.410
then you are able to download this

128

00:05:12.410  -->  00:05:14.690
packages from there so you could create

129

00:05:14.690  -->  00:05:16.669
a package and you could upload that and

130

00:05:16.669  -->  00:05:18.440
that's where the package of coming from

131

00:05:18.440  -->  00:05:20.419
its only one of the locations are other

132

00:05:20.419  -->  00:05:24.470
locations where r packages are assembled

133

00:05:24.470  -->  00:05:27.080
and they're stored there but cran is by

134

00:05:27.080  -->  00:05:30.530
far the biggest one so now let's go

135

00:05:30.530  -->  00:05:35.060
ahead and install ggplot2 so ggplot2 is

136

00:05:35.060  -->  00:05:37.370
a package for working with graphics what

137

00:05:37.370  -->  00:05:38.660
we're going to do is we're going to type

138

00:05:38.660  -->  00:05:43.130
and install.package, packages and

139

00:05:43.130  -->  00:05:45.380
here you have to put in quotation marks

140

00:05:45.380  -->  00:05:48.350
for this one you type in the name of the

141

00:05:48.350  -->  00:05:51.470
package so its ggplot2 and if you execute

142

00:05:51.470  -->  00:05:54.470
this line what you'll see is that the

143

00:05:54.470  -->  00:05:57.590
installation has just started and now

144

00:05:57.590  -->  00:06:00.650
ggplot2 has appeared here again

145

00:06:00.650  -->  00:06:03.830
so if I expand this a little bit you'll

146

00:06:03.830  -->  00:06:07.039
see exactly what's going on the package

147

00:06:07.039  -->  00:06:09.919
was downloaded from the internet and

148

00:06:09.919  -->  00:06:11.900
then it was installed onto your computer.

149

00:06:11.900  -->  00:06:14.750
Now in order to activate the package

150

00:06:14.750  -->  00:06:15.950
we're going to have to call another

151

00:06:15.950  -->  00:06:17.990
command but before we do that what I

152

00:06:17.990  -->  00:06:20.240
want to show you is that right now there

153

00:06:20.240  -->  00:06:21.800
are some functions that we don't have

154

00:06:21.800  -->  00:06:24.020
access to for instance we don't have

155

00:06:24.020  -->  00:06:26.660
access to qplot, that's a function

156

00:06:26.660  -->  00:06:29.330
from the ggplot package. So if I put a question mark

157

00:06:29.330  -->  00:06:31.910
before qplot you'll see that there's

158

00:06:31.910  -->  00:06:33.890
an error and it's telling us that we

159

00:06:33.890  -->  00:06:36.020
don't have this function nothing was

160

00:06:36.020  -->  00:06:36.860
found

161

00:06:36.860  -->  00:06:39.180
now if I put a question mark and I go ggplot,

162

00:06:39.180  -->  00:06:41.460
and I asked for that

163

00:06:41.460  -->  00:06:43.470
function again it's not there so we

164

00:06:43.470  -->  00:06:45.210
don't actually have it right now even

165

00:06:45.210  -->  00:06:46.680
though the packages installed on the

166

00:06:46.680  -->  00:06:48.660
computer because it's not activated we

167

00:06:48.660  -->  00:06:49.500
don't have it.

168

00:06:49.500  -->  00:06:51.690
Another good one example is the Diamonds

169

00:06:51.690  -->  00:06:54.419
data set so this package does come with

170

00:06:54.419  -->  00:06:57.570
some prepackaged data and it's called

171

00:06:57.570  -->  00:06:59.009
the diamond status it so if i put a

172

00:06:59.009  -->  00:07:01.740
question mark here once again it didn't

173

00:07:01.740  -->  00:07:04.229
find this data set because we haven't

174

00:07:04.229  -->  00:07:06.090
activated the packages, so now let's go

175

00:07:06.090  -->  00:07:08.400
ahead and activate this package to

176

00:07:08.400  -->  00:07:10.110
activate the package you need to type in

177

00:07:10.110  -->  00:07:12.449
the library and then the name of the

178

00:07:12.449  -->  00:07:14.280
package here you don't have to use a

179

00:07:14.280  -->  00:07:15.750
quotation marks but you can if you want

180

00:07:15.750  -->  00:07:19.169
to and then it just activated and now

181

00:07:19.169  -->  00:07:21.360
the package is active you can see that

182

00:07:21.360  -->  00:07:24.449
this check box has been checked by the

183

00:07:24.449  -->  00:07:26.039
way this is where all of the confusion

184

00:07:26.039  -->  00:07:28.199
or most of it comes from that you have

185

00:07:28.199  -->  00:07:30.030
to use a function called library to

186

00:07:30.030  -->  00:07:31.740
activate a package that's why people

187

00:07:31.740  -->  00:07:34.050
think that a package is actually a

188

00:07:34.050  -->  00:07:35.070
library.

189

00:07:35.070  -->  00:07:36.900
Well we've already sorted that out that

190

00:07:36.900  -->  00:07:39.210
package the package and libraries just a

191

00:07:39.210  -->  00:07:41.550
function ever used to activate it. Now

192

00:07:41.550  -->  00:07:43.320
what we're going to do is we're going to

193

00:07:43.320  -->  00:07:45.030
check this function again right so let's

194

00:07:45.030  -->  00:07:47.669
see if we have Q plot there you go now

195

00:07:47.669  -->  00:07:50.010
we've got a quick plot, do we have ggplot.

196

00:07:50.010  -->  00:07:52.830
We've got ggplot and we have diamonds we have

197

00:07:52.830  -->  00:07:55.169
the diamond status set so there we go

198

00:07:55.169  -->  00:07:57.330
that's as simple as it is you are

199

00:07:57.330  -->  00:08:00.780
welcome to explore packages uh to see

200

00:08:00.780  -->  00:08:03.180
what other packages exist and what

201

00:08:03.180  -->  00:08:05.159
packages are available on crime and

202

00:08:05.159  -->  00:08:07.080
before we go today I wanted to give you

203

00:08:07.080  -->  00:08:09.870
a quick teaser of what's coming for the

204

00:08:09.870  -->  00:08:12.060
course let's quickly to step out some

205

00:08:12.060  -->  00:08:14.940
code and I'll show you what this package

206

00:08:14.940  -->  00:08:16.560
can actually allow you to do we've

207

00:08:16.560  -->  00:08:18.810
already seen that in the intersection of

208

00:08:18.810  -->  00:08:20.490
the course and let's have a look again

209

00:08:20.490  -->  00:08:22.650
at something different this time that's

210

00:08:22.650  -->  00:08:27.060
a key plot data equals diamonds and then

211

00:08:27.060  -->  00:08:30.690
we'll take care at that's our X variable

212

00:08:30.690  -->  00:08:33.000
then price they'll be that Y variable

213

00:08:33.000  -->  00:08:36.870
and will say color equals clarity and

214

00:08:36.870  -->  00:08:41.070
we'll say facets will take proportion

215

00:08:41.070  -->  00:08:44.339
color no clarity there we go so if we're

216

00:08:44.339  -->  00:08:48.990
on this code now what we get we get a

217

00:08:48.990  -->  00:08:52.690
beautiful beautiful chart over here

218

00:08:52.690  -->  00:08:54.430
so those are the wonderful things you

219

00:08:54.430  -->  00:08:57.580
can create in a clique of couple of,

220

00:08:57.580  -->  00:08:59.800
in a couple of keyboard strokes if you

221

00:08:59.800  -->  00:09:02.350
have the right package so packages are

222

00:09:02.350  -->  00:09:04.150
very powerful and throughout your work

223

00:09:04.150  -->  00:09:06.340
in R you will get to know more and

224

00:09:06.340  -->  00:09:09.220
more and more packages as you develop

225

00:09:09.220  -->  00:09:11.350
that expertise and I look forward to

226

00:09:11.350  -->  00:09:12.700
seeing you next time and until then

227

00:09:12.700  -->  00:09:17.659
happy coding.
