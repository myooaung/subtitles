00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.950
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:07.950  -->  00:00:10.019
R programming. Let's go ahead and solve

3

00:00:10.019  -->  00:00:11.070
this challenge.

4

00:00:11.070  -->  00:00:12.540
These are things that we are after so

5

00:00:12.540  -->  00:00:14.549
let's go ahead and calculate them. So

6

00:00:14.549  -->  00:00:16.020
profit, what is profit going to be?

7

00:00:16.020  -->  00:00:18.750
Profit is create a vector, profit is

8

00:00:18.750  -->  00:00:24.210
revenue minus expense, run that expenses,

9

00:00:24.210  -->  00:00:27.150
run that and let's just check it.

10

00:00:27.150  -->  00:00:29.429
Now, there we go so we've got our profit

11

00:00:29.429  -->  00:00:32.279
vector and this is our first vector

12

00:00:32.279  -->  00:00:33.809
operation in this challenge.

13

00:00:33.809  -->  00:00:35.730
Awesome, alright profit after tax

14

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:37.380
for each months. So first we're going to

15

00:00:37.380  -->  00:00:40.800
calculate tax. Tax is going to be profit

16

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:46.320
multiplied by 0.3 right? Run that and let's have a

17

00:00:46.320  -->  00:00:48.539
look at tax what we see here is that

18

00:00:48.539  -->  00:00:52.199
there is more than two decimal points and

19

00:00:52.199  -->  00:00:54.270
the challenges specifically said that we

20

00:00:54.270  -->  00:00:56.309
should perform calculations at the

21

00:00:56.309  -->  00:00:58.590
precision of one cent. So we need to

22

00:00:58.590  -->  00:01:00.570
round this, so we're going to round

23

00:01:00.570  -->  00:01:03.449
profit and but how do we use round?

24

00:01:03.449  -->  00:01:05.519
Yeah how do we use this function? If I run

25

00:01:05.519  -->  00:01:08.340
this now, it did work but what do I get? I

26

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:10.650
get the get no decimal points at all

27

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:11.880
which is not correct.

28

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:14.100
So how do I find out what to do with round?

29

00:01:14.100  -->  00:01:15.600
Well let's find out more about this

30

00:01:15.600  -->  00:01:18.450
function right. Round, question mark and here we have

31

00:01:18.450  -->  00:01:20.850
rounding numbers, so let's zoom in zoom

32

00:01:20.850  -->  00:01:22.950
into this area over here and have a

33

00:01:22.950  -->  00:01:25.830
look. If I scroll down I will see that

34

00:01:25.830  -->  00:01:28.710
there's my round function and it's got X

35

00:01:28.710  -->  00:01:30.810
is the vector that I'm passing it and

36

00:01:30.810  -->  00:01:33.420
then digits is an additional variable by

37

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:36.210
default it's 0. So digits is an integer

38

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:37.920
indicating the number of decimal places

39

00:01:37.920  -->  00:01:41.430
round or significant. We don't need

40

00:01:41.430  -->  00:01:42.990
this thread that's for different function

41

00:01:42.990  -->  00:01:46.110
of number of decimal places to be used.

42

00:01:46.110  -->  00:01:48.869
Negative values are allowed see details.

43

00:01:48.869  -->  00:01:50.820
Ok so that basically means how many

44

00:01:50.820  -->  00:01:53.250
decimal places we want to use and we

45

00:01:53.250  -->  00:01:55.710
want to use two. So let's put in two. There

46

00:01:55.710  -->  00:01:57.210
are two ways we can just say two or we

47

00:01:57.210  -->  00:01:59.130
can say digits equals to both are

48

00:01:59.130  -->  00:02:02.520
identical because digit is the second

49

00:02:02.520  -->  00:02:04.860
variable. Anyway second argument of the

50

00:02:04.860  -->  00:02:06.180
function anyway so let's go ahead and

51

00:02:06.180  -->  00:02:08.369
run that and check out, so there we go

52

00:02:08.369  -->  00:02:11.610
we've got our precision as requested

53

00:02:11.610  -->  00:02:14.700
good. Now let's calculate profit after

54

00:02:14.700  -->  00:02:16.470
tax by the way in

55

00:02:16.470  -->  00:02:18.810
R you can simply put dots inside the

56

00:02:18.810  -->  00:02:20.460
names of the variables it's totally fine

57

00:02:20.460  -->  00:02:22.770
unlike other programming languages and

58

00:02:22.770  -->  00:02:24.750
that makes it easier to separate words

59

00:02:24.750  -->  00:02:26.640
you don't have to use capital letters. So

60

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:29.640
we're going to say profit- tax by the

61

00:02:29.640  -->  00:02:31.560
way if you look here this is our tax

62

00:02:31.560  -->  00:02:34.260
values. You'll see that some of the

63

00:02:34.260  -->  00:02:36.120
months have negative tax and that's

64

00:02:36.120  -->  00:02:38.070
totally fine that's what was a noted in

65

00:02:38.070  -->  00:02:39.870
the challenge you can have negative tax.

66

00:02:39.870  -->  00:02:42.780
So profit after tax is profit- tax as

67

00:02:42.780  -->  00:02:45.990
check out if I type in profit, it

68

00:02:45.990  -->  00:02:48.420
comes up for me already, so there we go

69

00:02:48.420  -->  00:02:50.220
that's our profit after tax.

70

00:02:50.220  -->  00:02:51.750
Alright we've done that. What's next?

71

00:02:51.750  -->  00:02:53.580
Profit margin for each month equals to

72

00:02:53.580  -->  00:02:57.120
profit after tax divided by revenue so let's go

73

00:02:57.120  -->  00:03:00.720
ahead and calculate that. Profit margin

74

00:03:00.720  -->  00:03:06.600
is profit after tax divided by revenue basically

75

00:03:06.600  -->  00:03:08.880
it means how much of your revenue that

76

00:03:08.880  -->  00:03:11.280
you're making in this business is

77

00:03:11.280  -->  00:03:14.310
actually going becoming the final

78

00:03:14.310  -->  00:03:16.530
profit, so some of the revenue is going

79

00:03:16.530  -->  00:03:19.680
into expenses, some of the revenues going

80

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:21.870
into tax and so on so how much does the

81

00:03:21.870  -->  00:03:23.850
business actually get to keep out of all

82

00:03:23.850  -->  00:03:25.560
the sales that it makes? So revenue is the

83

00:03:25.560  -->  00:03:28.019
same as sales divided by revenue and we get

84

00:03:28.019  -->  00:03:30.840
profit margin. Let's have a look at it.

85

00:03:30.840  -->  00:03:34.260
Ok so that's not exactly what we wanted, we

86

00:03:34.260  -->  00:03:37.560
wanted a percentage right with no

87

00:03:37.560  -->  00:03:39.180
decimal point, so let's go ahead and do that.

88

00:03:39.180  -->  00:03:42.780
It will say round by two so that will

89

00:03:42.780  -->  00:03:44.820
already get us closer and now we have to

90

00:03:44.820  -->  00:03:46.140
multiply by a hundred to get a

91

00:03:46.140  -->  00:03:48.090
percentage and there we go, so that our

92

00:03:48.090  -->  00:03:49.769
percentage. No percentage sign and

93

00:03:49.769  -->  00:03:51.480
that's ok as the challenge said does

94

00:03:51.480  -->  00:03:53.880
that we don't really need a percentage sign. So as you

95

00:03:53.880  -->  00:03:55.380
can see twelve percent profit margin

96

00:03:55.380  -->  00:03:57.360
meaning that of every dollar that the

97

00:03:57.360  -->  00:03:59.220
business sold so if like if it's a big

98

00:03:59.220  -->  00:04:03.209
shop then if it's sold goods for one

99

00:04:03.209  -->  00:04:06.000
dollar then it gets to keep twelve cents

100

00:04:06.000  -->  00:04:07.980
after the expenses are paid and

101

00:04:07.980  -->  00:04:10.799
after of tax expenses in that first

102

00:04:10.799  -->  00:04:13.140
month in January they ate up

103

00:04:13.140  -->  00:04:16.019
eighty-eight percent of 88 cents for

104

00:04:16.019  -->  00:04:18.120
every dollar business made, then in the

105

00:04:18.120  -->  00:04:20.640
February they ate up 82 cents so it's good to

106

00:04:20.640  -->  00:04:21.959
understand these things like what are we

107

00:04:21.959  -->  00:04:22.710
actually

108

00:04:22.710  -->  00:04:25.380
calculating here. Profit margin in March

109

00:04:25.380  -->  00:04:27.389
was negative meaning that for every

110

00:04:27.389  -->  00:04:30.060
dollar of sales that the business made

111

00:04:30.060  -->  00:04:33.000
the business have to pay one dollar

112

00:04:33.000  -->  00:04:36.479
thirty cents in expenses right and if

113

00:04:36.479  -->  00:04:38.610
you look at the tax for that month which

114

00:04:38.610  -->  00:04:40.560
was somewhere up here it was actually

115

00:04:40.560  -->  00:04:42.720
negative, that's okay then that's normal

116

00:04:42.720  -->  00:04:44.669
because if your profits negative then

117

00:04:44.669  -->  00:04:49.530
well in Australia anyway and so this is

118

00:04:49.530  -->  00:04:51.479
like we might not be in all

119

00:04:51.479  -->  00:04:53.520
jurisdictions but in Australia if your

120

00:04:53.520  -->  00:04:55.080
profits negative then you get a deferred

121

00:04:55.080  -->  00:04:56.970
tax asset. Meaning that next time when

122

00:04:56.970  -->  00:04:58.050
you pay tax

123

00:04:58.050  -->  00:05:00.690
you will get to pay less tax so that's a

124

00:05:00.690  -->  00:05:01.470
good thing.

125

00:05:01.470  -->  00:05:04.169
Anyway, so but basically the expenses

126

00:05:04.169  -->  00:05:05.729
were very high in these months and

127

00:05:05.729  -->  00:05:07.320
that's why the profit margin was

128

00:05:07.320  -->  00:05:09.570
negative and basically means that you

129

00:05:09.570  -->  00:05:11.460
know if the business wasn't operating of

130

00:05:11.460  -->  00:05:12.780
course I guess we're getting into too

131

00:05:12.780  -->  00:05:14.970
much finance here if the business wasn't

132

00:05:14.970  -->  00:05:17.789
operating then it would have an going cost

133

00:05:17.789  -->  00:05:19.500
like rent and so on so maybe it would

134

00:05:19.500  -->  00:05:21.930
have made even higher loss but for some

135

00:05:21.930  -->  00:05:23.909
businesses that don't have ongoing costs.

136

00:05:23.909  -->  00:05:25.349
This means that they should probably

137

00:05:25.349  -->  00:05:26.639
just thought worked in those months.

138

00:05:26.639  -->  00:05:27.840
Anyway

139

00:05:27.840  -->  00:05:29.490
it made the business made up for it in

140

00:05:29.490  -->  00:05:31.919
the coming months following that. Alright

141

00:05:31.919  -->  00:05:33.090
so good months,

142

00:05:33.090  -->  00:05:35.250
let's look for the good months. How do we

143

00:05:35.250  -->  00:05:37.110
find good months? Where the profit after

144

00:05:37.110  -->  00:05:39.330
tax was greater than the mean for the

145

00:05:39.330  -->  00:05:39.930
year,

146

00:05:39.930  -->  00:05:41.759
alright then the mean profit after tax

147

00:05:41.759  -->  00:05:43.199
for the year so first thing we're going

148

00:05:43.199  -->  00:05:45.870
to need to find the mean profit after

149

00:05:45.870  -->  00:05:47.699
tax. We're going to say mean, I'm not

150

00:05:47.699  -->  00:05:49.110
going to type profit after tax. I'm

151

00:05:49.110  -->  00:05:51.599
just gonna say pat, mean pat is going

152

00:05:51.599  -->  00:05:55.650
to be mean of the vector profit after

153

00:05:55.650  -->  00:05:58.710
tax. So we're taking a vector which

154

00:05:58.710  -->  00:06:00.300
is profit after tax and we're taking the

155

00:06:00.300  -->  00:06:02.280
average of all these numbers using this

156

00:06:02.280  -->  00:06:04.919
function of mean and if we run that line,

157

00:06:04.919  -->  00:06:07.889
then we look up mean pat we'll see that

158

00:06:07.889  -->  00:06:11.580
that is our value. So we get one value in

159

00:06:11.580  -->  00:06:12.570
return.

160

00:06:12.570  -->  00:06:14.849
Ok so that's our mean pat, now we need to

161

00:06:14.849  -->  00:06:17.009
check the good months. Good months is

162

00:06:17.009  -->  00:06:19.830
going to be a vector as was stated in

163

00:06:19.830  -->  00:06:22.919
the challenge good month is months where

164

00:06:22.919  -->  00:06:26.849
profit after tax is greater than the

165

00:06:26.849  -->  00:06:29.099
mean for the year which is mean pat.

166

00:06:29.099  -->  00:06:32.370
Check that and have a look at good months.

167

00:06:32.370  -->  00:06:35.840
So now we have a vector of true

168

00:06:35.840  -->  00:06:37.699
false, true false so we first one for the

169

00:06:37.699  -->  00:06:42.110
good then we had four negative months so if we go

170

00:06:42.110  -->  00:06:44.030
to profit after tax. You'll see even

171

00:06:44.030  -->  00:06:47.000
though this month is positive that means

172

00:06:47.000  -->  00:06:49.370
for the year is this.

173

00:06:49.370  -->  00:06:52.790
So it's 1700 dollars in the second month

174

00:06:52.790  -->  00:06:55.040
in February was only 1300 dollars so

175

00:06:55.040  -->  00:06:57.290
therefore makes sense that this was not

176

00:06:57.290  -->  00:06:58.520
a good month even though it was positive

177

00:06:58.520  -->  00:07:00.710
it was a bad month it was below average

178

00:07:00.710  -->  00:07:03.380
and our accounting friends said that

179

00:07:03.380  -->  00:07:05.000
that's how they're going to determine

180

00:07:05.000  -->  00:07:07.400
good and bad month. So we've got four bad

181

00:07:07.400  -->  00:07:09.350
month here then a streak of four good

182

00:07:09.350  -->  00:07:11.540
months then we got two more bad months

183

00:07:11.540  -->  00:07:13.430
looks like these guys are doing well

184

00:07:13.430  -->  00:07:16.610
in summer, so january, february, march

185

00:07:16.610  -->  00:07:20.540
april, may and june, july, august see these

186

00:07:20.540  -->  00:07:22.100
things these kind of inside so you can

187

00:07:22.100  -->  00:07:24.229
derive a radio while you've been doing

188

00:07:24.229  -->  00:07:26.750
such basic challenge. So these guys this

189

00:07:26.750  -->  00:07:29.060
company seems to be doing better and

190

00:07:29.060  -->  00:07:31.490
summer so maybe you can tell that you're

191

00:07:31.490  -->  00:07:33.530
counting friends hey by the way I did

192

00:07:33.530  -->  00:07:35.449
what you asked me plus I noticed that

193

00:07:35.449  -->  00:07:37.460
they have a streak of good month

194

00:07:37.460  -->  00:07:40.940
summer and what's this December, January.

195

00:07:40.940  -->  00:07:43.460
Wow ok what does that tell us? So summer is

196

00:07:43.460  -->  00:07:45.350
summer holidays at school right and

197

00:07:45.350  -->  00:07:48.289
August August to over the January

198

00:07:48.289  -->  00:07:51.110
February, March, April, May, June, July, August,

199

00:07:51.110  -->  00:07:53.240
September people go back to school here

200

00:07:53.240  -->  00:07:55.460
and then December-January right. What

201

00:07:55.460  -->  00:07:57.950
does that mean? Well again holidays, so

202

00:07:57.950  -->  00:08:01.610
maybe this business is holiday oriented

203

00:08:01.610  -->  00:08:03.740
and they are doing better in holiday

204

00:08:03.740  -->  00:08:05.599
maybe like if you were analyzing the

205

00:08:05.599  -->  00:08:06.710
business and trying to give some advice

206

00:08:06.710  -->  00:08:09.470
maybe you'd say hey you should work in

207

00:08:09.470  -->  00:08:11.419
in the Holiday period, you're better off

208

00:08:11.419  -->  00:08:13.849
working in the holiday spirit.

209

00:08:13.849  -->  00:08:16.820
Ok so that's just how I think when I

210

00:08:16.820  -->  00:08:20.060
performed things like this when I work

211

00:08:20.060  -->  00:08:21.139
with data because working with data

212

00:08:21.139  -->  00:08:22.490
is interesting right? Tells you things

213

00:08:22.490  -->  00:08:24.169
that you otherwise wouldn't wouldn't see.

214

00:08:24.169  -->  00:08:26.990
Alright so good months, profit after

215

00:08:26.990  -->  00:08:28.340
tax, we've done the good months. How do we get

216

00:08:28.340  -->  00:08:30.139
the bad months now? So bad months is the

217

00:08:30.139  -->  00:08:31.610
opposite of good months so let's just say

218

00:08:31.610  -->  00:08:33.950
good months and let's practice something

219

00:08:33.950  -->  00:08:35.870
we learned in the first section. Let's

220

00:08:35.870  -->  00:08:40.219
practice exclamation mark, exclamation mark is the opposite right? Gives

221

00:08:40.219  -->  00:08:42.440
you the opposite of a logical expression.

222

00:08:42.440  -->  00:08:44.450
We know that this is already a logical

223

00:08:44.450  -->  00:08:46.190
vector, if we take the opposite of the

224

00:08:46.190  -->  00:08:48.500
logical vector we'll get an opposite

225

00:08:48.500  -->  00:08:49.550
logical vector.

226

00:08:49.550  -->  00:08:52.040
So let's type that in that month and

227

00:08:52.040  -->  00:08:53.089
let's have a look at it,

228

00:08:53.089  -->  00:08:55.070
so if you compare the two, see true and

229

00:08:55.070  -->  00:08:56.750
then became false, false became true

230

00:08:56.750  -->  00:08:58.070
false became true for the weekend

231

00:08:58.070  -->  00:09:00.709
true,false became true true became false

232

00:09:00.709  -->  00:09:03.529
true became false, so now you see the bad

233

00:09:03.529  -->  00:09:06.110
months. Bad months are here and bad months are

234

00:09:06.110  -->  00:09:09.769
here. Okay makes sense now let's move on

235

00:09:09.769  -->  00:09:11.600
to the next one oh that was the exclamation

236

00:09:11.600  -->  00:09:13.640
so let's copy that

237

00:09:13.640  -->  00:09:16.610
put it in here bad months. Ok going to

238

00:09:16.610  -->  00:09:19.490
make some space now the best month as

239

00:09:19.490  -->  00:09:21.290
you remember in the challenge we want to

240

00:09:21.290  -->  00:09:24.019
be still want a vector so we want just a

241

00:09:24.019  -->  00:09:25.760
vector of false false false false false

242

00:09:25.760  -->  00:09:29.209
and true just for the best month.

243

00:09:29.209  -->  00:09:30.769
How do we find the best month? Well first

244

00:09:30.769  -->  00:09:33.890
we're going to need to compare to the

245

00:09:33.890  -->  00:09:37.370
maximum right revenue. So we could do

246

00:09:37.370  -->  00:09:40.190
the same thing we could create max p80

247

00:09:40.190  -->  00:09:43.670
and put it in a variable put the max value

248

00:09:43.670  -->  00:09:45.560
in a variable then compare to it or we can

249

00:09:45.560  -->  00:09:47.750
just do it on the fly so let's practice

250

00:09:47.750  -->  00:09:50.690
that, we're going to say best months

251

00:09:50.690  -->  00:09:53.029
profit after tax and we're going to

252

00:09:53.029  -->  00:09:56.149
compare so it has to equal exactly

253

00:09:56.149  -->  00:09:57.770
remember it has to be a double equal

254

00:09:57.770  -->  00:10:02.660
sign equal to max profit after tax. So

255

00:10:02.660  -->  00:10:04.700
what we're doing here is similar to what

256

00:10:04.700  -->  00:10:05.600
we're doing here

257

00:10:05.600  -->  00:10:08.029
right? So we're comparing the R

258

00:10:08.029  -->  00:10:09.589
studio going to or R is going to

259

00:10:09.589  -->  00:10:11.690
compare each and every one of these

260

00:10:11.690  -->  00:10:14.750
values to this value that's how it will

261

00:10:14.750  -->  00:10:17.990
work right? Remember the whole notion of

262

00:10:17.990  -->  00:10:20.600
recycling vector so here we have a

263

00:10:20.600  -->  00:10:23.360
vector of 12 values and here we have a

264

00:10:23.360  -->  00:10:25.970
vector up just one value so and then

265

00:10:25.970  -->  00:10:28.220
what R will do is we'll take

266

00:10:28.220  -->  00:10:30.740
this one vector to compare and put like

267

00:10:30.740  -->  00:10:33.890
recycle it 12 times and so then this whole

268

00:10:33.890  -->  00:10:37.670
vector will have an identical length in

269

00:10:37.670  -->  00:10:39.709
length of vector to be compared to. It's

270

00:10:39.709  -->  00:10:42.260
just this is thinking of not we just

271

00:10:42.260  -->  00:10:43.940
think about accounting just now we think

272

00:10:43.940  -->  00:10:45.800
about programming how how programming

273

00:10:45.800  -->  00:10:47.420
works in the background well that's how

274

00:10:47.420  -->  00:10:49.699
it works so basically you're not just

275

00:10:49.699  -->  00:10:51.949
comparing line by line right. You're not

276

00:10:51.949  -->  00:10:54.079
comparing this value to this value this

277

00:10:54.079  -->  00:10:56.420
value is this value. Remember working

278

00:10:56.420  -->  00:10:58.730
vectorize operation so what is actually

279

00:10:58.730  -->  00:11:01.579
going to happen is at this vector this

280

00:11:01.579  -->  00:11:02.780
resulting vector of

281

00:11:02.780  -->  00:11:05.570
length one which is over here. It needs to be

282

00:11:05.570  -->  00:11:08.480
compared to a vector of length 12, then

283

00:11:08.480  -->  00:11:10.250
what's gonna happen is this vector will

284

00:11:10.250  -->  00:11:13.580
be recycled until it has length 12 and

285

00:11:13.580  -->  00:11:15.560
then two vectors of length 12 will be

286

00:11:15.560  -->  00:11:18.380
compared and then basically so you'll

287

00:11:18.380  -->  00:11:21.680
have a vector this vector being so this

288

00:11:21.680  -->  00:11:23.360
vector of 12 values been compared to

289

00:11:23.360  -->  00:11:25.430
these 12 values, so basically this

290

00:11:25.430  -->  00:11:27.680
vector on the right is going to be

291

00:11:27.680  -->  00:11:29.600
created, is going to look like this

292

00:11:29.600  -->  00:11:32.810
repeat I was just explaining here

293

00:11:32.810  -->  00:11:34.670
what's going on. It's good to know because

294

00:11:34.670  -->  00:11:37.520
that it helps you think in terms of

295

00:11:37.520  -->  00:11:40.070
problems so basically the profit after

296

00:11:40.070  -->  00:11:42.920
tax vector which is over here will be

297

00:11:42.920  -->  00:11:45.920
compared to this vector and as a result

298

00:11:45.920  -->  00:11:47.930
that we run the operation and we

299

00:11:47.930  -->  00:11:50.150
haven't run this operation as a result

300

00:11:50.150  -->  00:11:52.760
you'll get the best month vector which

301

00:11:52.760  -->  00:11:56.330
is false, false, false, false, false, true, December was the best

302

00:11:56.330  -->  00:11:58.250
month right? So this will be compared to

303

00:11:58.250  -->  00:12:00.440
this. It will be false. This compared this one

304

00:12:00.440  -->  00:12:02.720
here will be compared to this one false

305

00:12:02.720  -->  00:12:06.050
is it equal? Not equal, this is equal

306

00:12:06.050  -->  00:12:09.290
this equal not equal and so on until

307

00:12:09.290  -->  00:12:12.920
let's just do its power through it not

308

00:12:12.920  -->  00:12:16.910
equal and then still not equal, still not

309

00:12:16.910  -->  00:12:18.950
equal this one to this one and then it

310

00:12:18.950  -->  00:12:20.990
gets to this on it says AHA equal good

311

00:12:20.990  -->  00:12:22.970
and that's how it gets this false...

312

00:12:22.970  -->  00:12:25.100
true once again it's good to know these

313

00:12:25.100  -->  00:12:27.860
things is good to think on the level

314

00:12:27.860  -->  00:12:29.900
that your programming languages thinking

315

00:12:29.900  -->  00:12:32.660
because you will get along better that

316

00:12:32.660  -->  00:12:33.410
way.

317

00:12:33.410  -->  00:12:35.540
Alright so and finally the worst month,

318

00:12:35.540  -->  00:12:38.150
you can just simply do the exclamation mark operator

319

00:12:38.150  -->  00:12:40.400
here because there's one worst month not

320

00:12:40.400  -->  00:12:41.030
11

321

00:12:41.030  -->  00:12:44.090
so we're going to say to this same thing

322

00:12:44.090  -->  00:12:47.300
but instead of max and min and then say

323

00:12:47.300  -->  00:12:50.780
worst worst month we go so let's check

324

00:12:50.780  -->  00:12:53.660
that out there you false worst month was

325

00:12:53.660  -->  00:12:56.810
February, March last month was March

326

00:12:56.810  -->  00:12:59.000
alright good we've done everything we

327

00:12:59.000  -->  00:13:01.430
needed to. Now let's print them all out

328

00:13:01.430  -->  00:13:02.810
oh no actually we still need one more

329

00:13:02.810  -->  00:13:06.410
thing, that's right because if we print

330

00:13:06.410  -->  00:13:09.050
them out so if we look at profit will

331

00:13:09.050  -->  00:13:11.330
not profit margin if you look at profit

332

00:13:11.330  -->  00:13:13.820
after tax for instance it's got,

333

00:13:13.820  -->  00:13:15.860
it's interesting dollars but we we're

334

00:13:15.860  -->  00:13:18.740
asked what we're asked, let's go to the next

335

00:13:18.740  -->  00:13:21.740
slide. Results for dollar values need to

336

00:13:21.740  -->  00:13:24.860
be calculated with one percent precision, we did

337

00:13:24.860  -->  00:13:27.110
that but need to be presented so the

338

00:13:27.110  -->  00:13:29.120
final result needs to be presented in

339

00:13:29.120  -->  00:13:31.370
the units of thousands with no decimal

340

00:13:31.370  -->  00:13:34.220
points so let's do that now right. So all

341

00:13:34.220  -->  00:13:35.900
of our dollar values which we're going

342

00:13:35.900  -->  00:13:38.240
to include in the final result which are

343

00:13:38.240  -->  00:13:40.730
just consistency to include revenue,

344

00:13:40.730  -->  00:13:42.950
expenses, profit and profit after tax right?

345

00:13:42.950  -->  00:13:47.060
So let's go ahead and fix them up units

346

00:13:47.060  -->  00:13:49.250
of thousands.

347

00:13:49.250  -->  00:13:53.360
Alright so revenue dot let's say dot

348

00:13:53.360  -->  00:13:56.810
1000 just so we remember what it is, it's a

349

00:13:56.810  -->  00:14:00.230
revenue and this is us practicing the

350

00:14:00.230  -->  00:14:03.680
round operation so if we run that and

351

00:14:03.680  -->  00:14:05.690
then we just look at revenue a thousand

352

00:14:05.690  -->  00:14:09.050
whoops. You'll see that it's not rounded

353

00:14:09.050  -->  00:14:11.180
properly right. We want units of

354

00:14:11.180  -->  00:14:13.190
thousands but with no decimal point so

355

00:14:13.190  -->  00:14:16.880
we want round and then not to because

356

00:14:16.880  -->  00:14:18.890
if we do two will have two decimal

357

00:14:18.890  -->  00:14:22.430
points we want just zero right or

358

00:14:22.430  -->  00:14:24.680
because zero is a default value we can

359

00:14:24.680  -->  00:14:27.140
just not even specify remember for

360

00:14:27.140  -->  00:14:29.570
round here we saw that if we zoom in

361

00:14:29.570  -->  00:14:31.910
here will see that the default value of

362

00:14:31.910  -->  00:14:33.770
digits is actually 0 so you don't have

363

00:14:33.770  -->  00:14:35.120
to specify if you want to get rid of the

364

00:14:35.120  -->  00:14:36.950
just one point just do round.

365

00:14:36.950  -->  00:14:40.130
Alright so that's revenue a thousand now

366

00:14:40.130  -->  00:14:43.130
there's the same thing for X and says

367

00:14:43.130  -->  00:14:46.640
dot thousand is round,

368

00:14:46.640  -->  00:14:52.370
whoops expenses divided by thousand and then what

369

00:14:52.370  -->  00:14:55.430
we're going to do profit dot thousand

370

00:14:55.430  -->  00:14:58.250
actually I'm going to just copy this.

371

00:14:58.250  -->  00:15:01.790
Ok so this was going to be profit and

372

00:15:01.790  -->  00:15:04.190
profit over here. They should some music

373

00:15:04.190  -->  00:15:06.530
playing in the background while I do this but

374

00:15:06.530  -->  00:15:09.200
that's a reality of life right.

375

00:15:09.200  -->  00:15:11.720
Profit sometimes in programming you

376

00:15:11.720  -->  00:15:13.610
got to spend some time to create

377

00:15:13.610  -->  00:15:17.180
something that is worth while.

378

00:15:17.180  -->  00:15:19.760
Ok so we've done all of these so we

379

00:15:19.760  -->  00:15:23.360
haven't run this in this and Oh viola,

380

00:15:23.360  -->  00:15:24.980
we're done let's present the final

381

00:15:24.980  -->  00:15:26.690
result output

382

00:15:26.690  -->  00:15:29.150
because we're not going to export. We

383

00:15:29.150  -->  00:15:30.830
haven't learned to export stuff and

384

00:15:30.830  -->  00:15:31.970
things like that what we're going to do

385

00:15:31.970  -->  00:15:34.250
is we're going to run this and as if

386

00:15:34.250  -->  00:15:36.470
we're presenting to the client on our

387

00:15:36.470  -->  00:15:38.270
computer so we're going to say there's a

388

00:15:38.270  -->  00:15:40.490
revenue that you gave us as expenses

389

00:15:40.490  -->  00:15:44.120
but presented in units of thousands and

390

00:15:44.120  -->  00:15:45.740
there's our profit, there's a profit

391

00:15:45.740  -->  00:15:48.050
after tax and you can see it's kind of

392

00:15:48.050  -->  00:15:50.240
like smaller but the negative 1 is

393

00:15:50.240  -->  00:15:52.100
greater because text can be negative

394

00:15:52.100  -->  00:15:55.610
there's a profit margin and there's a

395

00:15:55.610  -->  00:15:58.760
good months, bad months, best month, worst

396

00:15:58.760  -->  00:15:59.120
months.

397

00:15:59.120  -->  00:16:01.970
Ok so that's that that's the challenge

398

00:16:01.970  -->  00:16:04.190
is done now I wanted to show you a bonus

399

00:16:04.190  -->  00:16:07.190
a little bonus for the for sticking

400

00:16:07.190  -->  00:16:11.090
around this long  guess for persevering

401

00:16:11.090  -->  00:16:13.280
to the end of this challenge so what I

402

00:16:13.280  -->  00:16:15.020
want to show you is something that we're

403

00:16:15.020  -->  00:16:16.400
going to study in the next section of

404

00:16:16.400  -->  00:16:18.080
the course and it's called matrices

405

00:16:18.080  -->  00:16:19.820
right so we're going to create a matrix

406

00:16:19.820  -->  00:16:23.270
now don't be afraid it's it's not like

407

00:16:23.270  -->  00:16:25.640
in the movie, not just I'm not going to

408

00:16:25.640  -->  00:16:28.490
offer you any life choices which is

409

00:16:28.490  -->  00:16:30.350
going to create a matrix so we're going

410

00:16:30.350  -->  00:16:33.320
to say just to follow this code and then

411

00:16:33.320  -->  00:16:34.820
in the next section this is like a

412

00:16:34.820  -->  00:16:36.080
preview of the next section you'll find

413

00:16:36.080  -->  00:16:37.310
out what it all means.

414

00:16:37.310  -->  00:16:40.280
So rbind so row bind and then we'll

415

00:16:40.280  -->  00:16:43.310
just take all this stuff and put in here

416

00:16:43.310  -->  00:16:47.270
and now we just have to put comments so

417

00:16:47.270  -->  00:16:50.150
if I run this add creative matrix and

418

00:16:50.150  -->  00:16:52.070
let's print it out now and have a look

419

00:16:52.070  -->  00:16:54.920
at what it looks like.

420

00:16:54.920  -->  00:16:59.060
No there it is uh-huh okay so not enough

421

00:16:59.060  -->  00:16:59.750
space

422

00:16:59.750  -->  00:17:02.840
let me fix that problem. I 'm going to

423

00:17:02.840  -->  00:17:04.100
rerun this

424

00:17:04.100  -->  00:17:07.339
there we go so you can see that what we

425

00:17:07.339  -->  00:17:10.280
presented previously here is a bit like

426

00:17:10.280  -->  00:17:13.100
kind of you know some of it is ok but

427

00:17:13.100  -->  00:17:16.130
then it goes out of line and it's hard

428

00:17:16.130  -->  00:17:18.860
to follow along if you look at this it

429

00:17:18.860  -->  00:17:21.079
looks beautiful right and you'll notice

430

00:17:21.079  -->  00:17:22.640
that all the true-falses have been

431

00:17:22.640  -->  00:17:24.319
changed to 1 to 0 which makes sense right

432

00:17:24.319  -->  00:17:26.750
and it's easy to read still a one is

433

00:17:26.750  -->  00:17:30.020
true zero is false and everything is

434

00:17:30.020  -->  00:17:32.180
nicely aligned. You've got the first

435

00:17:32.180  -->  00:17:34.250
second but the months number of out by

436

00:17:34.250  -->  00:17:35.480
the way you can you can totally change

437

00:17:35.480  -->  00:17:37.760
this I 'll show you how the next section

438

00:17:37.760  -->  00:17:39.570
how to change the headers here

439

00:17:39.570  -->  00:17:42.299
the headers here so it looks much better

440

00:17:42.299  -->  00:17:44.009
like this looks much better matrix and

441

00:17:44.009  -->  00:17:46.110
now this is something much more

442

00:17:46.110  -->  00:17:48.750
pleasurable to look at and you can

443

00:17:48.750  -->  00:17:51.450
present this to your friends in order to

444

00:17:51.450  -->  00:17:52.980
him who asked you to help them and

445

00:17:52.980  -->  00:17:53.880
they'll be like they'll be pretty

446

00:17:53.880  -->  00:17:55.649
impressed don't go wow that's that's

447

00:17:55.649  -->  00:17:56.519
pretty cool

448

00:17:56.519  -->  00:17:58.080
and there you go hope you're excited

449

00:17:58.080  -->  00:18:01.019
about matrices we will talk about them

450

00:18:01.019  -->  00:18:03.960
in the next part of the course but most

451

00:18:03.960  -->  00:18:06.000
importantly I 'm pretty happy we got to

452

00:18:06.000  -->  00:18:07.919
practice these vectors operations and

453

00:18:07.919  -->  00:18:11.100
also combined financial statement

454

00:18:11.100  -->  00:18:13.379
analysis with programming that's pretty

455

00:18:13.379  -->  00:18:14.820
cool I think that's pretty and in the

456

00:18:14.820  -->  00:18:16.740
previous section or statistics and

457

00:18:16.740  -->  00:18:18.419
programming now its financial statement

458

00:18:18.419  -->  00:18:20.429
analysis programming what's next right,

459

00:18:20.429  -->  00:18:23.669
what's coming up next. Anyway happy

460

00:18:23.669  -->  00:18:25.169
that you stuck around and thanks for

461

00:18:25.169  -->  00:18:26.669
your attention and I look forward to

462

00:18:26.669  -->  00:18:28.740
seeing you on the next tutorial until

463

00:18:28.740  -->  00:18:37.349
then, happy coding.
