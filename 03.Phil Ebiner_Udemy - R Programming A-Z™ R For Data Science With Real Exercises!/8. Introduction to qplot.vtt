00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.290
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:07.290  -->  00:00:09.210
R programming. In the previous couple

3

00:00:09.210  -->  00:00:11.340
of tutorials we learned so much about

4

00:00:11.340  -->  00:00:13.380
data frames that we are now ready

5

00:00:13.380  -->  00:00:16.199
to proceed to the fun stuff to

6

00:00:16.199  -->  00:00:18.539
visualization we can finally start

7

00:00:18.539  -->  00:00:20.939
visualizing our results and today we'll

8

00:00:20.939  -->  00:00:23.760
learn a brand new function a very

9

00:00:23.760  -->  00:00:26.279
powerful function which is called Q plot.

10

00:00:26.279  -->  00:00:29.550
Alright, so let me introduce you to Q

11

00:00:29.550  -->  00:00:32.099
plot. I'm going to create a new section

12

00:00:32.099  -->  00:00:34.140
in R code and I'm going to say

13

00:00:34.140  -->  00:00:37.410
introduction, 2q plot.

14

00:00:37.410  -->  00:00:39.960
Alright so where do you find Qplot?

15

00:00:39.960  -->  00:00:43.200
Well if you just type in Qplots and if

16

00:00:43.200  -->  00:00:46.230
you type in the question mark, nothing will happen

17

00:00:46.230  -->  00:00:48.329
because no documentation for Qplot,

18

00:00:48.329  -->  00:00:49.559
couldn't find it,

19

00:00:49.559  -->  00:00:52.410
not there, where did it go? Well in

20

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:53.670
order to get Qplot, you need to

21

00:00:53.670  -->  00:00:55.079
install a package. We've talked about this

22

00:00:55.079  -->  00:00:56.850
package already a little bit.

23

00:00:56.850  -->  00:01:00.149
It's called the GGplot2 package. Let's go

24

00:01:00.149  -->  00:01:02.460
ahead if you don't have it, then you need

25

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:05.670
to type in install packages and in

26

00:01:05.670  -->  00:01:08.970
quotation marks GGplot2. I'm not going to

27

00:01:08.970  -->  00:01:10.439
do that, I'm going to come out this line

28

00:01:10.439  -->  00:01:12.570
and if you're not sure if you have it

29

00:01:12.570  -->  00:01:14.580
then just trying this line first library

30

00:01:14.580  -->  00:01:19.229
GGplot2 and if I run this here what you

31

00:01:19.229  -->  00:01:22.470
get is I've installed GGplot2 and I get

32

00:01:22.470  -->  00:01:25.110
this interesting new comment is a great

33

00:01:25.110  -->  00:01:28.259
place to get help okay. Well GGplot2

34

00:01:28.259  -->  00:01:30.390
is installed. If you've got an error then you

35

00:01:30.390  -->  00:01:32.579
might need to first actually download

36

00:01:32.579  -->  00:01:34.950
the package and then run this line so

37

00:01:34.950  -->  00:01:36.210
basically just run this line. It will

38

00:01:36.210  -->  00:01:38.009
download the package onto a machine and

39

00:01:38.009  -->  00:01:39.659
then you can install the library.

40

00:01:39.659  -->  00:01:41.640
Alright so and we talked about this in

41

00:01:41.640  -->  00:01:44.130
the library's tutorial way back,

42

00:01:44.130  -->  00:01:46.619
ok so hopefully you've got that sorted

43

00:01:46.619  -->  00:01:49.049
and now you have GGplot2 and now if you

44

00:01:49.049  -->  00:01:54.030
check Qplot, question mark. If you check Qplot,

45

00:01:54.030  -->  00:01:57.119
you will see that the help has updated

46

00:01:57.119  -->  00:01:59.700
so let's zoom in over here. We can see

47

00:01:59.700  -->  00:02:01.409
that we've got the Qplot function. It's

48

00:02:01.409  -->  00:02:03.930
got lots and lots of parameters, we are

49

00:02:03.930  -->  00:02:06.149
not going to go through them right now

50

00:02:06.149  -->  00:02:08.789
one by one, actually instead we're going

51

00:02:08.789  -->  00:02:11.550
to start practicing. What's a better way

52

00:02:11.550  -->  00:02:12.940
to learn than

53

00:02:12.940  -->  00:02:15.190
to practice right? So instead of just

54

00:02:15.190  -->  00:02:16.540
reading this boring theory,

55

00:02:16.540  -->  00:02:18.640
let's go ahead and start building and

56

00:02:18.640  -->  00:02:21.070
we'll learn as we go. Alright what do we

57

00:02:21.070  -->  00:02:23.470
want to visualize? Well today it's just an

58

00:02:23.470  -->  00:02:24.940
introduction to Qplot so we're not

59

00:02:24.940  -->  00:02:26.590
actually solving the challenge. We're

60

00:02:26.590  -->  00:02:28.120
just going to use our data set to do

61

00:02:28.120  -->  00:02:29.620
a little bit of experimenting with Q

62

00:02:29.620  -->  00:02:30.310
plot.

63

00:02:30.310  -->  00:02:34.600
Alright, so let's say Qplot and then

64

00:02:34.600  -->  00:02:37.840
in brackets what we want to type is just

65

00:02:37.840  -->  00:02:40.570
two things, first we'll say data equals

66

00:02:40.570  -->  00:02:43.900
stats so what we're doing here is we're

67

00:02:43.900  -->  00:02:46.840
saying okay Qplot, I'm passing you

68

00:02:46.840  -->  00:02:49.540
some data and that data is the start of

69

00:02:49.540  -->  00:02:51.760
frame stat, so Qplot and GGplot

70

00:02:51.760  -->  00:02:53.680
which are both functions from this

71

00:02:53.680  -->  00:02:55.870
library. They both work with data

72

00:02:55.870  -->  00:02:58.180
frames and finally now that we know

73

00:02:58.180  -->  00:03:00.670
data frames we can finally work with

74

00:03:00.670  -->  00:03:03.130
these functions and because they're so

75

00:03:03.130  -->  00:03:05.350
powerful and so good it's it's great

76

00:03:05.350  -->  00:03:07.510
that we can work with them finally. So

77

00:03:07.510  -->  00:03:09.850
basically, we're saying Qplot, here

78

00:03:09.850  -->  00:03:12.040
some data, it's called the star from

79

00:03:12.040  -->  00:03:14.650
stats take it and everything I type in

80

00:03:14.650  -->  00:03:16.870
further down in these brackets will

81

00:03:16.870  -->  00:03:20.650
relate to this data set. Ok, Qplot says

82

00:03:20.650  -->  00:03:22.989
okay because it knows that when you say

83

00:03:22.989  -->  00:03:25.510
data equals something that means that

84

00:03:25.510  -->  00:03:27.850
from now on this is the data that we

85

00:03:27.850  -->  00:03:29.680
working with, great so we kind of

86

00:03:29.680  -->  00:03:32.860
encapsulating or creating this shell for

87

00:03:32.860  -->  00:03:34.660
Qplot to work inside.

88

00:03:34.660  -->  00:03:37.360
Next we're saying x equals internet

89

00:03:37.360  -->  00:03:40.209
users internet,

90

00:03:40.209  -->  00:03:42.489
the only problem here is that the pop-up

91

00:03:42.489  -->  00:03:43.750
doesn't come back up.

92

00:03:43.750  -->  00:03:45.760
So what you see here is we no

93

00:03:45.760  -->  00:03:48.160
longer need to say stats dollar sign

94

00:03:48.160  -->  00:03:51.040
internet users because now Qplot

95

00:03:51.040  -->  00:03:53.050
knows that everything we type we'll have

96

00:03:53.050  -->  00:03:55.180
this at the start. We don't need to say

97

00:03:55.180  -->  00:03:57.489
you could say it you could type in stats

98

00:03:57.489  -->  00:04:00.310
dollar sign, but it is advised against that

99

00:04:00.310  -->  00:04:03.010
so even in his book hardly we can who

100

00:04:03.010  -->  00:04:05.200
came up with this package and we'll talk

101

00:04:05.200  -->  00:04:07.600
more about ggplot2 further in the future

102

00:04:07.600  -->  00:04:10.150
section of this course. But basically he

103

00:04:10.150  -->  00:04:13.150
advises against doing that once you've

104

00:04:13.150  -->  00:04:15.670
set the data set just stick to it and

105

00:04:15.670  -->  00:04:17.380
just use the column names without any

106

00:04:17.380  -->  00:04:18.250
dollar signs.

107

00:04:18.250  -->  00:04:19.840
Alright so what happens if I run this

108

00:04:19.840  -->  00:04:22.539
line, wow something already appeared.

109

00:04:22.539  -->  00:04:25.630
It's a distribution and

110

00:04:25.630  -->  00:04:28.990
here we've got the internet users so how

111

00:04:28.990  -->  00:04:31.870
many countries fall into these bins and

112

00:04:31.870  -->  00:04:33.670
the beauty about Qplot and

113

00:04:33.670  -->  00:04:35.410
everything in GGplot2 is a lot of

114

00:04:35.410  -->  00:04:37.570
stuff is done automatically for you

115

00:04:37.570  -->  00:04:40.960
so the labels for the axes have been

116

00:04:40.960  -->  00:04:42.520
added so here we've got introduced,

117

00:04:42.520  -->  00:04:45.310
internet users. You've got count and then the

118

00:04:45.310  -->  00:04:47.050
colors have been selected, you can see a

119

00:04:47.050  -->  00:04:49.180
grid in the background. The beans have

120

00:04:49.180  -->  00:04:51.250
been selected. You don't need to do anything

121

00:04:51.250  -->  00:04:54.460
just wrote one line and what we got is

122

00:04:54.460  -->  00:04:57.160
this a beautiful plot right away.

123

00:04:57.160  -->  00:04:59.320
Ok so that's a great start, let's try

124

00:04:59.320  -->  00:05:01.300
something else. Let's say a Qplot data

125

00:05:01.300  -->  00:05:05.080
equals stats and then comma x equals

126

00:05:05.080  -->  00:05:09.580
income group right and then we'll say y

127

00:05:09.580  -->  00:05:11.440
equals birthright.

128

00:05:11.440  -->  00:05:13.660
So what are we doing here? Well we're

129

00:05:13.660  -->  00:05:16.450
saying put a categorical variable income

130

00:05:16.450  -->  00:05:18.580
group so it'll will be categories on the

131

00:05:18.580  -->  00:05:22.390
x-axis and put a numeric variable on the

132

00:05:22.390  -->  00:05:25.540
y-axis. So let's run that, will keep plot on

133

00:05:25.540  -->  00:05:26.320
doing this case.

134

00:05:26.320  -->  00:05:29.650
Wow isn't that smart? It's already picked

135

00:05:29.650  -->  00:05:32.440
the right representation for this

136

00:05:32.440  -->  00:05:34.240
combination of data.

137

00:05:34.240  -->  00:05:36.070
Ok what else can we do? We can take this

138

00:05:36.070  -->  00:05:37.600
and we can pass it down another

139

00:05:37.600  -->  00:05:41.260
parameter we can say size equals three.

140

00:05:41.260  -->  00:05:43.360
Now let's see what happens if i run it

141

00:05:43.360  -->  00:05:45.640
like this right now. You will see that

142

00:05:45.640  -->  00:05:48.280
the size did change but then on the

143

00:05:48.280  -->  00:05:49.780
right there's a legend why do we have a

144

00:05:49.780  -->  00:05:51.220
legend if I just wanted to change the

145

00:05:51.220  -->  00:05:53.830
size? What if i change the size to ten now?

146

00:05:53.830  -->  00:05:56.830
If I run that, what you'll see is that they're the same

147

00:05:56.830  -->  00:05:59.770
size still and what's going on is that

148

00:05:59.770  -->  00:06:02.950
we are instead of just assigning the

149

00:06:02.950  -->  00:06:05.710
value to this parameter we're mapping

150

00:06:05.710  -->  00:06:07.870
it. So Qplot is kind of thinking that

151

00:06:07.870  -->  00:06:11.740
this is going to need to create a legend

152

00:06:11.740  -->  00:06:13.330
and different objects will have

153

00:06:13.330  -->  00:06:15.850
different sizes on this plot and so on

154

00:06:15.850  -->  00:06:18.010
so the correct way to work with Q plot

155

00:06:18.010  -->  00:06:22.060
is you need to put I around the value

156

00:06:22.060  -->  00:06:23.890
that you want to assign. So we won't go

157

00:06:23.890  -->  00:06:26.140
into detail around why this is because

158

00:06:26.140  -->  00:06:27.880
that would take quite a while to

159

00:06:27.880  -->  00:06:30.220
understand and in fact we're just

160

00:06:30.220  -->  00:06:32.680
working for with Q plot as a

161

00:06:32.680  -->  00:06:35.890
transitional step to get to GGplot in

162

00:06:35.890  -->  00:06:37.750
further sections of the course so for

163

00:06:37.750  -->  00:06:39.040
now if you just want to

164

00:06:39.040  -->  00:06:43.210
assign a value say a color red or a size

165

00:06:43.210  -->  00:06:45.880
to your objects on a plot using Qplot, just

166

00:06:45.880  -->  00:06:48.700
type the letter I around it so that way

167

00:06:48.700  -->  00:06:52.060
Qplot or R will treat this number as

168

00:06:52.060  -->  00:06:54.820
is instead of thinking that it should be

169

00:06:54.820  -->  00:06:57.640
mapped to the data. Ok so let's just run

170

00:06:57.640  -->  00:06:59.890
that and so here you'll see that there's

171

00:06:59.890  -->  00:07:02.200
no more legend and these values are huge.

172

00:07:02.200  -->  00:07:04.480
These circles are huge so let's take him

173

00:07:04.480  -->  00:07:06.820
back to value of three.

174

00:07:06.820  -->  00:07:08.710
Alright what else can we do with Q

175

00:07:08.710  -->  00:07:10.360
plot and then once again this is a

176

00:07:10.360  -->  00:07:12.700
tutorial just to get a quick overview of

177

00:07:12.700  -->  00:07:15.400
Qplot and intro to Qplot so color,

178

00:07:15.400  -->  00:07:18.280
maybe let's make a new line here. I'll

179

00:07:18.280  -->  00:07:20.470
leave the comma here on this line and

180

00:07:20.470  -->  00:07:24.430
then I'll say color equals I and around

181

00:07:24.430  -->  00:07:28.240
I'll say inside I'll say blue and so

182

00:07:28.240  -->  00:07:30.280
for us so I'll show again if I if I

183

00:07:30.280  -->  00:07:33.520
don't say I and I run this and now it's

184

00:07:33.520  -->  00:07:34.900
waiting for the second line because of

185

00:07:34.900  -->  00:07:37.150
the comma and this plus sign over here so if I

186

00:07:37.150  -->  00:07:40.810
run this. You see that's not blue, that's nowhere

187

00:07:40.810  -->  00:07:42.280
near blue. It is a color but it's not

188

00:07:42.280  -->  00:07:42.910
blue.

189

00:07:42.910  -->  00:07:46.420
So make sure to put that I when you're

190

00:07:46.420  -->  00:07:49.780
working with Qplot, okay if I run that,

191

00:07:49.780  -->  00:07:51.820
there we go we've got blue beautiful so

192

00:07:51.820  -->  00:07:53.290
you can control color, by the way both

193

00:07:53.290  -->  00:07:55.420
American and Australian I'm going to say

194

00:07:55.420  -->  00:07:57.460
Australian in this case British of

195

00:07:57.460  -->  00:08:00.160
course British English work so you can

196

00:08:00.160  -->  00:08:01.960
type of the you or you don't have to

197

00:08:01.960  -->  00:08:04.360
type the you whatever is your preference

198

00:08:04.360  -->  00:08:07.060
I like typing the you. Okay and another

199

00:08:07.060  -->  00:08:10.690
one is let's do the same thing

200

00:08:10.690  -->  00:08:13.000
no color but this time and actually no

201

00:08:13.000  -->  00:08:15.400
size but this time we'll pass a

202

00:08:15.400  -->  00:08:19.030
parameter will say geom equals box plot

203

00:08:19.030  -->  00:08:21.970
so we all know what box plots are so if I

204

00:08:21.970  -->  00:08:25.960
run that, there you go, Qplot has created a box

205

00:08:25.960  -->  00:08:28.390
plot for you. You didn't have to anything you

206

00:08:28.390  -->  00:08:30.190
just told that I want a box plot create a

207

00:08:30.190  -->  00:08:31.300
box but for you.

208

00:08:31.300  -->  00:08:33.190
That's how smart this function is and

209

00:08:33.190  -->  00:08:36.760
that is what we are going to be working

210

00:08:36.760  -->  00:08:40.390
with in this section and actually

211

00:08:40.390  -->  00:08:43.419
actually how about this? How about what

212

00:08:43.419  -->  00:08:44.320
we're going to do in the next tutorial

213

00:08:44.320  -->  00:08:46.510
is we're going to you know visualize

214

00:08:46.510  -->  00:08:47.830
what we're supposed to according to a

215

00:08:47.830  -->  00:08:50.770
challenge but why don't you give it a go

216

00:08:50.770  -->  00:08:52.480
and see if you can get

217

00:08:52.480  -->  00:08:55.389
it to achieve what we're after and in

218

00:08:55.389  -->  00:08:56.860
the next tutorial we'll do it together

219

00:08:56.860  -->  00:08:59.380
and then you can compare your results.

220

00:08:59.380  -->  00:09:01.149
Alright and I look forward to seeing you

221

00:09:01.149  -->  00:09:13.919
then, until next time happy coding.
