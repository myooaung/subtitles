00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,960
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:06,960  -->  00:00:09,480
R programming. Today we're going to finally

3

00:00:09,480  -->  00:00:11,910
get our hands dirty in the basketball

4

00:00:11,910  -->  00:00:14,250
data set and also we're going to learn

5

00:00:14,250  -->  00:00:17,279
about matrix operations while we are at

6

00:00:17,279  -->  00:00:17,850
it.

7

00:00:17,850  -->  00:00:20,279
Alright so let's get started right away,

8

00:00:20,279  -->  00:00:23,699
let's see what kind of tables are at our

9

00:00:23,699  -->  00:00:25,470
disposal. So we can see them over here,

10

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:27,570
let's type some of them out. So let's

11

00:00:27,570  -->  00:00:29,730
start with the games table for instance,

12

00:00:29,730  -->  00:00:33,360
matrix. The matrix, so here we've got the

13

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:37,020
players as we've got the years and as we

14

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:39,719
now know these this is a named matrix so

15

00:00:39,719  -->  00:00:42,780
basically it's got row names and

16

00:00:42,780  -->  00:00:46,289
column names. So if we check row names, get off

17

00:00:46,289  -->  00:00:49,230
games we will see that that's the names

18

00:00:49,230  -->  00:00:52,140
and same for column names we will get

19

00:00:52,140  -->  00:00:54,570
the similar results so let's check games

20

00:00:54,570  -->  00:00:57,780
we see that it does have, that's so

21

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:00,660
basically it's the matrix right, and now we know

22

00:01:00,660  -->  00:01:03,329
how to access it as well so if we want

23

00:01:03,329  -->  00:01:05,970
to for instance check how many games

24

00:01:05,970  -->  00:01:08,850
Lebron James played in 2012 we would say

25

00:01:08,850  -->  00:01:11,880
games and then instead of trying to

26

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:14,549
figure out what role Lebron James is

27

00:01:14,549  -->  00:01:18,030
on, 3rd row and then what 1,2,3 the number

28

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:20,009
of the column. Here we can just simply

29

00:01:20,009  -->  00:01:24,420
say LeBron James and then comma and in

30

00:01:24,420  -->  00:01:27,270
2013 or 2012, whichever year,

31

00:01:27,270  -->  00:01:29,729
let's say we want 2012 we check that we

32

00:01:29,729  -->  00:01:32,189
get our on 276 game so here you can see

33

00:01:32,189  -->  00:01:33,930
that that is correct

34

00:01:33,930  -->  00:01:37,500
Lebron James played 36 games in 2012.

35

00:01:37,500  -->  00:01:40,320
Okay great, so but now matrix operations,

36

00:01:40,320  -->  00:01:42,240
what can we do with matrices?

37

00:01:42,240  -->  00:01:44,579
Well we know that with vectors we can do

38

00:01:44,579  -->  00:01:47,310
the same operations as we would do with

39

00:01:47,310  -->  00:01:49,020
just variables right? So we can add

40

00:01:49,020  -->  00:01:51,600
vectors subtract, multiply we'll explore

41

00:01:51,600  -->  00:01:53,909
all of that in previously in the course

42

00:01:53,909  -->  00:01:56,340
but now can we do the same things of

43

00:01:56,340  -->  00:01:57,149
matrices?

44

00:01:57,149  -->  00:01:58,920
Well yes of course we can, so let's take

45

00:01:58,920  -->  00:02:00,780
another matrix that we have. Let's say

46

00:02:00,780  -->  00:02:05,219
field goals right, field goals so this is

47

00:02:05,219  -->  00:02:07,170
how many field goals each of the players

48

00:02:07,170  -->  00:02:09,599
called in each of the years right? So

49

00:02:09,599  -->  00:02:11,970
what we can do here is let's say we want

50

00:02:11,970  -->  00:02:15,060
to find out how many field goals every

51

00:02:15,060  -->  00:02:16,050
single one of these

52

00:02:16,050  -->  00:02:18,510
players scored for game. One way to do it

53

00:02:18,510  -->  00:02:20,490
would be to go through every player

54

00:02:20,490  -->  00:02:22,140
through every year and divide the number

55

00:02:22,140  -->  00:02:24,600
of goals by the number of years like in

56

00:02:24,600  -->  00:02:26,730
the loop or it could even be a double loop, right?

57

00:02:26,730  -->  00:02:29,310
You would have to loop by the

58

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:30,900
players and by the years but that's

59

00:02:30,900  -->  00:02:33,150
overly complicated, so mathematicians

60

00:02:33,150  -->  00:02:35,550
and statisticians that was overly

61

00:02:35,550  -->  00:02:38,130
complicated and they decided that in R

62

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:40,620
we're going to just divide one matrix by

63

00:02:40,620  -->  00:02:42,090
the other just like we can do

64

00:02:42,090  -->  00:02:43,710
with vectors right? So let's do that,

65

00:02:43,710  -->  00:02:48,960
let's say field goals divided by games. Let's

66

00:02:48,960  -->  00:02:51,300
check that out, now this is way too big

67

00:02:51,300  -->  00:02:53,790
of a matrix so let's try it again, let's

68

00:02:53,790  -->  00:02:56,880
make some space and there we go. So now,

69

00:02:56,880  -->  00:02:59,220
you can see how many field goals per

70

00:02:59,220  -->  00:03:01,800
game each player scored if I round this,

71

00:03:01,800  -->  00:03:04,860
if I round this and I don't give any

72

00:03:04,860  -->  00:03:06,840
parameters and if I just do that or

73

00:03:06,840  -->  00:03:09,630
maybe let's say let's give it one number

74

00:03:09,630  -->  00:03:11,880
after the decimal, then here you can see

75

00:03:11,880  -->  00:03:14,340
how many field goals each player

76

00:03:14,340  -->  00:03:16,980
actually scored per game and it's and

77

00:03:16,980  -->  00:03:18,510
the presented nicely than that

78

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:21,540
and let's say you want to find out Chris

79

00:03:21,540  -->  00:03:23,640
Paul in 2010.

80

00:03:23,640  -->  00:03:25,709
Here you go, he scored on average he's

81

00:03:25,709  -->  00:03:30,090
scored 5.4 goals per game and that is

82

00:03:30,090  -->  00:03:32,220
what this table is about. That is how a

83

00:03:32,220  -->  00:03:35,430
matrix is divided by another matrix in R. it

84

00:03:35,430  -->  00:03:37,530
just simply element by element so as you

85

00:03:37,530  -->  00:03:39,030
can imagine they have to be of the same

86

00:03:39,030  -->  00:03:42,090
size for you to be able to perform this

87

00:03:42,090  -->  00:03:43,110
operation.

88

00:03:43,110  -->  00:03:44,280
Alright, let's have a look at another and

89

00:03:44,280  -->  00:03:46,200
what are the tables do we have? Let's

90

00:03:46,200  -->  00:03:49,650
bring this back and here we've got let's

91

00:03:49,650  -->  00:03:52,500
say minutes played right? Let's find out

92

00:03:52,500  -->  00:03:54,720
how many minutes per game did each

93

00:03:54,720  -->  00:03:57,870
player play. So let's do that, minutes

94

00:03:57,870  -->  00:04:02,610
played divided by games and once again not enough

95

00:04:02,610  -->  00:04:05,160
space and let's round that. Let's round

96

00:04:05,160  -->  00:04:08,610
that to the nearest one decimal point, so

97

00:04:08,610  -->  00:04:10,709
or actually no decimal point for

98

00:04:10,709  -->  00:04:12,690
minutes played, so here we can see how

99

00:04:12,690  -->  00:04:14,760
many minutes on average for every game

100

00:04:14,760  -->  00:04:17,580
each player played in every single one

101

00:04:17,580  -->  00:04:20,130
of these seasons. So you can quickly tell

102

00:04:20,130  -->  00:04:23,190
Derrick Rose 29 minutes for game over

103

00:04:23,190  -->  00:04:27,330
here, then 37, 35 then he was injured, then   31, then 30

104

00:04:27,330  -->  00:04:29,280
and looking at

105

00:04:29,280  -->  00:04:32,280
per game stats is actually quite handy

106

00:04:32,280  -->  00:04:33,870
because if you just look at minutes

107

00:04:33,870  -->  00:04:37,020
played what you'll find is that here

108

00:04:37,020  -->  00:04:38,970
Derrick Rose only played 311 and you

109

00:04:38,970  -->  00:04:40,620
can't compare to the other players or

110

00:04:40,620  -->  00:04:41,850
you can't even compared to other years

111

00:04:41,850  -->  00:04:44,310
because it's a very low number or even

112

00:04:44,310  -->  00:04:48,060
zero here but if you divide by games is or what

113

00:04:48,060  -->  00:04:50,430
we already have here it's much more

114

00:04:50,430  -->  00:04:51,990
comparable so you can now compare

115

00:04:51,990  -->  00:04:54,300
between different players and between

116

00:04:54,300  -->  00:04:55,800
different years because 31,

117

00:04:55,800  -->  00:04:57,120
here you can see that even though he

118

00:04:57,120  -->  00:04:59,010
played only a few games he actually

119

00:04:59,010  -->  00:05:01,620
played more minutes per game than in

120

00:05:01,620  -->  00:05:02,910
2014.

121

00:05:02,910  -->  00:05:05,610
Ok so that's how you divide matrices, the

122

00:05:05,610  -->  00:05:07,680
same thing you can add matrices, you can

123

00:05:07,680  -->  00:05:10,500
subtract them, you can multiply them. In

124

00:05:10,500  -->  00:05:12,870
our case, it's just that the type of data

125

00:05:12,870  -->  00:05:14,580
set we have we're mostly going to be

126

00:05:14,580  -->  00:05:18,750
dividing one matrix by the other and but

127

00:05:18,750  -->  00:05:20,280
nevertheless you can still do all those

128

00:05:20,280  -->  00:05:22,620
other operations with matrices and so

129

00:05:22,620  -->  00:05:23,760
that brings us to the end of today's

130

00:05:23,760  -->  00:05:26,340
tutorial. In the next tutorial we'll find

131

00:05:26,340  -->  00:05:28,740
out how to actually visualize these

132

00:05:28,740  -->  00:05:30,540
results that we're getting, it will be a

133

00:05:30,540  -->  00:05:33,120
fun tutorial. We'll start building charts

134

00:05:33,120  -->  00:05:34,950
and graphs and for now what I would like

135

00:05:34,950  -->  00:05:37,830
to do is to invite you to explore these

136

00:05:37,830  -->  00:05:40,169
other matrices that you have here and

137

00:05:40,169  -->  00:05:42,780
perhaps perform some other operations

138

00:05:42,780  -->  00:05:45,630
like try to calculate the field goaled

139

00:05:45,630  -->  00:05:48,390
attempts per game or another good one

140

00:05:48,390  -->  00:05:50,760
would be trying to calculate the field

141

00:05:50,760  -->  00:05:54,090
goals per field goal attempt and that will

142

00:05:54,090  -->  00:05:56,520
give you the accuracy of each player so

143

00:05:56,520  -->  00:05:58,860
you will know how many of the shots that

144

00:05:58,860  -->  00:06:02,070
they actually make and up in the basket.

145

00:06:02,070  -->  00:06:03,960
Okay that brings us to the end. On that

146

00:06:03,960  -->  00:06:05,820
note, I will see you in the next tutorial.

147

00:06:05,820  -->  00:06:17,589
Until then, happy coding.
