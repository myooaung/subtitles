00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,990
Hello and welcome back to the course

2

00:00:06,990  -->  00:00:09,240
on R programming and congratulations on

3

00:00:09,240  -->  00:00:11,309
completing this section of the course

4

00:00:11,309  -->  00:00:15,179
devoted to our fundamentals. And today we

5

00:00:15,179  -->  00:00:17,550
have another homework exercise and this

6

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:20,250
time we're analyzing financial statement.

7

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:23,490
I know it can be a bit tedious to go through

8

00:00:23,490  -->  00:00:25,920
financials and look at all the revenues

9

00:00:25,920  -->  00:00:28,260
expenses and so on but as a data

10

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:30,300
scientist depending on your role of

11

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:33,540
course but sometimes you will be in

12

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:35,250
encountering financial statements and it's

13

00:00:35,250  -->  00:00:36,660
good to have at least a basic

14

00:00:36,660  -->  00:00:38,969
understanding of what's going on and how

15

00:00:38,969  -->  00:00:40,590
you can apply the tools you know to

16

00:00:40,590  -->  00:00:42,780
analyzing these financial statements and

17

00:00:42,780  -->  00:00:45,000
moreover of course we're going to

18

00:00:45,000  -->  00:00:47,250
analyze the financial statement using

19

00:00:47,250  -->  00:00:48,480
R. So it's going to be an interesting

20

00:00:48,480  -->  00:00:52,020
combination of programming and financial

21

00:00:52,020  -->  00:00:53,789
statement analysis, so without any

22

00:00:53,789  -->  00:00:55,739
further ado let's dive straight into the

23

00:00:55,739  -->  00:00:57,930
challenge. Here we have a scenario, you

24

00:00:57,930  -->  00:00:59,489
are a data scientist working for a

25

00:00:59,489  -->  00:01:01,500
consulting firm, one of your colleagues

26

00:01:01,500  -->  00:01:03,359
from the auditing department has asked

27

00:01:03,359  -->  00:01:05,549
you to help them assess the financial

28

00:01:05,549  -->  00:01:08,130
statement of organization X and by the

29

00:01:08,130  -->  00:01:10,470
way this scenario comes from real life,

30

00:01:10,470  -->  00:01:12,750
when I was working consulting in the

31

00:01:12,750  -->  00:01:14,790
data science division the auditing guys

32

00:01:14,790  -->  00:01:16,560
would often come to us asking for help

33

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:18,210
because they had lots and lots of data

34

00:01:18,210  -->  00:01:20,400
and they knew that the tools that we

35

00:01:20,400  -->  00:01:22,229
have and the knowledge that we possess

36

00:01:22,229  -->  00:01:24,750
can help them process that data much

37

00:01:24,750  -->  00:01:25,979
faster so it is a very powerful

38

00:01:25,979  -->  00:01:27,659
combination of the two departments

39

00:01:27,659  -->  00:01:30,780
working together, and in this case, you have

40

00:01:30,780  -->  00:01:32,369
been supplied with two vectors of

41

00:01:32,369  -->  00:01:34,439
data monthly revenue and monthly

42

00:01:34,439  -->  00:01:36,180
expenses for the financial year in

43

00:01:36,180  -->  00:01:36,869
question.

44

00:01:36,869  -->  00:01:39,030
Your task is to calculate the following

45

00:01:39,030  -->  00:01:41,579
financial metrics, profit for each month,

46

00:01:41,579  -->  00:01:43,649
profit after tax for each month, the

47

00:01:43,649  -->  00:01:46,290
tax rate is 30 percent, profit margin for each

48

00:01:46,290  -->  00:01:48,450
month in which equals to profit off the

49

00:01:48,450  -->  00:01:51,659
tax divided by revenue, good months where the

50

00:01:51,659  -->  00:01:53,970
profit after tax was greater than the

51

00:01:53,970  -->  00:01:55,890
mean for the year and bad months where

52

00:01:55,890  -->  00:01:57,540
the profit after tax was less than

53

00:01:57,540  -->  00:01:59,610
the mean for the year. Also, the best

54

00:01:59,610  -->  00:02:01,500
month where the profit after tax was

55

00:02:01,500  -->  00:02:03,600
max for the year and the worst month

56

00:02:03,600  -->  00:02:05,969
where the profit after tax was mean for

57

00:02:05,969  -->  00:02:06,659
the year.

58

00:02:06,659  -->  00:02:08,340
Now it sounds serious blood with the

59

00:02:08,340  -->  00:02:10,929
help of R, we can power through this

60

00:02:10,929  -->  00:02:12,670
challenge and also we've got some

61

00:02:12,670  -->  00:02:15,069
additional notes over here, all results

62

00:02:15,069  -->  00:02:17,019
need to be presented as vectors and that

63

00:02:17,019  -->  00:02:19,060
includes the best month and the worst

64

00:02:19,060  -->  00:02:20,650
month they should be presented as true

65

00:02:20,650  -->  00:02:23,019
and false vectors. Results for dollar

66

00:02:23,019  -->  00:02:25,060
values and need to be calculated with

67

00:02:25,060  -->  00:02:27,969
one cent precision but need to be

68

00:02:27,969  -->  00:02:31,540
presented in units of 1,000 dollars meaning

69

00:02:31,540  -->  00:02:34,239
that every unit is a thousand dollars

70

00:02:34,239  -->  00:02:37,420
and there is no decimal point. Results

71

00:02:37,420  -->  00:02:39,250
for the profit margin ratio need to

72

00:02:39,250  -->  00:02:41,319
be presented in units of percentage

73

00:02:41,319  -->  00:02:43,870
terms with no decimal points and also

74

00:02:43,870  -->  00:02:45,220
don't worry about the percentage sign,

75

00:02:45,220  -->  00:02:46,900
just get a number from zero to a hundred

76

00:02:46,900  -->  00:02:50,230
and for those of you curious out there,

77

00:02:50,230  -->  00:02:52,269
note that your colleague has informed

78

00:02:52,269  -->  00:02:54,459
you that it is ok for tax for any given

79

00:02:54,459  -->  00:02:56,950
month to be negative. In accounting terms,

80

00:02:56,950  -->  00:02:59,079
negative tax translates into a deferred

81

00:02:59,079  -->  00:03:01,780
tax asset but we won't get into detail

82

00:03:01,780  -->  00:03:04,269
on DTA's and stuff like that,

83

00:03:04,269  -->  00:03:06,310
just bear in mind that if you do get

84

00:03:06,310  -->  00:03:08,530
attacks that is negative in a given

85

00:03:08,530  -->  00:03:11,109
month that's totally fine and it doesn't

86

00:03:11,109  -->  00:03:13,959
cause any problems. Okay? So where do you

87

00:03:13,959  -->  00:03:17,139
get the data set for this challenge? To

88

00:03:17,139  -->  00:03:18,579
get the data set for this challenge, you

89

00:03:18,579  -->  00:03:21,609
need to go to the website which is

90

00:03:21,609  -->  00:03:23,889
superdatascience.com/rcourse, so let's

91

00:03:23,889  -->  00:03:27,639
zoom in over here and now if you scroll

92

00:03:27,639  -->  00:03:31,269
down to Section three, Fundamentals of

93

00:03:31,269  -->  00:03:33,220
R. Here, you will see more challenge

94

00:03:33,220  -->  00:03:36,189
which is the PDF so the slides that we

95

00:03:36,189  -->  00:03:38,079
just went through and also you'll see

96

00:03:38,079  -->  00:03:40,569
the homework data set so go ahead and

97

00:03:40,569  -->  00:03:43,180
download the homework data set and once

98

00:03:43,180  -->  00:03:45,400
you unzip it and open up in R, what it

99

00:03:45,400  -->  00:03:46,000
look like

100

00:03:46,000  -->  00:03:49,180
is it look like this. So you'll be given

101

00:03:49,180  -->  00:03:50,769
these two vectors, they're already

102

00:03:50,769  -->  00:03:53,139
pre-coated for you so you just have to

103

00:03:53,139  -->  00:03:55,870
run these two lines to create these two

104

00:03:55,870  -->  00:03:58,599
vectors and then you can go ahead and

105

00:03:58,599  -->  00:04:01,359
type in your solution over here. So if

106

00:04:01,359  -->  00:04:03,009
you're comfortable with this challenge

107

00:04:03,009  -->  00:04:05,829
already then please proceed and

108

00:04:05,829  -->  00:04:09,099
attempt it, see how far you can get but if

109

00:04:09,099  -->  00:04:11,229
you'd like some additional hints then

110

00:04:11,229  -->  00:04:12,609
stick around because I'm going to give

111

00:04:12,609  -->  00:04:15,129
out two additional hints and the first

112

00:04:15,129  -->  00:04:17,979
one will just list the functions that

113

00:04:17,979  -->  00:04:20,260
you will need new functions that we

114

00:04:20,260  -->  00:04:22,000
haven't talked to through just to get

115

00:04:22,000  -->  00:04:23,060
you on the right

116

00:04:23,060  -->  00:04:24,980
track. So now I'm going to proceed to the

117

00:04:24,980  -->  00:04:28,040
hints, let me bring up my presentation

118

00:04:28,040  -->  00:04:29,600
and now

119

00:04:29,600  -->  00:04:33,290
hint number one, hint number one is the

120

00:04:33,290  -->  00:04:35,720
new functions that we haven't talked

121

00:04:35,720  -->  00:04:37,340
about yet and that you will need for

122

00:04:37,340  -->  00:04:38,960
this challenge. Here they are, there's

123

00:04:38,960  -->  00:04:41,930
four of them round, mean, max and min and

124

00:04:41,930  -->  00:04:44,389
I specifically have not included any

125

00:04:44,389  -->  00:04:46,160
descriptions or any additional

126

00:04:46,160  -->  00:04:47,450
information on these functions here

127

00:04:47,450  -->  00:04:50,540
because now you have the question mark operator

128

00:04:50,540  -->  00:04:51,830
which you should be quite comfortable

129

00:04:51,830  -->  00:04:53,660
with. Remember, if you put the question

130

00:04:53,660  -->  00:04:56,210
mark before the name of the function and

131

00:04:56,210  -->  00:04:59,510
execute that line then you will get some

132

00:04:59,510  -->  00:05:00,770
additional information. You will get

133

00:05:00,770  -->  00:05:02,840
description of the function and you'll

134

00:05:02,840  -->  00:05:05,150
get some insights on how to use it. So

135

00:05:05,150  -->  00:05:06,860
the mean, max and min functions are

136

00:05:06,860  -->  00:05:08,270
pretty straightforward and you should be

137

00:05:08,270  -->  00:05:11,090
okay with them straight up, but the round

138

00:05:11,090  -->  00:05:13,070
function, you might want to use the question mark

139

00:05:13,070  -->  00:05:14,960
operator to find out some additional

140

00:05:14,960  -->  00:05:17,180
information because it does have a

141

00:05:17,180  -->  00:05:19,430
parameter that you need to pass on to

142

00:05:19,430  -->  00:05:20,060
it.

143

00:05:20,060  -->  00:05:22,340
Ok so there they are, the four functions

144

00:05:22,340  -->  00:05:23,930
now you should be pretty much on the

145

00:05:23,930  -->  00:05:26,330
right track to attempt this challenge

146

00:05:26,330  -->  00:05:28,880
and I invite you to do so, so go ahead and

147

00:05:28,880  -->  00:05:31,190
stop this video and attempt the

148

00:05:31,190  -->  00:05:33,440
challenge. I do understand it's quite a

149

00:05:33,440  -->  00:05:36,410
long task so don't be worried if you

150

00:05:36,410  -->  00:05:38,240
don't get through all of the points that

151

00:05:38,240  -->  00:05:40,220
required in the challenge even if you

152

00:05:40,220  -->  00:05:41,960
get through some of them, that's already a

153

00:05:41,960  -->  00:05:43,520
great accomplishment because it will

154

00:05:43,520  -->  00:05:45,380
allow you to practice these vector's

155

00:05:45,380  -->  00:05:47,900
operations which are so important in R

156

00:05:47,900  -->  00:05:49,850
and once you've attempted the challenge,

157

00:05:49,850  -->  00:05:52,880
come back and I will reveal hint number

158

00:05:52,880  -->  00:05:54,139
two for you.

159

00:05:54,139  -->  00:05:56,720
Ok so now I'm going to proceed with hint

160

00:05:56,720  -->  00:05:59,300
number two. Hint number two is just as

161

00:05:59,300  -->  00:06:02,960
last time a fill-in-the-blanks exercise

162

00:06:02,960  -->  00:06:06,200
and the code was a very long so I didn't

163

00:06:06,200  -->  00:06:09,020
put it in the slides over here,

164

00:06:09,020  -->  00:06:11,210
what I did is I uploaded it on the

165

00:06:11,210  -->  00:06:12,740
website and now we're going to go and

166

00:06:12,740  -->  00:06:14,240
have a look at it.

167

00:06:14,240  -->  00:06:17,360
Ok so if you proceed to the website over

168

00:06:17,360  -->  00:06:20,060
here, superdatascience.com/rcourse

169

00:06:20,060  -->  00:06:23,330
and you scroll down to Section

170

00:06:23,330  -->  00:06:25,789
three fundamentals of R, here at the

171

00:06:25,789  -->  00:06:28,250
end you will see fill-in-the-blanks exercise, so if

172

00:06:28,250  -->  00:06:29,840
you download that file and unzip it

173

00:06:29,840  -->  00:06:32,150
you'll see our code which looks like

174

00:06:32,150  -->  00:06:33,110
this.

175

00:06:33,110  -->  00:06:35,270
Here's the R code that you'll see and

176

00:06:35,270  -->  00:06:36,460
this is our fill in

177

00:06:36,460  -->  00:06:38,080
the blanks exercise, so as you can see,

178

00:06:38,080  -->  00:06:40,569
I've put in a very thorough comments

179

00:06:40,569  -->  00:06:42,340
throughout so you should be pretty

180

00:06:42,340  -->  00:06:45,009
comfortable as in what's going on in

181

00:06:45,009  -->  00:06:47,050
each one of these and you

182

00:06:47,050  -->  00:06:48,729
it's a great exercise to complete

183

00:06:48,729  -->  00:06:51,580
because once again you will learn how to

184

00:06:51,580  -->  00:06:53,020
or you will revise how to do those

185

00:06:53,020  -->  00:06:55,389
vectors operations and by the way even

186

00:06:55,389  -->  00:06:56,949
if you didn't complete the challenge, there's a

187

00:06:56,949  -->  00:06:59,560
bonus for you over here at the end. It's

188

00:06:59,560  -->  00:07:01,720
a preview of what's coming in the next

189

00:07:01,720  -->  00:07:04,660
section, so if you run this code, you will

190

00:07:04,660  -->  00:07:06,310
get a matrix which you'll be able to

191

00:07:06,310  -->  00:07:08,410
print out there once again we haven't

192

00:07:08,410  -->  00:07:10,330
talked about matrices yet but it's

193

00:07:10,330  -->  00:07:12,009
coming in the next section very very

194

00:07:12,009  -->  00:07:14,169
soon so I just wanted to give you a bit

195

00:07:14,169  -->  00:07:16,389
of a taste and a bit of a feel for it. So

196

00:07:16,389  -->  00:07:19,810
there we go, that is hint number two and

197

00:07:19,810  -->  00:07:21,310
this brings us to the end of today's

198

00:07:21,310  -->  00:07:23,259
tutorial. I wish you luck with this

199

00:07:23,259  -->  00:07:25,539
challenge and if you'd like to see how I

200

00:07:25,539  -->  00:07:28,240
solve this problem then go to the end of

201

00:07:28,240  -->  00:07:29,440
this course, there's a section on

202

00:07:29,440  -->  00:07:32,020
homework exercises. The solution is

203

00:07:32,020  -->  00:07:34,389
presented there and I look forward to

204

00:07:34,389  -->  00:07:35,680
seeing you in the next tutorial.

205

00:07:35,680  -->  00:07:47,660
Until then, happy coding.
