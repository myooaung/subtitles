00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,870
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:06,870  -->  00:00:08,910
R programming and today we're going to

3

00:00:08,910  -->  00:00:10,559
solve the challenge where we need to

4

00:00:10,559  -->  00:00:13,080
recreate this beautiful visualization in

5

00:00:13,080  -->  00:00:14,910
front of us. So let's dive straight into

6

00:00:14,910  -->  00:00:17,340
it. Here I've got R studio and the

7

00:00:17,340  -->  00:00:18,960
first thing that we will need to do is

8

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:21,359
import the data so let's go ahead and do

9

00:00:21,359  -->  00:00:21,810
that.

10

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:24,510
Import the data, we're going to check our

11

00:00:24,510  -->  00:00:26,730
working directory first thing and here

12

00:00:26,730  -->  00:00:28,949
you can see it's not the one that we're

13

00:00:28,949  -->  00:00:31,109
after so let's set the working directory.

14

00:00:31,109  -->  00:00:35,880
It's going to be users there we go so that

15

00:00:35,880  -->  00:00:38,460
is going to set our working directory let's

16

00:00:38,460  -->  00:00:40,379
run that and now let's check our working

17

00:00:40,379  -->  00:00:42,750
directory again as you can see it is the

18

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:43,770
correct one now.

19

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:46,950
Now let's read the data into a new data

20

00:00:46,950  -->  00:00:48,660
frame which we'll call just mov for

21

00:00:48,660  -->  00:00:51,809
movie read dot CSV and what is

22

00:00:51,809  -->  00:00:54,149
our file called, let me copy the name

23

00:00:54,149  -->  00:00:57,510
here. There is the name of our file, so if I

24

00:00:57,510  -->  00:01:00,660
run that and now we've got the data set

25

00:01:00,660  -->  00:01:02,460
prepared. Now we'll just quickly do some

26

00:01:02,460  -->  00:01:05,640
data exploration as we usually do so

27

00:01:05,640  -->  00:01:08,220
we'll check the top rows. Let's make some

28

00:01:08,220  -->  00:01:11,400
space here and let's rerun this line. So as

29

00:01:11,400  -->  00:01:12,990
you can see there's a lot of columns and

30

00:01:12,990  -->  00:01:15,750
that's why it's taking a few even bros

31

00:01:15,750  -->  00:01:18,420
to output all this so here we've got the

32

00:01:18,420  -->  00:01:20,340
columns looks okay

33

00:01:20,340  -->  00:01:22,530
nothing stands out the only thing is the

34

00:01:22,530  -->  00:01:25,409
names of course our it's not the best

35

00:01:25,409  -->  00:01:27,210
but we're actually not going to fix them

36

00:01:27,210  -->  00:01:28,380
up because we're not going to be using

37

00:01:28,380  -->  00:01:29,850
all the columns. We're going to be using

38

00:01:29,850  -->  00:01:32,100
some of the columns and fixing up the names

39

00:01:32,100  -->  00:01:34,200
of all the columns is just going to take a

40

00:01:34,200  -->  00:01:36,450
time that we don't really need to waste.

41

00:01:36,450  -->  00:01:39,479
So let's check the summary so here

42

00:01:39,479  -->  00:01:42,210
you've got your factor columns as we

43

00:01:42,210  -->  00:01:43,170
remember

44

00:01:43,170  -->  00:01:47,100
so all of these words and names and then

45

00:01:47,100  -->  00:01:50,520
we've got some numeric columns as well and now

46

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:53,670
let's look at the str for mov. There we go

47

00:01:53,670  -->  00:01:56,189
so that's all the columns listed over

48

00:01:56,189  -->  00:01:56,820
here.

49

00:01:56,820  -->  00:01:59,549
Alright so let's quickly decide which

50

00:01:59,549  -->  00:02:01,290
columns we're actually going to need in our

51

00:02:01,290  -->  00:02:03,240
visualization. Here's the visualization

52

00:02:03,240  -->  00:02:05,310
and we can see right away, x is genre,

53

00:02:05,310  -->  00:02:08,009
gross percentage us is the vertical

54

00:02:08,009  -->  00:02:09,479
axis. So let's find them here, so

55

00:02:09,479  -->  00:02:12,209
we've got gross percentage us, that's

56

00:02:12,209  -->  00:02:13,530
going to be a vertical axis

57

00:02:13,530  -->  00:02:15,690
then we've got the genre that will be

58

00:02:15,690  -->  00:02:18,150
the horizontal axis and then one other

59

00:02:18,150  -->  00:02:20,010
aesthetics because that's how you think

60

00:02:20,010  -->  00:02:22,770
about right so is aesthetics are mapped

61

00:02:22,770  -->  00:02:25,530
to they can either be set or they can be

62

00:02:25,530  -->  00:02:26,670
mapped so we're looking for the

63

00:02:26,670  -->  00:02:29,040
aesthetics that are obviously mapped to

64

00:02:29,040  -->  00:02:31,350
some of the variables in our data so

65

00:02:31,350  -->  00:02:33,870
some of the columns. This is mapped, this

66

00:02:33,870  -->  00:02:36,209
is mapped. There we can see that this is

67

00:02:36,209  -->  00:02:37,920
mapped as well right because there's

68

00:02:37,920  -->  00:02:39,930
budget is one of our columns and this is

69

00:02:39,930  -->  00:02:43,140
mapped so the size and the color sizes

70

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:45,570
budget of the movies color is the studio

71

00:02:45,570  -->  00:02:47,580
that produced the movie so let's have a

72

00:02:47,580  -->  00:02:49,500
look here. The studio

73

00:02:49,500  -->  00:02:52,560
we've gotta column for studio and budget

74

00:02:52,560  -->  00:02:54,989
so that's another column that we are going to need.

75

00:02:54,989  -->  00:02:56,820
So as you can see we only need four columns,

76

00:02:56,820  -->  00:02:58,890
we only need a genre, studio which have

77

00:02:58,890  -->  00:03:01,050
good names budget million that's okay we

78

00:03:01,050  -->  00:03:03,330
can remember to copy it from here

79

00:03:03,330  -->  00:03:05,730
three dots then one dot and cross us. If

80

00:03:05,730  -->  00:03:07,050
you feel like changing the names of the

81

00:03:07,050  -->  00:03:09,569
columns please go ahead and do that you

82

00:03:09,569  -->  00:03:12,300
are now comfortable doing that you have

83

00:03:12,300  -->  00:03:14,970
the correct skills to do that, but I am going

84

00:03:14,970  -->  00:03:16,769
to be a bit lazy. I'm not going to change

85

00:03:16,769  -->  00:03:19,019
the names of the columns. So now we're

86

00:03:19,019  -->  00:03:23,430
going to activate our favorite GG plot 2.

87

00:03:23,430  -->  00:03:25,920
I'm just going to take this first line

88

00:03:25,920  -->  00:03:28,170
here because that's what conventional

89

00:03:28,170  -->  00:03:31,380
standards say or people are just

90

00:03:31,380  -->  00:03:33,780
used to doing this just put it here just

91

00:03:33,780  -->  00:03:35,310
in case person and the person who's

92

00:03:35,310  -->  00:03:37,200
running this code doesn't have the

93

00:03:37,200  -->  00:03:39,030
package installed from the internet and

94

00:03:39,030  -->  00:03:41,640
commented out because we actually do and

95

00:03:41,640  -->  00:03:44,489
then we'll just type in library ggplot2.

96

00:03:44,489  -->  00:03:46,980
So if I run that, there we go we've

97

00:03:46,980  -->  00:03:48,989
activated the package.

98

00:03:48,989  -->  00:03:51,329
Alright so quickly what I wanted to show

99

00:03:51,329  -->  00:03:54,209
you is a bit off topic, so cool insight.

100

00:03:54,209  -->  00:03:56,310
This is not related to challenge but I

101

00:03:56,310  -->  00:03:57,810
thought this was really interesting

102

00:03:57,810  -->  00:04:00,090
about the data set and I wanted to show

103

00:04:00,090  -->  00:04:03,299
it right away. So data movie and then let's

104

00:04:03,299  -->  00:04:04,799
have a look at some aesthetics, we'll say

105

00:04:04,799  -->  00:04:06,959
actually one aesthetic. We just want,  we just

106

00:04:06,959  -->  00:04:09,269
want to visualize day of the week right?

107

00:04:09,269  -->  00:04:12,120
I want to see when our movies released.

108

00:04:12,120  -->  00:04:15,269
So remember previously would use geom

109

00:04:15,269  -->  00:04:17,700
histogram but here you can use histogram

110

00:04:17,700  -->  00:04:19,530
because it's not a continuous variable

111

00:04:19,530  -->  00:04:21,989
so here we are using instead of like a

112

00:04:21,989  -->  00:04:24,930
number in America will be using a factor

113

00:04:24,930  -->  00:04:26,400
variable so we've got day of the week

114

00:04:26,400  -->  00:04:26,730
here.

115

00:04:26,730  -->  00:04:29,760
It's like fridays, saturdays and so on

116

00:04:29,760  -->  00:04:32,610
so instead of histogram for factors or

117

00:04:32,610  -->  00:04:34,440
categorical variables what you need is

118

00:04:34,440  -->  00:04:37,230
geom bar so if you're on that is that

119

00:04:37,230  -->  00:04:39,000
you'll see that most of the movies out

120

00:04:39,000  -->  00:04:41,250
of we were like 600 something movies in

121

00:04:41,250  -->  00:04:44,400
the data set and over 400 of them are

122

00:04:44,400  -->  00:04:45,960
actually we're actually released in the

123

00:04:45,960  -->  00:04:48,810
friday. A few on a Saturday, a few on a

124

00:04:48,810  -->  00:04:50,910
Sunday, quite a few on Thursday to Tuesday

125

00:04:50,910  -->  00:04:53,070
then in the next like over a hundred

126

00:04:53,070  -->  00:04:55,740
were on Wednesday. That is I when I saw

127

00:04:55,740  -->  00:04:57,180
that I was quite fascinated because like

128

00:04:57,180  -->  00:04:58,770
so obviously there are strategies around

129

00:04:58,770  -->  00:05:01,830
this so the studio's know that most

130

00:05:01,830  -->  00:05:03,990
people go to movies on a friday and if

131

00:05:03,990  -->  00:05:05,730
you release the movie on a different

132

00:05:05,730  -->  00:05:08,790
day then it's less likely to make a lot

133

00:05:08,790  -->  00:05:11,670
of revenue and the same thing so

134

00:05:11,670  -->  00:05:13,920
Wednesday's like the midweek release and

135

00:05:13,920  -->  00:05:15,270
the other thing you'll find here is that

136

00:05:15,270  -->  00:05:17,280
there is no Monday. So it's Friday,

137

00:05:17,280  -->  00:05:18,720
Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Tuesday, Wednesday, there is

138

00:05:18,720  -->  00:05:21,810
only six days so never out of all of

139

00:05:21,810  -->  00:05:23,580
these movies that we have in our data set,

140

00:05:23,580  -->  00:05:25,830
not even one was released on a Monday.

141

00:05:25,830  -->  00:05:27,720
How cool is that?

142

00:05:27,720  -->  00:05:29,820
So they obviously know that if you

143

00:05:29,820  -->  00:05:31,680
release the movie on the Monday it will

144

00:05:31,680  -->  00:05:34,620
be a flop so yeah that was just an

145

00:05:34,620  -->  00:05:36,090
insight that you can get right away from

146

00:05:36,090  -->  00:05:38,280
the data and this kind of brings me to

147

00:05:38,280  -->  00:05:39,570
the other point which also wanted to

148

00:05:39,570  -->  00:05:42,720
make that this data set has a lot of

149

00:05:42,720  -->  00:05:45,120
information in it, like we just look

150

00:05:45,120  -->  00:05:46,230
through it and we said we're going to be

151

00:05:46,230  -->  00:05:48,120
only using four columns but in reality

152

00:05:48,120  -->  00:05:50,400
there's so much more information so I

153

00:05:50,400  -->  00:05:52,410
highly encourage you after you done with

154

00:05:52,410  -->  00:05:55,260
this tutorial on how to solve the

155

00:05:55,260  -->  00:05:57,480
challenges go ahead and explore and try

156

00:05:57,480  -->  00:05:59,460
to set some other challenges for

157

00:05:59,460  -->  00:06:01,140
yourself and see what other things you

158

00:06:01,140  -->  00:06:02,940
can find in this data set and what you

159

00:06:02,940  -->  00:06:05,400
can visualize because obviously we're

160

00:06:05,400  -->  00:06:06,780
going to cover some of the skills we'll learn

161

00:06:06,780  -->  00:06:08,460
in this section but not everything. So we

162

00:06:08,460  -->  00:06:11,160
won't be doing any smoothers, we won't be

163

00:06:11,160  -->  00:06:13,110
creating scatter plots and so on so

164

00:06:13,110  -->  00:06:15,690
maybe explore data set and see what

165

00:06:15,690  -->  00:06:16,860
else you can find.

166

00:06:16,860  -->  00:06:19,920
Ok so what are we going to do now?

167

00:06:19,920  -->  00:06:22,470
Now we're going to move on to the actual

168

00:06:22,470  -->  00:06:25,410
challenge. We're going to proceed, we have

169

00:06:25,410  -->  00:06:28,440
our filters. Why do we need filters?

170

00:06:28,440  -->  00:06:31,320
Well what you'll notice is that in this

171

00:06:31,320  -->  00:06:34,800
final visualization we've only got five

172

00:06:34,800  -->  00:06:38,730
genres and we're going to go to 123456

173

00:06:38,730  -->  00:06:40,449
studios. In the actual

174

00:06:40,449  -->  00:06:43,449
data set, there is much much more so

175

00:06:43,449  -->  00:06:47,680
studio has 36 level so the 36 different

176

00:06:47,680  -->  00:06:52,389
studios and genre has 15 levels so if we

177

00:06:52,389  -->  00:06:54,129
try visualizing the same thing but

178

00:06:54,129  -->  00:06:56,499
without filtering out data set we'll have

179

00:06:56,499  -->  00:06:59,319
a very very cluttered visualization and

180

00:06:59,319  -->  00:07:02,020
so the there's a reason probably why

181

00:07:02,020  -->  00:07:04,900
those filters were applied and I'll give

182

00:07:04,900  -->  00:07:06,099
you a hint. It's because those are the

183

00:07:06,099  -->  00:07:08,439
most popular genres and then the

184

00:07:08,439  -->  00:07:10,240
students that produced most movies but

185

00:07:10,240  -->  00:07:12,159
what concerns us is that we get the

186

00:07:12,159  -->  00:07:15,279
exact same studios and exact same genres

187

00:07:15,279  -->  00:07:17,620
and that also help us practice filtering

188

00:07:17,620  -->  00:07:19,419
data sets a little bit right? So

189

00:07:19,419  -->  00:07:23,499
let's do this, filter data frame number

190

00:07:23,499  -->  00:07:27,490
one or let's say filter number one for

191

00:07:27,490  -->  00:07:28,719
the data frame.

192

00:07:28,719  -->  00:07:31,870
Alright so filt will be our filter and

193

00:07:31,870  -->  00:07:33,099
this is how we're going to create we're

194

00:07:33,099  -->  00:07:37,330
going to move dollar sign genre, equals action

195

00:07:37,330  -->  00:07:40,659
so this is one of the genres in the

196

00:07:40,659  -->  00:07:42,339
visualization here so we got

197

00:07:42,339  -->  00:07:44,409
action-adventure animation comedy and

198

00:07:44,409  -->  00:07:47,349
drama so if we do that that will give us

199

00:07:47,349  -->  00:07:51,039
only movies that are in action in that

200

00:07:51,039  -->  00:07:52,839
genre, so if I do that and then I say

201

00:07:52,839  -->  00:07:57,580
let's say move to is going to be a movie

202

00:07:57,580  -->  00:08:00,129
and then also filt comma nothing

203

00:08:00,129  -->  00:08:00,520
right?

204

00:08:00,520  -->  00:08:03,639
You remember this so if I run that, now I

205

00:08:03,639  -->  00:08:07,209
will have a data set that only has

206

00:08:07,209  -->  00:08:10,539
movies from that specific genre so if I

207

00:08:10,539  -->  00:08:13,839
scroll up here, it's a lot of information

208

00:08:13,839  -->  00:08:16,419
still a lot of information so here you

209

00:08:16,419  -->  00:08:18,009
can see that all of these movies are

210

00:08:18,009  -->  00:08:20,199
action, action, action, action, action,

211

00:08:20,199  -->  00:08:24,580
action all of them. That is not what we

212

00:08:24,580  -->  00:08:26,169
want, we want many different genres

213

00:08:26,169  -->  00:08:28,599
so we want to say action and now we want

214

00:08:28,599  -->  00:08:31,689
to say or right? It's either

215

00:08:31,689  -->  00:08:35,139
action or it is just put some brackets

216

00:08:35,139  -->  00:08:37,419
here, you don't have to put these

217

00:08:37,419  -->  00:08:39,159
brackets but it might just make it a

218

00:08:39,159  -->  00:08:42,639
more comfortable. So or here we're going to

219

00:08:42,639  -->  00:08:48,399
say adventure or it is animation or it

220

00:08:48,399  -->  00:08:52,720
is comedy or it is drama.

221

00:08:52,720  -->  00:08:55,300
So we're using the logical or operator

222

00:08:55,300  -->  00:08:58,779
this vertical line to say one of these

223

00:08:58,779  -->  00:09:00,639
conditions has to be true, either movie

224

00:09:00,639  -->  00:09:03,160
dollar genre equals to action or it

225

00:09:03,160  -->  00:09:05,529
equals to adventure or and so on and

226

00:09:05,529  -->  00:09:07,660
notice I'm using the double equal sign

227

00:09:07,660  -->  00:09:09,519
to check that condition.

228

00:09:09,519  -->  00:09:11,649
Ok so that's the first filter, now we

229

00:09:11,649  -->  00:09:14,470
need a second filter right? Filter number

230

00:09:14,470  -->  00:09:18,459
two how do we filter now? Well now we

231

00:09:18,459  -->  00:09:22,389
need to fix up the studios and we can do

232

00:09:22,389  -->  00:09:24,310
the same exact thing so instead of

233

00:09:24,310  -->  00:09:26,740
movies genre, let's just say movie dollar studio

234

00:09:26,740  -->  00:09:28,810
and then select the correct studios but

235

00:09:28,810  -->  00:09:31,779
I wanted to show you a better way. I want

236

00:09:31,779  -->  00:09:33,699
to show you kind of like a quick preview

237

00:09:33,699  -->  00:09:36,399
of something that we haven't talked

238

00:09:36,399  -->  00:09:40,149
about yet so filt2 this is just a

239

00:09:40,149  -->  00:09:43,240
faster way of doing it is if I say move

240

00:09:43,240  -->  00:09:46,449
dollar sign a studio and then instead of

241

00:09:46,449  -->  00:09:50,620
equals I'll say percentage in percentage

242

00:09:50,620  -->  00:09:53,110
and this operator means that you will

243

00:09:53,110  -->  00:09:56,769
give it a vector of values and then if

244

00:09:56,769  -->  00:09:59,680
this matches any of these values then it

245

00:09:59,680  -->  00:10:02,949
will return a true value so let's say

246

00:10:02,949  -->  00:10:04,870
I'm just going to copy the values that

247

00:10:04,870  -->  00:10:08,079
we're going to be working with basically

248

00:10:08,079  -->  00:10:11,019
I'm just copying these exact words, these

249

00:10:11,019  -->  00:10:12,699
exact names of studios. I'm just copying

250

00:10:12,699  -->  00:10:14,980
them into this vector. So there we go so

251

00:10:14,980  -->  00:10:17,230
we got vector. We're creating a vector

252

00:10:17,230  -->  00:10:20,350
here which contains these studios. The

253

00:10:20,350  -->  00:10:23,949
Buena Vista Studios, Warner Brothers are

254

00:10:23,949  -->  00:10:26,800
probably pronouncing on Fox, Universal,

255

00:10:26,800  -->  00:10:29,620
Sony, Paramount Pictures so basically

256

00:10:29,620  -->  00:10:32,170
this line means if movie studio is in

257

00:10:32,170  -->  00:10:35,199
any of these then it's the truth. So

258

00:10:35,199  -->  00:10:37,480
choose either way you like, you can

259

00:10:37,480  -->  00:10:40,600
achieve accomplish the same thing with

260

00:10:40,600  -->  00:10:43,000
this approach or with this approach. This

261

00:10:43,000  -->  00:10:44,889
one is just a bit shorter. So let's go ahead

262

00:10:44,889  -->  00:10:47,139
and run that and now I want to combine

263

00:10:47,139  -->  00:10:49,480
the two filters right so I've got filt

264

00:10:49,480  -->  00:10:51,579
which is filter 1 which is a true true

265

00:10:51,579  -->  00:10:54,459
true and false and I've got filt 2

266

00:10:54,459  -->  00:10:57,160
right, so another filter so how do I

267

00:10:57,160  -->  00:10:59,680
combine them? How do I say I want a movie

268

00:10:59,680  -->  00:11:01,929
to match this criteria and I want the

269

00:11:01,929  -->  00:11:04,179
movie to match this criteria for it to

270

00:11:04,179  -->  00:11:05,370
participate in our visualization.

271

00:11:05,370  -->  00:11:08,220
Here I have to put and filt 2,

272

00:11:08,220  -->  00:11:09,990
so there we go

273

00:11:09,990  -->  00:11:13,080
and now if I run that, this data set will

274

00:11:13,080  -->  00:11:16,320
actually only have the movies that we

275

00:11:16,320  -->  00:11:18,720
want in the final visualization and

276

00:11:18,720  -->  00:11:20,279
we'll see that as we're creating the

277

00:11:20,279  -->  00:11:22,500
visualization. So there we go, we've only

278

00:11:22,500  -->  00:11:24,600
now come up to the point where we're

279

00:11:24,600  -->  00:11:26,190
going to be practicing our visualization

280

00:11:26,190  -->  00:11:28,740
skills and that's not a problem. That's

281

00:11:28,740  -->  00:11:31,110
okay because we hear we were refreshing

282

00:11:31,110  -->  00:11:32,820
our knowledge and filtering data sets

283

00:11:32,820  -->  00:11:35,040
and that's also important topic and also

284

00:11:35,040  -->  00:11:43,009
works with some logical operators
