00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.990
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:08.610
R programming and in today's tutorial

3

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:11.219
we're still talking about aesthetics.

4

00:00:11.219  -->  00:00:12.870
I know it's been a couple of tutorials

5

00:00:12.870  -->  00:00:14.759
but aesthetics is a very important topic

6

00:00:14.759  -->  00:00:17.490
and we really want to learn it well, so

7

00:00:17.490  -->  00:00:19.800
that we can later create very powerful

8

00:00:19.800  -->  00:00:22.080
visualizations and moreover today we're

9

00:00:22.080  -->  00:00:24.060
talking about a very important topic

10

00:00:24.060  -->  00:00:26.519
inside a very important topic which is

11

00:00:26.519  -->  00:00:28.980
mapping vs setting. So I think it is

12

00:00:28.980  -->  00:00:31.349
worthwhile to devote some time to it, so

13

00:00:31.349  -->  00:00:34.380
it settles very well in our mind. So

14

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:36.750
let's go to R studio and before we

15

00:00:36.750  -->  00:00:38.850
move on to mapping vs setting, I wanted

16

00:00:38.850  -->  00:00:40.920
to say that this chart that we created

17

00:00:40.920  -->  00:00:43.020
over here with the budget that is going

18

00:00:43.020  -->  00:00:45.000
to be our second chart in R

19

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:47.070
deliverable. So let's go ahead and run it

20

00:00:47.070  -->  00:00:50.460
and it looks pretty interesting because

21

00:00:50.460  -->  00:00:52.649
budget it's showing us that budget

22

00:00:52.649  -->  00:00:55.230
doesn't really affect the rating that

23

00:00:55.230  -->  00:00:57.120
the audience will give, so doesn't matter

24

00:00:57.120  -->  00:00:58.920
do you invest a lot of money on a movie or a

25

00:00:58.920  -->  00:01:01.109
little bit of money they are other

26

00:01:01.109  -->  00:01:03.690
factors that affect audience rating or

27

00:01:03.690  -->  00:01:05.280
rather than budget. So I think it's an

28

00:01:05.280  -->  00:01:06.390
important insight that we want to

29

00:01:06.390  -->  00:01:07.770
convey. So we're going to export the

30

00:01:07.770  -->  00:01:08.909
image by clicking this button and

31

00:01:08.909  -->  00:01:12.119
clicking save as. Here we're going to say

32

00:01:12.119  -->  00:01:17.220
what size we want, to thous.. 1, 2, 8, 0, 720 update

33

00:01:17.220  -->  00:01:19.409
preview and let's go ahead and save that

34

00:01:19.409  -->  00:01:22.619
and now I've actually prepared a

35

00:01:22.619  -->  00:01:25.259
presentation which six slides. This is going

36

00:01:25.259  -->  00:01:27.330
to be our deliverable and will copy it

37

00:01:27.330  -->  00:01:29.729
as the second plot because we only leave

38

00:01:29.729  -->  00:01:31.680
first place for the plot to steal

39

00:01:31.680  -->  00:01:32.790
requested.

40

00:01:32.790  -->  00:01:34.740
Alright so there's our first chart,

41

00:01:34.740  -->  00:01:36.450
that's a great start.

42

00:01:36.450  -->  00:01:39.000
Alright and now let's move on to mapping

43

00:01:39.000  -->  00:01:41.310
vs setting. So first thing that we're going to

44

00:01:41.310  -->  00:01:43.829
do is start up in your letter R and then

45

00:01:43.829  -->  00:01:47.009
we'll say ggplot same thing data equals

46

00:01:47.009  -->  00:01:51.119
movies then aesthetics. Let's get some

47

00:01:51.119  -->  00:01:53.700
aesthetics X. So basically let's recreate

48

00:01:53.700  -->  00:01:55.140
what we've already done.

49

00:01:55.140  -->  00:01:59.100
It's always good to practice, y equals

50

00:01:59.100  -->  00:02:01.229
audience rating.

51

00:02:01.229  -->  00:02:03.060
Alright, so if I run that, that's our R

52

00:02:03.060  -->  00:02:05.549
object and now what I want to do is I

53

00:02:05.549  -->  00:02:09.720
want to say R plus let's give it some geometry, geom_point.

54

00:02:09.720  -->  00:02:11.830
I run that.

55

00:02:11.830  -->  00:02:14.620
We remember this black

56

00:02:14.620  -->  00:02:18.040
plots, so just basically black plots.

57

00:02:18.040  -->  00:02:20.830
Alright, how do we know add it give it some

58

00:02:20.830  -->  00:02:22.960
color. So let's do that,

59

00:02:22.960  -->  00:02:26.620
add color. They are two ways we can add

60

00:02:26.620  -->  00:02:29.830
color to this plot. Number one is by

61

00:02:29.830  -->  00:02:33.280
mapping and this is what we've done so

62

00:02:33.280  -->  00:02:35.620
far. This is actually the hard bit so

63

00:02:35.620  -->  00:02:37.420
setting is easier and it's good that we

64

00:02:37.420  -->  00:02:39.460
started with mapping, it's a bit harder

65

00:02:39.460  -->  00:02:41.020
but now we know it.

66

00:02:41.020  -->  00:02:44.230
R plus geom_point, whoop not path,

67

00:02:44.230  -->  00:02:46.540
point and here we want to say

68

00:02:46.540  -->  00:02:49.690
aesthetic and inside we wanna say color equals

69

00:02:49.690  -->  00:02:53.620
genre right? So if we run that, we've got

70

00:02:53.620  -->  00:02:55.900
some colored points. Good!

71

00:02:55.900  -->  00:02:57.910
now let's look at the second way. The

72

00:02:57.910  -->  00:03:00.310
second way is actually setting. This is a

73

00:03:00.310  -->  00:03:01.990
new way which we touched on the previous

74

00:03:01.990  -->  00:03:03.459
tutorial, lets look at it.

75

00:03:03.459  -->  00:03:07.090
So R plus same thing, geom_point and here

76

00:03:07.090  -->  00:03:09.459
instead of saying aesthetic which is

77

00:03:09.459  -->  00:03:11.620
going to say the color. We're just going to say

78

00:03:11.620  -->  00:03:14.500
take color equals and we'll say dark

79

00:03:14.500  -->  00:03:17.350
green, so if you run that, you'll see

80

00:03:17.350  -->  00:03:20.019
that the points now are actually dark

81

00:03:20.019  -->  00:03:23.709
green. Alright now this would be an

82

00:03:23.709  -->  00:03:25.989
error, if I would say we'll get back to

83

00:03:25.989  -->  00:03:27.400
what we did just now but I just want to

84

00:03:27.400  -->  00:03:31.540
show error. If you tried to set the color

85

00:03:31.540  -->  00:03:34.120
while using aesthetic, so if I was just

86

00:03:34.120  -->  00:03:37.780
do this and then instead of Scharner if

87

00:03:37.780  -->  00:03:41.620
I said dark green. So if I did that, if I run

88

00:03:41.620  -->  00:03:43.660
that you'll see that the points are

89

00:03:43.660  -->  00:03:46.989
actually kind of pink or salmon color

90

00:03:46.989  -->  00:03:49.510
and there's a legend moral. Well there shouldn't be

91

00:03:49.510  -->  00:03:51.519
a legend, and that is happe.. what's

92

00:03:51.519  -->  00:03:53.050
happening there is that even though you

93

00:03:53.050  -->  00:03:55.450
think that you're setting the color to

94

00:03:55.450  -->  00:03:57.519
dark green. You're actually mapping it to

95

00:03:57.519  -->  00:04:00.370
this new variable that are things you're

96

00:04:00.370  -->  00:04:02.860
creating. So very important to remember

97

00:04:02.860  -->  00:04:04.330
that if you just want to set a color

98

00:04:04.330  -->  00:04:06.340
then you don't use the aesthetics. If you

99

00:04:06.340  -->  00:04:09.160
want a map a color to a variable, then you

100

00:04:09.160  -->  00:04:12.430
use the function aesthetic and so I know it

101

00:04:12.430  -->  00:04:14.320
can be a bit confusing, so I'm just going to

102

00:04:14.320  -->  00:04:16.630
comment this answer so it's not in our way. I can,

103

00:04:16.630  -->  00:04:18.310
it can be a bit confusing between

104

00:04:18.310  -->  00:04:20.169
the two because in both cases you're

105

00:04:20.169  -->  00:04:22.419
setting color right and what is color?

106

00:04:22.419  -->  00:04:25.230
Well color is an aesthetic, right?

107

00:04:25.230  -->  00:04:27.810
It's an aesthetic on your chart so in

108

00:04:27.810  -->  00:04:30.180
this case you're mapping color to a

109

00:04:30.180  -->  00:04:33.810
variable. In this case, you are setting a

110

00:04:33.810  -->  00:04:36.390
color which is an aesthetic to a

111

00:04:36.390  -->  00:04:38.460
physical color. So you're using the

112

00:04:38.460  -->  00:04:41.490
actual meaning of this word dark green.

113

00:04:41.490  -->  00:04:43.740
It can be a bit confusing but the best

114

00:04:43.740  -->  00:04:46.230
way I would say to remember it is that

115

00:04:46.230  -->  00:04:48.750
it's harder to map the right? So

116

00:04:48.750  -->  00:04:52.140
attaching one variable or something

117

00:04:52.140  -->  00:04:55.350
a color to variable is generally a more

118

00:04:55.350  -->  00:04:58.050
complex process and just setting it. So

119

00:04:58.050  -->  00:04:59.790
that's how to remember it, so something more

120

00:04:59.790  -->  00:05:01.950
complex requires this function

121

00:05:01.950  -->  00:05:03.750
aesthetics requires the help of this

122

00:05:03.750  -->  00:05:05.790
function as something simpler like

123

00:05:05.790  -->  00:05:08.640
setting doesn't require that. So I know

124

00:05:08.640  -->  00:05:09.840
it might be a bit confusing right now

125

00:05:09.840  -->  00:05:11.700
but let's practice a little bit more and

126

00:05:11.700  -->  00:05:14.370
I yeah I'm sure that throughout the

127

00:05:14.370  -->  00:05:16.860
section we will have so much practice

128

00:05:16.860  -->  00:05:21.150
that by the end of it you will be very

129

00:05:21.150  -->  00:05:22.530
comfortable with all of this.

130

00:05:22.530  -->  00:05:25.980
So mapping let's do it well, let's do another one.

131

00:05:25.980  -->  00:05:27.540
So number one is going to be mapping,

132

00:05:27.540  -->  00:05:31.800
we're going to say R plus geom point and

133

00:05:31.800  -->  00:05:34.500
actually feel free to use any of your

134

00:05:34.500  -->  00:05:37.710
own suggestions. For example I'm going to

135

00:05:37.710  -->  00:05:41.100
use budget millions so I'm going to size

136

00:05:41.100  -->  00:05:43.740
for budget millions which we used before

137

00:05:43.740  -->  00:05:46.770
right? Now you can see the size has

138

00:05:46.770  -->  00:05:48.360
changed, that's good

139

00:05:48.360  -->  00:05:50.640
and now let's try setting. Here we're

140

00:05:50.640  -->  00:05:54.510
going to say, R plus geom underscore point

141

00:05:54.510  -->  00:05:57.510
and here we're going to say size equals

142

00:05:57.510  -->  00:05:58.290
10.

143

00:05:58.290  -->  00:06:02.640
Aha, Very big, very nice exactly what we

144

00:06:02.640  -->  00:06:03.390
wanted.

145

00:06:03.390  -->  00:06:05.640
Now let's see what happens once again,

146

00:06:05.640  -->  00:06:07.440
we're going to check this out, the error.

147

00:06:07.440  -->  00:06:09.900
I just want to show you that it is very

148

00:06:09.900  -->  00:06:11.640
important to remember these things so

149

00:06:11.640  -->  00:06:15.210
R plus geom underscore point and

150

00:06:15.210  -->  00:06:18.840
here let's say I had forgotten that I

151

00:06:18.840  -->  00:06:21.060
don't need to use aesthetics for setting.

152

00:06:21.060  -->  00:06:23.280
I set aesthetics and I said size equals 10.

153

00:06:23.280  -->  00:06:26.460
What you'll see the size is a bit

154

00:06:26.460  -->  00:06:29.880
bigger than in this case but that's not

155

00:06:29.880  -->  00:06:32.790
10 as we saw 10 is much bigger.

156

00:06:32.790  -->  00:06:35.190
That is just because R is looking at this

157

00:06:35.190  -->  00:06:37.740
10 that you're supplying as if it were a

158

00:06:37.740  -->  00:06:38.660
category right?

159

00:06:38.660  -->  00:06:40.670
As if it were like a factor variable and

160

00:06:40.670  -->  00:06:42.650
saying okay, that's a category I'm going

161

00:06:42.650  -->  00:06:43.700
to create a legend.

162

00:06:43.700  -->  00:06:45.740
So everybody in category 10 is gonna

163

00:06:45.740  -->  00:06:47.750
get this specific size which looks like

164

00:06:47.750  -->  00:06:49.400
a three or four or something like that.

165

00:06:49.400  -->  00:06:51.950
So basically  it can be very

166

00:06:51.950  -->  00:06:54.410
misleading and if you by accident forget,

167

00:06:54.410  -->  00:06:57.950
then you might end up in a bit of

168

00:06:57.950  -->  00:06:59.960
trouble. So always remember if you want

169

00:06:59.960  -->  00:07:02.270
to set something don't use the aesthetic

170

00:07:02.270  -->  00:07:04.490
function, if you want to map something

171

00:07:04.490  -->  00:07:06.890
use the aesthetic function. It's as simple

172

00:07:06.890  -->  00:07:09.320
as that, and at the same time even though

173

00:07:09.320  -->  00:07:12.440
it's being such a simple concept that

174

00:07:12.440  -->  00:07:15.410
you can either set or map aesthetic such

175

00:07:15.410  -->  00:07:17.600
see on the chart. It gives you a lot

176

00:07:17.600  -->  00:07:19.070
of flexibility as you can imagine, so you

177

00:07:19.070  -->  00:07:20.660
can either color something using a

178

00:07:20.660  -->  00:07:22.280
variable or you can just color something

179

00:07:22.280  -->  00:07:24.350
using a color. You can make a charge

180

00:07:24.350  -->  00:07:26.510
prettier. You can make them more vibrant.

181

00:07:26.510  -->  00:07:28.640
You can change the sizes, so if

182

00:07:28.640  -->  00:07:30.290
something's too small you can change all

183

00:07:30.290  -->  00:07:32.390
the sizes without even having to map

184

00:07:32.390  -->  00:07:34.580
to a variable. It really, it gives you a lot

185

00:07:34.580  -->  00:07:36.800
of control over your visualizations. So

186

00:07:36.800  -->  00:07:38.360
that's what we're going to be practicing

187

00:07:38.360  -->  00:07:41.960
throughout this section and that brings

188

00:07:41.960  -->  00:07:43.700
also today at the end of today's tutorial. I

189

00:07:43.700  -->  00:07:45.980
highly encourage you to play around with

190

00:07:45.980  -->  00:07:47.600
this, so just spend a couple of minutes

191

00:07:47.600  -->  00:07:50.480
on practicing setting vs mapping.

192

00:07:50.480  -->  00:07:52.220
We've got a lot of variables in our data

193

00:07:52.220  -->  00:07:54.410
set, so try different a couple of

194

00:07:54.410  -->  00:07:56.570
different ones because it is an

195

00:07:56.570  -->  00:07:58.640
important concept that needs to settle

196

00:07:58.640  -->  00:08:00.950
down in our mind very well and I look

197

00:08:00.950  -->  00:08:02.090
forward to seeing you next time.

198

00:08:02.090  -->  00:08:14.220
Until then, happy coding.
