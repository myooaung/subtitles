00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,960
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:06,960  -->  00:00:08,730
R programming and today we're talking

3

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:10,860
about statistical layer of our

4

00:00:10,860  -->  00:00:13,769
visualization process. So let's move into

5

00:00:13,769  -->  00:00:16,109
R studio and see what we have for

6

00:00:16,109  -->  00:00:16,740
today.

7

00:00:16,740  -->  00:00:19,590
Alright so statistical transformations,

8

00:00:19,590  -->  00:00:21,420
well the functional we're going to talk

9

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:22,830
about or the layer that we're going to

10

00:00:22,830  -->  00:00:24,660
be talking about today is called geom

11

00:00:24,660  -->  00:00:26,609
smooth, so let's look it up.

12

00:00:26,609  -->  00:00:29,490
Geom underscore smooth and we won't read

13

00:00:29,490  -->  00:00:30,990
through all of this but let's zoom in

14

00:00:30,990  -->  00:00:32,610
and look at the first sentence it says

15

00:00:32,610  -->  00:00:35,040
aids the I in seeing patterns in the

16

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:37,829
presence of over plotting. So basically

17

00:00:37,829  -->  00:00:40,649
geom's move allows you to observe trends

18

00:00:40,649  -->  00:00:42,690
and dependencies and kind of like

19

00:00:42,690  -->  00:00:46,079
relationships. It shows you all of these

20

00:00:46,079  -->  00:00:49,140
things if there's like lots of points on

21

00:00:49,140  -->  00:00:51,870
your chart, exactly our situation

22

00:00:51,870  -->  00:00:55,289
it shows you those trends and other

23

00:00:55,289  -->  00:00:56,640
things that you might not see right

24

00:00:56,640  -->  00:00:59,460
away. So let's go back into the main

25

00:00:59,460  -->  00:01:02,219
window of R and let's go ahead and see

26

00:01:02,219  -->  00:01:04,350
how can use or take advantage of this

27

00:01:04,350  -->  00:01:06,390
function. So we're going to create our

28

00:01:06,390  -->  00:01:09,930
u functions, so that's the order you

29

00:01:09,930  -->  00:01:12,060
layer starting layer is going to be u

30

00:01:12,060  -->  00:01:15,150
today and going to say ggplot data

31

00:01:15,150  -->  00:01:19,110
equals movies aesthetics and inside

32

00:01:19,110  -->  00:01:21,600
aesthetics we're going to create that a

33

00:01:21,600  -->  00:01:23,640
plot that we're pretty used to critic

34

00:01:23,640  -->  00:01:27,689
rating, audience rating and color equals

35

00:01:27,689  -->  00:01:31,560
genre. Alright there we've map our

36

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:32,490
variables.

37

00:01:32,490  -->  00:01:35,939
Now let's say you + geom point,

38

00:01:35,939  -->  00:01:38,579
so we're very well aware of this plot

39

00:01:38,579  -->  00:01:40,500
and now we're going to add this smoother.

40

00:01:40,500  -->  00:01:42,899
We're going to say plus geom so we're adding

41

00:01:42,899  -->  00:01:45,479
a new layer and geom smooth so if I run

42

00:01:45,479  -->  00:01:49,439
this now, you'll see that it is horrible.

43

00:01:49,439  -->  00:01:52,290
It is very very not pretty, it's got all

44

00:01:52,290  -->  00:01:54,600
of these smoothers with all their bands on

45

00:01:54,600  -->  00:01:57,329
top of each other kind of kind make

46

00:01:57,329  -->  00:01:58,619
things worse can't really tell anything

47

00:01:58,619  -->  00:01:59,340
from here.

48

00:01:59,340  -->  00:02:01,860
So what we will do is we'll say fill

49

00:02:01,860  -->  00:02:05,909
equals N/A, so N/A means we don't want any

50

00:02:05,909  -->  00:02:08,879
fill and if we run this now much

51

00:02:08,879  -->  00:02:11,280
better right? So now we have the trends

52

00:02:11,280  -->  00:02:13,490
and now we can observe them. We can say

53

00:02:13,490  -->  00:02:16,970
that ok so we've got our legend over

54

00:02:16,970  -->  00:02:18,950
here and we can see that for instance

55

00:02:18,950  -->  00:02:22,490
this is romance right so this is how are

56

00:02:22,490  -->  00:02:24,830
the critic ratings and audience ratings

57

00:02:24,830  -->  00:02:28,520
interrelated so for instance if your

58

00:02:28,520  -->  00:02:31,310
movie is their romance comedy and the

59

00:02:31,310  -->  00:02:33,440
critics give it or have come in just a

60

00:02:33,440  -->  00:02:35,540
romance movie and the critics give it a

61

00:02:35,540  -->  00:02:38,510
low rating around 25 then it's actually

62

00:02:38,510  -->  00:02:40,820
very likely that or you know

63

00:02:40,820  -->  00:02:43,430
statistically likely that the audience

64

00:02:43,430  -->  00:02:45,170
is going to actually rate it pretty high.

65

00:02:45,170  -->  00:02:49,970
So over 50 surprisingly and or for

66

00:02:49,970  -->  00:02:51,170
instance what else can we talk? Well

67

00:02:51,170  -->  00:02:53,600
we can tell that let's take for instance

68

00:02:53,600  -->  00:02:57,470
horror movies here and action movies so

69

00:02:57,470  -->  00:02:59,540
you can see that if the critics give a

70

00:02:59,540  -->  00:03:02,600
horror movie a high rating of 75 and

71

00:03:02,600  -->  00:03:04,760
they give an action movie the same high

72

00:03:04,760  -->  00:03:07,130
rating of 75 then statistically the

73

00:03:07,130  -->  00:03:09,170
action movie is more likely to get

74

00:03:09,170  -->  00:03:11,150
better and better rating from the

75

00:03:11,150  -->  00:03:13,010
audience than the horror movie so you

76

00:03:13,010  -->  00:03:15,110
can observe quite a few relationship

77

00:03:15,110  -->  00:03:16,670
from here and they're quite interesting

78

00:03:16,670  -->  00:03:18,530
especially as we move from left to right

79

00:03:18,530  -->  00:03:20,960
and you look at how the critic ratings

80

00:03:20,960  -->  00:03:23,360
change and then you observe what happens

81

00:03:23,360  -->  00:03:25,820
the audience ratings so that is what a

82

00:03:25,820  -->  00:03:28,220
smoother helps us see it helps us see

83

00:03:28,220  -->  00:03:30,200
all these patterns in the data which we

84

00:03:30,200  -->  00:03:32,510
otherwise wouldn't have ever picked up

85

00:03:32,510  -->  00:03:34,880
because there is so many dots is like

86

00:03:34,880  -->  00:03:36,560
500 dots on that chart.

87

00:03:36,560  -->  00:03:39,320
Alright so that's the smoother and we

88

00:03:39,320  -->  00:03:41,810
will be using smoothers a bit more

89

00:03:41,810  -->  00:03:44,690
throughout this course and actually

90

00:03:44,690  -->  00:03:46,970
actually so now we know where you know

91

00:03:46,970  -->  00:03:50,660
books histograms so that's one way of

92

00:03:50,660  -->  00:03:53,360
statistical analysis and now we know

93

00:03:53,360  -->  00:03:55,880
smoothers, let's look at another one. Let's look

94

00:03:55,880  -->  00:03:59,660
at box plots, alright these are the

95

00:03:59,660  -->  00:04:02,150
favorite type of plus for executives,

96

00:04:02,150  -->  00:04:05,840
they absolutely understand and they like

97

00:04:05,840  -->  00:04:07,970
box plots from my experience.

98

00:04:07,970  -->  00:04:11,630
Alright so let's say u is going to be

99

00:04:11,630  -->  00:04:14,240
ggplot what are going to do this time?

100

00:04:14,240  -->  00:04:15,500
This time is going to be different, we're

101

00:04:15,500  -->  00:04:18,500
going to say data equals movies and

102

00:04:18,500  -->  00:04:20,299
then we're going to say aesthetics and

103

00:04:20,299  -->  00:04:22,430
instead of aesthetics we're going to say x equals

104

00:04:22,430  -->  00:04:24,080
so the bottom axis the horizontal

105

00:04:24,080  -->  00:04:26,180
actually going to be genre, that's

106

00:04:26,180  -->  00:04:26,780
going to be

107

00:04:26,780  -->  00:04:29,030
a categorical variable, y equals

108

00:04:29,030  -->  00:04:33,050
audience rating and color is going

109

00:04:33,050  -->  00:04:36,290
to be genre as well, so everything is pretty

110

00:04:36,290  -->  00:04:38,060
much the same just we're changing the

111

00:04:38,060  -->  00:04:40,580
bottom variable to from critic rating to

112

00:04:40,580  -->  00:04:43,310
genre. Let's run that and now we're

113

00:04:43,310  -->  00:04:46,520
going to say u plus geom with what you

114

00:04:46,520  -->  00:04:47,510
think it's going to be? It's going to be

115

00:04:47,510  -->  00:04:51,200
box plot so if I run that, viola!

116

00:04:51,200  -->  00:04:53,960
Simple as that, we get a box plot already,

117

00:04:53,960  -->  00:04:54,950
right away.

118

00:04:54,950  -->  00:04:57,230
Alright and now I'm going to say u

119

00:04:57,230  -->  00:05:01,910
plus geom box plots then size equals 1.2,

120

00:05:01,910  -->  00:05:04,520
I'm gonna increase the size,

121

00:05:04,520  -->  00:05:07,190
ok so I wanted to say right away here

122

00:05:07,190  -->  00:05:09,680
that if you are not entirely comfortable

123

00:05:09,680  -->  00:05:12,200
with what box plots are I totally understand

124

00:05:12,200  -->  00:05:15,350
it you know, it takes takes a bit of

125

00:05:15,350  -->  00:05:16,730
studying to understand them pretty well

126

00:05:16,730  -->  00:05:18,290
how they're constructed you know what is

127

00:05:18,290  -->  00:05:20,900
the first quarter 2nd 3rd 4th what's

128

00:05:20,900  -->  00:05:22,760
this line in the middle and what what

129

00:05:22,760  -->  00:05:24,260
are these anomalies around how they

130

00:05:24,260  -->  00:05:27,590
calculate, I'm going to add in a tutorial

131

00:05:27,590  -->  00:05:29,840
at the very end of the course in the it'll be

132

00:05:29,840  -->  00:05:32,180
bonuses tutorial section and I'll add a

133

00:05:32,180  -->  00:05:35,360
tutorial on box plots from one of my

134

00:05:35,360  -->  00:05:38,000
other courses just so that you can go in

135

00:05:38,000  -->  00:05:40,580
and check it out and learn box plot

136

00:05:40,580  -->  00:05:42,950
once and for all. So go ahead and do that

137

00:05:42,950  -->  00:05:44,450
if you would like to learn a bit more

138

00:05:44,450  -->  00:05:45,710
about box plots.

139

00:05:45,710  -->  00:05:47,990
It's they're pretty handy and definitely

140

00:05:47,990  -->  00:05:50,150
can help you out sometimes when you're

141

00:05:50,150  -->  00:05:52,340
presenting or when you doing some

142

00:05:52,340  -->  00:05:53,030
analysis.

143

00:05:53,030  -->  00:05:54,560
Alright so now we're going to just

144

00:05:54,560  -->  00:05:56,330
continue with our box plots so there we

145

00:05:56,330  -->  00:05:58,610
go, we've changed the size now let's add

146

00:05:58,610  -->  00:06:01,310
some point so let's copy that and here we're

147

00:06:01,310  -->  00:06:04,160
going to say plus geom point, so we're

148

00:06:04,160  -->  00:06:07,130
going to combine box plots and points so

149

00:06:07,130  -->  00:06:08,660
that's another layer we're at it we've

150

00:06:08,660  -->  00:06:10,610
got one layer now we're adding a second

151

00:06:10,610  -->  00:06:13,130
layer. Let's run that haha

152

00:06:13,130  -->  00:06:15,979
there are our dots beautiful actually

153

00:06:15,979  -->  00:06:18,200
not that beautiful because this is not

154

00:06:18,200  -->  00:06:21,979
pretty like you can really doesn't add

155

00:06:21,979  -->  00:06:24,200
any value to this truck that's why

156

00:06:24,200  -->  00:06:26,810
there's a trick and I'm going to show it

157

00:06:26,810  -->  00:06:29,990
you know. It's gonna it's a tip or a hack

158

00:06:29,990  -->  00:06:32,330
for you so I'm going to do the same,

159

00:06:32,330  -->  00:06:34,789
box plot but instead of geom point, I'm

160

00:06:34,789  -->  00:06:37,820
going to say geom_jitter and what

161

00:06:37,820  -->  00:06:39,820
jitter does is it

162

00:06:39,820  -->  00:06:41,800
synthetically or just throws the point

163

00:06:41,800  -->  00:06:44,380
around. It does is this the jitter comes

164

00:06:44,380  -->  00:06:45,790
from nowhere, it's just like a random

165

00:06:45,790  -->  00:06:49,270
chaotic thing that R does for you, just

166

00:06:49,270  -->  00:06:51,250
throws these points around. So if I rerun

167

00:06:51,250  -->  00:06:52,660
this you'll see that they end up in

168

00:06:52,660  -->  00:06:54,460
different point in different areas every

169

00:06:54,460  -->  00:06:57,460
time but basically it aids the I. It helps you

170

00:06:57,460  -->  00:06:59,290
see the data better now you can actually

171

00:06:59,290  -->  00:07:01,450
see all ok that's what the box plot

172

00:07:01,450  -->  00:07:03,640
means. Alright so you know who you're

173

00:07:03,640  -->  00:07:05,350
presenting to will actually appreciate

174

00:07:05,350  -->  00:07:07,270
that are there's more points in here or

175

00:07:07,270  -->  00:07:08,800
yeah that's true like most of these

176

00:07:08,800  -->  00:07:10,510
brown points do fall in the box and then

177

00:07:10,510  -->  00:07:11,980
there's only a couple here, a couple here

178

00:07:11,980  -->  00:07:14,440
and so on and then the outliers that

179

00:07:14,440  -->  00:07:16,870
much better presented and so on so a

180

00:07:16,870  -->  00:07:18,970
jitter is a very powerful tool when you

181

00:07:18,970  -->  00:07:21,790
use it in combination or box plots so note

182

00:07:21,790  -->  00:07:23,500
that down that that's a good combination

183

00:07:23,500  -->  00:07:27,280
I think and another way to present this

184

00:07:27,280  -->  00:07:30,430
so this is one way to visualize it

185

00:07:30,430  -->  00:07:33,010
another way which I personally prefer is

186

00:07:33,010  -->  00:07:35,560
to put the points first so we say you

187

00:07:35,560  -->  00:07:38,500
plus geom underscore jitter and then

188

00:07:38,500  -->  00:07:42,760
we say plus geom remember if we change

189

00:07:42,760  -->  00:07:45,160
layers then there you know which one is

190

00:07:45,160  -->  00:07:47,020
on top which on the bottom also changes

191

00:07:47,020  -->  00:07:49,780
which says size because of 1.2, so if we run

192

00:07:49,780  -->  00:07:52,570
this the points are gone right so the

193

00:07:52,570  -->  00:07:54,370
boxes are on top but the point I got so

194

00:07:54,370  -->  00:07:55,840
what we're going to do now is we're

195

00:07:55,840  -->  00:07:58,690
going to make the boxes half-transparent.

196

00:07:58,690  -->  00:08:01,750
We're going to say alpha equals 0.5 so alpha is in charge

197

00:08:01,750  -->  00:08:03,130
as we know alpha is in charge of

198

00:08:03,130  -->  00:08:06,880
transparency, so 0-1, 1 is opaque. 0 is

199

00:08:06,880  -->  00:08:09,370
transparent, so here we're going to say

200

00:08:09,370  -->  00:08:13,750
0.5 and now personally I like this style

201

00:08:13,750  -->  00:08:16,000
more I can see that the boxes are on top

202

00:08:16,000  -->  00:08:19,060
and the points so the point is you feel

203

00:08:19,060  -->  00:08:20,440
like the point where you there and then

204

00:08:20,440  -->  00:08:23,200
somebody can put the boxes on top and I

205

00:08:23,200  -->  00:08:26,440
think that's much better to present in

206

00:08:26,440  -->  00:08:27,250
that way.

207

00:08:27,250  -->  00:08:28,630
So there we go that's going to be our

208

00:08:28,630  -->  00:08:31,150
shark number six.

209

00:08:31,150  -->  00:08:34,150
Let's go ahead and export it what do we

210

00:08:34,150  -->  00:08:37,450
usually do that and then that so I'm a

211

00:08:37,450  -->  00:08:42,320
preview, save and let's take it

212

00:08:42,320  -->  00:08:45,050
okay two more to go. We've got that

213

00:08:45,050  -->  00:08:47,390
executive one and then we've got one

214

00:08:47,390  -->  00:08:50,090
more which we actually like to the

215

00:08:50,090  -->  00:08:52,010
bottom of the histogram which we wanted

216

00:08:52,010  -->  00:08:54,140
to fix up. Alright so that looks pretty

217

00:08:54,140  -->  00:08:56,660
cool I I kind of like how this box plot looks

218

00:08:56,660  -->  00:08:59,660
and well of course we didn't we've

219

00:08:59,660  -->  00:09:01,220
created the plot but we didn't talk

220

00:09:01,220  -->  00:09:02,030
through it.

221

00:09:02,030  -->  00:09:03,440
What do we see from here? Well we see

222

00:09:03,440  -->  00:09:06,800
that I am based on the genre, so you

223

00:09:06,800  -->  00:09:08,990
can see where the mean is so what is the

224

00:09:08,990  -->  00:09:11,120
most statistically likely rating that

225

00:09:11,120  -->  00:09:13,520
movie will get so I random movie that

226

00:09:13,520  -->  00:09:15,890
just throw into this environment into

227

00:09:15,890  -->  00:09:18,140
the world to create a movie and

228

00:09:18,140  -->  00:09:19,940
depending on the genre you can kind of

229

00:09:19,940  -->  00:09:21,380
guess if it's going to be an average

230

00:09:21,380  -->  00:09:23,600
movies, going to be somewhere around its

231

00:09:23,600  -->  00:09:26,060
peers you'll see what's rating it is

232

00:09:26,060  -->  00:09:27,470
likely to get the audience so it's an

233

00:09:27,470  -->  00:09:28,880
action movie it's probably going to get

234

00:09:28,880  -->  00:09:31,670
somewhere on looks like what does it

235

00:09:31,670  -->  00:09:34,730
look like 60 maybe 57 or something out

236

00:09:34,730  -->  00:09:36,770
if its invention I get a bit higher

237

00:09:36,770  -->  00:09:38,960
rating so the highest rating you're

238

00:09:38,960  -->  00:09:42,050
probably going to get with a thriller

239

00:09:42,050  -->  00:09:45,500
right? It's got this the most the

240

00:09:45,500  -->  00:09:48,770
narrowest box so it means the variance

241

00:09:48,770  -->  00:09:51,170
is very low and you're much more likely

242

00:09:51,170  -->  00:09:53,720
to be at over here the lowest as you can

243

00:09:53,720  -->  00:09:55,850
see is with horror movies, So it's very risky

244

00:09:55,850  -->  00:09:59,300
to be in the horror movie business drama

245

00:09:59,300  -->  00:10:00,650
is actually also pretty good

246

00:10:00,650  -->  00:10:03,170
surprisingly so people kind of the like

247

00:10:03,170  -->  00:10:05,870
drama these days as well as the romance

248

00:10:05,870  -->  00:10:06,860
and thriller.

249

00:10:06,860  -->  00:10:09,710
Yeah there we go, that's a box plots and that's

250

00:10:09,710  -->  00:10:11,810
how you read them and that brings us to

251

00:10:11,810  -->  00:10:14,060
the end of tutorial but before we go I

252

00:10:14,060  -->  00:10:15,920
have a mini challenge for you. A

253

00:10:15,920  -->  00:10:19,460
challenge to create boxplots but instead

254

00:10:19,460  -->  00:10:22,310
of audience rating over here create them

255

00:10:22,310  -->  00:10:25,010
for the critic rating and see what do

256

00:10:25,010  -->  00:10:27,710
you can tell from those boxplots based

257

00:10:27,710  -->  00:10:29,750
on what we've learned today and I look

258

00:10:29,750  -->  00:10:31,889
forward to seeing you next time. Until then,

259

00:10:31,889  -->  00:10:39,950
happy coding.
