Keycloak describes itself as an open source identity management solution.

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.123
In a nutshell, it's a Java-based authentication and authorization server.

3
00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:18.408
It has been around since 2013, has an Apache open source license,

4
00:00:18.408 --> 00:00:21.814
is actively being developed mainly by Red Hat developers,

5
00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:25.823
but also a large active open source community.

6
00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:28.743
There is also a commercial offering, Red Hat SSO,

7
00:00:28.743 --> 00:00:30.732
which is the same product,

8
00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:33.550
but it gives you that additional support from Red Hat

9
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.551
that your organization might need.

10
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.329
Now in my opinion, it has the best documentation and guides,

11
00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.710
which is one of the reasons I like to use it.

12
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.646
It has all the features our application will require and more,

13
00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:49.694
single sign-on, supports all the key protocols,

14
00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:52.264
SAML, OAuth2, OpenID Connect,

15
00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:55.865
integrates with directory services so you can easily

16
00:00:55.865 --> 00:01:00.115
integrate it in your organization, and a multitude of features,

17
00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:03.930
like two-factor authentication, email verification,

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.971
user registration, social sign-in, like Google and Facebook,

19
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:09.294
and much more.

20
00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:11.688
It's also very customizable and extendable.

21
00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:16.504
You can write your own adapters and plugins and even format the login

22
00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:20.303
registration pages to your application's look and feel.

23
00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:24.948
Now I should mention, there is also CloudFoundry UAA Server,

24
00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:28.195
which is also open sourced and is actively developed by Pivotal,

25
00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:32.374
the creator of Spring and actually built with Spring.

26
00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:41.000
It's very similar and is also a good candidate for an authorization server. Next we will look at how to install Keycloak.
