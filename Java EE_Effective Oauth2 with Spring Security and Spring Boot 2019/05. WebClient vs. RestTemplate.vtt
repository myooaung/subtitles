If you have been using Spring for some time now,

2
00:00:04.382 --> 00:00:06.942
you're probably already familiar with the RestTemplate,

3
00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:11.674
which is used to make REST HTTP requests in Spring.

4
00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:14.802
However, if you look at its Java doc,

5
00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:17.622
they're basically saying it will eventually become

6
00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:21.405
deprecated and replaced by WebClient.

7
00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:24.253
And there is actually very limited OAuth support for the

8
00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.338
RestTemplate in Spring Security 5.

9
00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:30.315
The OAuth2 version of the RestTemplate is not a part

10
00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:34.518
of Spring Security as of 5.6 .1.

11
00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:35.207
Hence,

12
00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:37.945
you're probably better off choosing the WebClient over the

13
00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.976
RestTemplate going forward as WebClient can be used in both

14
00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:45.154
reactive and traditional web MVC applications.

15
00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:49.254
It supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests.

16
00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:54.002
By simply using the block, it will behave just like the RestTemplate.

17
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:55.049
In the next sections,

18
00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:01.000
I will demonstrate how to use both to implement token relay and client credentials.
