Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02.403 --> 00:00:08.409
My name is Wojciech Lesniak.

3
00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:14.463
Welcome to my course, Effective OAuth2 with Spring Security and Spring Boot.

4
00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:16.058
OAuth2, OpenID Connect,

5
00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:21.659
and JSON Web Tokens make it easy for your users and services

6
00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.866
to securely access your application without having to

7
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.209
remember or provide their passwords.

8
00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:33.459
That's powerful and can significantly improve user experience,

9
00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:38.680
streamline your registration process, and make your application more secure.

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.886
In this course,

11
00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:43.546
we are going to dive into Spring Boot and Spring Security

12
00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:46.726
5's support for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

13
00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:52.485
Some of the major topics we will cover include what JSON Web Tokens,

14
00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.004
OAuth2,

15
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:57.750
and OpenID Connect is and is not and what security

16
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.051
challenges they can help you solve,

17
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:03.674
how to add social sign-in to complement your

18
00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:05.391
application's existing authentication,

19
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:10.529
how to secure both public and confidential clients,

20
00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:13.654
securing distributed systems and the various

21
00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:16.839
microservices patterns you can leverage.

22
00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:21.539
By the end of this course, you'll have the foundational knowledge of OAuth2,

23
00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:22.382
OpenID Connect,

24
00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:26.348
and JWT and the practical knowledge of how to implement it in your

25
00:01:26.348 --> 00:01:30.144
application in Spring Boot and Spring Security.

26
00:01:30.144 --> 00:01:31.671
Before beginning the course,

27
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.749
you should be familiar with Java and the Spring framework.

28
00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:39.223
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Spring Security

29
00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:50.000
OAuth2 with the Effective OAuth2 with Spring Security and Spring Boot course at Pluralsight.
