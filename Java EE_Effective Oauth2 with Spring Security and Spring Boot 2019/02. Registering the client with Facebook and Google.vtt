00:00:01.956 --> 00:00:05.525
Facebook is not an OpenID Connect provider.

2
00:00:05.525 --> 00:00:08.439
They have their own implementation of Facebook Connect.

3
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.751
So we will need to use the OAuth2 flow.

4
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:16.858
Facebook will play the role of the authorization server and resource server,

5
00:00:16.858 --> 00:00:19.637
and Crypto Portfolio will be the client.

6
00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:23.781
If you recall back to the OAuth2 flow in the previous module,

7
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:26.713
we need a client id and client secret.

8
00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:31.566
Hence, we need to first register our application with Facebook.

9
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.699
We can do this by Facebook developers.

10
00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.275
Once registered, select create new app.

11
00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:42.245
Enter the display name and click Create App ID.

12
00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:47.715
Select Integrate with Facebook Login, then in PRODUCTS Facebook Login,

13
00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:50.373
Quickstart, select Web.

14
00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:52.234
Put in your site URL.

15
00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:54.908
Since we are in dev, we can use localhost.

16
00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:56.012
Save and Continue.

17
00:00:56.012 --> 00:01:01.126
There is some very useful info on the API, which is worth a read.

18
00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:04.692
Now under Settings, Basic, there is an App ID,

19
00:01:04.692 --> 00:01:09.154
which is your client id and the client secret.

20
00:01:09.154 --> 00:01:11.415
You can click Show to see it.

21
00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:14.915
We now have a client id and client secret.

22
00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:18.378
For Google, you can register with Google API.

23
00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.791
I go through how to do that in my previous course,

24
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.654
Spring Security Authentication and Authorization in the module for OAuth.

25
00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:28.039
So check that out if you want to do that.

26
00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.179
Now this is an important point.

27
00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.540
Keep your secret safe!

28
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.533
If it gets leaked,

29
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:37.714
a malicious site could masquerade as yours potentially gaining access

30
00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:40.602
to your users' Facebook resources and your site.

31
00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:49.000
So now that we have the client ID and secret, let's configure the application next.
