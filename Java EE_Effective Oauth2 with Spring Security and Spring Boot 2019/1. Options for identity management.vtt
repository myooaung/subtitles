00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.350
Now when it comes to authorization servers, you have a number of options.

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.541
You could build your own.

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:09.471
Spring provides a framework for you to do this.

4
00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:12.238
You could go for an out-of-the-box solution.

5
00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:16.074
There are many products from commercial to open source available.

6
00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:20.174
Or you can go with an identity as a service provider.

7
00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:23.264
Now there are pros and cons from each approach.

8
00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:24.819
And from my experience,

9
00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.453
an out-of-the-box solution or an identity provider as a

10
00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:31.830
service is probably the best way to go.

11
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.331
Building an authorization server from the ground up is a lot of work,

12
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:38.459
and it's not easy to get right.

13
00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.780
However,

14
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.654
I will go over how you'd go about creating one with Spring

15
00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:50.000
Security and then show you an open source, out-of-the-box solution with Keycloak.
