00:00:01.937 --> 00:00:03.640
Currently in our application,

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.774
we have users Joe and Dave and a service account portfolio service.

3
00:00:10.774 --> 00:00:14.111
The portfolio service should be the only client with

4
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:16.723
access to the pricing service.

5
00:00:16.723 --> 00:00:21.676
So let's create a new scope called pricing and only allow access to

6
00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:25.909
the pricing service to clients with that scope.

7
00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:34.332
In our Keycloak admin console under Client Scopes, select Create.

8
00:00:34.332 --> 00:00:35.518
Fill the form in.

9
00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:41.351
This will be for a non- human resource owner, so we don't need consent.

10
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:41.988
Save.

11
00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:45.171
One more scope for administration.

12
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:49.055
Call it portfolio-service-admin.

13
00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:52.874
Now to add the pricing scope to the token created

14
00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:58.628
by the portfolio service client, navigate to the client,

15
00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:00.131
select scopes.

16
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:02.772
You can either add it as default,

17
00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:06.691
meaning it will always be added to the token for this client without them

18
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:11.114
having to request it during the authorization or optional,

19
00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:14.329
meaning the client will have to specify that they want

20
00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.126
this scope in the authorization request.

21
00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:20.471
Let's put it in as optional.

22
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:23.622
Let's do the same for the portfolio service admin scope,

23
00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:27.635
but added to the crypto- portfolio client.

24
00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:28.480
Hence,

25
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.101
only users who authenticate via the MVC application will be

26
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:38.243
allowed to access the admin features.

27
00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:40.539
If they log in via the React client,

28
00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.978
they won't have the appropriate scope even if the

29
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:46.562
resource owner has the admin role.

30
00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:52.144
Next, let's create an admin role for the Crypto Portfolio clients.

31
00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:56.920
On the client page, Roles, Add Role.

32
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.112
Name it portfolio-admin.

33
00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:06.802
Now to include the roles in the access token, we can create a mapper.

34
00:02:06.802 --> 00:02:11.845
Create new, token claim name to roles.

35
00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:15.047
This would be the key of the new attribute.

36
00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:18.067
The value will be a collection of roles.

37
00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:20.568
Now that the roles and scopes are configured,

38
00:02:20.568 --> 00:02:25.239
let's create an admin user, Victoria.

39
00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.358
Let's fill in the form and the credentials,

40
00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:33.524
give her a password, and assign her the portfolio-admin role.

41
00:02:33.524 --> 00:02:41.000
Okay, all set. Next, let's use these roles and scopes in our application.
