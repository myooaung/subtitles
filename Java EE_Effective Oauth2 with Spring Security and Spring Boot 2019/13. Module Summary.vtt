00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:09.730
credentials using their Google or Facebook accounts.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.142
However,

4
00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:13.382
the application is still handling and storing user

5
00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.404
passwords and their personal details.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:17.089
In the next module,

7
00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:25.000
we will look at setting up our own authorization server and configuring our application to use it.
