00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.410
Hello and welcome actually a course on computer vision.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.070
And today we're talking about the multi box concept behind the as the algorithm.

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:17.290
This is going to be quite a visual tutorial so there we have Avalon standing on a pontoon at Lake Bonynge

4
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.280
in Slovenia just as a side note if you're ever in Sylvania or around there definitely visit lake behind.

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.900
It's a beautiful magical place as you can see it's it's amazing there.

6
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.380
There's also those the Alps behind you is really great to have a lookout tower there.

7
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.950
You can actually go up and see all that like a huge part of Alps from up there.

8
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.210
Very lovely We were there during our European road trip when we are visiting students all across Europe.

9
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.070
And is there any great stuff.

10
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.250
They have two big lakes and Savannah Lake Bled and Lake voyage and this is like Boeing's bigger one.

11
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.450
It's a bit further away from the main cities but it is worth the trip.

12
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.180
And so as you can see we're very guilty posture on identifying him as a person that he's standing there

13
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.240
pointing.

14
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.710
And what we're going to do today is we're going to take this pork's as the ground troops and then we're

15
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.440
going to see how the the Allegan works with its own boxes to understand to actually identify ODLAND

16
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.930
and build this same exact box.

17
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.130
And first things first.

18
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.390
What is the ground truth.

19
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.310
Well a ground truth is a concept that's not just using computers is used in many places and it separates

20
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.240
the observed evidence or empirical evidence from inferred evidence.

21
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.330
So for instance when you go and actually look at something and you see something and you can physically

22
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.510
understand that this is a true state of things that's your ground truth there.

23
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.000
There is no two ways about it.

24
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.400
No there's no gray areas as you can see exactly that this is the box that should be wrong.

25
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.220
Whereas when you apply an algorithm and it goes processes all of this data through its convolutional

26
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.180
neural networks and so on and comes back with boxes those are not going to be ground truth boxes those

27
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.860
are going to be inferred boxes those are going to be suggestion brought up by our group even if they're

28
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.260
correct they're still merely suggestions and in order to make sure that they're correct we need to have

29
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.260
the ground truth.

30
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:33.760
And that's why in the process of training these networks the D-Fla. in particular we need the ground

31
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.020
true.

32
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.420
So we need these boxes to be identified we cannot just train the algorithm.

33
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.940
If these boxes are not present in the first place that's something important to keep in mind for that

34
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.120
training process.

35
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.850
And yeah so there is a lull.

36
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.020
Let's see how the algorithm will work and build its boxes and how the training will happen.

37
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.420
So what this is they will do is will break down the image into segments and then for every segment it

38
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.710
will construct several boxes will construct the box like that looks like that and a box like that for

39
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.940
for instance so these exact exact set up can vary.

40
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.790
But we're going to stick to this one this is the most generic one and basically the whole image will

41
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.840
get covered with these boxes.

42
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.600
As you can see it's covered entirely.

43
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:36.590
And then for every single one of these boxes is going to ask the question is there an object in there

44
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:45.140
or not and not just an object is to ask that question every single class of objects that it's it's trained

45
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.860
for or in the training processes that is going to ask that question for every single class of all that

46
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.540
it is training for.

47
00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:03.590
And so basically in this case it will identify that none of these boxes except for the ones highlighted

48
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.430
in red actually have an object of interest and then we're going to assume that in this case for simplicity's

49
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.010
sake they we're only looking for people.

50
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.780
There are people in the background there but they're very small.

51
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.060
And the algorithm will not be able to pick up their features and therefore will not detect those people.

52
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.090
I will talk about size and scale further down and inch and others Tauriel in the section for now which

53
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.880
is going to focus in on Lot and we can see that some of the boxes have picked up some features of a

54
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.620
human being in that current form.

55
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.310
So if we remove all that let's just look at one box just so that it's clear why for instance this box

56
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.350
is able to pick up that there is a person within this box or it doesn't have to be a full person.

57
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.910
This is what I wanted to point out here doesn't have to be a fool personal object as long as it can

58
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.930
find a sufficient number of features it will produce a probability it will say that with a likelihood

59
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.470
of 80 percent or 70 percent.

60
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.120
What I have in this box is the human being or as a car or as a both or as a cat or a dog.

61
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.820
So in this case it sees enough features to say that there is a human or a person inside this box.

62
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.260
And then all of these ones that we have identified here can see the same almost the same features and

63
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:29.360
they're very different features but nevertheless they all have enough identify each with a green one

64
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.180
you can see that that green one for instance.

65
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.660
It can it only sees from the elbow downwards.

66
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:42.260
So just for the sake of this tutorial I decided to assume that it's not seeing enough features although

67
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.770
as you'll see from the practical side of things that is actually that would be enough features for the

68
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.120
S's algorithm to detect a human being.

69
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.400
But just for our case I just wanted to show you that not always these three boxes like you can see that

70
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.890
the boxes come in threes.

71
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.070
In our case that does not always tally.

72
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.420
So if one of them takes a person that doesn't mean all the time.

73
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.150
So in this case that would be draw.

74
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.260
And so far we have not six but five officers that have to take that approach.

75
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.900
And so that is the ideal case and that's what we're striving towards.

76
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.050
That's what we want to train the next hope to do.

77
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.730
And the way it will happen is here's our network.

78
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.520
And every time all of these boxes predict something we'll have an output so I'll bring them out here

79
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.490
so for instance they'll look at these small areas.

80
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.720
For now we'll talk about them later.

81
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.670
We're dealing with this layer over here and so we've got all these boxes and they all predict something.

82
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:46.340
And so then the on neural network searches for features that predicts that for instance in these boxes

83
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.410
in these boxes that there's a human that's what we want.

84
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.210
But for example if it had predicted that there is in these boxes as a human or in these boxes a human

85
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.040
and then on the other hand it predicted that some of these boxes don't have a human at the end would

86
00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.900
have an error.

87
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.250
How would we have this error because we actually have the ground truth.

88
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.940
We have the ground truth with this white box and we would actually know by overlaying these images the

89
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.250
algorithm knows exactly which boxes should say yes there is a human.

90
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.570
And which boxes should say no.

91
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.960
So it really knows the way what we did actually here is with the red boxes are the ones that I ideally

92
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.510
should say there's a human and we want them to say human and all other boxes which we've deleted should

93
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.760
say there is no human there is no person.

94
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.090
And so unless that is the case there will be an error.

95
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.830
So if say for instance a box or here says that there is a human and a box or a says that there is a

96
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.110
human and one or a couple of these boxes don't pick up the humans there'll be an error.

97
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.990
And at the end of the algorithm that error can be calculated and can be expressed mathematically we

98
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.670
don't get into that that you can find more information on that in the annex on convolutional neural

99
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.160
networks.

100
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.190
But basically that area can be expressed and then what will happen with that error is will be back propagated

101
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.590
through the network as is just a visual representation of the to this point just back propagate through

102
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:10.940
a network and the weights of the network will be updated in order to better accommodate that so that

103
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.430
next time this box won't predict a human and this box will predict a human.

104
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.310
But these boxes will predict the.

105
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.770
So it takes many iterations is going to happen on and on and on and on but that's how the training process

106
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.250
goes.

107
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:29.600
And so the important thing here to remember is that we unlike just simple convolutional neural networks

108
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.520
where we just want to predict if there's a dog on the if there's not a dog in this case we actually

109
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.700
need to find where on the image there is a person and so that we need a ground truth.

110
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.580
So it's not sufficient for us as for this image itself to be labeled that there is a person or there

111
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.600
is not a person.

112
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.520
No that's not enough.

113
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:55.590
We have to know exactly where the person is so we need this box already on the image for the training

114
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.160
process.

115
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.860
And the way to think about it kind of a very intuitive way of thinking about it is take each one of

116
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.150
these boxes as a separate.

117
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:11.850
They think of each one of these boxes as a separate example of the convolutional neural network.

118
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.370
In practice if you think of each one of these boxes as a separate image that's one.

119
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:23.610
If you take each one of these boxes as a separate image then yes then you that that kind of is very

120
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.770
similar to a convolutional in your own codes because for each one of the boxes you just need to make

121
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.500
sure it predicts that there is a human inside this box.

122
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.840
And you also need to know for the purpose of this that indeed there was a human side as well.

123
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.000
So that's the ground truth in that case.

124
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.180
So that's how it works.

125
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:46.210
Like basically all of those boxes that we saw around that were built plotted around the image.

126
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.730
You just can think of them as separate images in their own right.

127
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:55.690
And each one is trying to understand is there a human inside my image or is it or not it's human an

128
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.340
image and doesn't care about the rest.

129
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:03.860
But then the algorithm puts everything together on the hands and it takes the aggregate error propagates

130
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.190
and network and trains everything up like that.

131
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.710
So there we go that's the multi box concept of the essence the algorithm.

132
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.870
And we will continue that etc..

133
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.280
I look forward to seeing you there.

134
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.490
And until then enjoy computer vision.
