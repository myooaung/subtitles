00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,240
Hello and welcome back to module one face recognition you had your intuition lectures with Curiel to

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,040
understand how Cascades work.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:13,830
So now we're going to put them into action and we're going to put them into action to do some face recognition

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,440
and we're going to do it through the web cam that is that I'm going to put on my web cam and we're going

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,310
to try to protect my face and my eyes and some extra stuff that will be for the homework but that's

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,310
what we'll be doing we'll be working with the Cascades that is with open city to do this face recognition.

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,790
So as you can see I launched my spider in my virtual platform environment which is a virtual environment.

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,010
And now the first thing we have to do when launching spider is to find the right folder because this

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,160
folder is going to contain the Cascades ex-MIL.

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,090
And so we need to be in this folder because we will be calling the Cascades to execute our code.

11
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,420
So let's do that right now we're going to go to File Explorer and we're going to go to our computer

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,130
vision A.D.C. folder which is right now on my desktop.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,870
So you go into this folder and you go to module one face recognition the first module of discours.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,970
So I'm very excited to start this.

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,390
And actually right now I want to tell you that the more we evolve in the course the more the models

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,150
will be working with will be powerful and that means that actually open city is great but it's definitely

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,730
not the most powerful models of discourse and of the virtual platform that some of you might have noticed

18
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,470
that it is no longer in development.

19
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,740
We have some much better models today we will see that with object detection for object detection we'll

20
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,870
be using something much more powerful than open city.

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,690
I will let you find out about the surprise but still open city is going to do some great stuff here

22
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,150
for face recognition.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,260
But keep in mind that you should really follow the course until the end because we will be working with

24
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,660
some much more powerful models.

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,730
But let's start with open city.

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,140
So this is the right folder.

27
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,910
Make sure that you're in the right folder.

28
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,290
And now I'm quickly going to describe the folder.

29
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,170
So we have four files.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,280
The first file is the code that we're about to implement right now but the connected version of the

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,610
code.

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,620
So if you open this file you will have each line of the code commented.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,410
So that's in case you don't have time to watch the video.

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,010
But really I strongly recommend to watch the video because I will be seeing much more than the comments

35
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,440
and this is actually this face recognition that bites and fowl.

36
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,250
And this is actually where we're going to implement the code.

37
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,890
Then we have the cascade for the eye.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,900
That's the cascade that we'll use to detect the eyes and the web.

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,700
That is my eyes.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,750
But you will use the code to detect your eyes too.

41
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,770
And the cascade to detect the face.

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,090
So these are X-amount files that's not very important.

43
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,120
But this is what we'll use from open city to do these face protections.

44
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,020
So there we go that's the folder.

45
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,700
Make sure that you have all these files.

46
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,900
And now we're going to start.

47
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,120
So as you can see there is this first code section here in the libraries.

48
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:10,110
And of course the only library that we need here is open city and that is silly to say Make sure you

49
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,260
import too.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,770
I'm going to execute the whole code in the end but make sure that you import 3:2 that's entirely compulsory.

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,280
And the reason why we don't import much more is that actually we're not doing some deep learning here.

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,000
If you noticed in the intuition lectures the Cascades are actually not some neural networks.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,110
There is a deep series of filters but this is not a series of layers so open city cascades are not based

54
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,460
on any neural networks.

55
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,460
And that's why for open city we don't need to import any neural network libraries like the torched libraries

56
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,180
or tenso flow or anything.

57
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,240
We just need open city.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,800
And what we need from open city is mainly the Cascades.

59
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,470
And that is exactly what we're going to do now.

60
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,910
We're going to be loading the Cascades one cascade for the face and one cascade for the eyes and to

61
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:06,090
do this we're going to create two objects because these are going to be some objects of some class that

62
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,920
is called Cascade classifier.

63
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,890
And this class will take as arguments exactly the SML file that contains the cascade.

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,990
So the first object will take an argument while the frontal face cascade and the second object will

65
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,910
take its argument.

66
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,620
I Harker's Kate.

67
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,170
So let's do this.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,750
We're going to create a first object here for the face and we're going to call it face cascade.

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,210
All right so that's the object.

70
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,660
And now since it's an object of some class we need to call the class.

71
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,950
Now this class is actually a class of the CB2 module from the open library.

72
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,170
So what.

73
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:56,600
And here we type the name of the class which is cascade class C fire cascade classifier.

74
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,270
All right.

75
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,530
And as I just said in argument here we just need to put one argument which is the name of the ex-MIL

76
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,620
Harker's Kate.

77
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,690
And since we're starting with a face well we need to put exactly that heart cascade underscore frontal

78
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,080
face underscore default.

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,290
SNL but we need to put that in quotes.

80
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,200
There we go.

81
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:29,900
Let's do that har cascade underscore frontal face underscore default and there we go.

82
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,700
That SNL and that's will import the cascade for the face.

83
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:41,660
So as a reminder the cascade is a series of filters that will apply one after the other to detect the

84
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,770
face.

85
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,750
All right so now we're going to do exactly the same for the eye.

86
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:55,940
So I'm copying this line to be efficient and basic in here and I'm just going to play face Cascades

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,040
by I cascade.

88
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,120
All right.

89
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:06,080
And of course here I need to replace Hargus Cade's frontal face default SNL by hardcase gate.

90
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,340
I am just selecting this and replacing it by.

91
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,440
There we go.

92
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,720
So now we have our two Cascades the cascades of the face and the cascade of the eye so perfect we were

93
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,540
ready to move onto the next code section which will be about implementing a function that will do the

94
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,760
detection itself that will use those cascades to detect the face and the eye.

95
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,740
But you're going to see that there is a little trick which is about computational efficiency and that

96
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,960
is we're going to do the phase detection on the global referential the main differential but we're going

97
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,630
to do the detection and the referential of the face and that will save us some computation time.

98
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,360
All right so let's do that in the next tutorial.

99
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,190
And until then the computer vision.
