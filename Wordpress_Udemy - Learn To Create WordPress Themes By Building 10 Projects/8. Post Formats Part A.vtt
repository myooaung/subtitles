00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.360
You guys in this video are going to be looking at a few different things.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:12.120
OK so we're going to look at post types or post formats now right now if we look at our theme we have

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.980
just basically one kind of post and it's just a standard blog post so we can also have things like Galeries

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:29.010
links images quotes status updates things like that and we can format these different types of posts

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.540
in different ways.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.210
OK so I want to show you how to do that how to add that to our theme.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.260
Also we're going to look at with a function called Get template part and that allows us to stop repeating

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.110
ourselves.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:49.800
For instance if we look in our index page we have this this while have posts and then we're just we're

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.500
just putting our post same thing in the archive.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.650
OK we're doing the same thing here we're doing the same thing in search ph P and so on.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.950
So we want something that's going to stop us from repeating ourselves over and over.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.700
OK.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.280
I know that each of these files have minor changes but we can implement that inside of a specific content

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.140
file.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.280
Ok so I think the best thing to do is to just jump in and show you.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.090
So let's go to index ph P And what we want to look at is everything that is inside of this while loop

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.120
.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:32.580
OK so our post loop and I'm going to just go ahead and grab it all so it's basically that article tagged

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.540
to the ending article tag and we're going to cut that and then I'm going to create a new file and save

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.270
it as content dot ph p.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.830
All right.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.290
And then we're going to just paste that in there.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.910
Let me just bring this back.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.640
All right.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.670
So save that.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.300
And then what we'll do is go back to index and in it's place we're going to say ph P and then we're

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.250
going to use get a template part right.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.470
And then in here we want to pass in the name of the file which we just created which is content.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.870
All right so we'll save that.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.740
Make sure content ph is saved as well.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.770
And if we reload it looks the exact same which is what we want.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.410
OK so now let's take a look at archive PGE.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.030
All right.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.390
So we have some of the same stuff here.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.760
The idea is to get all the everything that's in the while loop into that content file so let's go ahead

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.030
and cut this out.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.650
All right.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.280
And then go to content ph P.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.610
Now this is a little different than what's quite different than what we have for a regular blog posts

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.030
.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.320
All right.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.570
So what we can do is we can use a conditional OK and we can check to see if this is an archive or a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.490
search result page.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.000
All right so to do that we're going to say HP.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.160
And we're going to open up an if statement here.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.930
Actually I'm going to use the shorthand.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.670
We're also going to have an else

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.360
.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.160
All right.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.540
So the if statement it's going to say if is underscore search.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.780
OK so what this what this means is that if we're on a search results page so if we search for something

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.600
and this comes up OK it's checking to see if we're on this page.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.060
All right.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.090
We can also check to see if it's on a category or an archive not just category but any kind of archives

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:59.670
so let's say or is archive all right if this is true then we want to just output what we just copied

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.630
from the archive.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.210
Post page.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.980
All right.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.190
So just like that.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.230
OK.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:18.600
Else if it's not search or archived then we want this we're going to just grab all this and cut and

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.840
then we'll just piece that inside of the else or I save it and then archive.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:35.850
We also want what we put in the index file which is this or copy that piece that right there and save

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.540
.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.280
All right so if we go and we reload the search page it should look the exact same.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.860
All right.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.370
And just to make sure it's coming from the content file just say test load.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.970
OK so that's not giving us a test.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.290
Let's see.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.230
Oh that's because we didn't put it in the search.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.510
We only put it in the archive.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.270
So let's test that first.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.090
OK so if I click on this category name you can see we're getting test.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.790
All right.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.730
So what we want to do is just like we did in the archive where we put this get template part.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.040
We want to copy that and then put that in the search page as well.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.780
All right.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.060
So it's the same exact code as we have here so we can just paste that in.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.350
All right.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.890
And then if we do a search now we get this test.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.620
OK so we know that it's coming from this content page in this conditional.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.380
So save that.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.480
All right so that's all set.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.440
Now we can also implement our content ph P inside of the single as well.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.110
OK because if we look at single we have a lot of the same stuff that we had in the index k we have an

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.350
article tag.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:04.420
I think the only difference is that we're using the excerpt inside of the you know the blog roll.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.250
And also we have the read more link that's not in the single.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:21.330
So what we can do is let's just see we're going to go from the article tag to the ending article tag

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.190
and let's just paste that in the template part.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.620
Save it.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:34.320
Now if we go to a single page now OK it's we lost that that single page formatting.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.670
So what we want to do here is go into the content page page and just add some conditionals where we

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.530
want things to be different.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.080
So for instance the excerpt we want to say ph P if

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.750
.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:07.770
OK so we can say if is single ok if it is single then we want the content

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.430
.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.900
If not then we want the excerpt.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.480
So paste that in and then get rid of that.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.390
OK so let's go back to the single page reload and now we have our content back.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.390
We also want to get rid of this read more.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.350
So let's go down to where that is.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:41.790
And actually we don't even need to do another conditional we can just grab it and put it right here

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.630
.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:42.900
All right.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.730
So then it won't show up on the single page anymore.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.790
So you can see how we've saved ourselves from repeating ourselves.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.370
OK.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.320
So now archive inside the while loop we just have this one line.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:02.910
Same thing with the other pages search single and index.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.380
So now what I want to do is get into the the post formats.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.880
All right so let's add a gallery type.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:17.880
All right so what we want to do is first go to our functions PKP file and we need to enable these these

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.850
different formats that we want to use so we can go right under this really registered the nav menus

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.070
and let's say

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:41.980
post format support and we'll say add theme's support and we want to add post formats.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.210
Right.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.640
And then the second parameter will be an array of the types of formats we want.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:57.940
So I'm going to choose three we're going to take a side gallery and the link.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.280
All right.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.210
And if we look at the documentation
