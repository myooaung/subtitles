00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.900
All right so now we're going to work on the gallery display so the gallery is just going to be a way

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.590
to display posts that are in that category.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.970
All right.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.990
So we're going to do.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.790
We already created the category.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.380
Now I want these.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.930
These posts here that are on the home page to be the ones that are also in gallery.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
So let's go to this post and you can see it's featured.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.100
Let's also make it.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:37.320
Gallery will do the same for the other two.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.260
This one here gallery.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.650
All right.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.780
And then what we're going to do is we're going to go to appearance menus and let's click on categories

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.240
and then click just gallery we're going to check gallery and add to menu.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.030
All right.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.710
We'll put this right here.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.870
So save and as far as the functionality.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.010
It's all set up.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.280
We got a gallery.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.520
You can only see see it's only showing posts that are in the gallery.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.470
But we want to customize the way this looks.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.610
So what we can do is we can create a new file and save it as category dash and then whatever the category

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.830
name is in this case gallery.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.610
All right.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.800
And since I did that.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.780
Now if we go and reload we get a blank page.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.520
OK let's copy what we have in index and paste it there.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.450
OK and then what we're going to do is change this H-1 to gallery and you can put whatever text you want

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.540
here for the gallery or just remove it.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.250
And then we're going to change this query around.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:59.310
Let's change this to gallery query and we're going to change this to category name which is going to

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.920
be in gallery and get rid of this or replace this actually

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.630
.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.280
All right.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.200
And then and here what we're going to do is get rid of this whole article

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.600
and this is actually going to be very simple.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.730
I'm just going to paste this in.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.430
All right so we just have a div.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.190
It's going to be a four column div and it's going to have the thumb thumbnail.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.860
It's going to be full size.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.580
And we're going to add the class HPR grow for the hover CSSA animation.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.910
All right.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.930
So let's save that and go back and reload and then we have our gallery images.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.490
And let's actually wrap this in a section

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.520
and I'll give it a class of gallery

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.140
and see that Will.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.600
And here

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.540
we go.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.550
And these shouldn't be here.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.630
All right.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.580
So I think that's it.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.750
God is we have our four corners theme.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.290
You know it's pretty simple but I think it's pretty clean and elegant and yeah.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.430
So that's it.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.940
All right.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.890
Hopefully you guys liked this project and they'll see you in the next one.
