00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.370
All right congratulations you finished the Wordpress theme Project series.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.860
Now you have 10 WordPress themes under your belt which is something to be proud of where I wanted to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.460
do now just go through and touch on what we learned in each theme project.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.070
So the simple theme was really just an introduction to theme building.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.850
We looked at a lot of the different syntax and what files to create.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.360
We set up an install WordPress.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.150
We looked at that the dynamic code that we can use in the head tag we looked at the Main Post loop and

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
also how to set up widgets.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.400
The advanced team week we took it up a notch and we created the design beforehand and we created just

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.600
a regular age html template and then kind of converted it into a WordPress theme.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.670
We looked more at the navigation bar and pages.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.230
We created pages for archived posts and search posts or search results post formats.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.140
I showed you how to create a custom home page and also how to create a comments template and style that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.120
photo gallery theme we use the W3 CSSA framework.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.610
We had a little bit of animation using that framework.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.840
Photo Gallery post layout.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.770
OK so we basically formatted post to look like what you would find in a photo gallery and also category

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.400
widgets.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.020
I showed you how we can use widgets and actually override the code and add stuff to them.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.810
All right so the word word strap theme was a Twitter bootstrap theme that we kind of converted into

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.100
a WordPress theme.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.790
We use the Nav. Walker menue class which allowed us to use dropdown as the bootstrap elements such as

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.520
nav bar panels list groups.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.300
We integrate integrated these as well.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.480
The Commerce theme we use the foundation framework we use the theme customized to be able to upload

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.970
a custom logo.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.420
We had our posts were formatted as as product based and then we had a custom showcase widget that we

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.230
built from scratch.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.060
OK so the business theme was very clean.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.650
It was an elegant design.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.040
This is where we really jumped into the W.P. customize or API and it showed you how to implement the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.500
customized settings in the theme.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.910
We also used fun awesome for nice icons.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.350
So the clean cut theme we use Twitter bootstrap.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.450
We had a large customizable Showcase area we could use the theme customize or for that social icon customisation

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.240
we could add our profile links and so forth.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.540
And we also used animate dots CSSA to give us some nice intro animations.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.560
WP news was a news based theme we use the ink framework which gave us a lot of cool things including

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.020
some J Querrey widgets.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:09.120
We also use custom queries using WP queery the four corners theme was a nice elegant looking theme we

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.690
had a custom page home layout.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.110
We used custom queries of course using WP Querrey.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.440
We also use the hover dot CSSA library to give us some nice hover animation especially in the gallery

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.350
.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.750
The dynamo theme was was pretty customizable we use the grid Asom grid framework.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:37.080
We used an slider which was a slide show component and we made it so that we could assign post to a

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.980
slide show category and have them automatically show up there.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.010
Same thing with the jey query tabs we could take a category and make turn those posts into tabs in the

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.930
on the front page and then we implemented some color customization where we could choose a preset either

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.790
light or dark and then we could also change the color scheme.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.260
OK so those are the 10 projects.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.600
I really hope you guys learned a lot.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.720

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.860
