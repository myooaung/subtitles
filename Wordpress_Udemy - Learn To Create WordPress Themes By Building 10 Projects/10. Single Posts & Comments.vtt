00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.560
So in this video we're going to take care of some of the other post pages.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.270
So the single page if I click read more the single page looks like this which we don't want.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:20.100
All right so let's go and create a new file in our theme folder and we're going to save this as a single

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.920
dot page.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.670
All right.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.300
Now if we go and we reload this page it's going to be completely blank.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.450
All right.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.350
And what we're going to do is go to our index Pietsch p.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.020
We're going to copy everything there and then pasted in single.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.260
OK.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.310
Now with this single we want this the title bar to have the title of the actual article of the post

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.590
.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.160
So we want the while loop to go way up here.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.220
All right so let's take this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:07.590
cut it and then put that up at the top right here.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.880
And then what we can do is just take this out and just say the title.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.890
OK then we'll go back down here and we're not going to want the 5 column and 7 column layout.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640
We want it all to be in one column.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.930
So let's change this at 12.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.420
Actually you know what we don't even need that.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.760
Let's get rid of that and then get rid of the that div.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.130
Actually no we want that.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.510
That goes with the post.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.570
Now let's see.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.720
We don't want to read more.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.730
OK this can get rid of that 7 column div.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.840
This ends here.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.210
We can get rid of that.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.840
OK so we have the thumbnail then we have the matter.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.100
Then we have this title we don't need that.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.670
So will put a line break right here and then this is going to be the content.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.970
OK let's check that out.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.990
OK.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.840
So looks good.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.160
You see we have the title of the post right here.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.260
Now we're not going to get to the comments just yet.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.510
We'll do that later on.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.630
So now I want to do the archive page for click on let's say business we want business to be to show

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.760
up right here.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.880
So what we can do is create a new file in our theme called archive

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.870
archive.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.810
P.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.450
And then we'll copy what's in index

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.190
place that in and all I really want to change is that the titlebar up here.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.670
So in this H-1

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.140
I'm going to paste in a big piece of code.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.940
OK we've used this in past projects.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.140
We'll see if it's a category archive if it is we'll put out the title.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.030
If it's an author We're going to put out that.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440
And so on.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.630
So save it go back to our archive page reload and now it says business.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.970
If I click on the user admin we get this OK.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.870
So yeah that's good.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.960
And I guess we could do the comments.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.890
Now I was going to wait but we have quite a bit of time left so let's go ahead and do that.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.250
All right.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:14.850
So let's go to a single dot ph P and we're going to go down to where we have and if right here right

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:25.620
under it we're going to save page PIERI comments template All right now if we go and we look at a single

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.600
page.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.030
We have comments functionality.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.650
All right but it doesn't look too good.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.360
So what we'll do is create a custom template.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.880
Let's go to our theme and say new file comments dot ph P

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.610
we'll have a div with the class of comments.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.050
All right.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.160
And we have some code.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.760
I'm just going to paste in.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.410
Actually it's put a heading first.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.200
All right.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.400
In this speech I'm going to just grab real quick.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.270
OK so this is an argument array with just some of the default options here.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.310
This is actually copied from the documentation.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.140
And then down here we're calling W.P. list comments we're repassing those arguments.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.500
All right.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.660
Now for the form

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.670
piece that and same thing we have some arguments such as the the label of the submit button.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.580
Reply and so on.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.360
And then we're calling comment form and passing in those arcs.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.700
So save that reload.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.640
OK so it's changed a little but it still doesn't look very good.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.150
So now what we need to do is style it.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:59.550
So let's go to style C Ss will go all the way to the bottom.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:13.220
Let's put in our comments Clast to see a broader one pixel So Solid said some padding

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.980
say margin bottom will be 20.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.870
And then I also wanted to margin top that will be 10 k now you need the headings.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:41.580
We have comments H 2 and comments age 3 going to do a background of that green color.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:50.420
So that's what is at 0 F A 9 7 color will be white

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.520
and padding plus say 5 pixels.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.000
Next will be the common body

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.010
or

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.230
the margin bottom 10

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:27.300
say padding 20 2010.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.750
Now the maildir styling I'm going to paste in we have comment made a comment an image and it at a time

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.750
.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:47.780
Then we have the reply link in the form case just copy that save it or reload.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.220
And now we have a nice looking comments area

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:57.410
.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.510
All right.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.940
So we're just about done.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.210
The last thing I want to do is the page.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:08.470
OK so if we go to a sample page it looks like the blog roll which is not what we want.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:16.170
So what we'll do is create a new file and save it as Page dot pee pee.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.860
If we reload that should go blank.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:26.690
And what we want to do is let's just grab what we have in this single dot page P and we'll paste that

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.560
in page.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.040
All right.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.560
Now we're going to

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.140
get rid of the the comments template line right here of course we don't want that.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:44.080
And then for the content itself it's going to be really simple we don't want this.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:50.520
Mehta UL can get rid of that.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.500
Let's see.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.010
Well get rid of all keep the thumbnail.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.150
I think that should be.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:10.560
Let's let's change it from article class post to class page.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.000
We'll take a look simple page.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.350
All right.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.260
Let's just put a line break down here

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:24.280
.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.290
There you go.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.980
OK.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.040
So I think we're there.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:39.390
We have our customers are working so we can edit the front page log page looks good single page with

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.690
comments looks good.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.570
So I think we're all set.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.420
So this is a pretty good looking template.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.480
I think it looks nice and clean.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.430
It uses Bootstrap which is good fun.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.140
Awesome so you can add icons easily.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.020
All right.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.080
So hopefully you guys like this project and I'll see you in the next one.
