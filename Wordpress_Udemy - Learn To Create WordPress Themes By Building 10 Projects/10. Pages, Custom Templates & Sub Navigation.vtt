00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.000
All right so in this video we're going to move from the post to pages.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.370
OK.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.760
Because right now if I go when I go to the About page you can see that it's formatted just like a post

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.160
which is definitely not what we want.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.520
All right.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.620
The pages we just want to have the title we don't want this meta data.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.730
Read more stuff like that.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.210
So to change that all we have to do is create a new file and save it as Page dot ph pick.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.590
All right.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.290
Now if I go back to that page and reload it's just a blank white page.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.900
All right it's looking to this file to parse it.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.260
And just to start with I'm going to grab what we have in the index page and pasted in here and just

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.720
change some stuff right.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.440
So we want the while loop.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.820
We're not going to use the get template part.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.200
So we can get rid of that in each.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.040
Yeah.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:09.000
So what we want to do here is we want to Article tag and let's give this a class actually of page

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.600
right.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.160
And let's put in H 2.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.330
And this is where the title will go so say p p the title

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.140
and right under that will have content.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.520
Ok really simple save it.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730
Let's go to the About page.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.150
And now we have a very simple About page.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.580
If we go to services uses the same format sample page uses the same format.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.820
OK.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.910
Now I want to show you that we can actually create page templates for certain pages.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.490
All right.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.580
So for instance let's take the About page.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:12.520
If I go and I say new file save it as Page dash about DUP ph P say test.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.300
I actually will say about save it and I go and reload.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.610
We get a boat.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.630
Now this isn't going to be on every page you can see Services shows up sample page.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.430
It's only the about page.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.530
OK so it's using the slog which is up in the you are L..

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.860
All right we could just as well say page services and that would work.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.140
All right.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.770
The reason you would do this is if you want something on the About page is that you don't want anywhere

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.700
else.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.050
So if we just copy what's in page put it in here and then let's say we'll go right above the content

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.670
div of the class of well

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.370
we'll just put in company phone

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.740
and go back to about.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.520
And I can see we have the company phone here.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.610
All right.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.020
It's not on services it's not on sample page or any other pages.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.640
OK.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.090
So you can do that.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.250
But I think a better thing to do when you want to have specific styles or content on certain pages is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.560
to use a template.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.310
All right so I want to get rid of that.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.200
I'm actually going to get rid of this whole page about file I just wanted to show you that that is possible

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.420
.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.180
All right.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.500
So we got rid of that.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.990
Now what we'll do is create a template.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.900
All right so let's create a new file and we're going to save it as company Dasch template dot Ph.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.870
D.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.290
All right.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.780
And what we'll do is copy what we have in the page file.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.000
Paste it right in there right now at the top.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.620
We want to add a declaration or comment.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:19.150
OK so actually this needs to be in the tags.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.430
OK so what we want to do here is a template.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:34.730
You name it and we'll call this company to lay out OK.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:43.740
And all we want to do here is go right below the title and we're going to just put the phone number

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:55.060
but I'm going to put it in a paragraph tag with a class of phone and we'll put a 1 800 number.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.180
OK save that.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:07.170
And let's quickly just go into the style sheet and will add a style for for phone class.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.640
Now this isn't probably something you wouldn't do but just to give you an example of that to show you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.240
that you can have custom templates for certain pages.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.390
All right so let's give it a background.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.330
It's a border

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.900
adding

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.250
and we'll make it fold.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.350
OK.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:50.970
So what we want to do now that we have created is let's go into our post I'm sorry our pages and go

00:05:50.970 --> 00:06:00.870
to about and then down here under template we can choose company lay out or update that reload and I

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:08.770
can see we have the phone I actually want to put some text in front of it though will say.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.920
So they call us.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.050
OK.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.070
So if we go to services that doesn't have it OK because we didn't use that template.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:30.350
But I actually do want it for services so simply go into services page and select company lay out.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.750
So now that should also have the phone number.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.550
So the next thing that I want to show you is how we can create a sub menu.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:48.270
So what I mean by that is if we have let's say the About page and in under the About page we have child

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.350
pages.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.560
All right which we do.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.210
And back a couple of videos ago I put in fake Q And in our team under the About page k about is the

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.240
parent.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:06.150
Now my goal is to on the About page have links for further child pages not just the About page but any

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.580
page that has a child.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.680
I want them to show here.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.050
All right.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.030
So there's quite a few things we have to do to accomplish this.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.320
All right.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.160
So let's go to page ph P..

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.570
All right.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:28.350
And I'm actually going to remove that company Leo from the about page.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.360
OK so it shouldn't have the phone number anymore.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:43.980
So in page pupae Let's go right under the article tag and we're going to say p p W.P. underscore

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.820
list pages.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.100
All right.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.130
So let's see what that does.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.860
OK so what it did is it's listing all of the pages that we have on our WordPress site which obviously

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.300
isn't what we want and pay no attention to the style yet because we'll get to that after we get the

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.910
functionality.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.490
We want to do is we only want to get the about page and it's children.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:20.650
So what we will do is go read above that and let's say TGT.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:27.910
And we're going to create a variable called args and we're going to set that to an array.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.110
OK.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:44.380
And we're going to say child of now there is no there is no core function to do this to get the parent

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:44.510
.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:50.720
So we're going to actually create a function called Get top parent.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.050
OK.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:59.670
And then we also want to say tidal underscore ally and set that to nothing to hide.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:05.450
I'll explain that in a bit but right now we get to put our get our eggs right in there.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:11.070
If we go ahead and reload we're going to get an error because there's no function called Get top parent

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:11.470
.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.690
So let's go into functions.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:25.830
And let's go down to the bottom create a function called Get top parent.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:34.460
OK we're going to make the post object available to us by saying global post.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:40.950
OK and then we're going to say if so you mean to do that.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.110
So if

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.770
post a post underscore parent

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.570
then we're going to create a variable called ancestors

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:10.140
and we're going to set that to get on the score and post underscore ancestors and then we just want

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.990
to pass in post

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.420
ID.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.310
Right.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.710
And then what we want to do is return

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.750
ancestors and we want the zero index

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:39.810
it then we want to go under that statement and say return post Id save it and if we go and reload now

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:46.440
you can see that we're only getting the children of the About page which is AFAIK you and our team.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.380
Now we also want the about link to show up in here as well because we can go to the Ephie.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.370
Q But we can't get back to about unless we use the main menu.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:06.490
So let's go back to page ph P and we're going to go right here and we're going to create a UL right

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:14.580
which is going to and actually above the US we're going to have a Nav. and we're going to say now we're

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:24.510
going to give it a class of both Nav. and sub now of k and then that will end

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.450
right here.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:29.810
OK.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:36.000
So we'll have you well and then we'll have nav.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.620
OK.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:49.670
So under the well I want to put a span and we're going to give this a class of parent link.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.370
And then in here we're going to have an eight chag

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.260
and that's going to go to PH P So

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.970
the permalink.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:16.760
And what we need to do is pass in that get taught parent function here.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.780
We're going to pass that in.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:30.620
And then for the linked text say ph P echo the title.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.730
All right.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.390
And then we want to pass it in there as well.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:35.800
Get taught parent

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.620
OK.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:49.020
So if we save that and take a look now we get about this 15

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.340
.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:13:00.750
All that's because instead of using just the permalink we want to get the permalink.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.370
That should fix it

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.830
and fix it.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:15.630
Echo get the permalink and all we want to do.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.090
We did.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.170
Oh and get the title.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.230
That's right.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.750
There we go.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:30.320
So now we just have about and we can navigate with this menu.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.370
OK.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:37.740
Now this is all well and good but if we go to services are not services because that uses a custom template

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.240
but sample page or any other page.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.880
It's going to still have this even though there's no child links.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:52.410
So what we'll do is create another short function in the function start ph P file and we're going to

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.400
call this page is parent

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.830
Kerry.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:13.860
And then let's do a global post and then we're going to set pages to get pages and and here we want

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:26.400
to say child under score of equals and then we're going to concatenate the post ID.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.360
Right.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:34.590
And then what we'll do is just say return and then we want the number of pages we're going to say return

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.600
count pages.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.620
So if it's if it's more than 0 then it's we know that it's a parent right.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.530
So let's go back and we're going to go right above them now

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.450
and we can put an if statement

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.410
and then that will.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:02.260
And down below now.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:23.430
OK so what we want this to say is we want page is the parent or post post underscore parent is greater

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:24.490
than zero.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:30.810
OK so if there's if it's a parent or if there's any children then we're going to we're going to do this

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.120
.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.780
I need my question mark here.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:39.850
OK.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.190
So let's save that and then go back to sample page.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.540
And now that's gone.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.400
But if we go all about it's still there.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.090
K because it has these children these pages that are children.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.120
So everything's working correctly now I just want to fix the display.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.580
I want it to be over here and to look a little better.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.420
So let's go to our style sheet

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:09.030
and let's see a sub now of actually you know where I'm going to paste this stuff in

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.010
because this is get this video is getting kind of long.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.800
OK so we're floating the U L to the right.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.540
The sub now of itself we just have some margin on the top of floating it to the right and setting it

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.980
to 300 pixels wide and then the parent link which in this case is about.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:40.500
I want that to flow left and we want to make it black and also make it bold and add a border to the

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:46.220
right and then the link right here is saying the parent link will be black.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:54.500
And here we're using this current page item because whatever page we're on we want that to be bold.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.380
So let's save that and see what that looks like.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.050
OK so you can see that we have our.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.430
And if we go to F.A. Q That stays bold.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.530
We go to our team that's bold.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.540
All right so that looks a lot better and I think that's about it.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.830
Oh I do want to clear the flow.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:27.450
So what I'll do is I'm going to go under the nav and div class equals c o r and then we'll go to our

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:38.510
style sheet and let's add that taught S.R. and we'll say clear both.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.190
OK so now it's above the title on the page.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.060
All right so we did quite a bit in this video we went ahead and set up our pages.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:54.270
I showed you how to create custom pages custom templates and also how to use how to create a sub navigation

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:54.960
.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.190
All right so in the next video we're going to get into widgets
