WEBVTT

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.130
All right so up to this point we're doing pretty good.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.980
We have our main post page or my our home page Don but if I click on one of these and we go to the single

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.510
product page it doesn't look too good.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.710
All right and we're missing a bunch of information.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.930
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a new file inside the my shop the Imphal there and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.540
we're going to save it as single dot Ph.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.100
All right.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.000
And just by creating that file if we go back to the single view and reload it's blank OK because it's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.520
looking at this file.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.930
So what we'll do is let's copy everything we have in the index page.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.120
All right so grab all of it and paste it in and I'm going to get rid of the showcase part because we

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.740
don't want that.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.700
We only want the showcase on the home page so we're going to get rid of it.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.750
And I'm just going to put in H.R. tagon there.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.330
All right now we're going to be doing this same thing as far as checking for posts and looping through

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.050
the post even though it's a single post.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.400
But I'm going to get rid of everything that's in between the while loop.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.120
OK we're just going to get that out and then we're going to create a new div with the class.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:30.860
Let's create a div with the class of row and also single product.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.960
OK.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.650
And then inside there we're going to have a five column div.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.030
So this will be a large five and columns

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.290
K and inside there we're going to have our go back I think

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.400
and put a line break and then we're going to check for the featured image of a thumbnail.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.510
So I'm going to just copy right here.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.860
We just want to check to see if it's there.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.850
And if it is then it will display it.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.500
OK.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.870
And then that should be it for the five column div OK so that's just going to be the image basically

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.170
.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.860
And then after that we're going to have a seven column div

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.630
.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.110
OK.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.200
And then this is going to have the title which will put in an age.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.750
So I'll say ph P the title

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.110
and right under that we're going to put the content

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.010
right.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.500
And then we'll do an H R tag and then we want the tags in this code I'm actually just going to paste

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.710
in Kreiss So you just want to get that copied.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.690
We're just checking for the tags and then we're checking to see if the function exists.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.630
And then we're going to spit them out.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.840
All right so let's go ahead and save this and we'll go back to our page and reload.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.040
And now we have a product page.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.390
So for the Go back right now it's it's not going to be anything.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:57.810
What we can do is let's have it go to the home page will say ph P we should be able to say sight underscore

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.800
u r l

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.970
k x or do we need to echo it

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.730
right

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.980
back.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.300
And that brings us back to our home page.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.920
So that looks good.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.200
Now we also want to be able to have multiple images in here as well.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:37.230
So let's go to our post in the back and let's go to blue and white shirt and what I want to do is click

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.580
on Add media and then create gallery and then upload a couple more files.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:53.050
I have these files here and I want to use those and create a new gallery for the link.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.550
Just say media file and insert gallery.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.570
OK let's update go back to the front and reload.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.800
And now we have some images for that product.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.790
OK so that looks pretty much like a like a standard shopping cart.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.460
Details page.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.820
All right.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.360
So we're getting there now for the regular pages like a bow.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.800
Obviously we don't want this.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:29.710
So what we can do is go into our folder and create a new file and we'll save it as Page dot ph p.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.150
All right.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.350
And then if we go back to here and we reload it's going to be blank.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:42.180
All right let's grab what we have in the index page pasted right there and then we want to go down to

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.260
where the the post loop is.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:54.120
And let's just take everything out from within the while loop and what we'll do is we'll create a div

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.680
and this will be a 12 column.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.380
So we'll see a large 12.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.940
COLMES Right.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.530
And then here let's do an H three that will have the title

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.350
.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.080
OK.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.880
Under the title let's do the whole thumbnail thing.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.790
I'm just going to grab it from here.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.910
Grab that.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.170
OK so if there is an image it'll show it and then we just need the content

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.440
.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.070
All right we'll save it.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.300
Let's go back to about.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:56.920
And now we have just a standard page with a title and then the body K sample page same thing.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.690
So we're looking pretty good.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:07.970
Now if you do if you want to have comments on your product or post pages you could do that.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:18.660
I'm not sure if you would want to but if you do go to a single dot ph P and go probably go like right

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:25.770
here and just say ph P comments underscore template

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.300
and save it go back reload.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:41.380
And now we have comments let's say this is a test comment.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.010
All right.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.030
So that will leave comments and I don't think that looks that great.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.500
Of course you could create your own comments template and make this look a little better.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:57.010
We've done that in past past themes so don't really want to go through that again.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.390
And you may even rebranded as revues as a product review.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.390
You could do that as well.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.530
All right so we're going to go ahead and stop here.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.990
We introduced a few new aspects of Wordpress theme development in this project such as creating your

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:19.890
own plug in widget and also implementing the image the logo and the Customize are.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.450
And so on.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:21.750
All right.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.070
So thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next project
