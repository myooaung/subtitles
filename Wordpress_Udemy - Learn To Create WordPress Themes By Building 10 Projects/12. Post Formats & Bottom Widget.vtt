00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.350
Guys in this video we're going to set up different post formats as well as our bottom widget.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:07.650
All right.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.590
So let's start with the bottom widget.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.580
Now if we go to one of these pages we want that that area to pop up with the icons and so forth.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.410
So what we'll do is go to functions ph P and we're going to just add another position.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.750
So copy this let's just say bottom

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.800
this will also be bottom

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:42.930
and then for this before widget we're going to paste into divs one is has the class of Section A animated

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.530
fade in up and then the container div.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.640
So after widget is going to be to ending divs and then for the title same thing we're going to keep

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.840
the hide.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:06.310
OK we'll save that and then let's go into it see where do we want this page to page up.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.800
We actually know what we'll do is create a custom template for for that lay out with the bottom widget

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.050
.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.820
So let's create a new file and we're going to save it as a content

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.430
Wadham way out ph p.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.310
And then what we'll do is copy exactly what we have and Page dot P P and then we'll just add that to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.110
the bottom.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.340
So we want to go under.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.160
See this is where the main content is to we want to go under that.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.290
And let's just throw that in.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.760
OK it's just going to check for the bottom widget if it's there it's going to display it.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.420
So we'll save that.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.950
And then what we do is create the widget.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.120
So it's going to be just a text widget.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.220
Put that in the bottom and then let's grab the code from our HVM template

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.730
which I think we had in the about age DML.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.540
Yeah it was all this boxed content stuff.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.910
All right.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.820
So remember we used this in the actual widget code so we don't need that.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.710
We're going to get everything from this row.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.770
Everything inside too.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.520
So we're just going to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.920
let's

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.730
start over.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.480
OK.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.890
So we want everything in the row.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.270
Copy that.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.220
And we're just going to put this in as a widget.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.670
Save it.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.680
OK.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.770
Now we go to what say services and we want that widget to show up.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.990
We have to select that theme.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.120
Now in order to be able to select that then we just have to add to the top here.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.100
We need to add a comment block.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:32.580
So we're going to open up some ph tags and like that and then just say template name or call this bottom

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.240
content way out.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.250
All right so now let's say we want to on the services will go to pages services and then down here under

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:52.950
template we can choose the bottom content way out and click Update reload and there we go.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.370
OK.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.100
So it's only going to be on the services page if we want it on the our team page.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.850
Can simply enable the template down here.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.120
All right.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.590
We might as well do the same for you.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.330
All right so now all these pages are using this template.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.800
So now what we want to do is take care of the post formats OK.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.530
In addition to standard posts I want to be able to to create a side post which will just be a title

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.690
and content and then also a photo gallery.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.570
So let's go to functions dot ph P and we're going to have to add support for these post types.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.130
So we'll say

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:55.530
post format support and we're going to say add thier support and then we want to pass in those formats

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.040
.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.850
And then an array of the formats that we want to accept which in this case is just going to be a side

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.730
and gallery.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.280
All right so let's save that.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.620
And now if we go to posts and let's add new you can see over here we now have the option for a side

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.700
gallery.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.540
So let's say a side

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.740
they will just grab some text

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.110
publish.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.390
And now if we go to our front end our excuse me our front page.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.150
You can see that the A-side post is there and I don't want that I don't want a side posts or galleries

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.240
to show up here.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.850
So what we can do is go back into the front page of PGE and go down to where we have our latest blog

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:14.180
post queery and what we can do is add add to this an array of sorry not number eight.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:24.900
We want to say tax underscore Querrey and we want to set that to an array.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.310
All right.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.800
And then in this array we're going to say

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.100
taxonomy

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.700
is going to be post format.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.760
The field

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.870
is going to be slug

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.700
and terms that might be another way to do this.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:02.140
But this is one way this is going to be an array of The Post types that we don't want.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:18.100
OK so we don't want to post format side and we don't want post format gallery.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.620
And then we just want to go right here put a comma and say operator

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.330
not in.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.350
And that's what's going to make it say that we don't want these.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.180
All right let's save that and reload.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.360
OK so still showing up.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.060
Oh you know one has to be an array within an array.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.660
So right here.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.530
Forgot about that.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.870
And then that's going to end

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.920
right here

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:04.070
.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.990
There we go.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.360
OK.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.540
So now the post isn't showing on the home page.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.800
We're going to blog it is OK because we wanted to show on the regular blog.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.910
Now for the formatting we don't want this.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:25.460
Basically all I want is the title and the content no image no meta data or anything like that.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:33.410
So what we'll do is go to index dot ph P and let's go down

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.630
to see right here.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.190
All right.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.260
And we're going to do an if statement.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:59.610
We're going to say if it has post format then we'll pass it in the format and post underscore ID.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:12.130
OK so if it has a post format and get post format pass in the ID.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.430
If the format is equal to.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:16.670
Side

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:27.470
.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.150
All right.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:35.450
So this will check to see if its an aside post and we're also going to want an LCF.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.670
So I want to copy this.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.230
All right.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:48.740
And then here we're going to say LCF and then change side to gallery

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.380
and then we just want a final else.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.020
OK.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:08.900
So right here is if it's an aside if it's a gallery if it's a standard standard we want what's what's

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.470
been here.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.240
So from there down to here

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.930
now instead of just putting that code in here what I'm going to do is create a separate file.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:29.420
So let's create a new file we'll save it as content dot ph P and paste that in.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:29.770
All right.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:38.480
And then let's go to back to index and and what we can do is just paste in right here

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:46.250
.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.330
Actually we need to be tagged though

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.090
right so that a load content not PKP.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.450
And then of course up here we want to create separate files for our side and gallery.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:06.880
So let's go ahead and paste that in here and we'll change this to a side.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.670
So be content content dash side.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.240
P P and then this one here

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.820
will be for a gallery.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.280
OK now we just need to create those two files.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:36.510
This one will be content Dasch aside and then we'll have the content Dasch gallery.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.660
OK for the aside it's going to be very simple.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.240
We have our class.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:53.230
We're still using the variables section class and then we just have the title and the content.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.310
All right so let's save that.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:03.620
Go back and reload and now these are all the same but this one here is an aside it just has the title

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:09.560
and the paragraph which actually you should change this.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.100
Let's change that to div class

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.400
X or

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.910
.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.520
OK.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.240
Now for the gallery Let's go into that file.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.890
And this is pretty much going to be the same thing I'm going to place that in.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.670
We don't need the paragraph around the content though.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:45.170
And then I just want the heading to see the heading and want to give that that has the class text Center

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.480
.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.140
All right.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.730
Because I want the gallery to have its title in the center so let's save that and then we're going to

00:12:52.730 --> 00:13:03.710
go and create a gallery say add new post photo gallery and let's say add media create gallery I'm just

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:10.230
going to choose these three images and let's choose to link to the media file and I'm going to choose

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:18.370
a medium for the size insert and publish and reload.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.610
OK so that's not showing up.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.760
I didn't choose gallery over here you have to be sure to choose the gallery format.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.510
All right I will reload.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.600
And there we go.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.930
Now we have a gallery and if we go to the home page it's not going to show up.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:37.090
We only want these to the standard post to show up.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.520
All right so that's going to be it for this project.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.960
If you'd like you could of course add more features to it.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.760
But hopefully you liked it and I'll see you in the next one.
