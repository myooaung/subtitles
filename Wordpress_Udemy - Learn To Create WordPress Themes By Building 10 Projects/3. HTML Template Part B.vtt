00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.880
All right welcome to the second part in this part we're going to be adding the CSSA to make this work

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.140
a lot better.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.500
All right so we have our style C Ss created.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.360
Let's start with the body.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.690
OK we're just going to do a font family of Ariel.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.320
The color of the text is going to be a really dark gray.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.930
We're going to set the body margin to zero and the padding to zero.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.450
OK so let's start with some core styles for the unordered list.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.300
I want to just take off the margin and the padding.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:55.860
OK let's do the links for the atax and then give them a color light blue which is going to be 0 0 9

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.650
a CD and we get a set text decoration to none.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.370
We also want a hover color

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:19.680
or color will just be the dark gray and the next is going to be the container that's going to bring

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.670
everything to the middle we're going to set up a wealth of 960.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:36.180
And be sure to set the margin to auto and we're going to set the overflow to auto Cyrene now for the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.780
hotter.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.350
Of the the background of light gray.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:54.060
And let's set the padding of the header to 10 pixels and we'll set a border bottom of three pixels solid

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.440
and soon to be that same light blue color.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.170
OK now for the each one.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.990
So obviously Hetter each one.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.920
And that's going to have a margin and padding of zero

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.580
in what else.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.940
It's a color be that light blue.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:38.800
And we want to float it to the left and then we also want that each one to be a link.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.300
I don't think I made it a link.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.140
No I didn't.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.080
So I'm just going to wrap this in in a tag

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.220
in Exene or

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.280
we want the H-1 to be on the outside.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.260
All right.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.590
So I will say however each one a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.150
and it's going to have a color of light blue.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.290
And we also want the text decoration to be in.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.070
All right.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.700
Now another thing I want to do is I want to have kind of a slogan or a tag line because Word Press by

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.610
default has an option for that.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:57.270
So I'm going to go right inside of the H-1 and I'm going to put this in a small tag you know just say

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.480
another word press.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.830
The animal style that say hello or small

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:20.220
We're going to give it a color of dark gray and let's give it margin left.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.670
Just give it out one pixel margin and I'm going to set the font size to 13.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.210
OK so now for the right side of the header when I say Hetter H.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.970
Right.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.860
And we're just going to float that to the right now.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.700
This is it has an input.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.680
So we're going to style the input as well.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.310
So H writes in it.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:06.610
Let's make sure it's it's only for the text input so same type equals text and a set a width of two

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.560
fifty.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:19.370
We're going to set up padding of five and a margin top of five and that should do it for the help.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.360
Let's go ahead and save it and take a walk OK.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.040
So that's our header.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.270
Next is the navigation.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.790
All right.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.730
So it's a nav dot in the nav heights.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.170
Actually you know what I don't want to do that I want.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:55.090
See I want to have the main nav div have the have stuff like the height the background color customisations

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.080
like that.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.940
But I do want to have just a regular nav class to do the floats you know so our footer menu can can

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.540
have our list item floated floats and stuff like that.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.120
All right so I'm not going to put anything for that yet.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.080
I do want to do the eyes of the NAV and let me just make sure we actually have that OK.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:27.340
We have NAV class and main nav so for this we're going to float these list items to the left and we

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:43.090
want to display in line instead of padding on the right of 15 pixels that will say nav dot nav and just

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.370
wanted to make sure the text declaration is set to None.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.520
All right so now let's do the main now.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:05.130
OK so we're going to say height 45 overflow is going to be hidden.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.150
We're going to do a background

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:17.710
of dark gray color of the text is going to be white.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:25.810
And let's say padding top will be 7 pixels.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.900
All right so now we want to do the main nav allies.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.900
OK.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:45.730
So again the same height for pixels and then line height also 40 pixels.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.530
I will do the A had

00:07:55.030 --> 00:08:07.430
colored needs to the white text decoration one in all said padding to 8 pixels.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.930
All right so now we need the hover state.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:16.900
So now I've got main nav hover

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.500
in the hover colors going to be that light blue.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.770
All right.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.710
So let's save that.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.920
And there's our navigation.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.060
OK.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.880
Now this whole area here is going to have it has a class of content.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.920
I just want to push it down a little bit.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:48.170
And I also want to set the line height of all the text so saved or content

00:08:51.500 --> 00:09:04.250
with said margin top so that 30 pixels line height will be 1.5 am

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.340
I right.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:15.600
No I don't think I didn't include a sidebar did I.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.670
Yeah I didn't do the sidebar so we need to do that.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.620
Let's go back into the index each team now.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.980
And this this class this div right here is going to be the main area.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.760
So we want to go right underneath that ending div

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.710
and we want to just put where we want our Sidebar.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:47.360
So this will be div class and let's give this a class of side.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.310
All right.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:56.640
And we're also going to have a div inside of that called block.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:03.740
Each element in the sidebar should have a class of block right.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:16.260
And then we'll just put in age three and a side bar head and then we'll just put a paragraph going to

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.900
grab some text.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.040
Right.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.340
And then under that we'll have a button or a link that is formatted like a butler

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.700
.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.710
OK.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:46.480
So now our Sidebar is down here so we want to do is we want to say Dot main We're going to float that

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.760
to the left

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.220
and we're going to give it a width of 65 percent.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.610
All right.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:08.330
And then the side is going to have a width of 30 percent and that's going to float to the right.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:09.450
OK.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:16.670
Now for the block style We're going to set the border of light gray.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.540
Let's say one pixel solid.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.340
We want some padding.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:31.780
Five 15 25 15.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:37.030
They will set the background to really light gray

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.650
and set overflow to you.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.670
And now for each three in the block

00:11:51.180 --> 00:12:01.160
said border bottom and that's going to be like gray solid one pixel.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.350
I want to set up padding on the bottom of 10 pixel.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.180
Let's take a look.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.740
OK so now we have our main area here in the sidebar.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.920
Now let's do the article.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:26.700
So say it's actually an article tagged with a class of post.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.470
I'm going to add a border bottom to those

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.360
and let's do a margin bottom

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.850
and also padding bottom.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.600
OK we also want to style this method area right here.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:13:00.950
I want to give it a blue background so I'll say Article Dart's post dot net

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.810
.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:18.570
Will give it a padding of seven pixels.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.220
And also the bottom class

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.540
I just copy this.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:34.650
OK except we want to change the padding to 10 15.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.410
All right.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:41.860
Let's also display it as an inline block.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:49.830
All right so if we take a walk you know it's pretty good.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.460
Last thing is the footer.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.130
So down here we're going to stay further.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:01.870
And we gave the class I think it was mean for her.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.310
We'll just check know.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:12.030
All right so here we want to set a margin on the top.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.770
I want to align everything to the center

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:29.760
and give it a dark gray background color needs to be white.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.860
We'll give it a height of 60 pixels

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:43.400
padding top 10 pixels and overflow will be Arto.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.540
All right.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.020
Now we have the left and right side of the footer.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.060
So it's a floater dart

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.320
half left.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.580
That's just going to have a left float.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.180
And then we have the right side

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.790
which will have a right flow

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.920
.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:16.730
All right.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.030
So now we have the menu

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:24.430
.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:30.820
So we'll do a UL I want that to display in line

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.210
and then we'll have the line.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.730
OK ally we're going to say float left

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:56.890
and right will be 10 pixels and let's make sure we set a set list style to none all right and then lastly

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:04.030
we have the links which will be white.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.290
All right.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.840
Let's take a look here.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.730
We just want to push this down a little bit

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.540
.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.910
OK that didn't work.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.070
Let's do it on f. right actual margin.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.580
It's hard to get a

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.670
little more.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.320
All right.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.090
There we go.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.190
So that looks pretty good.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.170
It's very it's very simple design.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:53.320
I didn't want to go all out because the main point of this is to get you familiar with the syntax to

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.060
create a word press theme.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.670
Not so much creating a great design.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.500
Ok so now that we're done with the HDMI on CSX we can move on.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.430
And the next video will start to create our WordPress theme
