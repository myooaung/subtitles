WEBVTT

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.190
All right.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.300
So we have the header and footer files created and included in the index file.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.100
What we want to do now is work on the main post area.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.740
OK right now we just have a bunch of static HDMI now which obviously we need to change.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.830
So we're going to have two types of posts we're going to have regular posts which will just be you know

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.800
a standard blog post with a title and paragraph and then we're going to have a gallery post which is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.170
going to be obviously what we've seen just the image with the description underneath.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.990
So we need to add support for content or post formats.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.120
So what we need to do is create a functions not peach P file right inside of our theme.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.370
So save that as functions dot THP And when we're going to do is I'm going to create a function to set

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.700
up support certain support for our theme.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.030
All right.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.400
So for instance we want to be we want we want to be able to use the featured image or thumbnails so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.260
we'll put that in this function.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.860
All right so let's say BGP and this will be for themes support.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.150
OK so we're going to say function

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.430
theme support.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.280
OK.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.220
So a couple of things you want to do.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.360
Let's let's set up featured image support.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.880
So say add

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.380
themes for it and then we want in here we want to say post thumbnails

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.690
.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.510
All right.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.310
And actually let me just show you real quick before we actually add that I want to show you if we go

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.460
to a post we don't have that featured image box down here.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.010
So that's all we're adding right now.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.910
So for the thumbnail size I'm actually going to put it to the max image size because we're going to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.280
use CSSA to shrink the images down.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.090
All right so we'll say set post

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.870
thumbnail size.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.870
And that's going to be 900 by 600.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.570
OK then we need to add our gallery post format support.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:47.460
So I'll say post format support and we want to use the same add theme support function except we want

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.400
to replace this with post formats.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.790
OK and then a second parameter we can put in an array of the formats we want to include K.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.310
All we want besides the standard is the gallery.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.900
So we're just going to put in gallery.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.960
OK so now we have the theme support function now we need to pass this into an action so let's say had

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.530
action

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:28.340
and the action is going to be after set up theme.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.530
So the second parameter is going to be the function we want to run which is of course themes themes

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.300
support.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.140
Actually you know what I want to change is to theme's set up

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.570
.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.650
All right so let's save that.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.170
And then what we'll do is go back here and reload.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.530
And now you can see we have the featured image down here.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.000
We also have support for the gallery format.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.810
Now since we have both standard and gallery we need to create the two files for this content.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.670
So in our photogenic folder website I want to do that I want to create a new file and we're going to

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.150
save this one as content dot ph p.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.600
And then we're going to create another one called content dash gallery dog Ph.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.160
D.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:34.530
Ok so content will be for the standard content gallery will be for the gallery format before we actually

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.950
touch those files we need to go to our index.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.300
All right.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.670
And we're going to get rid of this for now.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.150
And then what we'll do is is check for posts if there are posts we're going to loop through them and

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.780
spit out the correct content file.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:04.710
So right in here we're going to say P if and we want to say if I have underscore hosts

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.480
and then we're going to use this shorthand syntax.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.070
OK so if there are posts then we want to loop through them so we can use a while loop to do that.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:31.290
So let's say Pietsch P while have posts while have posts and then with wordpress we have to use this

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:40.170
format here where we say colon to the underscore post which is a little weird but that's just what we

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.020
have to do.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.880
And let's see this is going to have an end while.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.040
OK so while it has has posed them what we want to do is split out spit out the content file whether

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.880
it's content ph P or content gallery that protect that pertains to whatever they click here.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:14.730
OK so let's say THP and then we want to say get template part.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.210
Okay.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.240
And then what we'll do is pass in content

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:30.580
and we'll have a second parameter here that will be get post format.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.540
OK so whether it's Galerie or just a standard post.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.600
Now I do want to put an else to this if.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.080
OK.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.680
Which which will mean if there are no posts.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.840
So we're going to do that right here say p p else.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.140
And if there are no pose then let's say a Ph.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:03.620
P Ekho and we're going to use this W.P. auto P function and we want to say

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.380
sorry there are no posts.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.410
OK.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.250
Mean make this formatted as PKP.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.320
There we go.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.580
OK so that is the index file.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.620
Save that.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:31.970
And then what it's looking for these content files so for now let me just put in standard content.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.250
And then this one will be photo.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.050
And let's just see if that works.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:44.400
If we go and reload we get standard content because if we look at our polls we just have one called

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.860
Hello world.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:54.930
All right so if we add another one that's a test and we'll choose gallery for this one and then we publish

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.520
.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.090
We go back and reload.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.710
You can see we're getting photo and then standard content.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.710
So that's our two posts.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.610
They're on the same line that this is actually two different posts.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.920
Ok so we know that that's working.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:16.570
So in the next video what we'll do is we'll work on both of these content files so that we can output

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.230
the post correctly.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.750
All right so I'll see you in the next video
