00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.640
Hey guys and this video I'm going to show you how to implement a bootstrap nav bar with a WordPress

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.950
theme using W.P. bootstrap nav Walker.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.630
All right.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.870
So this is a really popular script that will integrate your nav bar so that you can create sub items

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.070
and things like that.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.700
So you want to go to this you get hub page and we're going to just go ahead and download the zip K and

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.610
if you open that up you'll have a folder and that will have the p p file inside of it.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.780
OK so what we want to do is let's open up our project folder.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.160
OK.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.780
And we're just going to bring that P2P file into our folder.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180
OK close up.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.530
And now we want to open up the functions P2P file and we want to include that files so let's go to the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.680
top here and let's do the choir once

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.800
and we're going to put in W.P. underscore bootstrap underscore.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.910
Now Walker Daut ph p.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.430
Ok so will bring it in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.390
and then make sure that saved.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.540
And if we go to the get hub page and look and see that we just did this step.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.470
Now the usage we want to use this W.P. nav menu function inside of our nav bar.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.000
All right.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.720
So let's grab this whole thing and copy it and then go into our header file where nav bar is and go

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.960
down into.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.880
Into this is divorcÃ©e have the collapse class.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280
Right above the form and we're going to paste this in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.210
.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.690
All right.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.900
So this basically defines a bunch of options for us.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.280
We don't need all of this stuff.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.350
I'm going to get rid of this menu item here.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.110
OK we want the theme location which is going to be primary depth is 2.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.870
That's good.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.930
Let's see container.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.470
We're going to set container to false.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:47.220
Get rid of the quotes in and we don't need a container class or a container Id get rid of that Menu

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.350
class.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.910
That's good.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.520
Fall back.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.920
That's fine and that's good.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:04.680
OK so let's keep it just like that and save it now and go back to our functions P P and we want to register

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.010
our NAV menus so inside of this theme set up

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.910
we're going to say register

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:26.360
register now menus and that's going to take in an array.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.090
OK.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:39.450
So this is going to be called primary and we're going to set that to double underscore parentheses and

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.110
then the readable name which will just be primary menu

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.620
.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.710
OK so we'll save that.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.970
Let's go back to the get hub page.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.450
So we did this we did this.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.380
That's fine.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.710
All right so make sure everything is saved and then we're going to go back into the backend and go down

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.320
to appearance and you should have this menu option.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.040
OK we're going to click that.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.380
You know what let's create an extra page

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.770
so it will say about

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.680
publish.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.210
Let's create one more and we'll call this

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.330
our team

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:03.160
cray and then we're going to go back to the menus page and take a look at this menu and let's go ahead

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.250
and say create a menu and then you want to make sure you check this right here.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.510
Primary menu and then save it.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.000
All right.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.430
And then we'll go to our front end and reload and you can see we have our menu and it works.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.100
So let's test out the dropdown functionality all we should have to do is take one of these and put them

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.630
right in here we'll put the our team in there as well and then save menu go back.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.900
And now we have a dropdown.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:38.380
All right.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.870
So awesome.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.910
So you can see how easy that was to implement an NAV bar.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.680
And this is definitely something that you could use in other projects as well.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.660
Any kind of bootstrap WordPress theme.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.670
All right so now what I want to do is get the sidebar set up so that we can add sidebar widgets so we're

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.010
still in the functions P file.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.590
We're going to go underneath the add action here and let's create a function

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:22.550
and we're going to call this init underscore widgets.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.970
OK.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.750
And that's going to take an ID.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.800
Now in here we want to say register sidebar

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.070
and that's going to take in an array and then we have a bunch of options.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.680
So let's say you name a sidebar

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.040
ID

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.260
side.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.610
All right.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:14.700
Now we can also include other things here for instance we can say before widget.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:22.700
Now what this does is it allows us to insert code right before the widget renders.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.150
So we're going to need this because we want our widgets to render inside bootstrap panels.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.850
So we need to include the Pernod classes.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:48.730
So let's put a div in a class of panel and also panel default.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.150
Right.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.840
And then let's do it after widget.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.200
And that's just going to be to ending divs.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:05.710
All right.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:11.910
Now we also have the ability to add content before and after the title which we also want to do.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.040
So for this one for title

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:29.680
and this is going to have a div with the class of panel heading.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:32.880
OK.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:38.710
And then we also want to the age three and we're going to give that a class

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.180
of panel title

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.710
right.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.050
And then finally we'll do after title

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.010
that's going to be the ending.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:04.270
H-3 and then div and then we also want the start of the panel body

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.470
.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.460
OK so that should be good.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.360
Now we need to have an action Soldan say add action

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.180
right.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.160
And the hook will be widgets.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.400
Underscore that.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.240
Right.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.980
And then of course the function we want to call is in widgets.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.480
So make sure that saved.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.870
And if you go to the back end and reload.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.650
You should now have a widget option under appearance and you should also see sidebar.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.310
So what I'm going to do is bring over category's
