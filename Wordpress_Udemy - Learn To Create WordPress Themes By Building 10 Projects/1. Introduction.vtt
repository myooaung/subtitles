00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.250
Oh welcome to the Wordpress theme project's course by Onix.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.050
My name is Brad travesty and I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.350
So in this course we're going to be building 10 WordPress themes from start to finish.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.620
We're going to be looking at all of the fundamental knowledge that is needed to start building great

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.490
WordPress themes.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.130
So those 10 projects are sections and there's six to ten lectures per section and then we have anywhere

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.130
between 1 and 3 videos per lecture.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.530
They'll also be one section quiz that will have up to five or six questions.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.190
So what you should know before taking this course you should definitely have experience with each team

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.270
on CSX preferably HDMI 5.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.700
You should know some ph P at least the basics.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:59.270
We're not going to get into really in-depth ph coding but you should definitely know the basics WordPress

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.570
although you don't need to know how to build WordPress themes or plug ins you should have a general

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.250
idea of what Wordpress is how to install it and how to I guess manage award press Web site and then

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.960
programming fundamentals things like array's variables loops if statements and things that are found

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.620
across a wide range of programming languages.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.040
So here is a list of the technologies and concepts that we'll be looking at through this course.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.330
This is an all of them but this is these are most of the common ones.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.120
Obviously HTL CSSA and ph P are extremely important.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.150
That's what everything is based around.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.620
We have Wordpress the Wordpress post loop which is the main loop that grabs the posts from the database

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.230
hooks and actions of functions P2P file where thats where we put our dynamic code for for a WordPress

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.300
theme widgets W.P. queery which is used to make custom queries.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.160
So if you want to get queries by category or by users anything like that theme custom Isar which is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.930
fairly new this is where we can actually store settings and values and things like that for particular

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.040
themes.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.840
So we're also going to use a range of frameworks of front end C Ss framework such as bootstrap Foundation

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.730
Inc.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.430
We're also going to use grid ism which is a really lightweight grid based framework and then W3 CSSA

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.800
which is a fairly new front end framework.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.020
So here's an overview of the projects we have the simple theme this is going to be an introductory theme

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.240
.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.390
We're not really going to focus on design here it's going to be more on the actual syntax and that the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.900
files that need to be created things like that.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.700
The advanced theme will go a little more in-depth adding things like archived and search pages things

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.590
like that.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.480
Then we'll build a photo gallery theme we're going to use the W3 CSSA framework and also include some

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.230
simple animation word strap is going to be our first Twitter bootstrap theme.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.350
We're going to implement that.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.910
We're also going to use something called the W.P. Nav. Walker which is a class we can use to have dropdown

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.710
menus in Word Press.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.850
We'll be building an e-commerce theme using the foundation framework which is similar to bootstrap the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.930
business theme.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.020
This will rely heavily on the theme.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.860
Customize or API we're also use Fonte awesome for icons and make it look really nice.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.740
Clean cut is another bootstrap theme we're also going to use animate CSSA with that and we'll also use

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.150
theme customizing quite a bit.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.370
WP news is going to be a news based theme on the ink framework and we're going to use slider's and some

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.030
javascript widgets in that as well.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.030
Four Corners is going to be a really simple elegant theme based on foundation.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.450
We're also going to use a library called hover dot CSSA which gives us some nice animation when we hover

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.800
over elements and then finally we'll build the dynamo theme which is going to use grid Asom.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.360
It's going to use an slider which is a J Querrey slide show component.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.530
Jay queery tabs and we're also going to make it so we can customize the color and we can set a light

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.640
in a dark preset for the theme.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.970
All right.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.750
So we have a lot of information packed into this into this course.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.880
Hopefully guys like it and I'll see you in the first project.
