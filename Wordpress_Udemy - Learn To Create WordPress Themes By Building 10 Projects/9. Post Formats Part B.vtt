WEBVTT

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.180
K and documentation these are the CDs supported formats.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.990
So we're using a side gallery and link but we also have image quote status video audio and chat.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.770
All right so you might want to take a look at that.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.230
So go ahead and save this.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.590
And since we put that in there if we go to our posts and let's say add new you'll now see we have this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.160
format box on the side where we can choose what format we want for our post.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.570
All right.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.840
Now as it is it's not going to do anything different.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:47.600
So let's say let's do an aside as a sample aside and let me just grab.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.360
I'm going to grab some content we'll just take this.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350
And let's just paste that in.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.560
OK we'll choose a side.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.830
We'll choose business as a category and publish.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.080
All right so if we go to our front end and reload you can see that we have our side but it's no different

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.170
than these post-K what the point of this is to have this show up differently.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.710
All right.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.700
Now the way we can do that is when we go to let's say Index where we put this get template part we want

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.710
to pass in a second parameter of get host format.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.490
And that's a function.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.280
And that's going to allow to see to see what type of what post format it is so we're going to go ahead

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.650
and just replace all that and get template parts with this with the second parameter.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.820
So we want to go the archive piece that and go to search

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.920
and single.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.520
Okay.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.400
So now what we want to do is for each format we want to create a content files so let's say new file

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.280
and we're going to save this as content dash aside.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:19.510
THP right will also create content Dasch gallery dog TGT

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.390
and finally content Dasch link dog fee.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.420
OK so now these these different files we can make our formats look differently.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.800
All right.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.210
So let's start with the side case is going to be very simple.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:49.630
We'll have an article tag will give us a class of post and also post a side.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.690
All right.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.660
I don't want to have any images or any other any of that stuff.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.950
We just want the actual content and the author and date.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.210
And I'm going to put this in a deal with the class of well which is a bootstrap class.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.460
And here we're going to use a small tag and let's put in

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:32.130
the author OK and he can kind of think of this is like a status update and let's put the at sign and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.260
then we'll do ph P the date

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.520
K and then right under it we'll put the content.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.450
All right.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.250
Just that's it.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.710
So we'll save it and if we go back and reload it can see that this post has changed K because it's read

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.740
it's coming from this content side file.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.050
Now I want to make this look a little better.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.640
So what we'll do is go into our stylesheet and we'll go down to where we have the article stuff

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.110
and let's say Article dark coast side.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.140
And actually we don't want to do the core element we want the small.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.570
I just want to make this text bold.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.940
Also a font we polled.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.270
We also want to format the well

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.850
.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.820
So for this I just want to change the background from gray to a blue light.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.470
Hello.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.310
So this will be easier though he f c and I just want to add some padding.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.640
All right so take a look at that and I can see that that's formatted differently.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.050
So that takes care of aside.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.710
Now let's do the link.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:17.620
OK so we'll go into content linked up Peachtree and let's copy what we have in a site.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.650
Right.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.530
And then what we'll do is change changes to the link and we're going to keep the world class.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.280
And I but this is going to be different.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.040
So we're going to get rid of that.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:41.080
We're going to put in a tag and then this is going to go to pee pee we're going to see ph P echo

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.370
get the content

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.670
right.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.470
And then in here we want to echo

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.720
the title and that's it.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.500
And now if we go back into our post we say add new this time we're going to choose a wink and then up

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:20.580
here will say let's say get us some web dev courses at Edgewater X..

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.770
And then and here we just want to put a link

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.230
.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.700
Right.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.780
And that's it.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:40.090
So you go ahead and say publish and go back and reload and you can see we have a link which goes to

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.740
you want to start up.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.740
We want to format that to look a little better.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:55.220
So we're going to go back here and say Doc post the link.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:03.430
Actually we just want the we're all going to say the background

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:17.200
background is going to be just like gray and we'll say padding 10 pixels.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:27.270
OK so now we have formatted like I said we have our regular post we have a side content or status updates

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.950
and we have links.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.570
So that's what we're going to look at is the gallery.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:38.930
So let's go to a content gallery Doppie H-P and this is actually going to be very simple.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.130
We're going to do article class host host gallery

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.200
and all we want here.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.070
We want to do an age to save a title

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.880
and then we just want the content

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.630
and that's it.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.270
All right.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.410
Now what we'll do is go to add new post.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:22.510
Now I want to go to add media and then create gallery.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.680
All right so we have some images in here but I want to upload some more.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:34.920
And you should have these in your files and we just.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:43.390
OK so I'm going to upload some of these.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.670
And

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.190
so that's what five that's fine.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:01.580
We're just going to click all of these images and say create actually before you do that.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.650
Yeah.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:10.250
Create a new gallery and then you want to make sure that all of these are in there.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.840
And see that's good.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:22.350
And then insert gallery and make sure the galleries chosen on over here on this side.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.920
Put this in entertainment and say publish.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.740
All right so let's go back and reload and there's our gallery and if we want to edit it we can go back

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:39.030
in and you can choose this pencil icon here and you can edit right now.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.400
Right now they're linked to go to the attachment page.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.630
But I want them to actually go to the media file.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.060
All right

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.940
OK so when you click on them it's just going to go to the image file.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:53.870
You can change that.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:59.710
You can have it go to a media to a page or you could implement some kind of Lightbox plug in if you

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.330
want it to as well but we're not going to get into that.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:03.150
OK.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:12.050
Now what I want to do here is go to my CSSA file and we want to just add some styles.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:20.320
They are called Door post gallery and we're going to add a dark background

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.420
and color will be white.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:40.070
We're going to add some padding say five 10 and then margin top to be five.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.580
OK.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.690
So I'd say that and reload.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.780
And there you go.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.750
OK so now we can post a gallery.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.970
All right so that's going to do it for post formats.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.420
I will see you in the next video
