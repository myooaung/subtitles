00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.420
You guys in the last video we went ahead and installed and set up WordPress now we're going to do is

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.080
we're going to start to create our theme files and enable the theme.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.760
All right so what we're going to do is amusing Sublime Text.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.550
And we're going to add my project folder so that we can access the files easily.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:31.550
We're going to go to see my C-Drive amps UWW and W.P. themes.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.900
All right.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.110
And then the folder that you want to create your Femen is going to be in W.P. content and then themes

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.220
.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.940
OK you can see we have the three themes that come with wordpress already installed.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.410
All right so what we're going to do is create a new folder and we're going to call this simple.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.840
That's going to be the name of our theme.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.490
Now there's two files that you absolutely need in order to enable your theme.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.650
So one is going to be styled Daut to see SS and then the other one is going to be index dot ph P.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.870
OK.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.810
Now the reason we need style CSSA is because that's where all of our declarations go.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.080
So the theme name the description things like that.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.500
So what we can do is open up a common block just like that.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.310
And then we can put in some fields actually let me pull up the documentation here

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.170
.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.060
OK.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.200
So this here includes all of the different fields that you can use.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.390
OK so we're not going to use all of these.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.960
They're not all required.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.960
I'm pretty sure the theme name is all that's required but it's good to have some other information as

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.770
well.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.780
So let's a theme name.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.270
And we're going to call it simple.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.390
OK we're also going to have an author

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.490
and you can put your own name there if you'd like.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.810
We'll have an offer to you are I.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.920
So if you're creating themes for clients you probably want to put your company website where we can

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.790
have a description.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:41.680
They will say a very simple WordPress theme and let's do version 1.0.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.030
All right.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.780
So let's go ahead and save that.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.440
Now just having this is going to allow WordPress to see your theme if we go back to our back end and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.790
we go to appearance and then themes you'll see that our simple theme is is here and we can actually

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.190
activate it now in order for a screenshot to show up here you need to put an image in the root of your

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.770
theme folder and call it screenshot.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.160
Dot P N G.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.650
All right so I've included a sample screenshot in your files which I have here on my desktop which is

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.550
just a quick Photoshop image that I created that just says simple theme.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.900
All right.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.020
So let's go ahead and I'm going to cut that and I'm going to put that in our theme folder.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.640
So I'm going to go to my server root.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:45.440
Go to W.P. themes repeat content themes and then simple and was going to paste that in there.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.740
Right.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:54.120
And then if we go back to the back end in reload now you can see that we have a screenshot.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.490
Well it's not really a screenshot but it's an image.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.800
All right.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.280
Now if we go ahead and activate our theme go to our front end reload we get absolutely nothing because

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.250
we haven't added any code.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.540
Our theme just contains nothing it's completely blank.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.910
All right.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:23.930
Now if I was to go and go in our index ph P and say test save reload see we get test OK.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.530
So it's reading our index P2P file by default.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.670
Now what we want to do is start to create our HDMI structure.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.970
So let's put in some just core each team old tags we have our doctype we have in each team our tag head

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.560
tags body tags and we have title tags.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.370
Now first thing we're going to do starting at the top is our HTL tag sometimes you want to include a

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.940
language here and WordPress has a function that we can actually include here to make this dynamic so

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:08.880
we can do ph the language attributes which is a function and that will determine the language that we

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.370
want the theme to display.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:19.020
All right now in the title you probably want this to be dynamic you probably want it to have your site

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.580
name and so on.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.280
So what we can do is we can save THP and we can use a function called blog info.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.110
And this is really useful because it has a bunch of things that you can get such as the site name the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.240
description the character set.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.660
You are Ell's and the list goes on.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.820
You can actually look at the documentation to see exactly what it includes.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.080
But what we're going to use is name.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.590
OK so if we save that and we go back and reload you look in the title it says WordPress dev if you remember

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.950
that's what we call the site.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.910
All right so it's going to display the name.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.940
So let's go back to our head tag and continue.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.930
OK we're going to want a character set.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.430
So we're going to say Metta

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:17.040
char sat and then we can use blog info here as well to say blog info and then just pass and char set

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.070
her right.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.710
And then if we save that and we go and look at our source code doing it using control you you can look

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:36.240
at both the language attributes says we're using English us and the character set is UTF 8.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.870
OK.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.360
So those things can now be controlled from within WordPress.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.830
So the next thing I want to do is I want to include our stylesheet.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:54.420
OK so we have this style CSSA file we actually need it but if we go in and let's say we really say body

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.300
background black we save that and we reload.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.110
We're not getting a black background.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.240
It's not being read.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:16.550
So in order for that style sheet to be seen or going to say link raÃºl style sheet and then for the H

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.300
ref what we're going to do is we're going to say ph P blog info.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.690
And in here we want to say style underscore you are.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.370
All right and that's going to get it from the correct location.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.060
So let's save that reload and now we see a black background.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:44.070
OK so whatever we put in our style sheet is now going to register.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:53.740
Now the last thing that I want to put in the head tag is a function call W.P. underscore head.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.460
Right.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.470
And what that does is that puts any additional information that is needed into the head.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:06.570
So when you install a plug in and let's say it needs to include a stylesheet or need to do something

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.440
in the head.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.990
This is where it'll come out.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.110
OK so when you when they create plug ins you can have stuff pop out right in the head.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.870
All right.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:21.090
So if we look at the source code here you'll see that we have a bunch of other stuff now and this is

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.600
all coming from that W.P. head.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:30.490
If I go ahead and take that out and go back and reload it just gives us just what we have here.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.860
All right so you're going to need that W.P. head.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.420
So that part of the template is done in the next video we're going to start to build out the body.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:47.210
I'll show you how to grab posts to create menus and so on.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.880
All right so I'll see you in the next video
