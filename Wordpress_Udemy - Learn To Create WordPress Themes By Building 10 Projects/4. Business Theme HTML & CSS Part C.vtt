WEBVTT

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.810
All right so we are almost done with the HTL template or we need to do now is just style it.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.910
So we want to go to our style CSSA And let's start with the body.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.390
OK.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:24.080
So I want to add a font size here of 15 pixels are going to set the color to gray which will be seven

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.440
a seven a seven day.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:37.110
And we're going to set a line height of 1.7 m OK.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.500
Now all of the links are going to have a green color which matches the logo.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:55.110
So it's for her just adding a tag here and say color and then the main color is going to be zero F A

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.190
F 9:7 k.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.550
Now we also want that color for all of the primary buttons.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:16.130
So we're going to add DTN dash primary and set the background to that color.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.830
And then we also want the color of the text to be white.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.370
OK we also want the border color to be white

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.160
OK see if those changed.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.940
OK.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.710
Now for the Nav..

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.330
You can see it's still blue.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.560
I'm going to just play something in here it's kind of stubborn we have to add a bunch of classes.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.700
So let me just

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.200
let's go right here and a pace to sing K because we want all of these classes

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.240
and set the background to that green color.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.510
So now if we go and reload now it's green came if we hover over other links it's going to be like gray

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.210
.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.350
So let's move on to the Jumbotron.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.240
We have quite a bit to do there.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:32.070
We're going to go down right here and let's say Dortch jumbotron and we're going to align everything

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.990
to the center.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:48.000
We're going to add a border bottom and that's going to be one pixel solid and it's two E-5

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.420
right.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.610
So next let's do.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.780
I'm going to add some padding.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:05.850
We're going to say palang top 90 pixels and also padding the bottom will also do 90 pixels.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.130
Now we're going to have a background image so say background which would be that you are l.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.700
OK and here we're going to say dot dot slash image slash banner dot.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.800
Jay peg.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.670
Ok now I'm going to just adjust the position a little bit will say 0 and then negative 80 pixels.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.310
So that's just going to bring it up a little bit.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.080
And then the last thing we want to do here is set the color to white.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.440
All right.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.670
So let's go in and reload.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.660
Now we have an issue here.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:54.060
We want the the jumbotron in the image to to go across the entire page not end here like the rest of

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.350
the template.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.420
So let's take a look at our age team I'll

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.730
see you on index and if we go down to where we have the Jumbotron.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.410
Well actually what I did here.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.540
Well what it had.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.350
By default when we used the demo template it has a container going around the entire site.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.920
And I don't want that.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.410
So I'm going to get rid of that.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.810
And then of course the ending div which is down at the bottom.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.160
All right.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.270
We actually don't need this either.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.990
So let's save that and take a look at it.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.130
OK.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.600
So in some areas it's going it's extending further where we don't want it to.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:53.340
Such as the heading here as well as these boxes not the footer or these widgets because they have their

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.550
own container.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:02.520
If we look at let's say the content region 2 and content region 1 they have the container class so we

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.340
just need to add a container to the heading as well as the box area.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.630
So let's go up here and we have our header.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.390
We're just going to add in a container.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.610
All right.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.350
So take a look at that case you can see everything now pushed to the middle.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.440
Now for the boxes area which is right here will do the same thing

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.870
.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.130
They reload that and now everything is pushed in except for the geometry.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.870
Now I do want the text in all that content to be restricted just not the background so what we'll do

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.510
is we'll do the same thing with the Jumbotron.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.990
OK we want to go inside the div here and then call the container

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:23.370
.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.230
And there we go.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:35.370
So let's go back to the C Ss and actually you know what the button here.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.900
I want that to have a primary class ok by default it had success.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.110
Let's just change that to primary.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.370
That'll change the color to the correct green and also give us the white.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.810
Now if you notice when I hover over it we get a blue when I don't want that.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.040
So let's go up to where we have the button primary.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.950
And we're going to save between primary and hover.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:16.850
So what I want is I want that to have a background of white and then we'll change the color to that

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.750
green color

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.720
as well as the border to that color.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.350
OK so now we go and hover.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.990
Now it's just white.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.170
All right.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.530
Actually this needs to be border color.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.880
Now I also want to have a class to reverse it to have this be the regular state and then nappie the

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.270
hover.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:56.210
So what I can do is copy that save button primary reverse we'll take what we have here.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.850
Paste that in and then we'll take what we have here

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:10.480
piece in here and then we'll just change this to reverse OK.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.870
We do want to take this off so the color white.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.200
So now it's move along to these boxes.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.460
Now each one has a class of block.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.050
So let's do the block class.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:29.770
OK.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.810
Block is going to have a border

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:48.170
and going to set some padding here we're going to say 20 20 30 20 and we want to just move everything

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.800
to the center.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.460
And then for the age three saved are age three.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.080
We're going to set that color to the green.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:09.240
So see this right here.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.350
All right let's go ahead and take a look.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.160
All right so that didn't change anything.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.500
That's a little weird.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.060
Let's see let's school back.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.500
Did I not do the block.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.270
No they don't have the block class.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:32.210
All right so in this where we have the boxes we want each one to be wrapped in a block class

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:40.260
.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.570
There's one

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.520
two

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.570
and there's three.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.940
They go back reload and there we go.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.750
Now for the icon we have to make those bigger.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.890
Remember we gave each one the class of F.A. three.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.180
So what we'll do is we'll say f a theory

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.810
and we're going to set font size to 4 am and we're going to leave it important.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:36.380
K now the all the icons we also want the color to be that green.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:42.550
So we're going to say hey we're going to set the color to green.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.180
All right.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.170
So things are looking a lot better.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:54.710
Now we want to move on to these widget areas and I'm just going to paste in a couple things here.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:11:02.240
So content or region one would just adding the green background color white text to line center to and

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:09.780
then we're also doing a three which has a black background too has a white gray black background.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.740
So we save that.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.910
Now you can see we have the green background.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:26.420
Now we want the marketing class to have some margin so let's do that when we go right here and say marketing

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:35.340
margin is going to be 40 pixels zero.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:44.340
OK so that adds some margin here and lets put some margin on the bottom.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.790
Actually you know what I don't want margin on the bottom here.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.880
These two are going to be right on top of each other.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.380
All right so let's fix that.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:06.500
I want to set content region to image or set with to 100 percent

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:19.030
that in-work content region to oh I forgot the dash.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:25.670
All right so now we need some padding here so let's get a copy.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.790
I mean I'm going to paste in all my padding classes.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.380
OK.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:37.490
So we have padding top and bottom from 20 to 60 pixels.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.160
All right so that looks much better.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.720
Now I just want to add some styles for the content region headings.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:56.660
So this is for a content region 3 h for this one here is for one and two H ones k just zero padding

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.830
and margin.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:03.380
Font size is going to be 40 K now.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:11.600
Down here in the Forder the footer is actually going to be content region 3 so I don't think I put that

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.130
in here.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.360
Malik.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.410
No I didn't.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.810
So right here we have the flooder.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.680
We're going to add on to the class here.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.910
We're going to say content region 3.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:32.030
And then let's do padding top 30 and padding bottom 40.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.810
OK.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.910
Now we have this little bit of white down here and that's coming from the body type.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:51.260
So body going to get rid of this padding bottom 20 and that should fix that.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:56.250
Now for the footer form here I'm going to just style that.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.450
So we're going to paste that in here.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:09.070
OK so I'm just saying content region 3 form input that is text as well as text area.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.220
And we're just setting some padding background things like that.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.690
OK so that looks a lot better.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:27.920
All right so now if we visit the about page now we have to make some changes on the above page just

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.230
like we did on index you can see that the should be going out all the way.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.410
And the reason for that is that we have the container wrapped around the whole page.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:43.210
So go ahead and fix that.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:50.570
See as each team melts open about and we're just going to get rid of this container

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:57.040
.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:02.070
All right let's reload.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.080
OK.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:09.540
And now we just need to add the container to the to the head area to the header

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.850
which is here

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:28.730
.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:36.380
Now in the actual word press theme you only have one header and one footer so you won't have to do this

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:36.400
.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:43.200
But I just want to fix this just so you have it and then in the footer we need to add a couple of classes

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.500
that are here.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:57.230
So we're going to add content region 3 and then we want padding top.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.310
What was it 30 and then 40

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.640
right

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.310
now for the side widget.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.190
I'm also going to paste in some classes for that or some styles for that I should set and some of this

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.570
stuff will change a little bit when we actually build the word press theme.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:24.780
OK.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.280
So you can see it put the line for the the heading.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.780
Now we're going have the same issue with the blog.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.700
Let's see.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.710
So these what I'll do is copy what we just did.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.330
For instance the footer class.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.560
Let's take that

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.050
in let's open blog each tiem now.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:54.080
And also single each team now and let's add the for our class

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:03.020
.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.000
OK.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:15.050
And then we're going to also remove the container that wraps around the whole thing.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.030
And then we want to add a container to the head

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:35.080
.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.060
Right.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.110
OK so that looks good.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.580
Oh the titlebar we need to add some styles for that

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.330
piece that line

00:17:53.340 --> 00:18:01.670
curly and then let's see what else we're going to need some new styles for this for the men and for

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.120
the rest of the post.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.050
So let's paste those in.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:14.430
OK so the article posted self we have a border bottom overflow padding.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.370
And then for that matter we're going to add a border to the top and bottom.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.520
Let's see what else for the list items in the meadow we want those to float to the left and display

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.510
in line and then the image is going to be 100 percent.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.680
OK so let's go ahead and reload and there we go.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.120
So it's pretty good.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:42.940
And then the single page we also need to get rid of that container that's going around the whole template

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.470
and then we should be all set.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.190
I believe

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:56.290
it will add a container to the head.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.610
I know we should have done this earlier but it's all right

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.300
.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.290
And there we go.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:18.620
All right so that's our Each team on template looks pretty good in the next video we're going to start

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.650
.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:23.300
And we're going to start to convert this into a WordPress theme.
