00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.810
It's in the last video we went ahead and implemented the showcase.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.620
Customize your options so we can now edit the showcase.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.840
Also the social icons and social buttons.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.520
Now what I want to do is work on the banner down here as well as the animation.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.360
All right now the animation right now works where using animated CSSA that's really easy to implement

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.650
.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.240
What I want to have an option to actually shut it off.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.260
So we're going to do that as well.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.530
All right.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.190
So let's start with the banner.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.700
Now I'm going to open up inside of the ink folder we have customized dot p p.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.530
We're going to go down to the bottom of this function and add a new section.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.540
So I'm going to paste this in.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.650
This is the bottom banner section.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.670
OK we're adding it using WP customize add section just like we did with the the ones above.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.390
All right.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.730
Now this is going to have a background image settings just like the Showcase area.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.290
So we're going to paste that in.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.650
We have the setting and then we have the control.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.170
OK we're using this W.P. customized image control just like we did in the showcase.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.150
We're also going to have an area for the heading of the banner.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.390
So put that in there

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.570
and that's it for the band or that's all we need are those two settings so let's save that.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.380
And if we go to the customize or in the back end we should now have a bottom banner section and we can

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.840
create the end we can upload the image and we can change the heading.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.060
All right so let's implement these on the front end.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.630
We're going to go to p p and we want to go to right here where we have this banner style and I'm just

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.760
going to replace this with the dynamic version.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.080
OK so we're just getting the R from get the mod and then banner image and then the default.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.910
We're just pointing to the template you are l and then to the banner image.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.200
All right.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.710
We're still using the no repeat center center options.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.190
Now for the banner heading we're going to save that and then go into the forward file and down to where

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.710
we have.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.050
Or is it right here.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.640
OK.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.660
So we're going to replace the static hatting

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.020
with that.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.230
So get the mod banner heading and then just the default text that you want save that it's go to the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.140
front end and reload.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:50.150
You can see we have the default options if we go to the back end and let's go to bottom banner and let's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.390
remove the US we'll just say follow on social media reload and you can see that that's coming from the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.570
customized.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.240
All right.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.760
Now for the animation that's actually going to be pretty easy.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.650
We're going to go into the header file and we're just going to create a conditional that's saying if

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.770
it's enabled then we want this anime dot CSSA to be included.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.510
If not then we won't.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.980
All right but before we can do that we need to add the actual section.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.230
All right so we're going to add a new section here in our customize.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.260
And this is going to be a miscellanea.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.930
So if you have any other things that you want to include as far as the customize or you could put them

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.260
in here.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.330
OK.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:44.970
So calling it Misc and then we're going to paste in the the animation option.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:54.330
OK so we have the setting which is called animation or setting the default to 1 and then down here with

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.490
our control we're going to use this W.P. customized control.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.850
All right.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.210
And you want to make sure that you use type checkbox.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.650
All right.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.320
And let's see.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.200
Yeah that should do it.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.250
So let's save that.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.600
And now in the back end we should see a new section misc options and we have a naval animation which

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.550
by default is checked because we set the default to 1.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.900
So now we want to do is go back to the header.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.740
And like I said we're just going to have a conditional statement here and we're just going to say

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:49.290
if we say if get theme mod and we want the animation option to fall it will be 1.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.630
So if it's enabled then this link is going to be included.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.820
So save it by default.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.290
It should be enabled.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:10.770
So you can see the animations enabled if we go back and reload this first and then uncheck it save go

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.770
back reload and see there's no animation.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.600
All right so that's working.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:26.510
So our customize our area is complete in the next video we're going to work on the front page.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.820
And we're also going to create a page for our blog
