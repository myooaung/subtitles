00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.640
Hello and welcome to your first WordPress theme project this project will be a little different than

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.320
the rest because it's going to be sort of an introductory project I'm going to show you how to install

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.700
and set up WordPress so that you can have a fresh installation to work with.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.430
Now we will be creating a theme but we'll be focusing more on the code and the overall look than the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.170
overall look and style.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.490
All right.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.340
So creating the files and folders where and what php the code to add things like that.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.550
I want to get you familiarized with the p code and then after that we can add some simple style.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.110
Now as far as an environment there's a lot of different ways you can run WordPress you may have your

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.120
own server set up if you don't you can use something like amps which is what I'll be using.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.480
Gives you an Apache server ph P and my s.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.210
Q Well all on your local machine zapper X samples is very similar.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500
You could use that you could use wimp.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.940
There's also map for Mac.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.950
There's a lot of different choices but if you want to use amps like I am you can go to amps dot com

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.340
.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.830
Just go ahead and download it.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.940
It's available for Windows Mac and Linux.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.120
Pretty easy to get set up.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.510
All right.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.880
Now I don't have WordPress installed so we're going to go through and do that together although most

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.850
of you probably already know how to do this.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.200
OK.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.370
So I'm at Wordpress dot org going to go ahead and download the package and I'm going to go to my server

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.690
route.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:39.570
If you're using amps it should be should be in your C drive or you or your root drive.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.630
And in amps and actually you know what I think the default is in your program files.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.250
But I set it up in my drive in amps and then there's a WDW folder that's the hosting route.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.400
So I'm going to create a folder here called W.P. themes.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.690
And that's going to be the folder that I'm going to install WordPress in.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:11.850
All right so let me just open up my downloads in search going to grab the word press package.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:21.840
Open that up and then just take everything from there into the project folder.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.760
OK so now we have the files.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.370
Now before we do anything here we need a database a minuscule database.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.500
If you installed amps are you using Samper or something like that.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.930
Then you most likely have Pietsch PMI admin that's what we'll be using.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.270
So you can go to a local host.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.260
What should be local host org.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.940
That's weird.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:55.480
We're going to go to HTP local host slash ph P my address.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.910
OK.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.210
And now we go to databases.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.180
We're going to create a new database.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.030
And I call it W.P. themes create case.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.630
Now we have an empty database.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.310
Now we're going to go back to the files that we created or that we brought over from the Wordpress package

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.960
and you should have this W.P. config sample speech.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.130
Well we want to do is rename this to just W.P. config.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.720
You want to get rid of the dash sample.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.510
All right and then we're going to open that up and I'll be using sublime text as my editor.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.860
You can use whatever editor that you feel comfortable with.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.290
So what we're going to do here is change some things or add some things the D-B name.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:50.690
We're going to put right here which in my case is W.P. themes theme's the DBI user My user is root and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.950
the password you want to put whatever your password for your databases.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.540
All right the rest can stay the same.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.120
We're going to go ahead and save that.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.530
And then we should be able to go to

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.680
co-host slash W.P. things.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.860
OK.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.720
So now we can go ahead and run the installation site title.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:24.650
I'm just going to call W.P. actually just say a word press dev admin.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.640
You want to choose your password.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.640
I mean using a very weak password email

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.550
and install word press.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.720
OK.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.160
So success.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:51.480
Let's click on the log in that will take us to the admin log in and quote your username and password

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.070
in and it'll take you to your back end.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.730
OK we can go and say visit site.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.860
Open that in a new tab.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.280
And we have a brand new WordPress site.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.530
OK so this is what we'll be working with.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.990
So I'm sure you guys a lot of you guys have experience with wordpress.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.630
Basically we have our post area here where we can create and manage posts where we can have our categories

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.030
pages.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.630
So these are just Web site pages like let's say about us or services things like that I would go here

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.890
if we go to appearance and we click on themes that shows us the installed themes.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:44.040
By default we have 2014 2015 and 2016 which is the the one that's enabled but we will be creating a

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.910
new theme in the next video.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.930
OK so we'll get to that next.
