WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:09.210
All right so we have our front page almost done we have our customize or functionality complete now

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.780
we want to fix or not fix but implement the widgets down here at the bottom.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.790
So first thing we'll do is open up functions ph P and we're going to have to register or initialize

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.270
all of our widget locations.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:35.250
So let's go down here and say widget locations we're going to create a function here called init widgets

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:47.370
and that's going to take in an ID widget ID and then we're going to say register underscore sidebar

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.800
.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.360
Even if it's not a sidebar widget you still use register sidebar and that takes in an array.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.640
Let's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.610
say we want to give it a name.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:13.210
And this is going to be called content 3 Region 1 the next.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:24.770
Next we're going to need an ID and that's going to be same thing just in lowercase and no spaces.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.410
And then we can do before widget

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.810
and after we do

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.120
we can do the same thing with the title.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.380
So we'll say before title

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.760
and after title

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.990
now what we want to put here before widget is the markup that we have in our page.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:20.850
So if we go to front page and go down to right here this is this is the way that we're going to get

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.090
from here all the way to here.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.760
Okay and this is what we want before the widget So what's cut it out and we're going to go and put that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.260
right here

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.580
.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.120
Let's just put these on the same line.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.000
OK.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.940
I'm actually going to just make this wider.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.440
OK.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.830
So that's before Widgeon now after we'll take this

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.200
and we'll put that after widget

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.960
.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.380
Now before title I think it an.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.070
One has an H1 So that's all put here

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.410
and we'll save that.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.430
Now all we need to do.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.700
All we need here now is the dynamic sidebar call and just going a pace that in.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.660
OK.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.090
So what it's doing is it's checking to see if there's any widgets in that position.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.500
And if there is then it's going to display it.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.980
And it's also going to include the markup that we put in before and after widget.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.940
So now what we'll do is the content region too.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.230
So we're going to be doing the same thing let's copy this

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.780
and this will be content Region 2.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.540
Now for the before and after that that's going to be a little different.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.810
So let's get rid of that.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.360
OK.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.110
So let's see what we got here.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.570
We want to take this

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.700
now I'm not going to include this 5 column in seven column.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.440
This isn't going to be part of the widget.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.270
This can go inside the actual widget in the back end but all we want here is this.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.890
So we'll take that and we'll put it right here.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.670
Since it's only a section in a div that's what we need at the end as well.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.810
So this will be a div section.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.740
All right in the H-1 can stay there.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:08.960
So now all you do is copy that with their right here change this to two.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.260
OK.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.610
And then this content here we're we're going to need to put in the widget in the back end.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.140
But I'm just going to get rid of it for now

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.560
.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.220
All right.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.830
So save that now.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.570
We have our widgets but we didn't do the action so let's say add action

00:05:49.560 --> 00:06:00.220
and this is going to be widgets to net and then net widgets.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.690
OK so let's go to the back end and see if we can actually see these.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.810
OK.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.810
So if you look down in appearance we carry this widget option and we have content regt. one in content

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.980
region 2.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.290
So for our content region 1 I'm going to bring over a text paste in that paragraph and then here we'll

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.710
just say clean bootstrap

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.240
WordPress theme save it and then for a content region too.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:44.430
I'm also going to bring over a text and for this let's see we're going to do.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.050
Actually I'm just going to paste in the markup.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.810
All right.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.560
And this is just what we had in the template were the five column with an image we have a 7 column with

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.400
the theme features so save that k.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:10.360
Now if we go to the front end now the stuff here should be coming from the the widget.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.630
So just to test it out say clean word press just say test

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.390
load and test.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.380
All right.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.640
So that takes care of those two widgets.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:35.080
Now we also have the footer widgets we need to take care of so let's go back to our functions P2P file

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:41.470
and get a copy of this and this will be called

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:54.490
for one change this two for one.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.800
Now before and after the widget we're not going to have anything.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.610
And then down here we're just going to have each 4s.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.980
OK.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.870
So copy that.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:20.650
This will be two and this will be three it's easy enough.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.290
Now back in action let's go in for her Ph p.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:37.080
And we're just going to replace these for column divs with a 4 column div with the dynamic widget.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.310
So we get that we get that

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.270
in this

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.220
.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:58.620
This will be for two and this will be for free.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.560
Save it.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:06.430
And if we go and reload we get nothing down here because we need to add those widgets so let's do that

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.020
.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:16.610
So now we have for one two and three let's bring a text over the foot or one and I'll just say Helling

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:26.800
I'm just going to paste in some text save it and then for for to also bring over text

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.560
say having this here is just going to be an honored list.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:41.560
Save that and then for her three text

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.420
and this will just be a simple form.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.560
Now you can put whatever you want in these widgets you don't have to do what I'm doing.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.560
You don't have to use just a text you could put any of these widgets you could install another widget

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.350
and put that in there wherever you like.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.730
All right.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.160
So let's go ahead and reload and there we go.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.490
So these three are now coming from our widget system.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:17.470
So the home page is now done in the next video we're going to start to move on to the blog index page

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.730
and we'll go from there.
