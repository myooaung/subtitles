00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.500
All right so we're going to be doing now is we want to work on the archive page.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.910
Because if we go let's say to click one of these categories it's going to look like this which isn't

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.580
what we want.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:22.930
So it's created a new file and we're going to call it archive Daut ph.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.330
All right.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.480
And and we copy everything we have in the single dot PSAP file and then paste it in.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.640
As fine as far as how these are formatted.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.030
It's going to be formatted like the popular.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.340
OK.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.640
This right here.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.950
So what I going to do is I'm going to clear everything that's in the while loop

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.740
.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.770
All right.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.070
And let's put it to you well right here.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.910
Give it a class

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.330
and styled

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.290
and then right under the end while we're going to close that well.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.430
All right.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.530
And then we're going to jump over to index Peachtree and go where we have the popular pose which is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:30.610
right here and we're going to grab everything in here and in the Alhaj copy it and then go and pasted

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.210
it in this while loop.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.380
All right so let's save that and then let's go back to an archive page and now it looks like this.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.070
OK let's add a heading up here.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.550
Now since it's an archive there's many different types.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:55.040
So we're going to use the the if statement that we've been using all along for archive pages.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.440
Let's go right here and put it in H2

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.000
and then we're going to paste the sin.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.760
So it's just checking for the different types of archive's category author tag and so on.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.790
All right so now if we go back and reload now we get business.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.500
Click on entertainment you get entertainment click on one of these gives us the archived by day.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.530
What else.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.020
Actually no that should be by month

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.500
.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.470
This will be by year.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.540
OK now if I create if I click on the user we get all the posts by that user as well.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.740
All right so that's that.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.430
Now we also want the search to work and the search results should look just like that archive.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.360
So we're going to create a new file save it as search dog THP and we're going to copy everything that's

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.820
in the archive and paste that in its search.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:13.470
Except for the header the heading we want to get rid of this and we'll just have it say search results

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.630
.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.690
OK.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.500
And then the search form itself if we go to index PDP

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.200
and we look at the form all we need is we're going to have actually add a fourth form tag because we

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.950
don't have that

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.650
we're going to add a few things we need a method so method will be get.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.960
And then we need action.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.980
So here we're going to see ph P Ecko and then we're going to escape.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:17.890
You are all in here we're going to add home you are l and we're at as a parameter slash.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.180
Now make sure you have the name of the input as ass so that it works.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.550
All right we'll save that.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:34.830
And then let's go into one of our posts and let's just write the word Hello.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.770
All right.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.980
And then from the front end let's go and type in Hello.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.870
And there we go.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.550
I already had an article with the word hello in it as well.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.700
So that looks good.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.520
Now we have the form only on the home page.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.880
I also I want it to be on the search results as well.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.340
So let's just grab it right here in the index and go to search PSAP.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.490
And then we're just going to add that to the top.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.360
All right so then when we search we still get the input box at the top.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.500
All right so we're just about there.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.700
We just need to do the page now because if we click on let's say about this is what it looks like.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:36.480
So let's go and create a new file save it as Page dog HP and we're going to copy what we have in single

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.220
Daut ph and paste that in.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.230
And then let's get rid of this.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:49.170
MEDVEDEV You can get rid of this thumbnail post area

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.510
get rid of the comments template and I think that's it.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.780
So if we go now reload we have a simple about page.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.200
All right.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.840
So that's it guys are W.P. news theme is now complete.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.210
All right so hopefully you like this project and I'll see you in the next one.
