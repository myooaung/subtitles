00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.450
All right so in this video we're going to take a look at the single post page K so right now we have

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.550
this roll of post from our site but that's it.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.070
We can't we can't click on it and go to the individual post where we would have our comments and things

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.330
like that.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.900
All right so we're going to go ahead and do that.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.220
Let's go to index peech P and we're going to make the title clickable.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.890
OK we're going to add a link to the title so let's go into this H-3 right here.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.950
And that's an 8 Hagg

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.970
a wrap that around the title

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:52.330
and what we're going to put in here is very simple we're going to say peached P the permalink.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.240
All right.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.250
And let's save it reload.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.950
Now you see we have a link on the titles if I click that it takes us to that specific post.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.710
If we click on this one that takes us to that post.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.710
All right.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.800
Now I just want to add a little bit of style here I don't like the color of the links.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.010
I also want to make this bold and separate these a little bit.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.330
All right so it's good to wrap each post in its own div.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.660
So where we have this while right under it will say did actually put in an article

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.710
on that there that there.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.860
And then what's this.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.830
Say class equals post.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.310
All right.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.390
And then in our style sheet let's have

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.340
that and say color will be just the same as the text.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.770
All right.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.390
And then we can say Article Daut post.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.100
And let's just add a border to the bottom

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.170
case.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.680
Now they should have a border and that's good.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.630
OK now we have the title title has a link but we usually see some kind of read more button as well.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.570
So let's go ahead and add that all we have to do is just copy that.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.390
Put that right there.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.920
Is this the class of foughten.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.270
And then that's going on.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.230
What am I doing.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.150
We don't want to do that.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.790
We just want to put the text here so we'll say Read more.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.700
But I do want to give this a class Button.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.320
All right so now we should have a link that goes there as well.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.720
And so in here we'll say Article don't post a.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.430
And actually it's going to be a door button.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.740
And then what I want to do is just add a background

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.140
color will be white and padding.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.630
It's also add margin for them

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.190
.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.920
OK.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.480
We're going to have to put in the overflow here and say overflow.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.010
Hidden

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.660
in Lets make this button we're going to make this display as a block as an inline block

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.730
Cale's take the text decoration off as well.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.310
OK so we can now go to the single page.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.920
Now in the single page we don't want this to be a link.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.660
And that's that's kind of silly.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.410
So we want to change that.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.130
And there's going to be other things we want we're going to want to comment form as well.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:44.700
So we need to have a special page for single post so what we can do is create a new file in our theme

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.600
and we're going to just call it single dot ph p.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.080
All right.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.930
And let's just say test.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:58.560
So if we go back here now and reload we get test only on that if we go back to our main web site our

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.930
main post role here.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.810
It's fine but if we go to a single page we get that because it's automatically looking at this file

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.260
.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.740
So what we can do is use index ph P we can use that code as a starting point.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.700
If we post that in there and say it's going to go back to how it was now we can change whatever we want

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.720
here and it will only take effect on the single page so we can get rid of the link

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:36.130
k we can get rid of the read more we're obviously not going to want that.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.150
OK so now we have a single page.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.290
Let's make that matter.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.370
This right here I just want to add a little bit of style to that.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.980
Actually let's grab this

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:01.380
.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.430
There we go.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.120
OK.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.290
Actually I want some padding on the bottom of the post

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.920
not trying to go nuts with the styling because like I said I just want you guys to kind of learn the

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.810
code rather than how to create a great design.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.600
Will be getting into that later.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.110
So what I want to do next is I want to show you how to add an image to the post a featured image.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.510
Now if we go to the form to adipocytes and you look on the right side you don't see a featured image

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.800
box which you may have seen in other WordPress themes or other WordPress Web sites.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.720
The reason for that is we didn't include that functionality.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.870
So what we need to do is go into our theme folder and we're going to create a file and we're going to

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.450
save it as functions dot Ph.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.120
D.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.800
OK and this is where we can put custom functions where we can we can hook into certain parts of the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.380
code we can register widgets and do all that or basically anything dynamic.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.360
So what we're going to do here is we're going to create a set up function.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:30.930
Ok so it's a function simple themes set up and you can call this whatever you like actually.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:39.830
And in here it's a feature of the image support.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.260
OK so we want to use a function called add themes support

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.350
and then we want to pass into here post

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.000
thumbnails.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.820
All right.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.180
Now this function isn't going to run.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.250
If we leave it like this what we need to do is we need to use add action.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.510
And then there's certain hooks that we can hook into and run this function.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.940
So the one that we want is called after a set up theme.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.910
OK so we're going to put that in here after a set up theme.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:23.150
And then the second parameter will be the name of this function.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.450
All right.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:30.120
So that'll run or save it and now if we go back and reload this page now you'll see down at the bottom

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.580
we have a featured image box.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.880
All right.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.820
So if we click that we can go ahead and upload files.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.980
And let's see.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:48.380
You should have some blog images in your program files and then choose blog one and we're going to save

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:54.650
that and you can see it's down here and we can update now if we go to the front end and reload.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.510
We're not going to see it yet because we didn't add it to our index page file.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:06.330
OK so let's go to index PGE and you don't have to show it in index you could just show it in single

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:11.450
if you want but usually you want you want it to show on both pages.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:19.800
So in index Pietsch let's just put it right below the metta Larry and it's not going to look too great

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.260
at first but we'll fix that later on.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:32.070
So let's go right under the method and what we want to do is check to see if there is an image first

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.380
.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.010
OK so we can use the if statement

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.160
.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:49.260
And what we're going to do is we can say if has post thumbnail.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.000
OK.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:01.830
So if there is a thumbnail then let's create a div we'll give it a class of post Thum now

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:13.230
and in here we just want to say ph P to the post thumbnail

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.780
save it go back reload and there it is.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:31.080
Now it looks a little out of whack because it's not it's not it's not reaching 100 percent across the

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:37.190
page but we're actually going to put a sidebar in here and a little bit when we get to the widgets so

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.040
it will look a lot better when we do that.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.750
All right.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:49.200
But I am going to add a width of 100 percent in the CSSA case so we have this post this class post thumbnails

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:55.100
so let's go into our style sheet and we'll add that.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:06.680
So the image we want with to be 100 percent and then lets do height auto.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.620
All right so now it reaches across the whole page and I know that's really big.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.920
But like I said we'll get a sidebar in here and it will it will shrink that up a little bit.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.230
All right.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.710
Now we also want the image on this page.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.390
This is the single post page.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.190
So we're going to copy this

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:34.320
and go into single dog pee pee and put it in the same place right under the matter.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:42.120
All right so now we get it on the single page as well.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.780
Now the last thing I want to do in this video is Notice that in these posts on the index page it shows

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:54.180
the whole it shows all the content so if this was really long it would show right here and we don't

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.190
want that we want just a piece of the content to show.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.960
So what we can do is instead of saying let's go to index P and instead of saying the content we can

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.310
actually say that excerpt.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:08.670
All right.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.130
And what that'll do is it'll cut the content too.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.020
I think it's 55 55 words.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.410
All right.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:22.170
And you can actually customize that and make it as long or short as you want and that's actually really

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.270
easy we can go into functions ph P and create a custom function.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.080
Ok so we'll just say set

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.150
X serve Lanc.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.450
Oh I forgot to put the word function

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.090
and all we need to do here is just return a number.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:54.090
So let's say we wanted it to be 25 times and then what we can do is instead of an action we're going

00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:02.930
to say add filter because an action is usually used to add something or create something add filter

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.060
is usually used to change something.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:12.790
So the filter we want to hook into here is called excerpt length.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.580
OK.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:20.030
And then we just want to put in the name of our function which is set up

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.670
set excerpt like.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:32.130
And now if we go back and reload now you can see it's only 25 words long.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.410
All right.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:40.200
I actually want it a little longer let's say 60 K so I really didn't need to do that but I just wanted

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.510
to show you that that's possible.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:49.110
All right so we have our index page set up we have our single post page set up.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.760
Aside from the comments we're going to do that a little later but in the next video I'm going to show

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.260
you how we can create a menu and we can start dealing with pages as well as posts.
