00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:08.460
All right so in the last video we went ahead and set up our core template core theme with an index header

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.720
and footer file.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.600
And we also implemented the main post loop but we don't have anything else.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.010
We just have the title.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.210
We need to fix that.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.460
But before we do that I want to make it so that we can actually add images to our post because right

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.430
now if we don't we try to add a new post.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.880
We don't have a featured image area so we're going to have to create a function's dot ph P file.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.270
All right.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.060
And for now I'm just going to close all these out.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
OK so let's say new file and call it functions

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.490
Daut HP.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.970
And we're going to create Let's create a function and we're going to call it theme set up

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.190
with ad

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.800
featured image support.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:18.030
So I'll say add underscore theme underscore support and we want to post the thumbnails

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.090
and then underneath the function declaration we're going to say add action

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:42.530
and then and here we want to pass in the hook that we want which is going to be after set up theme.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.260
Okay.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:55.350
And then the function that we want to use is theme's set up.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.430
All right let's save that.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.960
And now if we go in reload now you can see we have a featured image area.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.700
So let's create a couple of categories first before we add a post.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.960
Let's say technology

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.520
let's say food

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.460
entertainment

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.140
business OK.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.520
I only want technology.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.720
OK so for the title we'll just say blog post one and I'm going to grab some text from larm of some pace

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.750
that in.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.710
And then we need to select a featured image so I'm going to choose.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.350
You should have these in your in your program files project files.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:04.690
But I'm going to choose this image of the Microsoft Surface and set feature that image and publish.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.640
OK if we go back and we reload you can see that it is seeing that post but it doesn't look too good

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.080
.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:24.060
All right so let's add one more I'll say add new Subi blog post to paste and text in lets choose food

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.320
for a category and then upload an image.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.720
We're going to choose the burger image

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.160
and publish.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.650
All right so now we have a couple of posts to work with and we have kind of an issue here because we're

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.240
putting the image in its own column inside of the post and some posts aren't going to have images.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.820
For instance the hello world post does not have an image so we need to have some kind of conditional

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.150
where we'll say if this post has an image then whatever format it a certain way and then we'll do one

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.730
else and if it doesn't have an image we'll formatted a certain way.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.500
So let's go into our index file and we're going to make this a little bigger.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.020
OK so we have our loop here we have a row we just indent this a little.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.230
All right so what we'll do is right after the first use me right after the row div is where we're going

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.340
to check to see if there is an image.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.860
So we'll say ph P if it has a post thumbnail

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.780
down here

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.350
will say ph P else.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:13.060
They're let's do ph P and F K so if there is a thumbnail then it's going to show this which is a three

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.160
column and a 9 column but if there is no thumbnail then we want it to be a full 12 column.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.160
OK.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.570
So turn that to 12.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.820
Get rid of that.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.520
So start with posts that have the thumbnail I'm going to get rid of this text.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:43.830
And what we'll do here is create a div with a class of post.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.060
OK.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:56.420
And here we can say the post thumb.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.780
All right so let's take a look at that so far.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.740
OK so it's showing the images there in Simi big but that's all right.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.350
The functionality is there.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.050
You only want to do is I'm going to wrap the post in an article tag.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.460
We're going to go right inside the while loop.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.640
It'll say article and we're going to give it a class of toast

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.960
and we want to end that down here.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.340
OK.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:49.530
And now we'll go into our style CSSA folder our file in the let's say Article Daut host image and when

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.910
to set the width

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.380
to 100 percent OK it's going to be 100 percent of its container.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:11.250
We're also going to set the height to auto in let's do margin top 30 pixels.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.070
OK so that looks much better.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:25.740
Now let's go back to index and back to we want to go right here where we have this title.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.500
Now we want the title to be a link.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:37.290
All right so let's go right here and let's put it in a tag K and then that's going to go to.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.000
We want to echo the permalink.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.560
Right.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.360
And that should be a link to that to that post

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.960
.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.480
Right.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:06.240
Now under the age 2 we're going to put our meta data so we'll put this in a paragraph will give a class

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.870
of matter.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.780
And so let's see

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:25.470
let's say posted at and then we can get the time by using p p the time

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.080
we'll say on and then we'll do the date

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.310
.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.890
Let's say by open up some strong tags

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.850
in here we want the the author's name.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.970
Excuse me.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.660
So say ph P the author.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.980
And that should be a function.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:12.120
So let's make sure that's working which it is Cagan see it's telling us the time of the date and also

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.130
the author.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.430
And this is a link if I click on it takes us to that page or that post.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.260
Now what we want is the excerpt of the content but not all of it we're going to use excerpts instead

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.000
of content because that will give us it'll truncate it.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.770
All right so let's go

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:44.300
we want to still be in the 9:00 column divs or the rendered under this paragraph and let's say div.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.390
Class

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.660
excerpt.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.020
And then let's do ph p.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:03.250
Go get the X sir.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.780
OK let's see if that works right.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.920
It looks good.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.360
Now we will also want to read more button.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:25.320
So we're going to go right under that let's say a class or use bootstrap class PTEN and then DTN default

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.480
.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:34.740
Let's see if we can set that to the permalink

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:40.160
.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.570
Right.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:54.480
And then for the text say three more and for the arrow symbol we can use ampersand.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:54.960
Ari.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.130
Q You o semi-colon.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.940
All right so let's take a look at that.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.430
And there we go.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.700
Let's put a line break right above it all.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.190
So now we want to do is take care of the posts that don't have an image.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.730
OK right now the hello world post doesn't and it's not showing up because we haven't put any any code

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.710
in that yet.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.200
All right so let's go.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.550
Where is it we're checking for the thumbnail here.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.550
And we say owls.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.560
And then this.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:42.000
This is where the code for the post without an image will go so what we'll do here is let's put the

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.500
title.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.330
So I'm going to grab this

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.630
copy

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.280
and then we want.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.020
Actually we'll just copy the rest of it.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:05.250
So the Medek the metaclass here the X server and the button or the link.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.490
So copy that and put that right under the title.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.390
All right let's see what that gives us.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:15.820
All right.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.270
So now we can have post without images and not have just an empty space.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:27.780
All right if we didn't do the conditional then this would just have an empty space where the image was

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.510
supposed to go.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.060
OK now I want to add a little bit of CSSA to make this look a little better.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:46.470
So let's go to style C Ss ants Let's see let's do article dot posts.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:59.750
And I want to put a border on the bottom of each post so this will be gray solid and one pixel right

00:12:59.820 --> 00:12:59.970
.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:12.320
And let's add some padding padding bottom 20 and margin bottom 30.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.620
OK but the last one the last article or post we don't want to have a border.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:30.260
So what we can do is say Article door post and then use last child to target that last one and we'll

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:36.860
set the border for them to none.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:48.620
So the meta data or I also want to have a little bit of style so see article dot Post dot matter.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.730
And we're going to give it a background.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:59.590
This will give the background a very light right.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:07.230
And let's see we're also going to have to add a little padding.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:13.830
People say 8 pixels by 12 pixels.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:19.450
And let's say color will make it a dark gray.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.510
So save that and reload.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.210
And now that looks a little better.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:33.120
So we're going to go ahead and stop here and in the next video I want to get the nav bar set up with

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.120
the custom Walker class.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.200
All right so we'll get into that next.
