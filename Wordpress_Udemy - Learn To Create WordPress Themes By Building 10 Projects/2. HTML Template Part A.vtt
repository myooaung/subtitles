WEBVTT

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.920
All right so we're going to jump in now and start to create our theme.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.750
But before we get into WordPress we're going to first map out and just create the design using HDMI

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.720
and see SS Okay.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.600
So usually when you're building a WordPress theme or a droop for Joomla theme something like that you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.780
can usually create the design first using just static HDMI out in the process.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.050
So what I have here is just an empty folder called Advanced W.P. aged him out and we're going to create

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.830
a couple of files here.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.520
First we're going to create an index dart HTL file and we'll create our style sheet which will just

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.540
be style Dotsie assets.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.020
All right.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.720
So let's go ahead and open these with sublime

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:04.470
and we're just going to add in our core HMO markup here for a title will say advanced W.P. theme and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.280
I'd see we're going to put in a link to our style sheet

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.720
and put in HGF attribute that's going to go to style dot css.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.810
All right.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.600
And then down in the body we're going to create our mock up to do the header.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:40.440
They we're using each team of five syntax or using a header tag and let's create a div with the class

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.490
of container

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.080
and then inside that we're going to have an H one.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:59.790
And I will just say in advance WordPress theme of course when we actually create the Wordpress theme

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.170
this will be dynamic and you will be able to change it from within the admin area.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.500
But for now we're just going to stick some static text in there.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.940
All right.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.770
Now let's see next to the H-1 we're going to have another div and we're going to give this the class

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.350
of H right for head are right.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.000
And this is where our search forms are going to go.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.150
So for now we'll just put a form tag and an input

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:45.450
will give it a placeholder we'll just say search.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.090
All right.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.960
So that's the header.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.570
So let's go underneath that.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.470
Now we're going to create navigation.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.420
I mean these are now tagged with the class of NAV.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.390
Actually that's too.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.010
Yeah will do.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.200
Nav. in them will do me now.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.050
All right.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.730
And then here we're going to have a well

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.500
actually outside the well I want to do a div with the class container just to move everything towards

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.100
the center

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.910
.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.890
And then here will put some ally tags and some links

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:45.230
.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.730
Ok will do.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:04:04.200
Home about let's say Services real changes to about's we're not actually going to have a services page

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.500
.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.710
I will do one about page just so we have some perspective on using on an page.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.770
So index will be the the post the blog posts about will be just regular page.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.560
OK so that's the navigation underneath that.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:32.960
Let's do DiVall give it a class of container and let's also give it a class of content.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.910
And then inside there we're going to have

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.390
the div it's going to have class Main and we're also going to give it a class of block

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.550
and block is going to be a class that we can use all around the site we can use it for widgets as well

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.910
.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.260
It's just going to have some padding and also border.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:06.000
Right now in here we're going to have our main post so each post will have an article tag with a class

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.950
of post.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:20.340
Ok so in here we're going to have a paragraph that's going to have a class of matter and that's where

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.510
things like the date of the Post the author name things like will go.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.130
All right.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.640
And like I said this might change a little bit as far as the format when we actually build the Wordpress

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.500
theme.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:43.290
For now we're just going to say posted at 11 o'clock on May 9th by admin.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.760
OK so it all looks something like that.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.960
And then we just need some content.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.560
Actually we need a title.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.220
Yeah the title should actually go right here.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:02.130
So for the title put an age to it was just a blog post one.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.360
And then let's just get some content real quick.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.700
It's

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.280
just going to generate some warm ipsum

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.520
and I'm just going to add subparagraph paragraph tags to this

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.120
.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.060
All right so there's our content.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.410
So next thing we need after that is a read more button.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.790
So we're going to do a link.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.750
We're going to give it a class of foughten.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.150
It's not going to go anywhere for now.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.470
All right.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:07.740
And then what I'll do is copy this article post and we'll just pasted two more times

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.180
.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.640
All right.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.190
So we want to take a look at it.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.660
It's not going all too pretty yet.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.690
All right.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.070
So now we'll do a footer.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:40.070
So we want to go to the end of this this div right here which should be the last day of the.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.110
And then we'll do is we'll put a foot or tag.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.310
And let's give this a class as well.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.680
A main footer.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.000
And that's going to have a container

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.230
and in the container.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.550
We're going to have a left side and a right side of the footer.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:10.620
So say give class left.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.390
I don't know why the my my editor stopped indenting on its own not sure what's going on that

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.130
day.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.050
So be f right.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:26.920
OK.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:37.100
So on the left side we're just going to have a paragraph that will have a copyright.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:52.310
And then on the right side we're actually going to have another menu.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.890
So I'm going to copy what we have up here.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.270
When I copy just the UL

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.710
I will put that right there

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:14.520
.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:21.460
So that should do it as far as the markup for the each team now area of a foreigner down there.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:29.190
It looks pretty horrible but that's because we have no styling in the next part of this section or this

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.020
lecture.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.740
We're going to add the CSX.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.410
OK so I will see you then.
