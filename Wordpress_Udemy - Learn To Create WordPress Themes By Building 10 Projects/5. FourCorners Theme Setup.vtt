00:00.740 --> 00:07.730
All right so we have our HTL template down now we're going to convert it into a WordPress theme.

00:07.740 --> 00:14.480
All right so I have a default WordPress installation set up I didn't add or change anything.

00:14.610 --> 00:21.870
And what I'm going to do is go and create first I'm going to add it to my project and Sublime Text.

00:22.350 --> 00:29.380
OK so I'm just going to add the whole WordPress site which I have at Wordpress for P.

00:29.490 --> 00:35.250
OK and then we're going to go to content themes and let's create a new folder.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.260
We're going to call it four corners.

00:39.840 --> 00:49.620
OK and inside there we're going to create our style dot C Ss and are also going to create our index

00:50.320 --> 00:53.010
page P in the style sheet.

00:53.010 --> 00:58.200
Let's add our comment block for the declaration.

00:58.200 --> 01:04.660
So the theme name is four corners.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.010
The author is me or you

01:11.300 --> 01:13.430
for you or my

01:21.230 --> 01:23.570
let's see description.

01:26.540 --> 01:39.520
Just a simple and clean word first thing in version 1.0.

01:40.570 --> 01:41.120
OK.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.640
So that is our declaration.

01:43.660 --> 01:51.910
If we save that should be able to go to our backend and go to appearance themes and you should see it

01:51.910 --> 01:52.330
here.

01:52.330 --> 01:58.480
Now I'm going to paste in my screenshot so you see

02:04.940 --> 02:05.470
OK.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.010
So we're going to paste it right in here.

02:09.470 --> 02:12.350
And then if we reload we can see the screen shot.

02:12.350 --> 02:17.000
So let's go ahead and activate it and if we go to the front end to reload we're going to just get a

02:17.000 --> 02:18.550
blank white page.

02:18.940 --> 02:21.050
OK so let's bring what we need to.

02:21.050 --> 02:30.150
Over to the fold or so I'm going to open up the h t m l folder and the actual theme folder.

02:30.340 --> 02:35.170
K so C Ss we want to bring that entire folder over.

02:35.180 --> 02:42.590
Actually we want to bring that one to bring Faunce and J.S. paste that in.

02:42.590 --> 02:42.920
All right.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.160
Now for the app CSX what I'm going to do is open that up.

02:47.180 --> 02:54.050
I'm going to copy everything in it and then paste it in our theme style C Ss and save it and then we

02:54.050 --> 02:59.080
can go ahead and just delete that out Dotsie ss.

02:59.330 --> 03:00.010
All right.

03:00.140 --> 03:05.350
In the J.S. folder we have our app J.S. vendors.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.000
That's good.

03:07.000 --> 03:07.560
All right.

03:07.840 --> 03:18.570
So let's go back to sublime and let's go to index ph P and then I'm going to open up the next AGM I'll

03:18.590 --> 03:19.840
file as well.

03:19.880 --> 03:27.940
I'm going to copy everything that's in that index HDMI and put it in the PDP file case.

03:27.940 --> 03:34.260
Now if we save that and we go to the front end and reload OK we can see the HDMI now.

03:34.300 --> 03:42.800
Now the CSSA files aren't being loaded because we need to fix the PAF.

03:42.830 --> 03:48.810
All right so where we have our APS-C assets we're actually going to change that.

03:49.080 --> 04:01.730
We're going to save ph P Acco not echo blog info and pass in stylesheet underscore you Arel

04:05.050 --> 04:05.700
Okay.

04:05.720 --> 04:13.610
And then for the rest of the C Ss files we're just going to add to the to the front of it p p blog info

04:16.220 --> 04:26.240
template you are l and then we want to slash K so go ahead and copy that will do that to the rest of

04:26.240 --> 04:27.780
these.

04:28.970 --> 04:33.130
And now if we go back and reload we get our CSSA.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.340
OK.

04:34.490 --> 04:42.210
So let's start at the top here and then this Each I'll tag we're going to get rid of all this.

04:42.470 --> 04:44.900
Actually yeah we'll get rid of.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.320
We don't need this.

04:47.740 --> 05:01.110
So we're going to say ph P language attributes that's a function or the char set into place with PH

05:01.120 --> 05:07.820
P blog info and just passing charts.

05:09.260 --> 05:14.330
We can keep this stuff the viewport we want to keep for the title.

05:14.370 --> 05:18.770
Let's get rid of that and just going to paste in the usual.

05:19.020 --> 05:25.710
So we have the blog name and then we have either the description if we're on the front page or the page

05:25.710 --> 05:26.260
title.

05:26.270 --> 05:33.560
If we're not in it for on a page so save that actually let's go ahead and add at the bottom here Page

05:33.600 --> 05:40.940
PWP underscore head k we'll go ahead and reload that.

05:41.020 --> 05:46.960
Now we have a blank space up here because we haven't included the the W.P. footer so let's do that.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.490
Way down at the bottom right before the ending body tag.

05:51.520 --> 06:00.700
Actually let's go just right above the scripts and you ph P W.P. underscore flirter and I just get that

06:00.700 --> 06:02.290
out of the way before I forget.

06:02.710 --> 06:06.430
Ok so now we get the admin bar.

06:06.470 --> 06:11.880
So back at the top let's change a few things here.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.490
So the top bar we have these social links.

06:16.490 --> 06:24.140
Now we're going to have to add some settings to the customize or so that the person can put in there

06:24.440 --> 06:25.840
social media links.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.940
But we're not going to get to that yet.

06:28.190 --> 06:30.360
Same thing with the phone and e-mail.

06:30.420 --> 06:33.440
We'll probably get to that in the next video.

06:33.440 --> 06:37.300
What else is in the header.

06:37.450 --> 06:39.070
What's to get rid of this.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.470
And we want this to be dynamic.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.410
We want the blog info in the name

06:48.980 --> 06:50.780
and then we have our menu.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.140
OK so those take care of the menu.

06:53.150 --> 06:57.410
We're going to create a functions p p file

07:02.950 --> 07:03.630
k.

07:03.710 --> 07:07.580
We're going to add our theme support function.

07:16.450 --> 07:22.350
Ok so I'll call this F.C. underscore theme support.

07:25.580 --> 07:37.280
Let's go ahead and do our NAV menus so we have register nav menus and then we're going to pass in an

07:37.280 --> 07:40.720
array.

07:47.730 --> 07:52.650
OK in this array we're going to include primary

07:56.970 --> 08:00.860
and then here will say primary menu.

08:01.540 --> 08:10.710
OK now we need to do an action on the hook that we want is after theme set up or I'm sorry after setup

08:10.740 --> 08:11.620
theme.

08:12.180 --> 08:18.690
And then we'll just grab this function name and put that as the second parameter.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.720
All right so save that.

08:20.740 --> 08:30.540
We'll go back to index and for our menu we're going to replace the whole UL with a function

08:32.910 --> 08:44.300
call W.P. underscore nav menu and then we want to pass in an array.

08:46.860 --> 08:55.860
OK we want the theme location for the menu and that's going to be primary.

08:57.120 --> 09:01.740
And you all had a class of menus so we're going to add a menu class

09:06.670 --> 09:13.350
of men you can save that.

09:13.460 --> 09:21.080
And if we go and reload now the menu you can see it's not styled correctly that's because we haven't

09:21.080 --> 09:30.350
set the location correctly so let's go back and you should have a menu option under appearance and say

09:30.380 --> 09:38.600
create menu called Main Menu and down here you can see theme locations we're going to choose primary

09:38.600 --> 09:40.210
menu and save.

09:40.550 --> 09:44.310
And then if we go back and reload now our menu is fixed.

09:44.810 --> 09:45.360
All right.

09:46.830 --> 09:57.300
Let's actually create a couple of pages so we'll create about page and I'll just grab some content

10:07.730 --> 10:19.700
rights and publish and then let's also add a Services page.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.170
OK.

10:21.770 --> 10:25.650
Last thing we're going to do is get our header and footer files.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.210
OK.

10:26.210 --> 10:37.070
So let's create a new file called hether thought THP and then also for THP and then we're going to go

10:37.070 --> 10:45.480
to the index and we're going to grab from the very top down to the bottom of the header.

10:45.650 --> 10:52.820
OK so we're going to cut that and we're going to replace that with p h p to get better

10:56.400 --> 11:04.010
all right and then we'll paste that in the header file save and close and then let's go down to the

11:04.010 --> 11:08.560
bottom and get from the very bottom up to

11:11.070 --> 11:13.590
let's see up to the clear fix.

11:13.840 --> 11:18.060
So we're going to cut that and replace it with the get Forder

11:24.490 --> 11:32.840
right and then we're going to pay seven footer to save and should look the same when we reload.

11:32.940 --> 11:33.550
All right good.
