00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.710
The guys in the last video we implemented these sidebar widgets.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.740
Now what we want to do is create a custom home page and then add those widgets to the positions that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.840
we added.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.890
All right so let's go ahead and create a new file and we're going to save this as front page dot php

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.830
.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.290
And just from creating that if we go and we reload the home page it goes completely blank.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.500
Because it's looking to this file.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.990
So what we're going to do is copy what we have in page dot ph P and paste it in there.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.580
All right.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.520
And then if we go and reload.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:48.540
Now this doesn't look very good because where we're showing the posts with just the page formatting

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.820
.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.640
So what we need to do is let's go into pages.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.200
We're going to create two new pages this one will be called home.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.470
We'll just say this is the home page publish.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.050
And then let's create a new one called Blog and publish.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.410
And then what we'll do is go to settings and then reading and right here front page display We're going

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.320
to set to a static page for front page.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.780
We're going to choose home for post page.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.360
We're going to choose blog and then we're going to save it.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.550
All right now we're going to go to appearance menus and say let's see we're going to take the blog and

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.220
add that to the menu.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.080
We'll put that right there save.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.050
And now if we go back and reload now we get the home page.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.900
And if we click on blog that brings us to the blog.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.690
All right so that's how we can handle that.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.690
Now we want to make this look a little different.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.110
I want to have a showcase widget up here and also I want to get rid of the side bar and have three boxes

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.010
here three different widgets at under this content.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.900
All right so let's go to front page ph P

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.040
And what we're going to do is get rid of the main class because that's what limits this to this width

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.840
.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.170
So we're going to get rid of that and then we're going to completely get rid of this side Dave.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.990
All right so we go and we look at it now.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.940
Now there's no more sidebar.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.270
All right.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.390
So let's do our showcase widget.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.980
That's going to go.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.610
Let's see.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.580
We're going to go right here.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.140
All right and I'm actually going to copy from Index I'm just going to grab this

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.160
little piece then

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.420
and then we'll just want to change the ID from side bar to showcase.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.160
Same thing here.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.950
OK so that takes care of the showcase widget.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.740
Now we're also going to want our three boxes which we're going to put down here right above the last

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.550
div..

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.340
OK so I'm going to paste this in three times

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.540
.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.340
This one will be box one

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.460
two

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.800
and three.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.380
OK I will save that.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.440
Now let's go to the back end go to parents and then widgets.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.410
And we're going to grab a text and put that right and showcase and then I'm just going to pay some code

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.560
in here and not some code but just snatched him out.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.990
Just a welcome with an H1 and then a paragraph and a link.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.820
Save that.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.530
Now we're going to grab another tax.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:32.520
Put that in Box 1 and we're going to put a title in here we'll say Box 1 heading and then I'll just

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.770
paste some simple text in there.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.040
OK let's do the same thing for box too

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:54.310
.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.940
All right.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.500
And then for Box three I'm going to do something different.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:08.970
I'm going to grab the recent post widget and put that in there and let's set that title to latest news

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.330
.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.910
OK we'll save that to go to the front and reload.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.200
And now we have our widgets.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.660
OK so they don't look too good.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.470
We need to style them.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.880
So let's go to style C Ss

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.550
and I'm going to paste in the styling for the showcase first.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.760
We gave it a background padding of 40 pixels margin bottom and aligned everything to the center.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.470
Same thing with the H-1.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.870
Now for the box model the box widgets.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:57.690
OK so the class box we just set to 32 percent with float left and then the H 3s Were just centered added

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.750
a background and some padding.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:08.940
So let's save that reload and there we go there's our home page and you can see down here we have the

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.710
latest news we can click on there and we can go to the different posts.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.040
This is the gallery blog posts.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.280
And just to make this look a little better.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:31.350
I'm going to go to where we put the side widget ally and we're just going to add a box high

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.730
ups and now that looks better.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:39.390
All right.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.950
So it's actually set that to three.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.450
All right.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.200
So this isn't the best walking style but the point of this whole project isn't the design or style or

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.170
you know to create something beautiful it's to get you familiar with the functionality of creating a

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.810
WordPress theme.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.630
All right so we're going to have one more video and that's going to be for the comments because right

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.930
now on our blog if we go to a regular post there's no comment functionality.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.230
All right so that will be the last video and we'll get to that next.
