WEBVTT

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.080
All right so our home page posts are all set.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.660
They're coming from where they need to come from.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.930
Now we want to work on a single post page because this doesn't look very good.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.690
All right now what we're going to want to do is create a new file in our theme and save it as single

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.600
Daut THP.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.510
OK.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:30.330
And for now let's let's just copy what we have in the index file and paste that in.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.090
All right so there's a lot that we need to remove here.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.140
We want the header the form we don't want the form so we can get rid of that.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.590
And then where we have this ink grid vertical space I want to use this for for the actual content so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.270
we can keep this div the panel div.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.770
That's it really.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.990
Yeah.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.990
So everything from within the panel we can actually get rid of

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.850
OK.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.460
Let's see.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.290
So this one ends down.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.450
Now let's get rid.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.370
You know what let's get rid of everything except those two divs.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.840
And of course the footer.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.980
All right.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.170
So looks like I'm going to need to add one more div here.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.340
All right.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.910
So I actually didn't have to copy the index page.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:48.900
Now in here we're going to have a main main area for the post and then a sidebar for any widgets that

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.040
we have.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.550
All right so to do that we're going to say div class

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.850
calling group which is like a row and bootstrap.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:10.650
OK and then we're going to have a div with the class of all Dasch 70.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:21.240
Let's also give it a class of post and then for the sidebar we'll say give class all 30

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.490
.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.800
Now in the all 70 div Let's start our while loop

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.910
ok and then we're going to end it.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.230
OK.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.540
Now in here let's add the title.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.440
OK and let's just check and see if it's actually working.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.680
So if he reload the single page there we go we just have the title.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.300
So let's go under that

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.980
and then I'm just going to paste in the matter of the model data.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.150
So if we go through it we have a div with the class of matter where seeing posted on.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.790
And then we're using the time function then by we have get the author Metta.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.430
OK so that's going to get the the author.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.740
No this will give the author right here and then this is going to give us a link to the author's archive

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.700
and then down here we're just using get the category to get all the categories as an array and then

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.320
down here we're looping through and we're displaying the categories.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:12.830
All right so let's save that reload and there we go.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.820
And next let's be sure to get the thumbnail.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.420
Actually that's created div.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.390
Now we'll do that afterwards too.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.670
HPF

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.850
has post

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.790
.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.440
Now

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.690
if he has thumbnail then we're going to create a div

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.860
and then here will say p p the post thumbnail

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.690
.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.990
Right.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.830
So there's our image.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.920
All right so after that

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.540
let's do the content.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.250
So for a wind break.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.560
And then let's say ph P the content

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:42.480
and then we'll do another line break and then we'll do the comments template.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.120
And there we go.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.780
So we're going to add a little bit of styling.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:01.060
Let's go to styles CSX style matter.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:15.610
I'll give it a dark background with white color I'll give it padding of five pixels and let's set for

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.350
a bottom

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.850
right now for The Post thumbnail

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.890
image.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.480
We're going to sit with you 100 percent in the heights to auto

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.350
save that and now it looks better.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.330
So while we're here we might as well do the sidebar as well.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:02.310
So let's go into functions of P P and we need to add support for for widgets.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:13.360
So let's create a function called init widgets and they'll take in an ID

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.620
.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.270
And I'm actually going to paste this in.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:33.110
So we're calling registers bar and the name is going to be side bar the ID sidebar which is all lowercase

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:41.190
and then before the widget we're just going to have a div before the title will have an H-3 right now

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:48.970
in order for this to work we need to have the add action widgets in it is the hook you want to use.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.200
Save that.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:57.230
Now let's go back into single thought ph P go into where we have this all 30.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.400
When I create a class of sidebar

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.900
I'm going to paste in the dynamic sidebar function.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.380
Jane make sure you have sidebar as the ideas well save it.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.490
Now if we go to our back end you should now have widgets on the appearance.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.010
And let's bring over categories

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:33.910
and let's bring over archives.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.610
OK go back reload.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.550
Now let's add a little bit of styling here because that doesn't look too good.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.300
So we're going to go to our style sheet

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.650
and let's add our Sidebar class.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:59.510
I'm just going to put some padding to the left let's say 25

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.780
and then we want the ally.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.970
So that'll be less style.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.640
None.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.290
Let's give it a.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:25.000
Line height of two point two am and then sort of bottom

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:37.200
say dotted and like right.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:39.910
OK.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.170
So that looks a little better.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:49.490
Actually you know each one let's give it a div of side widgets so where we have this before widget.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.190
I'm just going to add class

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.120
side widget and then we can separate them a little bit

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:05.090
.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.750
All right.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.110
So that's the single page.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.480
Now for the comments we're going to do the same thing we've been doing.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.500
We're going to just create a custom comments template

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.300
and we're going to just add basically just boilerplate code that's from the documentation.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:37.750
If you want to get that copied We'll spit all the comments here and then the form here

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:47.070
.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.140
OK so it doesn't look that great so we're just going to add our styling.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.020
OK nothing special just kind of the same thing we've been doing.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:11.170
We have our comments class the headings the body the Met the Reply link and the form.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.470
And there you go.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.850
So that's a single page with comments with the sidebar.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.570
So in the next video we're going to work on the archived pages because if I click on one of these categories

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.420
it just takes us to a page that looks like our home page which isn't what we want.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.580
All right so we'll get into that next.
