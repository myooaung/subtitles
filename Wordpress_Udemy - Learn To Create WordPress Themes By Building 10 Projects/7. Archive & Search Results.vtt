00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.080
All right so now that we have our main post area all set we also have the single page with the exception

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.680
of comments which will be doing later on.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.780
Now I want to show you how we can create custom archive pages if I click on one of these categories

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.340
.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.290
It's going to take us to a category archive by click on admin the user name that will take us to the

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.650
author archive and there's other ones as well.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.670
OK we can sort.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.970
We can have archives by dates.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.970
We can have them by tags and so on.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.690
So let's go ahead and in our theme folder we're going to create a new file and we're going to save that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.700
as archive Daut ph Pete.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.390
All right.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.080
And then we'll open that up.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
Now if I go back and I click on a category here you can see it's blank because it's looking at this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.790
archive each page.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:03.840
So what I want to do here is I want to copy what's in the index page and we're going to paste that in

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.000
.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.570
All right.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.370
Now I want these pages to be much more simple.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.520
OK we don't need the matter like this we don't need the image just pretty much just the title of the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.110
title and the date really is all I want.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.950
So let's go to we have the article tag and we're just going to get rid of that whole thing.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.260
OK we'll cut that right though.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:46.110
And we're going to replace it with a div and give it a class of archived post.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.600
Right.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.010
And then there we're going to have in age four

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.100
and we'll have a link that's going to go to the permalink

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.060
and then we'll have the title

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.770
.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.670
And then let's see underneath the age four will have a paragraph and then there we're going to say posted

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.300
on

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.500
the time it will pass and the same formatting options here

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.730
.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.700
Let's take a look at that.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.790
All right.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.830
I just want to go to the style sheet real quick and we'll go to the bottom

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.460
.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.700
I'll say archived post.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:16.920
We're going to set a border on the bottom of light gray one pixel solid

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:28.660
padding bottom 10 pixels and will also do 10 pixels on the margin bottom.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.590
All right.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.350
And then we'll take the H for

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.610
in the paragraph

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:55.980
and I just want to remove the margin and padding.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.710
All right.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.370
Now I want to have a different heading depending on what type of archive it is.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.120
Let's go back to our archive page.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.230
P.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.050
Now I'm going to piece this in because it's quite a bit.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.350
I'm going to put it right under the main block div..

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.970
And what we're doing here is we're using some WordPress press functions that are extremely helpful.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.070
So we have is category that all that will happen if it's a category archive.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.890
And then we're just using this single cat title.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.550
OK.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.780
That can give us the category name we have the if it is an author.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:52.530
We're going to have eco archives by author and then the author's name and then have the post right here

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.590
.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.400
Now this isn't needed all the time.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.960
I forget that there's a special case where this is actually needed so just throw that in there.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.580
Same thing with Redwine posts.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.900
All right.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.360
If it's a tag we can actually give the tag title.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.700
If it's by day we can say archive's by day and then just say get the date.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.260
We can also do the same here.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.520
This should actually be month.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.370
And then this one will be a year.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.760
All right.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.300
Now if it's none of these then it's just going to say archives.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:35.490
All right so let's save that and if we go back and reload now you can see we're getting archives by

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.470
author admen.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.040
OK.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.330
If we go back to a post click on the category it gives us the category name.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.110
All right so that's how that works.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.570
Seen kind of the same kind of view for the search.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.680
All right so when we search for something so what we'll do is create a new file and we'll just call

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.650
it search dog pee pee.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.040
All right.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.980
And then I'm going to copy what we have in the archive ph pee and paste it in there.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.380
But we want to get rid of this all this if statement stuff.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.870
I'm just going to take that out and then we'll just say search results

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.210
.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.740
And there we go.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.130
All right.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:35.010
And just to make sure the search is definitely working let's put in the word hello in blog post 2 and

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:42.210
then if we go back to the front end and we search for a hello blog post two comes up.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.490
All right so that works.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.980
Now I want to link to the home page in the menus so let's do that.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.760
We go to menus

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:03.990
and we're going to do is go to custom links for the you Arel I'm going to put in a local whole slew

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:14.890
W.P. themes and then for the tax or just say home and add to menu that up here the top save it.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:21.100
And then if we go back and or you load we have a home link.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.310
So in the next video I want to take a look at content types.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.390
OK so are post types.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.010
Right now we just have regular blog post but we can also have things like galleries.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.880
We can have a side content we can have links and so on.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.170
All right.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.980
So we'll get to that next.
