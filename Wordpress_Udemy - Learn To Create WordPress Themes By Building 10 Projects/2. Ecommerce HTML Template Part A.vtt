WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.880
All right so we're going to go ahead and get started and what we're going to do first is just build

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.080
a flat out each team all template and then after that we'll move on to integrating it and create making

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.050
it a WordPress theme.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.310
All right.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.750
So let's go ahead and create a folder for this template and I'm going to call this my shop underscore

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.990
aged him now.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.670
All right.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.960
And then inside there we're going to create a couple things actually you know before we create that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.060
let's download foundation from Foundation dot Serb dot com.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:43.650
We're going to click on this one over here complete it and then open up that zip file and let's just

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.180
take everything out and move it to our folder.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:57.690
Right now we open up index each team Maol with chrome and you can see we have pretty much a boiler plate

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.930
.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.240
OK so the CSSA is implemented.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.340
The Javascript should be implemented.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
So let's go ahead and open up index HVM now in our editor

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.950
.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.890
All right so we're going to kind of just work through this replace what we need.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.500
Let's also open up our CSSA file which is APS-C.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.660
SS OK there's nothing in here.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.360
The only styles is the core or foundation styles.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.340
Now I also have some images that we need to upload so I'm going to create a new folder called I m g

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.640
and you should have these files in your project file.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.890
I am going to pay CS in.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.380
OK so if we just take a look at these images make these bigger.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.350
So we have our logo logo dot j peg.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.540
And then we have a bunch of clothes we a bunch of shirts.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.880
We have a hat this blue shirt has multiple images because we're going to implement mini gallery.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.670
So these are all the images that we'll be needing.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.030
All right.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.770
So let's go back to the index each to your model.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.420
Now the head can stay how it is.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.570
We're linking our CSSA files.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.720
We have our viewport set so we can leave that stuff.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.950
So let's go right below the body tag and we're going to keep using the grid system.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.280
All right.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.550
So we have a div here with the class of row I'm actually going to change this div to Hetter.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.580
OK.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.910
And then inside of it we're going to have a six column div

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.990
and then we'll have another six call them div next to it.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:00.550
All right so on this side let's put the logo over and say I am g source is going to be slash.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.180
I am g slash logo dog.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.970
And let's see if that shows up which it doesn't

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.380
do dot slash image.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.250
All right.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.880
So we have our logo on this side we're going to have our navigation menu.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:44.510
All right so let's say you well I'm going to give it a class menu and also simple and main nav.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.980
All right.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.320
And then inside that we're going to have some slides tags

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.580
with a link and this one will go to indexed all age.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.680
You are now

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.870
going to copy this why

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.100
this one will be about and we'll have an About page.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.140
And then this one will be.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.130
This can be anything really it's not going to link it anywhere but we'll just say services.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.480
All right so save that reload.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.010
OK so the style that it has is coming from the core foundation file.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.350
We are going to add some other styles.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.230
For instance we want to push it down.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.520
We want to push it over but we'll get into the CSSA after the HD IMAO.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.590
OK next we have the Showcase area which is going to change quite a bit.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.110
I do want to keep Divx class row.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.810
We're just going to add onto this a class called showcase.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.240
We're going to weave this 12 column div we're going to leave this call out div but I'm actually going

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.070
to add a class called secondary which will make it gray.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.400
All right.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.830
And then everything in that we can get rid of

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.860
OK and then in what are going to do is we're going to have an H-1

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:29.550
whoops and this will say discount clothing and then I'm just going to paste in a paragraph and a button

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.640
.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.870
All right.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.190
Save that take a look.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.800
All right.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.640
We're going to add some more styles to that after so don't worry about it.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.180
So down here we have another row.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.020
This has an eight column div which is this area here.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.410
The main area and then there is way down at the bottom.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.910
There's a four column did which is the side bar.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.900
So we want to clear these divs out completely

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.730
.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.680
So I'm going to go to here.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:20.130
So now we have a cleared out a column div and then for the sidebar we're going to do the same thing

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.440
.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.370
All right.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:35.400
For the products when create a div give it a class of products.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.900
All right.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.460
And then here we're going to have a bunch of four column divs.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.860
OK we want three four column divs going across each row.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:59.460
All right so we can do is a div class and we set is too large for medium for small 12

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.030
columns and given a class of product and also a class of.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.380
And

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.810
.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.100
OK.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.330
Now in here we'll have an H three.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.290
We'll say blue shirt

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.470
and then we'll do an H for the lowest

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.630
price.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:43.230
Now the when we do the Word Press theme things might look a little different than the HVM theme just

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:48.140
because of there's some limitation to where we can put the content.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.660
So I just just remember that there may be some minor differences.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.720
All right so we have the title we have the price.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.220
Let's do the image

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:05.450
.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.450
OK then we'll do a button

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:20.480
.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.840
All right so let's grab where we have the four cone.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:35.670
Dave we're going to grab that and then just paste it in a bunch of times and then we're just going to

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.360
change the content up a little bit.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.230
So this will be ready sure go ahead and change the price.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.560
We're going to change this to redshirt.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.930
OK this one will be gray

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.000
and swallow the orange

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.360
and then I think it is a black

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.750
.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.370
All right so let's see what that gives us.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:22.620
All right so the images aren't showing up when we just checked the names.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.030
OK shirt black.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.310
All right so the image names are not correct

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:48.380
.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.620
Shirt black.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.690
All right let's try that.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.330
Looks like the first one.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:09.520
I miss that shirt blue shirt blue white.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.380
OK.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.350
So there's our products now for the sidebar.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.240
We're going to go down to the for call div here and I'm going to piece this in.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.840
OK so it's a div with the class of Calo that gives it a border and some padding.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:34.730
Then we have our categories heading and we have a well with the classic menu and vertical.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.460
All right.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.560
And then we're going to have another sidebar widget right below it.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.330
So we're going to put a line break in.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.530
Let me grab that

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.570
as just a heading.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.850
We can change this heading

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.990
in some text and a button.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:05.890
Ok so now we're going to go down to the very bottom right above the script tags and we're going to create

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.770
our footer.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.120
OK footer is just going to be a paragraph.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.000
We'll put our copyright

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.220
and there we go.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.940
So that's it for the H T M L for the index page.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.010
So now we want to do is move on to the details page.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.870
And obviously this doesn't look very good.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.750
We'll fix that in the second part.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.590
We'll do the CSX.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:50.880
All right so what I want to do now is go back and let's create a new file and this is going to be details

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.850
dot HMO.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:02.190
We're going to open that up and I'm going to copy everything that I have in the index each team out

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.990
.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:03.900
All right.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:12.190
And then we'll just go down to where the main area is which is this a column div will change this class

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:22.350
to single product and then let's change this to actual get rid of all of these four column divs but

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.090
one

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.410
right.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:35.370
And then we're going to change it from four columns to 12.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.050
So to go.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.660
I actually want to do that.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.740
Yeah.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.360
Okay.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.580
And then inside that 12 column there we're going to have two more columns.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.370
So it's copy that

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.650
you

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.220
just can get this right.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.720
So we have a 12 column div and then inside that we're going to make this one five columns.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.990
That's where the image will go.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:20.260
And then this one here will be seven.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:27.400
All right so let's go in the five column first and if we're going to have a link here to go back as

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.550
well.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:39.450
OK for now this will just go to indexed on each table.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.900
And then I know that we're going to have our image.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.270
We're just going to use the blue white shirt for now

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.190
.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:01.670
All right.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.810
So take a look at the details page

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.000
details each team out.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.570
All right so the image isn't showing up.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.230
The shirt blue that should be a dot.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.040
OK.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:26.130
Now on the other side in the seven call div we're going to have the content.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.060
So I'm actually going to just paste that in.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:35.970
OK we have an H to H for with the price paragraph for the description button.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.570
And then we have some tags.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.180
So save that.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:41.520
All right.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.520
That looks good so far.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.280
Now we're also going to create an about page just to represent a normal page.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.350
That's not a product page.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.860
So let's go in and create new

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.530
and we're going to say about daughter aged him.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:13.090
Open that up and I'm just going to copy what we have in the details page.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:13.430
All right.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.880
And then we just want to go to the main area

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:25.270
which is right here and instead of having a five column and a seven column we're going to get rid of

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:31.640
those and just have the 112.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.460
All right.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.290
And then we'll just put in a heading here

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.210
and let's grab some sample text

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.250
then.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.530
All right.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:11.280
So let's go to a boat and there we go.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.100
Just some text and a heading.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.730
All right.
