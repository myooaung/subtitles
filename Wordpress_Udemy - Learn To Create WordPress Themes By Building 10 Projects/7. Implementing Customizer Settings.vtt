WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.530
All right.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.350
So in the last video I showed you how to create new sections and settings in the Customize are now going

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.940
to show you how to actually implement the values that were entered.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.290
All right so I'm in the front page of the file right now.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.120
And if we go to the front end you can see that nothing's changed OK because we haven't implemented these

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.800
changes are these values.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.910
So let's go into our Jumbotron markup here and this is where we're going to add some code.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.210
So the H-1 which is just Jumbotron heading and you can see it here.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.350
All right there's no background image yet so that's why we can't see the white text on white.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.810
But let's go ahead and add ph P and then we're going to say Echo

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:04.080
echo to get the theme mod K that's the function that we need to use and then we're going to pass and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.250
here they enter underscore heading.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.770
All right.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.760
So if we save that and we go in there you load you'll see that it's totally it's gone there's nothing

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.270
there.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.310
This value isn't showing up.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.140
Now the reason for that is even though we put a default.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.770
Let's take a look at cost of Mizer and we did put a default value of banner heading all this.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.130
This default is for is for the backend.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.040
So this here that's where this text is coming from it doesn't provide a default for the front end to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.770
the to provide a default for the front end.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:54.270
We just have to add a second parameter so we could just go in here and say banner heading save it and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.200
reload.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.970
And now we get in or heading.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.780
OK.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.760
Now even though we have a default here if we change it in the customize or that's what's going to show

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.000
up.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.330
So if I change this now to let's say showcase heading and we go ahead and.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.410
And you can see that it actually updated here as well.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.980
If I save it and we go and reload now we get showcase heading.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.790
OK.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.630
So that's how that works.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.630
Now we're going to want to do the same thing for these other values so it's copied that and we'll put

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.180
this right in here we'll paste that.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.520
And this is going to be banner text.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.840
All right.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.870
And then it's going to take the default from here.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:52.380
So what we can do is copy what we put as the fall here which is this sentence or a couple of sentences

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.060
and we'll paste that right in here.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.370
OK so now it's coming from here because it's the default.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.380
Now even though we saved this before this didn't take effect because it wasn't changed.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.520
All right so if we want to just make sure this is changes let's just say test save.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.750
Go back and you see we get test ok we'll just change that back.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.500
So the heading and the text are all set.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.710
Now for the button let's copy that.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.630
And then for the button text we're just going to piece that right in here and we'll change this to Banner

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:54.370
DTN text and then right here will change this to sign up today

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.000
.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.850
So now we get the button text.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.270
Now for the link.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:17.370
Change this to the button you are l and we'll make that HTP test dot com.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.370
OK.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.420
So that's all set.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.630
Now what we need to do is the background.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.280
OK.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:35.280
So right now the value is coming from our CSSA Let's go to style CSSA go to a jumbotron and this is

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.910
where it's coming from.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:47.880
So we're going to do is just cut that how completely and then we're going to go back into the front

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.130
page.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.710
Actually no we don't want to go in front page we want to go in the header because we need to add a CSSA

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.710
style.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:06.960
So let's go right under the W.P. head say style and let's do Daut Jumbotron

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.230
background

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.650
and then we're going to pace that we're going to paste

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.790
not want to pace that write like that and then we're going to just get rid of this because this is now

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.280
going to come from them or from the theme maade.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:41.220
So let's copy one of these and then we're going to just paste that in there.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.310
Change is to be in our image.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.910
And then the default.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.630
OK.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.950
So for the default we'll say Get blog info

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:14.160
template underscore you are l and then we want to go to splash image slash then banner dog J peg.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.070
All right so save it.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.350
Go back and reload and there we go.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.720
Now just to test test out the customize our.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.690
Let's change this.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:34.840
You want to see change image and I have a test image on my desktop.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:42.930
We're going to choose that an update here let's save it go to the front end reload and there it is.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.270
All right.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:52.320
Now if we want to go back to the original we can say remove and then just click default save and then

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.830
it comes back.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.220
All right so you can see this customizes is really helpful in customizing your themes.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.640
Now we could have done just a widget here like we have in the past but I think that this is kind of

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.910
a better option.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.010
All right so let's move on to the boxes.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.040
OK we're going to go back to front page and this is all set.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.500
Now the Jumbotron.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.940
And what I want to do is just copy one of these.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.330
OK now this one here is going to the box one heading

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.730
.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.610
Think that's it.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.680
And so we called it

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:50.090
yeah box 1 heading.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.060
Change that to box one thing.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.060
OK.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.810
And this one here will be box one text

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.550
.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.560
Can can copy this text here.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.730
OK.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.350
Now for the icon.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.390
See where we have bar chart.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:30.170
We're going to keep this F.A. dash and we're just going to replace this UPS.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:41.790
Kerry just going to replace that and this will be box one underscore icon and then the default for that

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.000
will be bar chart.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.270
OK.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:52.490
So now I'm going to do is just copy this block div and then we'll replace these two

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.070
and then we'll just change a couple things so this one is box too.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.530
So we'll change that.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.150
Yes.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:15.900
And let's see for the default for the icon is going to change it to code.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.890
Ok this one down here.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.770
This is Box 3

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.710
and we're going to change the default icon to desktop.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.820
So it's go ahead and reload.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.950
And now these values are coming from the Customize.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.460
So take a look at this last icon the desktop.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:52.840
We're going to go in here boxes say Box 3 icon and when to change it to laptop and you can see here

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.180
it's changed to a laptop.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.700
If I save it go back reload turns into a laptop.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.360
OK so really simple.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.190
So that's going to be it.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:08.660
That's how we can implement our our customize our values in the next video.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.070
We're going to take care of these widgets OK.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.890
These two widgets as well as the three in the folder.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.230
So I'll see you in the next
