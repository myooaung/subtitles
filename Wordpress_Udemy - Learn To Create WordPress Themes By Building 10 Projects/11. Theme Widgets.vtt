00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.880
You guys in this video we're going to take a look at widgets.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.080
OK so right now we have a sidebar but this is just static content in our aged him file or in our I'm

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.800
sorry and our PDP file.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.290
So we want this to be to come from the widget guide widget system and we should be able to add multiple

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.360
widgets in the sidebar.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.960
Now on the blog page and on any other page this is going to be the only widget.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.130
Aside from a custom home page that we're going to create later on.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.500
All right.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.700
But we are going to add those positions in our functions file.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.000
All right.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.660
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.010
Open up functions ph.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.640
And we're all go let's see let's go right under the after theme set up action

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.840
and this will be to set up widget locations.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.750
So create a function call it in the net underscore the widgets.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:11.460
And that's going to take an ID and then and here we're going to say register sidebar.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.660
All right.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.810
Now even though this is called register sidebar this is used with all widget positions not just the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.950
side bar.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.900
So it takes in an array

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.420
.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.500
And it's going to take a name.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.580
This happens to be the side bar but it could be anything

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.270
actually that's going to be an upper case like that.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.740
And then the I.D.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.360
will be all lowercase

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.650
characters.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.860
Now we can also have before and after widget

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.080
.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.290
We can also have apps

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.420
we can also have before and after title of the widget

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.970
.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.330
OK.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.390
So this is basically just going to be HTL tags that we want.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.200
What we're going to do is if we look let's say Index ph P and we look at the sidebar it has a div with

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.280
the class of Block.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.690
All right.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.120
Now I don't want to actually have to add this div in here so let's put it in here.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.850
OK so div class.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.430
BLOCK And let's also add a class called side widget.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:13.000
And so after that we're going to want to close that div and for the title I'm going to put h three.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.610
OK so let's save that and then we'll go into index

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.590
and we can take out everything that's in this side div

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.950
and what we'll do is check to see if there are any widgets in that position.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:54.570
OK so say if it is active side bar and then pass in the widget ID which is sidebar then we're going

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:06.150
to say H-P dynamic sidebar and we're going to pass in the sidewalk.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.950
OK.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.540
So if we go and look at index it now nothing's there because we haven't added any widgets.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.250
Now we're going to have to replace all of the static side bar code with this.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.980
Let's copy it.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.160
We'll start with archive.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.210
I will just paste that in

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.310
and if we go to

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.660
Page and of course you don't have to have a sidebar with all these pages but we're going to

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.130
search a single

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.820
company template

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.540
and they think that's it

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.660
yeah.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.850
OK.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.560
So now all I do is go to our back end and go to appearance now see how there is no widget.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.540
Now once we added that code to phunk actually you know we need to initialize it.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.850
Yeah we need to go back to functions and then go right under in widgets and we need to say add action

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.120
.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.440
Now the hook we want to use is widgets init

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.950
and then we just want to put the name of our function which is in net widgets.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.350
So now we'll go back to our backend reload and now under appearance you should be able to go to widgets

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.480
.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.110
All right.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.920
And what we're going to do is just add a custom text widget.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.090
And let's just put

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:17.400
say my text widget and then I'm just going to paste a sentence or two in here and save go back to our

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.140
front end reload and there we go.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.560
OK so that's coming from the text widget.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.450
Let's add a button in here as well just for works

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.700
.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.690
Let's put a line break here.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.750
We'll put two line breaks.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.180
You can put whatever you like in a custom text widget.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:06.760
Now another thing we could do is add some kind of dynamic widget like let's say the categories.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.620
OK so let's take that categories widget put it here

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.000
and I'll save it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.010
Let's go take a look and there it is.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.360
So I want to do some make this look a little better so we can do that with CSX.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:37.150
Let's go to the bottom and I'll say Side widget.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:52.530
When it had a margin bottom 20 pixels that move it down a little bit and then we'll do the list items

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:09.090
will say list style none or give it a line height of one point eight AM and border bottom

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:19.410
will do dotted color will be gray.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.670
Save that.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.480
And there we go.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.230
So that looks a lot better.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:32.350
Let's actually make it's two point one.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.130
There we go.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.820
So we could also put let's say recent posts

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.830
changes to three.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.450
And there we go.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.430
OK.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.830
All the gallery we actually didn't give a title for that you know title.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.920
So let's just say a

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.850
photo gallery.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.050
There we go.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:21.200
So what are you going to do now is I'm going to add the rest of the widgets into functions ph P or the

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.550
rest of the widget positions.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.900
Even though we're not going to do it in this video in the next video we're going to create a custom

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.060
home page with those widgets so all go right under here.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.700
Paste this send four more times.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.200
OK so sidebar then we're going to have the Showcase area

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.740
change the class name.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.540
And then these ones here we're going to have box one box to inbox three.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:15.510
OK this will have a div of class of walk up lock box and box one.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:26.930
I I'm actually going to replace these two with that and then we'll change this to box 2 and change this

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:27.950
one to three

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.220
I save it.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:39.750
And now if we were to go back into the widgets area you can now see we have those widget.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.880
Ok at least we have the positions.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.190
If we put something in them now nothing's going to happen because we don't have them in our template

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.410
.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.320
But like I said in the next video we're going to create a custom home page where we'll add these widgets
