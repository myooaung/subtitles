00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.500
All right so in this video we're going to work on the content pages both the regular post content and

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.700
also the gallery.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.330
So let's start with content ph p.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.750
All right.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.060
So we're going to do is we're going to create an article tag and we're going to give it a class of post

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.410
.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.120
And a lot of this stuff will actually be the same between the two files.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.450
All right.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.540
And then we need the title.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.580
So we're going to put that inside of an age.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.370
So we can get that with PH P echo the title.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.740
And just to show you if we go and reload now you can see with the regular content posts we're actually

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.530
getting the title.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.340
Next thing we're going to want is the the meta data.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.820
So let's put that in a class called meta paragraph or the class called matter.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.360
And in here we're going to say posted at.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.760
And then when you get the date and time so to do that we can say ph P the time

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.890
all right and then we're going to say on and then we want the date.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:28.950
So we're going to see ph P the date and then by and then we wanted the user's name and we're going to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.440
put that in a link.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.230
So let's say a graph.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:44.130
And what we're going to want to do here is put in php tagging and we want to go out and get

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.370
get author posts.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.410
You are all

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.850
right.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:06.270
And then we need to put the ID the ID in here for the author which we can do with get the author meta

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:16.860
and we want to pass into it ID that will get to get us the authors ID and then for the actual text that's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.680
just going to be ph P the author.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.210
OK.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.740
Let's check it out.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.510
OK so posted at 2 0 1 p.m. on March by admen.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.920
And if we click admin it's not going to do anything yet.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.700
We'll get to that after.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.330
All right.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.280
So what we're going to do now is we're going to check to see if there's a thumbnail or featured image

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.770
.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:56.360
So say ph P If you want.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.630
Yeah I like that.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.770
So in here we're going to say has post Thum now

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.490
.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.180
So if there's a thumbnail.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.310
And let's end that

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.570
.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.980
OK if there's a thumbnail then we'll create a div.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.120
I will give it a class of post from now

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:39.060
and here all we have to do is say ph P The Post thumbnail.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.600
OK.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.860
And under that will do a b r tag and then we need the main content which is really easy.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.300
You can just say the content just like that.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.430
All right so let's save it and go and reload.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.690
And there we go we have the title the meta data and the content of that post.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.930
Now for the photo post that's all the gallery post that's going to be a little different.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.020
All right so let's just take a look at our index each team that we created earlier.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:25.410
OK so what we're going to want is one of these for column divs.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:38.480
OK so what we'll do is just grab that copy it and go and paste it in here.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.680
OK so we're going to want to loop through and then split for each post.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.340
We're going to be spitting this out OK but we want to change this stuff up so we can actually actually

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.320
the only thing we want to keep is the div.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.720
All right.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.150
Because what we want to do here is check for the thumbnail.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:08.010
So we want to use this same thing right here so let's grab that.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.390
We'll put that right here.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.430
OK.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.100
This is going to be a little different.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.420
We're going to get rid of this

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.520
case or checking for a thumbnail if there is one and when I say thumbnail or featured image I mean the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.560
same thing.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.210
All right.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.270
So we'll have the div that's fine.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.830
And let's see we're going to want to do a little extra here because we want the image to actually have

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.590
a class so that we can do the the animation and stuff like that.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.400
So we need to create an array of attributes.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:02.540
So save THP and say 80 t our equals array.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.780
All right.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.000
And then here let's see we're going to put

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:25.830
class and we want that to be W3 animate opacity and then we also want a hover effect which we can use

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.850
.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.680
W3 CSSA 4.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.360
So we need to just say W3 hover

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.580
opacity is like that.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.930
All right so then we can end the PH P in each image is going to have a link around it.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:51.140
So we're going to say hey Tref and that's going to go to PH P Atco

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.750
the permalink k that will take it to the single post.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:12.150
And then we just want the thumbnails so we're going to say p p echo this time we want to say get the

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.030
post thumbs down

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.400
.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:20.220
Right.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:29.550
And then we get a pass in a couple of things we want to pass in ID and the size which will be large

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:36.410
and then the attributes age just like that.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.890
And then underneath the div

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.400
or underneath the end if we want to put the contents

00:07:51.550 --> 00:08:02.040
they'll save that right now if we relo we don't see anything because we didn't actually add any content

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.650
to that photo post so I'm actually going to delete that.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.270
So in our posts when I'm going to do is delete both of these.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.540
So let's move those to trash.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:15.900
OK.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.890
And then let's create a new post.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.410
So this will be let's say photo one.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.020
All right.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:34.920
And just kind of paste in just a small paragraph or just some content which will be the description

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.150
.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.270
And we want to make sure you choose gallery here.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.250
OK.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.490
All categories we need to create those too.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:50.350
So for now it's just a category and will call it nature.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:57.990
Actually while we're at it let's just create them all say objects.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.170
Let's do what else people

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.370
can say places.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.950
Abstract.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.580
OK and let's I only want to choose nature.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.360
OK.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:23.450
And then down here and in featured image we're going to say set featured image and then we want to upload

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.440
a file.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:33.120
And what I'll do is go to our HVM owl template here and go into images and I'm going to grab this first

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.280
image OK.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:44.940
Over here you can give it a title a photo one you can put a caption description and then we'll say set

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.310
featured image.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.240
OK.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:54.140
So things you should have as the title description gallery you want to check that category.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.930
And then a featured image.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:02.190
OK and we'll go ahead and say publish and let's take a look at the front end.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.300
OK.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.580
So there's our image it fades in.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.740
Obviously the proportion is incorrect.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:18.900
So what we need to do is go to our CSSA which is let's see styled Dotsie SS and we're want to go down

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:27.210
to pick OK but this time we want the actual image so we're going to say pick image and we're going to

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:33.250
set the width to 100 percent and then get to make that important.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:41.080
And then we're also going to set the height to 100 percent.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.640
All right so let's save that and reload and there we go.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.470
So that looks good.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:54.090
If we click it it's going to take us to the single page which we haven't created yet so don't worry

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.240
about that.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.800
Let's go ahead and just upload the rest of these.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:09.750
OK so google the posts and I'll say add new to the photo to me and let's see I'm just going to grab

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:19.030
some text gallery and let's see you picked the image here.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.530
We'll get this one in.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.770
Let's see.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.130
I'm going to add a category of animals.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.790
GROSS That looks good.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.900
It's published that and go back and reload.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.040
And now we have our Dolphins picture.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:45.060
All right so I'm going to go ahead and just add the rest and I'll be back.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:52.540
All right so I have uploaded six posts or six images and you can see it's all show incorrectly.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.970
If you look in the back end in the post area we have our six photos.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.320
All right.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.210
So we now have that functionality down in the next video.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.480
I want to work on the categories.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.360
We want this to start working.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.090
We want it to be in and out how WordPress widget.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.010
OK so we'll do that next
