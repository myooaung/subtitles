00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.680
Hey guys get the last video we went ahead and fixed our nav bar.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.940
So that's now working.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.840
We also created our widgets our Sidebar widget area along with some customized widgets.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.830
So now what I want to do is add a search bar in the in the nav bar.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.420
All right.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.770
So we're going to go to our header file and go down to where we have this empty form and we're going

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.060
to add some stuff to it.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.850
So first thing we're going to add a method and the method is going to be get a class we can actually

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.740
change this left.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.210
I want to put it on the right.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.210
All right we also need to add an action

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.830
in the action.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.150
We're going to use PHP tags and we're going to say Ekko escape.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.840
You are all right because where we want the you are all checked and escaped.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.210
All right.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.860
And we're going to use home underscore you are l and in here we just want slash

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.730
.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.000
OK.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.060
So basically we're just submitting to the home you are l.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.720
Now as far as the fields we're just going to want one field for the search but let's add a label so

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:51.420
label will say for the nav bar search and give it a class of s r only.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.470
And then let's say ph P underscore the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.850
search and this is just for localization this underscore.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
And then we need a second parameter of a text domain

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.950
.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.890
All right.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.070
Let's close up those page tags.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.990
And so let's see under the label it's to div class

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.740
form group.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.450
And in here we're going to have an input.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:48.450
Given a type of text and given a class of form control which is just a bootstrap class and it's a name

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.000
call it asks for search.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.600
It's given an ID of nav bar search

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.680
cry and then we need to submit.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:19.120
So what does this all say button will give a type of submit and give it a class of between and between

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.100
default

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.110
and then for the text.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.540
I'm just going to copy this.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.560
What we have here

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.050
we go.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.010
All right let's save it.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.160
Let's do a search for larm.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.690
It gives us those Ok search for the word one

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.620
too.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.860
All right.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.790
So now we have a search bar and that the last thing that we need to do is this single post.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.500
Ok the single post page.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:10.080
So what we'll do is let's close up the header file and we're going to create a file in our theme root

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:20.580
and let's save this and we're going to save it as a single dot ph P.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.640
Now just creating this file if I go and click on one of these blog posts it's completely blank because

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.000
it's automatically looking at the single dot page page.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.010
All right so what I want to do is copy everything that we have an index

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.910
select copy all of it put it in a single save it and then if we go to reload it looks the same exact

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.410
way as the index page.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.250
All right so let's go in and change some of that.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.980
So what we want to do we want to

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.800
let's let's remove this if has post-up now altogether.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.650
All right so I'm going to go down to where it says ALS and I'm going to cut out from there up

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:22.840
to the actual if statement and then we need to go down and get rid of this and F right.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.200
OK.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.130
Because if there's an image or not it doesn't matter.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.240
But the way that we're going to be formatting it.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.520
All right so we do want the image though so we're going to put it.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.730
It's.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:47.030
Let's put it right under the heading and I'm just going to paces in.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.620
OK so we're just putting in the thumbnail or the featured image.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.350
If there is one.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.470
All right so let's save that and see what that looks like.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.820
OK.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.550
So we have our big image.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.730
Now let's put a line break underneath it as well.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.000
OK.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.540
So we don't want to read more.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.000
And we also want the full content not the excerpt.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:24.420
OK so let's get rid of the read more and instead of forget the excerpt.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.130
Let's to get the content.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.180
I think that should work.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.070
Yeah

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.480
actually that's change this to the content and get rid of the acco.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.680
OK.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.420
Also seems is class.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.950
There you go.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.740
So now it renders the HDMI as well.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.020
So that's the single page.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.510
Now we're going to have to have common functionality as well.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:02.250
So we're going to start here and in the next video we'll create a section for the comments as well as

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.360
the comment form
