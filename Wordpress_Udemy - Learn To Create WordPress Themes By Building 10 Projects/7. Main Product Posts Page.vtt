00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.390
You guys in this video we're going to start to work on this main content area k the area where the posts

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.440
show up.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.600
Now right now it's just a bunch of static HVM owls So we're going to go ahead and fix that.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.290
So let's go into the index file in the my shop theme folder.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.900
And we want to go to where we have this div class products.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.050
And inside there we have these four column divs to represent each product.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm actually going to have a class of row on this products div.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.110
And then what we want to do is get rid of all but one of these four call them devs.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.500
So get rid of that one all the way down to this div right here.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.260
OK we'll get rid of that.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.890
And then inside the four column div I'm going to get rid of the content.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.630
And then what we'll do is we'll go right above it.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.770
And we want to create our while loop.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.340
All right before we do the why although it's make sure that there are some posts so we're going to say

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.880
if

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.250
have hosts

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.950
man ended it down here.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.470
OK so if the if there are some posts then we want are wild.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.530
I saw say ph P

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.030
while

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:49.040
also a while have posts and then we have to just add the post straight here.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.400
Right.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.180
And then we'll do the end while I'm on the bottom of this div right here scrolls ph p and y

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.550
.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.440
All right.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.470
Now inside the div we're going to have an H 3.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.170
And that's going to be the title so we can save ph P the title.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.240
We're also going to have the thumbnails so let's do ph P and then we're going to check for the thumbnail

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.710
first.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.350
So say if has has a host underscore

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.650
from now

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:48.290
k if there's a thumbnail then we're going to say ph P

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.490
The Post thumbnail

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.590
then we'll go right under the END-IF here and we need our button.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.020
So it's going to actually be a link formatted as a button.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.540
So we'll give it a class of button.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.750
And then this is going to go to THP echo the permalink

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.560
K in the text.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.640
Just say details.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.570
OK.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.630
So let's save that needs take a look.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.410
OK.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.230
So the reason we don't see anything here except for hello world is that's the only post we have.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.870
So we're going to have to go in and create some posts just log back in real quick.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.930
All right and we'll go to all posts and you can see we only have.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.650
Hello world.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.150
So let's go and click add new.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.320
Now notice that there is no area for the featured image down here.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.490
OK we're going to have to change.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.340
We're going to have to add that so let's go to functions dot ph P and then we'll go into this.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.170
And this theme set up function

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.470
and we're going to say add theme support

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.790
and we want to post thumbnails.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.340
OK so now you can see down here we have the featured image box.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.940
So let's go ahead and click that.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.970
And I'm going to upload a file let me see if I can find it.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.810
What's he trying to figure out where he put it.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.970
OK so I have all these shirts.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.260
I'm going to choose this blue and white one and we're going to set that as a featured image.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.020
And let's call this

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.610
blue and white shirt.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.890
And then for the the description we're just going to get some sample text.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.110
Real quick.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.070
OK so I'll just copy a couple of sentences for the description.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.880
OK we'll paste that it and then we're also going to want the price.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.320
So we're going to put that in and each three

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.780
say nine ninety nine and then we're also going to want the button.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.480
So I'll give that a class of button

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.100
and just say fine now.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.820
OK it's not going to have actual e-commerce functionality.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.640
So this is what pretty much all of our products descriptions are going to look like.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.900
Copy that.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:25.940
And then let's choose the shirts category and we can add some tags to say blue shirt white shirt clothes

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.530
.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.790
OK we added those and that looks good.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.720
So let's go ahead and publish.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.200
All right.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.760
We'll go back to the home page and there's our shirt.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.910
OK.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:45.740
I'm going to disable the hello world post here.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:52.710
All right so I guess I'll just move it to the trash.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.010
All right.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.720
And then we'll add some more.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.530
So this one let's see we'll go upload the image

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.580
grab the black shirt

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.400
and say

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.530
black shirt and then I'm just going to paste in what we had for the other one

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.180
.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.870
OK we'll publish that.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.310
And I'm just going to go ahead and add the rest of them and I'll be back.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.740
All right.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.410
So I went ahead and added the rest of the products let's go to the front end and reload and there we

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.770
go.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.270
So it's starting to look like a real shopping cart.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.580
Now if I go on I click on the details it takes us to the correct place to the right product.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.170
But this isn't how we want it set up.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:52.170
All right we want to have the description we want it to walk like a real like a real shopping cart page

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.050
.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:59.340
And another issue if we go to a regular page not to post like say the About page it's formatted the

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.780
same way as the main post page so we don't want that either.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.440
So in the next video we'll take care of that and we'll get these pages looking correctly
