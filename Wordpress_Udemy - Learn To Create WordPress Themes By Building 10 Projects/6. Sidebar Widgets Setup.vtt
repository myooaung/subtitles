00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.160
Soon the last video we made a custom widget plug in for our showcase area.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.570
Now what I want to do is implement the sidebar.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.830
All right we've already done half the work.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.030
If you look in functions ph P We already have registered our Sidebar area.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:28.980
So what we need to do now is go to index ph P and go down to where we have our sidebar which is this

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.780
area here.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.950
And before I get rid of this let's make sure that we create our widgets.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.160
All right so we already have the categories 1 we don't have to worry too much about that but let's create

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.480
this this text.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:53.640
Ok so if we go to our back end here we have the categories we can bring that over.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.280
Save that and then we also want the custom text like this one right here.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.680
We'll put that right under the categories placed in our heading and then our text actually want the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.030
text and the button.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.230
So we're going to just grab that right.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.540
We'll save.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.810
And now we can go ahead and replace this stuff.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.920
OK so we want this entire Calo div..

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.070
And then this entire column div.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.620
All right.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.780
And then here what we'll do is check to see if the side bar is active.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.070
So I will say if it is active side bar

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.630
and the position is also called sidebar

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.190
.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.770
OK and then here we're going to say ph P

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.330
dynamic sidebar

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.190
and save that.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.340
Let's go to the front and reload.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.380
OK.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.630
So there's our widgets these are coming from the back end.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.280
Now for the categories let's let's create some all we have our categories.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.300
They show all they're not showing because there's nothing in them.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.110
OK.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.250
By default it's only going to show categories that have posts in them.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.760
Now these aren't the ones I want at all so I'm going to get rid of these and then I'm just going to

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.520
add a couple we're going to say shirts

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.940
hats and shoes.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.350
OK.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.430
And if we're going reload you still won't see them because we don't have anything in them.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.310
Now just to make sure that the categories will show up I'm going to just change.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.270
I'm going to add this hello world to all of the categories.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.120
OK.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.970
So now you can see they're showing up.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.810
Now I don't like how this looks.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.390
I wanted to I wanted to use some custom classes some Foundation Classes.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.460
So what we'll do is we'll create a widgets folder in the theme folder

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.500
and let's grab.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.580
We're going to go actually when to open this up in Windows.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.610
Ok I'm going to go to includes widgets and I want to grab the categories with you right here.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.210
So we're going to copy that and then we're going to bring it to the theme folder.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.040
Widgets paste that in OK and then we can open that from within sublime.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:35.400
And what we want to do is add on to the end of the class name custom and we want to just search for

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.090
the UL tag and all I want to do is add some classes

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.900
.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:54.530
Ok so class menu and vertical will save it and then we have to include that file in our functions P2P

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.800
file.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:07.740
All right so we want to go to the top and would say require underscore once and then we're going to

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.830
pass on

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.370
widgets.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.280
Slash What is it.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:25.950
Class W.P. dash widget dash categories.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.420
OK sure including that file now.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.660
Now we're going to have to register it.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.380
So let's go down to the bottom here

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:48.420
and we'll create a function called MS underscore register widgets

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.820
.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:08.840
We want to pass in the class name which is W.P. underscore widget underscore category's underscore custom

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.230
.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.680
All right.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.360
And then we'll just add an action

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.810
.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.930
All right.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.220
Save it and let's go and look at the front end now.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.520
And now the categories you can see has changed and looks a little better.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.270
And the next big thing we have to do is the main content area.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.890
All right so we're going to do that in the next video before we go I just want to split up the index

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.340
file into our header and footer files.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:02.070
So we're going to go from the very top here down to the end of the header tag we're going to cut that

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.800
and in it's place we're going to say ph p

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.850
get ahead.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.030
OK and then what we'll do is create

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.310
a file called Hetter dart ph P

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.600
and just paste that in there.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.260
Right.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.470
And we should see no change.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.420
So we'll do the same thing with the footer.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:40.770
So in index we're going to go from the bottom up to see the Forder cut that out.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.940
And then we're going to put in ph P W P underscore for us.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.420
All right.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.370
Do I get for that.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.870
All right.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.170
And then we'll just create a file called footer

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:06.300
and paste that and go back to the front end reload and everything's fine.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:06.680
OK.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.190
So in the next video get into the main content area
