00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.390
IT guys in this video we're going to start to create our WordPress theme from the H.T. M-L that we created

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.930
in the last video.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.010
So I have a default WordPress installation here.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.470
Haven't added or changed anything.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.610
And what we're going to do is first add the project to Sublime Text.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:28.740
And so I have it in a folder called WordPress 3P OK that's where my installation is.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.150
And then we're going to go to themes and then we're going to create a new folder here called W.P. news

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.060
.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.420
OK.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:48.590
And we need two files to be able to activate the theme to index start PSAP and we need style dots CSX

00:00:49.460 --> 00:01:01.330
for style CSSA we're going to add the comment block and we're going to specify the theme name which

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.180
will be W.P. news.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.680
The author

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.100
author.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.010
You are my

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.780
UPS needs to be a lawyer.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.890
Any of them will do.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.880
Of the description.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.240
OK so description or say news theme or Word Press.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.170
And then the version will just be 1.0.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.120
OK so now we should be able to activate the theme.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.110
Let's go to the back and go to appearance themes and you can see we have W.P. news.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.270
Now I do have a screen shot that I want to add as well.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.660
You should have this in your images folder.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.790
You.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.610
Themes of happy news.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.710
So we're going to paste that in and reload.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.290
Now we have a screen shot.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.430
So let's go ahead and activate it.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.280
If we go in the front end now reload we get a blank page.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.130
All right so let's go back to our Sublime Text and what we're going to do is we're going to open up

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.600
our index ph p.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.480
I'm going to copy and paste everything that we have inside the h t m l k so let's open up the Index

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.070
index each T.M. that we create.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.760
And the last video and we're just going to copy all of that and then paste that in.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.450
Index ph p k.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.870
So if we save that and go back to the front end we can see everything but it's all just static content

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.910
.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.220
OK.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.820
Nothing here is coming from WordPress.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.250
So let's start making it dynamic.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.170
We're going to go to our each symbol tag or place this lang attribute and make it dynamic using p p

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.290
language attributes.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.300
Right.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.360
And then in the head area for the char set let's replace that with PH P

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.410
blog info and then char set

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.890
all right for the title.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.400
We're going to get rid of that and I'm going to paste this in.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.850
So we've used this before we're using the site name.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.810
And then we're going to display the the page title.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.340
If it's the front page then we're going to display this blog in full description.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.620
If it's not there we're going to display whatever the title of the page.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.630
All right so let's save that.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.310
And if you look up in the top here.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.230
Now we have the site name which I have is W.P. news.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.160
And then the description which is just another word press site.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.640
All right.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.610
This stuff we can leave now we want to go down to actually you know what.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.890
One more thing we want to make sure we include the style sheet style CSX.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.020
So right here we're going to say actually you need a link tag you know say rowels style sheet

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:57.170
and let's set this to DHP the blog in fall and then pass it in style sheet underscore you are Al

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.010
OK so that should do it.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:15.340
Now if we go down to where we have our Hetter let's replace the static W.P. news with blog info name

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:29.470
OK we want to do the same thing with the description which we have which we have in our small tags so

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.760
I'll change that to description.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.080
OK we'll take a look and there we go.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.020
So now let's take care of the menu.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.540
We're going to have to create a new file called functions start ph p.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:02.390
And then I open up some peach tags and we're going to create a function for theme's support.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:10.750
So we'll call it W.P. news underscore theme support.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:21.030
And we just want to register our NAV menus so register

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.680
nav menus and that's going to take in an array

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.040
with the different menus so primary

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.270
primary menu.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:54.780
OK so in order for this to run we have to put in an ADD action and the hook that we want is after set

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:03.560
up the theme and then we just want our function which is W.P. news themes support.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:11.400
All right so let's save it and then go back into index and then we're going to replace this whole UL

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.820
with a function called W.P. nav menu

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.640
.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.060
And this is going to take in an array

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.810
and we want to specify the theme location

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:47.920
which is going to be primary and then we also want to specify a Menu class.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.650
OK because we had a class attached to the UL that we just deleted.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.750
So that's going to be

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.200
menue

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:08.570
horizontal and like OK so that should do it and save it.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:14.450
And if we go to our front end we get this sample page link.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:22.200
Now it doesn't look like the classes is working.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.280
We take a work

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:33.310
case of CLV the UL has no class.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.440
Hmm.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.380
OK.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.670
You know what it might be because we haven't actually assigned it to the primary spot.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.330
So let's go and reload.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.460
You should now have a menu's option under parents.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.820
So I'm going to say create menu.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.280
Call it main menu.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:00.950
Let's see down here and the theme locations you want to choose primary and save.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.090
OK if we go back reload.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:08.650
OK so now it's in effect it was just because we didn't actually assign it to primary.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.400
So let's create a couple of pages just kind of fill out the menu.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.400
All right so we'll have about page and I'm just going to grab some content real quick

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:26.840
.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:38.300
OK so about all say services

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.430
and let's create a page called press release.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.400
OK we can add those to the menu now

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.110
save.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.050
And there we go.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:17.580
So now we have our menu and the last thing I want to do here is break up our index into the header and

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.030
footer files.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:28.430
So let's create a new file and save it as Hetter dot PAGG and then another file called for Peachtree

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.460
.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:29.790
All right.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:39.540
And then in the index page we're going to grab from the very top down to where the last header tag is

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.120
.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.250
OK so we're going to cut that and we're going to replace it with each key.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.450
Get header

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.270
ok and then we're going to paste what we have in the header file.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.610
OK.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.120
Now back in the index page let's go from the very bottom

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:10.310
and is actually all we need is the ending.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:19.380
You know what let's just take the body and the age team I'll tag and we put in get flooder.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:27.290
OK we'll go with that in the footer file and everything should still look the exact same.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.130
Good.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:34.200
All right so in the next video we're going to start to work on the word press loop so we can grab posts

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:34.800
.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.760
Obviously we're going to have to create some post as well.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.900
So I will see you in the next video
