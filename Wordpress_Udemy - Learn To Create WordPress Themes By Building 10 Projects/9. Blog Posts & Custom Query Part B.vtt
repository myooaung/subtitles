00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.130
Now it's not seeing this leave class because it's actually there's paragraphs within this paragraph

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.380
.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.100
So what I'm going to do is change this to a div and then give it a class of excerpt and then we can

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.670
go into the style C Ss down to the bottom.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:42.000
Say excerpt P and let's just change font size to 18 and let's do font weight 400

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.360
and that changes that.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.400
So let's go back to front page ph P and let's grab the image k so we have this here.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.870
Now obviously we're not going to use an image tag we need to use the post thumbnail function.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.250
So let's get rid of this and we're going to put it in ph p.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
The Post thumbnail.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.380
Now we want to have a class here we want our classes so we're going to have to put in.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.070
Let's first of all say we want the full image and then we want to put in an array

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.180
and let's say class

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:54.860
C class is going to be image circle and let's do image responsive and then we also wants the animation

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.490
so I'll say animated

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.600
Thede and right.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.440
Well.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.410
Something's not right here.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.220
Oh you know what where I put this did x.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.150
I didn't change the ending P to a div.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.250
There we go.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.660
All right.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.250
Now you probably noticed that these are all the same.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.250
Now we don't have the section B styling.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.800
So this is a little tricky.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.580
What we need to do.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.560
We're going to use m p p to kind of break up our posts and kind of make.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.810
We're going to create a counter.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.620
We're going to have it be odd for the first one even for the second.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.490
Odd for the next one and so on.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.060
All right.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.170
So it's a little tricky.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.740
Just try to bear with me.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.840
So we're going to go right above here and let's say ph P

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.830
and we're going to set count.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.850
We're going to call it.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.710
I set it to zero.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.210
And then we'll set section and by default we'll just set it to Section A

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:46.780
and then we want to go down to where our loop starts which is right here.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.500
All right.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.490
And we're going to take that variable.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.710
We're going to incriminate by one with plus plus And then we're going to have an if statement or an

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.020
if else.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:16.140
And here we're going to say I know we're going to use the modulus operator and then say not equal to

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.670
zero.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.770
OK so right here this will be the odd post.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.450
And then this will be the even the post.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.500
OK so there's a few things we want to set.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.230
We want our second class.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.940
We're going to set that to Section A.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:51.280
Hey we're going to set our left class because if we look down here we have this class here.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.540
And then this one here for where the images on this side and these are different depending on if it's

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.390
s.a.a or Section B.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.330
So we're going to put it in variables instead.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.880
All right so let me grab this.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.980
Copy it and I'll put it right in here

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.570
and then we'll just replace

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.000
it or just replace it

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.300
with PH P echo We don't need echo.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.300
Yes we do need to go left class.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.620
All right.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.750
And then this here this is the section class which will always be the section or Section B

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.390
.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.750
Right.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.840
And then this one here will be the right class.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.750
So we're going to cut that

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.420
right.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:18.570
And then the last thing we need is the image class which is this.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:26.460
So we're going to cut that and just put image class.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.460
Actually we do.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.200
I am g

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.110
.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.210
OK.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.620
So if I saved this it should look exactly the same.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.430
OK.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.880
Now we want to do our S. B.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.450
K because this is all for the odd post which is s.a.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.140
Now to save on time I'm just going to piece this.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.450
And all right.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.200
And these are just the classes that are coming from Section be like we had earlier.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.480
OK you can see that the Left class is a little different.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.470
Right.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.870
And Image class is a little different.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.400
So let's save that and then reload.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.630
And now you can see that whatever one is Section B is formatted a little differently.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.980
OK.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.220
So that's exactly what we wanted.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.720
So we want the same kind of thing the same kind of effect on the blog page right now for Click on that

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.040
.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:32.300
It's still displaying index start P which is just a showcase and then static content down here.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:39.570
So let's go to index start ph P and we don't want this showcase here at all so we're just going to get

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.580
rid of it.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.390
That entire section.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:43.880
All right.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.780
And then that's for the post we're going to do the same kind of thing that we did on front page of PSAP

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.330
So let's grab.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.110
Let's see we want from here.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.630
Actually you know we don't want this.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.640
It's not going to be the latest blog post it's going to be the actual default loop.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.060
So let's just copy whatever we have in the loop which is here down

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.070
down to here.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.670
So I will copy that.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:26.850
And then let's go to index PGE and we're going to get rid of all of this section a b a

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:39.120
b and then we need to set the counter.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.830
And

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.070
actually we don't need that.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.980
So down now we'll have our loop Our while loop we're going to say ph P

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.220
while

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.660
have hosts

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.680
the post

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:25.100
and then everything we copied from front page we can put here.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:33.100
So let's go ahead and save that go back to blog reload and there we go.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.030
Now I want things to be a little different.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.060
I want to have the meta data here and also the read more.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:49.260
So let's go back into index ph P and go down to see if we want to go right under the H to heading.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.780
And I'm going to just paste this in.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:58.010
This is exactly what we've been doing in past projects for the matter.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.100
OK so we said we have posted on.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:09.570
And then we're using the time with some formatting by and then the users is the author along with the

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.550
link to the author archive.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:18.000
And then we have our categories we're saying we're getting get the category and then we're breaking

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.500
it up using a foreach so that we can display each category along with the link to that category archive

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.280
.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.990
All right so let's save that reload.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.070
And there's our meta data.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.790
Ok now for the read more that's easy too we're going to go right under the X or

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.230
we'll paste in the read more.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.550
Which is just a link to the permalink.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.260
OK now we have read more.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:55.370
Last thing we want here is a titlebar.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.610
So let's go up

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.020
and we can grab that from our h team template.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.130
OK so this section right here.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.970
Copy that.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.020
Let's go paste that right below the get hether

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.960
save it.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.800
And there we go.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.940
So that's going to do it.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.090
Now you see over here in the title bar on the right is just a static list.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.550
We're going to take care of that later on.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:42.300
Actually you know what it shouldn't even be here for the blog page so we can actually get rid of that

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:42.900
completely.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.630
We can get rid of the six column div

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:54.100
and then just change this to 12 column.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.310
All right.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.430
So we have our home page we have our blog index page.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:08.830
Next we're going to work on a single blog post because we don't want this and also for the archive.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:17.970
If I click on let's say the user name that does work we get the archive but we want the heading to be

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.540
different.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.960
I also want to be able to have the categories up here in the title bar.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:24.930
All right so we'll get to that.
