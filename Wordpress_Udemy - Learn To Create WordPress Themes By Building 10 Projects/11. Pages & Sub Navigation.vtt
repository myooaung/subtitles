00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.260
In this video we're going to work on the single pages as well as the sub nav menu.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.880
All right so what we're going to do is before we add any code we're going to create a couple of new

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.690
pages.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:22.560
So let's say add new one will say about it and as far as content Let's just grab some dummy data

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.430
copy that they publish and then let's see we're going to create another page.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.640
We're going to call this one services and this time we're going to choose a parent of about

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:57.440
OK I DOn't KNOW WHY DO I HAVE TO about's see when we get to that.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.270
All right.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:11.620
So it's at another page and we'll call this one our team and choose a parent for that of about.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.690
And then we'll create one more called F.A..

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.250
Q

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.090
And same thing about.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.300
OK so now we have these pages.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.790
Now we're going to do is go into our text editor and in that in our theme folder we're going to create

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.170
a new file and save it as Page dot THP.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.970
All right.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.910
Now actually before we do that before we do anything there let's go ahead and add to the menu.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.120
So although appearance menus and we want to bring over.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.240
About.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.630
All right.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.700
And I'm not going to get into the dropdown just yet.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.560
Let's just save that and make sure we can see it.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.710
Let's put it right here.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.260
OK.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.810
So we get a blank page.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.400
So let's go to page dot php.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.140
And I'm also going to open up from our age team template the about each team page.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.600
All right.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.850
And let's see

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.720
actually you know let's first grab what we have in single dot ph P bring that over to page P P

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.280
and this is all going to stay the same you know.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:49.380
We don't even need the about each DML just yet we don't want trying to see what we want to pick out

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.400
out of here we don't want this math.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.560
So we're going to get rid of that.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.350
We don't want the comments template get rid of that.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.530
And let's see what that looks like.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.210
OK.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.770
So there is a single page we our title our content and I think that should be good.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.330
So if we go to sample page same thing that's what we want.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.170
Now for this about page it has children page child pages.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.880
So what we want to do is display the menu over here on the right.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.960
All right so what's actually open up that about aged him Al page

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.140
and we're going to go to the title bar and grab this div with the class of sub nav

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:56.010
and then we're going to go back to page ph P and in the titlebar will change this to 6 and then put

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.620
another six call Dev

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.720
and then just paste that in there.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.310
The sub now.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.200
OK we'll save that reload.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.520
Now we have our static list over here.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.110
So what we want to do is we want these to show the children of this current page.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.580
So instead of having these lies right here we're going to put in some ph p code.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.330
OK first you want a variable called args or set that to an array.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:51.460
Let's do child of and then said that to get a top parent which is a function that we need to create

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:01.950
and then we want to title underscore why we just want that to just be an empty single quotes.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.490
All right.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.250
And then we need to call a function call W.P. underscore list pages

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.190
and we want to pass in those args.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:24.010
All right so now let's go to functions dot P P and we'll go down here and I'm just going to paste in

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.910
the get top parent code.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.520
All right.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.640
So pretty simple We're just setting up the global post variable.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.360
We're checking to see if it's if it is a parent if it is we're going to return the ancestors.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.710
So let's save that go back and reload.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.290
And now you can see we have all the child pages and we can navigate.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.750
All right.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.480
Now I want to be able to know which one we're on by looking at this menu so we can just add a simple

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.770
class or simple style in our style Dotsie SS and say current

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:17.190
page item and let's set font weight to hold.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.860
Right now you can see what page ran through the menu.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.600
Now one other thing I would like to do is when we're looking at the blog when we're on a page like this

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.280
I want to be able to see the categories up here on the right.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.580
So what we can do is make that a widget position and then we can set the categories widget to that position

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.980
.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:49.600
OK so let's go to functions ph P and we're going to grab this register sidebar right and then let's

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.960
just change this to solve now.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.390
That can also be solved now.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:06.860
And then we're going to have this just be a div with the class sub now.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:15.760
And I don't want the title to show so we're going to make this a div with the class of hide and then

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:26.890
change that to slash div right and then let's go to our back and then go to widgets and go to categories

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.950
.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:32.830
And we're just going to bring that over to sub Nav. save.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.470
Now if we go and reload k we not going to see it yet.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.550
We need to add it to index dot ph p.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.580
So let's go right here and change this to 6 and then create another six call div

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.010
.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:06.560
And we're just going to paste in this dynamic sidebar function reload and there it is.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.760
Now the reason it's bunched up like this is because there's not enough room over here.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:20.880
So let's actually change this one to a four column and this one to an 8 column.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.170
There we go.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:29.020
So now we can actually navigate navigate categories.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.940
Now when we actually visit a category page this is actually an archive.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.660
So we have to add that same thing to the archive page.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:51.100
So let's grab this and go to archive ph P and change this one to four and then we're going to add that

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.310
a column one here.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.550
OK.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:02.440
So now if we reload this page now we can just navigate through and we can set the active page to be

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:13.680
bold just like we did with the pages by just adding an extra class here of Currington underscore cat

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.880
.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.890
I think that's when we just check that.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:28.900
Let's see our current cat it's a dash not an underscore.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.060
There we go.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:37.300
So now whatever category we're on is going to be bold.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:44.650
All right so the very last thing I want to do in this video is get the drop down because right now we

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:59.060
can go to menus and let's add these three except we want to put them underneath about like that.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:09:59.510
All right.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.650
And we'll save it in the front end reload.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.210
And now you can see we have the arrow but nothing's happening when I click it.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:14.530
The reason for that is we didn't include the bootstrap javascript and also the J queery we need to include

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:14.570
.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:22.050
So let's go to Forder dark ph p good to go down to right above the the ending body tag.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.070
And we're going to say php blog info.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.560
And here we want to template URL.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:41.680
And then we'll say slash J.S. slash Jay queery and we see that the exact name

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.200
just copy that

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.320
.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:03.190
See we need to put this in the script.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.910
Ok so now do the same thing with the bootstrap file.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.990
Javascript file

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.410
.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:23.630
OK so let's save that and reload and now we get our dropdown.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.280
Awesome.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:35.680
So we're pretty much there the last couple of things I want to do is I wanted to have that bottom widget

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:44.560
so that we can have those those icons with the information pop up as well as I want to deal with post

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.820
format types of formats.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:52.570
For instance if we want in a side type of post as well as a gallery.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.160
OK so we'll get into that next.
