WEBVTT

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.110
All right.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.110
So we're just about done here.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.910
The last thing we need to do is add some comment functionality to our single post page.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.890
All right so if we go into single dog ph P and go down let's say I want to do it still within the panel

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.850
body.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.510
So that ends here so we'll go right above that and you could put your code in here.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:32.010
But what I liked to do is create a comments template and we can just say ph P comments

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.460
template.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.940
All right I'll save that.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.930
And let's go and create a new folder.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:55.630
I'm sorry a new file and we'll save it as comments towards TGP and saying there needs to be in you know

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.320
a theme folder

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.860
and then if we go and type something in here we'll say test and save reload and you can see we're getting

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.130
test OK.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.200
So let's create a div or give it a class of comments

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.460
and let's do the HP if

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.500
I have comments

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.240
.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:49.760
Let's do H-3 Is it a class of comments title

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.330
.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.930
All right.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.840
And then here

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.930
say if

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:20.250
you get comments number is equal to 1 because we I'm doing this because if there's only one comment

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.850
I wanted to say whatever and then comment singular if there's more than one then I wanted to say comments

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.120
.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.400
So we're checking to see if there's one here if there is then we're going to Acco get comments number

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:45.630
and then just concatenate the word comment and then we'll put in the else.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.400
Copy that and just to add an s to the end here.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.050
OK so that'll be the heading.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.190
Let's see if we need to end the PH p.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.570
All right.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:13.310
And then under the age 3 you will have a UL given a class of row and also comment list.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.410
So to say W.P. list

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.040
comments.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.320
And that's going to get passed in there Ray.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.450
OK.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:42.240
We're going to use avatars So let's say avatars Avatar size I'm going to set that to 90 and then we

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.270
have a callback which we have to create as well.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:57.180
OK so that callback will say add theme comments and this is going to go inside the functions of each

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.870
file

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:07.950
.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.080
Now I have a few big blocks of code that I need to use so I'm going to just pace some of this in.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.230
All right so this here is going to check to see if comments are closed and if they are then we can leave

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.270
a little note.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.910
OK.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.140
So just get that copied.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:38.610
Now let's go under this is a div and will put a horizontal rule in there and we need to create our common

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.790
arguments K and then create the form.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.420
So I'm going to paste this in.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.740
OK so we have a variable called comment args and that's set to an array with a bunch of different values

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.050
.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.230
You can have your your submit button label the title reply notes things like that.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.270
And then down here we're calling the comment form function and passing in those arguments.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.640
All right so you want to get that saved.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.770
Now if we go on we try to check it out.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.700
Now you can see that we have a form here and let's try to add something

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.900
send.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.430
OK.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:30.270
Now what's going on here is it's looking for the callback that we specified K which is up here.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.010
Add in comments it's looking for that and it's not finding it.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:42.140
So what we're going to do is we're going to go into functions dot ph P and we're going to fix that.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.910
I'm going to go ahead and paste this in.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.350
All right so we have a function called add theme comments and that should match your callback.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.690
All right.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.150
And we're passing in the comment ARGs in depth.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.500
All right.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.830
And then down here you can add some tags in classes so that you can style this.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.620
All right.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.770
I'm just going to go with what we have here.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.350
All right now we're going to have to post some other stuff in as well so we don't get overwhelmed it

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.500
is quite a bit but you can actually get this code off in the Word Press documentation.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.400
All right so from here down.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.380
Actually let me show you where I got this.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.890
OK.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:43.410
So this page here if we go down basically all the stuff that we've done and then the code that I just

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.180
pasted in is right here.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.670
All right.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:53.080
So just copying that and piecing that in that will give you the phunk the correct functionality.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.450
All right.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.920
Now I don't think I changed anything from from this code to that.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.770
So if you wanted to just go to the Word Press documentation and grab the code or you can just copy it

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.740
if you'd like.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.880
But let's go ahead and save that and see what happens.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.150
All right.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.320
So not much.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.110
Oh we have the call back.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.960
I have this parentheses in there for some reason.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.010
So let's clear that out.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.170
There we go.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.090
All right.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:31.790
Now the back in the background here isn't going over the whole thing but that's no wish.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.060
That's not a problem.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.440
We just take a look at the CSX case.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:49.720
That's a well to open up style thoughts see you see the class is called common item.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.480
So let's go in here and say Daut

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.100
comment item.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:14.290
I'm just going to set overflow to auto and I'm also going to add a comment list and set list style to

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.540
none.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:23.130
Margin is going to be 0 in a mark that as important.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:31.540
And then padding also zero.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.700
And there we go.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.960
It looks pretty good.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.080
OK so we can reply we can leave comments.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.180
Awesome.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.700
So that's it.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.450
We are done.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:01.590
We now have a WordPress theme with bootstrap and you could use this as kind of like a base theme to

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.720
create other bootstrap themes.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.640
You can use the the nav bar walker which is really helpful.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.620
But yes so hopefully you guys learned a little something in this project.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.040
And thanks for watching
