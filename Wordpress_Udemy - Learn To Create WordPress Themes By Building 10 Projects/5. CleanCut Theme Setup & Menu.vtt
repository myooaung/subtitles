00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.530
IT guys in this video we're going to start to take that HVM template that we created and turn it into

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.010
a WordPress theme.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.660
So what we have here at local host WordPress Tupi I have a default WordPress installation.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.080
I haven't added or change anything.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.090
So if you want to be on the same page as me through this through this section then just get a default

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.440
WordPress installation up and running.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.860
All right so in the themes folder which is in W.P. content slash themes I created a folder called clean

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.880
cut and that's going to be the theme folder as you can see it's empty.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.510
I also have it open in Sublime Text.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
So when I'm going to do now is create the two files that are absolutely needed for any theme and that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.160
is style Dotsie SS and indexed stop THP.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.170
All right.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.070
And then in-style CSSA we're going to add our comment with our theme information.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.740
So say the name.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.260
And that's going to be

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.780
clean cut.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.400
Well do offer

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.180
Feel free to put your own name author you are

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.690
.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.790
To description

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.890
in its version.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.860
OK.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.560
We'll save that.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.630
And I have a screen shot image that I'm going to put up which you should have in your project files

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.050
.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.410
So you want to put that right in the clean cut folder and paste that in.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.500
And now if we go to the back end and we go to three parents themes you'll see right here we have the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.850
clean cut theme.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.420
So we're going to activate it.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.990
And then the front end is just going to turn to just a blank white page.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.270
All right.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.670
So now I'm going to do is open up the aged hemol template folder and we're going to bring over a bunch

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.320
of stuff.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.730
OK.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.850
So in our WordPress theme folder let's create a folder called See access.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.050
Let's create a folder called J as I am g.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.640
And for fonts we're just going to bring that entire folder over.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.230
All right.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.710
In the CSSA folder we're going to bring over let's see everything except style Daut C Ss

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.160
and javascript's.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.170
We're going to bring over bootstrap dot J ass

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.100
.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.350
All right.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.290
And we're also going to need a queery for the bootstrap nav menu for the dropdown.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.690
So let's get that real quick just to get it out of the way.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.050
All right.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.200
So let's see who will grab the compressed version.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:51.150
All right we'll save it to see apps W W W word press to p content themes clean cut.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.520
J.S. save it right there.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.480
OK let's see what else.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.530
I think that's good.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.780
Now for the stylesheet.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:14.310
What I'm going to do is open up the style doc SS and we're going to just copy everything in here and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.300
then go paste it in the theme style CSSA folder file.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.910
All right and then we'll grab the index HTML

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.060
and copy that whole thing and put that in the index ph P file.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.150
Ok save that.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.140
And if we go to the front end then we reload will see the HTL now.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.300
But we don't have the C Ss in effect.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.040
And the reason for that is because of the paths.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:56.070
OK if you do our P2P file and go up here what we need to do is first of all for the main style sheet

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:07.870
to show up we're going to just replace this whole thing here a trough with THP log info and then style

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.550
sheet URL underscore you are all right.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.650
And then for these three we're going to just put in front of them ph P blog info

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.330
and this time we want to say template underscore you are l

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.820
and then we'll just copy that and put that in front of these ones as well.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.640
OK save that reload.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.610
And now our CSX is being read.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.120
All right.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.160
Now this is obviously just all static content so let's start to make this dynamic sort of start at the

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.980
top here in the HTML tag.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:00.580
We're going to say ph P language underscore attributes.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.880
All right.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:12.840
And then for the title let's do blog info name.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.970
All right.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.310
Now in addition to the site name I want the page title so I'm going to put a pipe character and then

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:27.710
we can save HP W.P. underscore title and we'll just Passons them just empty quotes.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.480
All right so let's go to our front end and see what we get.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.050
All right so you'll notice that we just have the pipe character and there's nothing here.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.800
The reason for that is since we're on the home page it's not getting a title.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.840
If we go to let's say slash sample page now you can see the page titles there.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.060
So what I want to do is create an if statement that if there's no page title then just put the site

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.670
description.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.940
All right so the way we can do that is we're going to go right here and we're going to use a function

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:09.030
called is front page to set to see if it's the front page or not.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.980
So is front page then will do.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.210
Question mark if it is then we want to say log info

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.350
description.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.170
All right.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.530
And then we'll put a colon.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.710
OK so that's just a shorthand if statement we're saying if it's front page show show the description

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.220
.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.180
If it's not show the title W.P. title.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:40.350
So now if we go back and reload on the home page we can see it as just another WordPress site.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.220
If we go to sample page we still get the page title.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.430
OK so that takes care of that.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.940
Let's move along.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:58.340
And in the nav bar we're going to replace this clean cut theme with the site name so we can use blog

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.250
in full name

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.160
and we can also make this a link.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.890
What's a p p blog info.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.990
And we're just going to pass and you are l

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.870
OK so now that should show us the site name also has a link.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.590
Now for the menu we're using bootstrap and we want to be able to use dropdown So we're going to use

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:34.430
the Nav. Walker class which you should have in a folder called underscore resources in your section

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.480
files.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:35.810
All right.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:42.630
So we're going to grab that and bring it into the theme folder.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:52.060
OK piece that in and then we're going to create a file called functions ph P

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.360
and we're going to pace that in so we're going to require that file.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.290
We also need to set up our menus so

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:13.430
let's set up a function and we'll call it clean cut theme support

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.080
and looks to NAV menus.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.030
So we want to register

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:34.730
nav menus which I want to do that I want to pass in an array.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.110
And let's say primary

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:50.470
primary menu and then we're going to have another menu in the footer

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.140
just like that.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.550
OK now we need to do add action.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.680
And the hook is called after setup theme

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.430
and then we just want to plug in the function name and that should do it.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.520
Now back in the index page we're going to replace this whole ul.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:34.350
We'll get rid of that and I'm going to paste in the WP nav menu function with an array of options.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.890
OK we want to use the primary menu so that should be good.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:45.320
I'm going to add a class right here called nav bar X. One collapse

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.170
save.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:11:00.500
Now if we go back and reload we get this add a menu link because we don't currently have a menu here

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.580
so we're going to click that and click on create menu.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:13.940
Well just call it main menu and what I'm going to do is I want a home link so I'm going to go to custom

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.030
links and we want this to go to.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:28.490
In my case local host WordPress to p text will say home OK and then I'm also going to add the sample

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.650
page.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:36.800
Now down here you want to make sure that you choose primary menu save and then if we go back to the

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.920
front end we now have our menu.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.690
All right.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.530
So that takes care of that.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:50.730
So the last thing I want to do is I want to create our header and footer files.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.860
So be better.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.650
Dog pee pee.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.980
This would be for her.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:09.440
And then from the index file We're going to take from a very top down to the ending now of tag we're

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.690
going to cut that out and we're going to replace it with HP.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.820
Get better.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:26.950
OK we'll paste that right in the header file and then we want the footer.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:38.670
We're going to go from the very bottom up to the footer tag cut that and replace it with p p get for

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.120
her

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:49.670
hips that needs to have parentheses and then we're just going to pace that in four or five.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.960
All right.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.680
So I'll go back and reload and still working.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:54.950
All right.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:00.410
So that's it for now and the next video we're going to basically work from the top down.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:05.260
We're going to go and create our showcase functionality and implement the Customizer
