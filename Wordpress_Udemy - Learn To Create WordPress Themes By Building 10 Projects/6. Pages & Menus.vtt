00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.940
You guys in this video we're going to start looking at pages and pull and menus.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.390
OK.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.340
So in addition to creating Posten WordPress we can also create pages.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.210
So if we go to the back end here and we go cook on pages and see we have a sample page let's go ahead

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.530
and create a new one and I'll just call this about and then I'm just going to grab some content I'll

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.500
grab two paragraphs.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.300
All right.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.590
And let's just click publish.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.830
OK.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.660
So we have an About page and we have this sample page.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.090
Let's create one more and we'll call it services.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.000
OK.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.810
Now we need some kind of navigation.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.350
All right so let's go ahead and do that now in order to use the menus the menu system we need to edit

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.410
the function speech P file because right now if we go to appearance there's no menus option.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.150
OK so let's open up functions up here and we can go into this.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.590
This theme set up function that we created.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.740
And what say register on the score.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.050
Now I've underscore menus.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.450
OK so we can use this and I want to do that.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.840
And then we want to pass in an array

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.080
and we're going to set primary

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.450
and then this will be the readable version.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.430
We're going to use this double underscore function.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.450
I don't need quotes here though.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.850
And what this does this is a localization function has to do with using multi languages in in multiple

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.850
languages in your field.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.310
So we'll say primary menu save.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.980
And now if we go to the back end and reload and go to appearance now you'll see we have this menu option

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.470
.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.640
OK if we click that let's say create menu

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.320
and see we have a home.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.870
Now you can see by default it has all the pages on the site and you can remove some if you want and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.730
if you want to add pages you can easily just check it click add to menu.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.100
So we're just going to keep what we have here.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.910
And down here where it says theme locations we want to make sure you choose primary menu.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.960
All right so we'll save that.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.790
All right and if we go to the front end to reload we're not going to see anything yet because we haven't

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.260
included it in the in our header file.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.600
That's what we want to put it.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.070
OK because we want it on every page.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.420
So let's go let's go right underneath the header.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:23.170
And what are going to do here is going to create the nav tag will give it a class of main nav.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.430
All right.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.100
And then we're going to wrap it in a container

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.590
.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.180
OK.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.430
And then all we have to do here is we're going to open up some peach peach tags and I'm going to create

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.150
a variable called args and this is just going to hold an array of arguments which we only need one for

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.950
now.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.140
And that's going to be the theme location.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.360
We need to we're basically specifying what menu we want to put here and that's going to be primary which

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.490
is the only one we have.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.130
All right.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:17.720
And then what we can do is we can call a function called W.P. nav menus and we just want to pass in

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.770
.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.070
I'm sorry I just mean you know us and we want to pass in that args variable.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.140
So I'll save that.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.850
Go to the front end reload and there's our menu.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.670
OK so it has all the pages that we put if we want to go and remove one let's say sample page we want

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.210
to remove save reload and now that's gone.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.730
All right.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.560
And just to style this a little bit.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.960
Let's go ahead and go to style C Ss and let's go down here and we'll say the meaning now of

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.000
let's give it a background

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.100
we'll do a black background

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.430
color white.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.510
Now we need to style the list items.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:24.180
So let's say main Nav. ally first we want to remove the bullet will say list style none.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:33.020
And we want to float these to the left and let's do padding right.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.980
Fifteen pixels.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.320
And then we want to do the lengths.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.270
Make sure those are white.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.240
It will remove the text decoration as well.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.060
OK let's take a look and let's do the.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.230
Well we want to remove the default margin and padding

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.900
.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.490
OK.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:22.600
And then we'll add some padding to the main that save 5 pixels.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.500
And there we go.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.000
I have a little navigation menu.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.570
If I click on about it's going to take us to about services.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.990
All right.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:40.420
Now notice when we go to about it has it's formatted the same exact way as the index ph p.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.540
All right as if it was a post and it's not it's a page.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.300
We're not going to want this.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.500
The meta data we're also not going to want a read more link.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.840
So what we need to do is add another page to our theme.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.740
So we're going to create a new file and we're going to save it as Page dot THP.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.610
Now if I go back and reload it's blank because it's looking at this file.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.590
So what we can do is get the code that's in index ph P and use that as a starting point.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.940
All right.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:18.240
And first thing we'll do is let's remove the link from the title because we we don't want to go anywhere

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.160
else.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.960
Also the read more we can get rid of that completely.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.920
And it also has an excerpt and we don't want that we want the whole thing.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.700
So we're going to change that to the content.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.680
All right.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.910
And then the metal we can get rid of that whole div save it.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.460
Let's take a look.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.180
And now it looks more like a regular web page.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.910
OK same thing with services.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:55.600
So that's how you can create pages and how you can target the markup for that page.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:02.310
You can also create custom pages custom templates so you can kind of have different layouts for different

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.300
pages but we're going to get into that probably in the next project.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.600
All right.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.720
There's a lot there's a lot more to building a theme there's a lot more you can do that we're not going

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.270
to get into in this project but I just want to cover just the basics in this project.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.060
All right so we can now have pages we have a menu

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.450
in the next video I want to get into widget locations.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.410
OK I want to be able to have a sidebar with widgets.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:31.710
All right.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.600
So we'll get into that in the next video
