WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:03.530
Now what we're going to do is work on the home page posts.

00:03.870 --> 00:11.700
So I don't want to just be the regular index page it's going to have a custom front page with a custom

00:11.700 --> 00:16.520
query where we want to get any posts that are in the featured category.

00:16.850 --> 00:26.460
OK so first thing I want to do is go back into the back end and let's first create some categories.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.370
We're going to have one called featured.

00:29.440 --> 00:30.020
All right.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.100
And then let's create a business

00:36.220 --> 00:37.240
web design

00:41.640 --> 00:48.070
global development and we also want a category called Gallery.

00:48.180 --> 00:50.310
All right and we're going to get to that later.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.520
So let's go to add a new post.

00:53.730 --> 00:59.700
And actually before we add the post we need support for a featured image so let's go to functions.

01:00.270 --> 01:12.380
And in the F.C. theme support function say ad featured image support

01:14.790 --> 01:24.400
and themes support and we want to pass in post thumbnails.

01:24.410 --> 01:32.960
OK so now if we go back and reload we have this featured image box down here so let's grab that or click

01:32.960 --> 01:36.030
that in to see

01:41.270 --> 01:45.310
OK so you should have a folder called underscore images.

01:45.530 --> 01:54.650
And I'm going to upload these three and these three OK and we're going to choose this one for our featured

01:54.650 --> 01:55.790
image.

01:55.860 --> 01:59.250
We want this to be in the featured category as well.

01:59.610 --> 02:00.220
All right.

02:01.290 --> 02:07.400
I'm going to just paste in some dummy text.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.290
Now I want to specify where the read more should be.

02:11.390 --> 02:20.620
So I want here I'm going to click this insert read more and then I'm going to paste in the rest OK.

02:20.930 --> 02:33.650
Let's publish that in let's say add new paste in some sample content there and there and then set featured

02:33.650 --> 02:34.140
image.

02:34.140 --> 02:39.490
We're going to choose this one and we're going to choose the featured category.

02:41.930 --> 02:51.470
You add another one paste in the title pasted the content featured category and let's set the image

02:51.470 --> 02:53.810
to this one.

02:53.820 --> 02:54.610
All right.

02:54.860 --> 02:58.060
Now while we're here we might as well create the other blog posts.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.780
So I'll say add new ones.

03:00.800 --> 03:08.120
Go ahead and paste in the title and then I'm just going to paste in some content here and let's set

03:08.120 --> 03:14.910
this to say mobile development set feature image grab image here.

03:16.870 --> 03:21.740
Right so it's published that will add another one

03:25.590 --> 03:29.970
OK paste in the title content.

03:30.380 --> 03:38.220
Let's say webdesign set featured image will grab this here.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.010
And then let's create one more

03:43.720 --> 03:50.960
choose business for the category and set featured image update.

03:50.960 --> 03:58.910
All right now we want to do is go to pages and we want to just create some blank pages one for the home

03:58.910 --> 04:04.000
page and then we'll create one called Blog.

04:04.460 --> 04:04.800
Right.

04:04.820 --> 04:08.950
And then what we want to do is go to settings reading and set.

04:09.050 --> 04:09.920
Home Page.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.870
Our front page to home and then post page to blog.

04:14.510 --> 04:17.570
OK once we do that we can add the menu items.

04:17.600 --> 04:22.930
So let's go to menus and let's see home.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.710
We're going to keep as is.

04:24.710 --> 04:31.330
But we want to add a couple of things we'll add about and the home page I'm sorry not the home page

04:31.340 --> 04:38.020
the blog page put about right here and we'll actually get rid of sample page.

04:38.020 --> 04:41.690
You don't need that.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.900
Let's see what else.

04:44.980 --> 04:48.000
Good so save.

04:48.380 --> 04:54.320
And then if we go to our front end and reload it's still the same because it's just static HVM All right

04:54.320 --> 04:55.320
now.

04:55.850 --> 05:01.760
OK so what we'll do is we're going to have a custom home page so we're going to create a new file and

05:01.760 --> 05:12.820
save it as front dash page dot ph P OK if we go and reload we get a blank page because it's looking

05:12.820 --> 05:14.270
at this file.

05:14.320 --> 05:21.180
So what we'll do is let's go to index PSAP and grab everything

05:24.080 --> 05:33.460
let's see I grab when you know what we only need one of these so let's just grab this article or post

05:35.490 --> 05:38.720
and we're going to need to head ph p get Hetter

05:42.240 --> 05:45.960
ph P for her.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.340
All right.

05:47.360 --> 05:55.670
And then what we'll do is we need to we need to set up our custom queery.

05:55.950 --> 05:57.270
So let's say

06:00.810 --> 06:06.270
featured queery equals new word press.

06:06.350 --> 06:10.130
Our W.P. underscore queery.

06:10.130 --> 06:12.690
And then we want to pass in an array

06:16.560 --> 06:20.940
with category name is going to equal

06:24.270 --> 06:26.040
is going to equal featured

06:29.450 --> 06:30.120
All right.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.690
And then we'll do our y a loop

06:35.170 --> 06:37.280
ok we'll say while

06:45.550 --> 06:48.300
say it while featured queery

06:50.940 --> 06:54.900
have posts.

06:55.870 --> 06:58.270
And then right here we want to say

07:01.690 --> 07:06.280
featured queery the post

07:11.400 --> 07:13.540
and then here we'll paste our article

07:19.010 --> 07:19.730
OK.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.500
So let's save that and see what we get.

07:23.140 --> 07:27.100
OK so we're getting three articles which is correct.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.870
We have three posts but they're all the same content because we're just using static content so let's

07:31.870 --> 07:33.130
update this.

07:33.270 --> 07:36.700
The title we're going to say Pete

07:39.890 --> 07:41.670
DHP the title

07:44.340 --> 07:47.240
and now you should see the titles change.

07:47.240 --> 07:47.950
OK.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.290
For the X.

07:51.470 --> 07:56.340
Let's replace this paragraph here candles say peach P The X or

08:01.250 --> 08:03.290
what else for the date.

08:05.260 --> 08:08.770
Save page P the time.

08:09.780 --> 08:14.110
And we want to format that to show the date as well.

08:14.110 --> 08:24.490
So I going to just paste in some formatting and let's see the read more we're going to have this.

08:24.880 --> 08:30.890
This is going to go to THP the permalink.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.180
OK that will take us to the individual post.

08:34.450 --> 08:51.320
And then for the image let's replace this with p p the post from now.

08:51.570 --> 08:51.910
All right.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.770
Now we want to specific size.

08:53.780 --> 08:59.840
So what I'm going to do is go to a function speech P and right under where we included the themes support

09:00.190 --> 09:01.330
the feet.

09:01.340 --> 09:07.040
The Post thumbnail support we're going to say add image size

09:10.540 --> 09:27.100
and let's pass and we'll call it home some and will set the width to 7 and 15 and height 2 4 4 9.

09:27.120 --> 09:27.460
All right.

09:27.470 --> 09:34.540
And then we can go ahead and pass in home thumb and that'll make it the size we want.

09:34.820 --> 09:38.100
So let's go ahead and save that reload.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.410
OK so that looks good.

09:39.410 --> 09:44.730
Now remember we want every other image to be on the opposite side.

09:45.020 --> 09:50.740
So all we have to do here is we're going to add a counter

09:53.300 --> 09:55.130
to break here.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.920
OK so I'll say P P

10:01.880 --> 10:03.810
and let's set a counter and call it.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.990
I will set it to zero.

10:09.370 --> 10:09.810
All right.

10:09.830 --> 10:12.840
And then we just want to go right above the while.

10:12.840 --> 10:13.370
I'm sorry.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.640
Inside of a while

10:20.360 --> 10:21.580
in.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.730
We want to increment the counter.

10:24.060 --> 10:34.010
So I plus plus incremented by 1 and then we're going to do an if statement or an if else.

10:34.720 --> 10:45.610
OK we're going to say if I am going to use the modulus OPERATOR 2 is not equal to zero.

10:45.990 --> 10:49.550
So basically we're going to check to see if the Konner is even or not.

10:49.830 --> 11:00.060
If it is then let's create a variable called float and set it to no float and then else we're gonna

11:00.090 --> 11:04.150
set float to the class of float.

11:04.170 --> 11:05.550
Right.

11:06.280 --> 11:06.730
OK.

11:06.730 --> 11:13.060
And then all we have to do is add that on to the description right here.

11:14.490 --> 11:21.100
We're going to say ph P echo float.

11:21.240 --> 11:21.870
All right.

11:21.870 --> 11:23.830
So let's go ahead and reload.

11:24.390 --> 11:31.450
And now you can see that the images they kind of switch spots every other post.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.650
So that's what we want.

11:35.080 --> 11:39.430
So in the next video we're going to take care of the blog page.

11:39.540 --> 11:44.990
OK right now it's still set to static content because it's looking at index ph P.

11:45.290 --> 11:47.030
OK so we'll work on that next.
