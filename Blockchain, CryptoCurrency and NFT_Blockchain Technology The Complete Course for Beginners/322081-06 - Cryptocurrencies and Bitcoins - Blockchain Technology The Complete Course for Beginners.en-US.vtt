00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.700
Zero can't see you getting to visit.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.500
And also the price girl last seventies.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.200
The fluctuations your can see from this summary job.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.800
So likewise here are the top 100 Cryptocurrencies.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.390
As I said,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.430
you'll be quite started with and then x r a p tedium.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.170
Like boys,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.350
they're the top cryptogram sees as that now.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:18.670
So in order to have that data So the time you look into this web leg the fine market kept

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.450
took around these raids.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.200
The fluctuations can differ from a second to second.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.450
It's better to get updated knowledge about this.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.360
They took around this region exchanging request.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.470
So we are now discussing about this top 100 pictograms but Khomeini cryptocurrencies

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
available when it comes to mark a Blockchain.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.740
Let's say the market capitalizes normally.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.530
Cryptocurrencies Available over.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.630
You can see here there are two dozen 116 cryptocurrencies available,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.050
is it?

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:09.390
So when it comes to this 2116 Cryptocurrencies Yeah,

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.490
which is also starting the highest price from the top on radio against it,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.350
saying things were going except medium.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.850
And likewise,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:30.040
there are 2116 preferences you can scroll down to see what other and say you want to look

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.890
into a detail about a group of parents so you can just click on and going signed off the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:45.540
currency and have little understand so other major thing.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.220
But I want to discuss here.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.080
He's about the dominance.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.120
So when it comes to this 100 crypto Gran's easy.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.970
All had started bombing going all these things,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.250
but who dominates the market right now or previously in the history moved off in the market

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.250
.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.290
So let's have a look on the domination.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.450
The percentage of poor to market capitalization organs recall is as the dominant.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.920
So you can see this job,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.140
uh,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:28.180
which is your can see on this axis percentage of the door market capitalization and like us

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.410
here,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:37.160
the timeline starting from July 2030 to January 2009.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.950
So when it comes to this brown color,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.980
we all can see the Bitcoins on.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:54.620
In July 2013 the Big kind head had a dominance off 94.13% that Gideon had,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.160
you know,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.370
and then in custody generally do those and 40 a bit ready use for big 0.97 point,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.150
which came around 87% days while the other,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.860
except be on like coins bit coming up hoods on.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:24.150
So when it comes to July 2000 40 bit kind again handed off millions off 92 point opposite

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.440
Likewise on in January 2015.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.490
Big guy.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.980
Big reduce off its market capitalization.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.750
Our dominance to 77.99%.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.660
That's still Delia me is not in the market like see,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.150
you know 0.0 prison.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.120
It is,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.250
uh,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:59.030
so July 2050 the year 2015 July Big kind heart 83 point.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.090
Still the dominant,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.270
no doubt about it.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.540
But you can see here like little by little,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:16.150
the other cryptocurrencies also trying to capture the market in January 2016 Uh,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.470
Bitcoin had 91.35% all the way to guarantee that very,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.290
very less percentage of dominance.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.520
Do you write?

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:41.360
Those in 16 year old can't see the 2016 because I had 83.3% tedium game of its 7.9.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.910
But I wasn't likewise that currencies also had more wasn't your.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:59.990
When it comes to general to those on sale deed where the big going at 87 80 87% off

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.490
dominance generally,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:13.230
2007 do so 2017 July yo can see a very changing environment here.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:23.760
Happening started to change that very unpredicted situation for Big Boy here.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:35.530
Suddenly it's market capitalisation drop the 38% unexpected if we are speaking about safe

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.980
every 20 bus stop 2017 it had 85% dominance,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:56.350
But on July on June June 24 it came down to 39% with the impact off it Erion Camilla.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.800
So again,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.150
the big guy had a slight improvement.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.730
Onda.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:13.320
When it comes to gentle 1019 it's still again with 35% even though it just went up and

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:21.190
suddenly came down with very few days and likewise the July 2018 reason.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.580
Beauty,

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.960
it's It's bit slightly slightly increasing,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:34.180
with the 42% 40 presents like that and also the Syrian coming off your can see Onda when it

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.590
comes to generally 2019.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:43.350
The big coin is having after team 1 to 2% off dominance,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.190
whereas the A TV in 10.5% because cash or,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.650
like,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.750
2.6% like us.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.350
So these are the Giants actually dominating this market.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.740
But nothing is certain.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.050
He's the demon.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.650
Let's say the capitalization,

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:09.090
the dominance can change second to second Onda within a second.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.010
It can change completely upside.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:18.060
So this is about the present dangers off market capitalization dominance.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:26.700
You'll have a good understanding about the grandes and always worlds always blocked drains

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.760
everything.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.620
So in this job,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:39.960
Joel can see from a period of type the idiots it tears in 13 2089 to Jan.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.690
20.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:50.860
Shift 2090 also with the different period that swarm get said that this view options are in

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.590
order for you,

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.020
the recipient doing easier,

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.450
and you have a problem understanding on this jobs?

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.760
No,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.490
it's discuss on the top 100 tokens by market capitalization.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:19.620
So your your Kensi the number one bring the rank number one Did the cat bomani with the

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:27.110
price of one point you won you with dollars as it now does that those in 90 big

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:36.090
fluctuations it has up Stand out there moving so likewise the top 100 tokens by market

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:44.850
capitalization against these things Be updated on this the time your Z everything might be

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.430
change upside though.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:55.710
So in order to have understanding your get received these absurd point market camp which

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:01.800
has updated data about the Blockchain crypto balances
