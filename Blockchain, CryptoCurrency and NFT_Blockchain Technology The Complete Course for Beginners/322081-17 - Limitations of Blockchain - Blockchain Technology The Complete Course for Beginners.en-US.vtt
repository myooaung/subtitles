00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.210
limitations off Blockchain technology Any Blockchain that birth large depends on the amount

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.930
of active users within it in order to operate its full potential,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.500
a network casting your Opus one with the widely distributed great doubles.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.460
So this Blockchain Nate Burkey depends on the moment of active uses.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.990
Less of that uses.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.420
This is the group.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.010
Moreover,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.570
there is no Blockchain ever in existence that could survive the same amount of transactions

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.840
as major card issuers like Visa MasterCard.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:55.270
As of 2019 Blockchain still has a very long way to go before it will be capable of

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.640
replacing the jobs off the financial.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.250
Finally,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.090
there's always a theoretical possibility of a large scale capture off any given Blockchain

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.090
.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:15.090
If a single organization we're somehow managed to gain the control off the majority of the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.970
network nuns,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.680
it will no longer be decentralized in the full sense off the hook.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.470
So there's a risk up.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.290
The control of the Blockchain maintain is decentralized ledger.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.160
Someone individual bosom tries to get the control off all off it,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.350
so it's no longer be decentralised.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:55.280
The lords are looking toe the limitations of Blockchain technology for suspects,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.970
but the Blockchain has that environment through cost.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.960
At least the ladies being used today It does.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.390
Blockchain relies on encryption provided security as well.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.810
Let's establish consents is over distributed.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.370
You can remember the proof of concept and the hashing function.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.970
This essentially means that in order to prove that a user has permission to write to the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.710
chain complex algorithm must be,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.480
which in turn,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.750
regard larger modoff computing power regarding keep the network running consumes as much

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.910
more energy.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.210
Likewise,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.360
this lack of regulation creates a risky environment.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.860
We'll also look into this in our again.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.340
This is largely a problem with going no other value based up Jane,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.310
but the fact he's as many interesting Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency is for the first time in

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.570
the last few months,

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.950
have found their past.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.670
It's a very well,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.840
it island vitamin.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.400
You did that lack of regulated oversight scams and market manipulation are common.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.090
Place Among the high profile cases is once kind.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.830
Recently,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.200
people.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.330
There's a poncey skill which is believed to our up millions from investors who believed

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.320
they were getting in early on what would become the next.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.550
So there's a risk,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.850
since most of the country it is not your last.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.490
So there is possibility in the manipulations on the scam and market manipulation.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:56.880
Blockchain can also be slow once again due to their complexity and the and the encrypted

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.510
distributed nature.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.900
Blockchain johns actually can take a while to process that any compared to traditional

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.810
payment systems.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.550
That s cash or cut.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.760
So when this processing becomes so,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.070
the reluctance off the people tends to increase.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.840
Not everyone of us,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.770
not anyone off us like it.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.580
Network ease.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:28.370
Anybody would like or prepare for past two transactions happening like cash or debit cards

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.500
is available.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.800
Cover.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.800
These are the few limitations of Blockchain technology.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.350
Since you can have idea about,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.110
it's not.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.640
It's going to be a revolutionary,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.860
but also it had its limitations.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.970
So if this Blockchain technology can overcome these limitations and come up with solutions

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.970
,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.580
it will be unstoppable.
