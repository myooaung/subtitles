00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
Now we learn about the blogged it and hash sponsor,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:17.730
So this block in a Blockchain contains block data as function at the hash of the three

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.620
years A block is created with all of these three elements data hash and the hash off the

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.460
previous look.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.550
Fishery will have a detail discussions in the coming listens.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.100
So when it comes to this club bait and the hash function,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.300
the Blockchain Onley contains validated transactions,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.370
which prevents fraudulent transactions and double spending off the currents.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.730
The validation process relies on data green encrypted using algo rhythms,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.940
hashing the resulting encrypted values series of numbers and letters that doesn't resemble

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.040
door Danny's old A hash.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.440
Also,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.510
this hashing rigorous processing the data from a block through a mathematical puncher,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.630
which results in an output top of fix.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.580
Like so,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.120
he's about the general idea about his passion and how the block works.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.400
We will have a separate discussion from love data,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:36.070
the hash and hash of the devious blood data.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.830
So when it comes to the block Betta,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.650
it contains the sender,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.530
the recipient on the alone,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.310
up coins for the Johns action.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:57.360
So this is what the blockade that consist No,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510
we've been learning about the hash function,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:09.540
so a hash is a function that converts and include top letters and numbers,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:17.070
using an algorithm into an encrypted output of a fix later so you can see you.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.650
Example.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.490
An example.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.060
Lover has just been taken from the Blockchain dot disease.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.650
How a hash been exactly appear?

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:36.980
Let's it if somebody if anyone tried to do changes to the block so that changes to the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.920
block happens,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.050
it's no longer the same hash.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:50.080
It is changing completely unique New hash will be generated if anyone tried toe make

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.260
changers to the block.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:01.610
So this hashing is used as a security for the Blockchain the organs in here,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.160
the example when a message is being trapped.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.760
But the eagle flies at me,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.070
which has been encrypted,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.870
that you received an encrypted output double things like.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.990
Also,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.370
when it comes to this block chase,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.760
these are secured by digital being weapons.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:36.900
So this digital fingerprints also ensures that the message came from the right person and

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.770
deals have the use,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.730
and it's in the EU's.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.820
Also have a private A Private Keenan isn't it's like a password where the user used by you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.090
said to control he saw her home.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.960
This is kept as a secret by the user simply a possible.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:05.090
And also we is a public where it is used to identify the using.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:13.230
The network is shared by the user So these kinds of Dukies also used for this security

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.760
purpose by private key on the public.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.590
So from the cinder side,

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.640
the message to be transmitted is passed through this hashing algorithm and this digital

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.510
fingerprint will be created.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.960
Waas hashing algorithm happens at out comes on the private key bridges a password and then

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.750
that peak was to the digital.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:51.010
So we'll now have idea how doing the transmission how the process that's it.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.750
The uses message.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.320
Now you know about the digital fingerprints on the public Give it that he shared between

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.070
users are transmitted.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.530
Oppose this never So there's so many controls,

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.410
I say Jeez,

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.560
their digital finger brings at the public keys everything.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.540
So at the receivers and I will speak about the receivers and how this authenticating off

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.790
this digital thing happens because the message is passed through a national golden.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.350
At the same time,

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:34.840
the cinder senders public e the digital signatures are passed very educational.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.450
Therefore,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.050
the output hashes I didn't compare to authenticate the user.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.090
So this is a week works the hash function,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.470
which is considered to be very secure for block James.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.800
So anyone can trust on dodgy on in mold in its transactions.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:05.650
Now we learn about the hash our previous block.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.720
So when it comes to the hash or previous block,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.600
you can see the blocks combination off blobs creates the change,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.550
which makes the Blockchain more secure.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.650
We'll take a look at an example you can see Yeah,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.750
your block number one change with block number two will change with block number three.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.500
So he had a Blockchain love number one to entry.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.980
Also.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:43.840
Now you can see the block Number one has its own hash and the hash of the previous hash.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.690
Like twice the block.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.610
Number two has its own hash,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.150
and the baby is hash the same day.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:03.030
The block number three years It has its own hash and the hash off the previous block,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.910
so hashes hash arise from his own book.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:15.590
But the previous ends hash arise from the hash off the cream Years.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.250
Now,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.150
if you closely look into the hash,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.670
which is available of the block number 1213 You can see that the block number three

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.620
previous hash points towards the hash off the block.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.750
Number two Life Ice serious Ashour Block number two,

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.350
Pointe Woods.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.670
The hash off the block number.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.840
Also,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.240
if you look into the previous hash of the block Number one,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:57.680
which is a bit special because the previous hash off the block Number one there cannot be a

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.700
previous has,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:05.460
since this is the first block and we call it Genesis.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.970
No,

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:16.310
let's see if someone price do tamper with the blocks,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:23.740
then what happens is when anyone tried to do changes or tamper with the blobs.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:32.650
Then the hash completely changes something wrong because the hash off the block Number two

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:38.530
He's connected with the previous hash off the block Number three.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.890
So scenes there's a connection.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.200
There is a validation points out of verification.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:52.350
There's something wrong which the transaction cannot be proceeded for the 10 days not

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.240
validated transactions of it.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.810
So the tempering is very impossible on the Blockchain,

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:05.330
which make the Blockchain more sick through these hashing Bunches.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:15.480
I hope you're now have idea all this Ashram engine works where a block cans east off the

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.490
data and its own hash and the hash Oh,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.700
the three years.
