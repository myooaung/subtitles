00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.900
now we didn't have a look long J So in the Blockchain you can't have that.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.490
You made the data.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.040
Both the big guy.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.450
Next.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:36.340
So there you can see Doc Explorer.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.550
You can see the dash warning.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.830
Advise hash.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.150
Great difficulty.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.870
He exploded.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.240
Average very average PM Confirmed.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.350
Transactions on the shameful.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:01:00.540
Likewise the blocks Here you can see the love obedience when it comes to the above.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.800
eDiets choose the height you chose Age of the belt.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.550
Which means we already discuss about that will be created.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.920
Everything you can see here the blocks have been created by its six minutes 11 minutes.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.760
It's very small nappies there you got to get I was each block.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.130
Lindsay,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.640
stop the number of transactions your kids see the transactions on the mine is very unusual

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.640
.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.120
You can see the exact liner who does the mining buses.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.150
With these you go.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.640
Who created this?

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.740
Need not against.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.800
And the size of the gold will be displayed.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.450
No,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.710
they want to identify in detail about this.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:00.950
The light is easy is that apart from that known mine is available?

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:10.610
Let's go to the DTZ Darko so you can see the BDC Garko How many reason up salving be easy

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.000
And what are the Your Kinsey with the time,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.850
the date and the time of the about speed created its unique cash on the size of the being

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.820
created at the height of the So.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.550
Like I was,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.030
you can see this very small gap in creating loves any bulbs to the genius.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.040
That would be easy go,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.730
which is a specific my when it comes to this hash anymore.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.450
See detail of these,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.150
You got it.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.540
And it's a unique love.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.840
Asked by fine lines you I'm gonna transaction 79 Likewise,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.270
you have comprehensive details about this stops and when it comes with the hashes,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.430
it has his own hash mash up.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.420
The beat used up that they spoke.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:18.560
As you can see the complete detail of this transaction fees.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.690
The high pastor was your day late time related by Bt's on the difficulty level.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:38.590
Even a lot of this sensible because find these Bitcoins on your cryptic guarantees against

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.890
you.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:49.350
These Washington how much of the way I be easy is used to be What is it now?

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.050
2002 entities that need to be really use.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.100
This is explained by Meade.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.350
Easy does it.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.810
These are John's actions.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.950
Look,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.650
you you can see them's up,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.510
you wisdom.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.710
Liz,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:24.350
how much these would want for those in 175.88 since the disease about a block,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.080
you know,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.650
very incited with when it comes to the block,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.720
that is what we see is very transparent.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.850
Everyone can.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.200
Alex is in view these deep.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:53.750
It's so really hash the Ustashe of the next bulk cash Everything uses It's a night price.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.950
Think back Good.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.840
Identify the transactions on the having.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.930
Always walk about the blocks inside its age of the look and the number of transactions will

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.130
look at the via the size of the likewise okin.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.380
See,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.050
there's a drum section pap available year.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:26.810
Once you begin to this transaction that against C transactions every second almost like

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.270
every single a new transaction.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.050
These general.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:39.370
So see exactly the generation of patchouli in the pecan.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.490
You more so you Yes,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.030
you're flying Khomeini.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.850
Unconfirmed transactions.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.260
Which means that this is a lie.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.950
You updated some Bitcoin transactions.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.440
Whatever the Egion,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.260
every second transactions happen.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.400
It is getting live.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.150
So this is what I'm speaking about 2nd 60 people,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
which means 64.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:15.000
Transaction Zeppelin's You can see this is office falling down You anything is live off

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.970
beat of rock sections into the Blockchain.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.240
It's messy.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:47.750
So likewise these time sections on this information off this subsection so as it no,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:55.650
you guess 1007 100 e tended can't exactly get Ruzicka.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:02.000
64 transactions happened to be going to this year.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.170
You can see,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.830
you know,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.750
under the data charts,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.070
the dashboard infuse the market.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.030
Pricing is dusty else.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.370
61.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.410
That was the very block size on the transaction.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.400
Pretty on demand.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.940
Full size is that the popular stats,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.200
which everyone is interested.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.010
So here it has on the last device like Mitzi,

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.780
that study sticks if you want.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.300
This study is,

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.040
you go get have a understanding by looking into these chairs at the block.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.880
Details.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.440
You can have an idea about the Jean size average,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.480
block size strong,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:54.080
that look and the median transaction so it's you get transaction.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.450
Let's see how it's the views.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.870
When it comes to the average number of prosection.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.450
Look,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:11.050
the average number of transactions with milk it shows you it's increasing on the video 1080

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.050
.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.850
Is there ever a 15,019 as a greasy?

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.130
So let's look into the all time.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.750
So it seems the station off Jay.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.410
But he's have original but of transactions.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.450
It's always really crazy.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.230
You can see.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:35.650
Is it red used?

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.150
That's still when it comes to do those in 19 it's again recovery,

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.610
the number of transaction beverage of the transaction.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.750
So this is very transmitted,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:56.190
and then you have all the data it would not standing and eligible of getting old.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:05.190
The miner mining bosses It's like race.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:19.400
There's a way you get the mining and it comes to the violating.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:29.470
Have a look nationally students about the how the mining was.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.540
How have there what is logic,

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.040
hashing,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.780
disillusion,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.150
even estimation of the hasher distribution among the largest mine.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.330
So you do,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.420
given an idea.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:46.250
Villages with these are not the individual by the state of minus.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.050
They get together on do the mining forces,

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.150
you know,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.470
being in the team.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:10:00.650
Those are considered to be the mining on what is being represented.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.040
Yes,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.850
20.2% off a no.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.450
And so let me be this grab.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:14.350
A notion was the market share of we would intrude on may be used as it up.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.960
Estimated very in season.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:22.930
Be 100 was inaccurate and a large portion of our more blocks them.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.100
You do every point to present that's not me.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.250
And attack on the papers don't get it simply means we help.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:45.120
This job will present 20 people when the body was Who Ortiz Andi It comes to the artist you

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:56.390
can see he's a be easy dot coms represented Find three present likewise f do cool 12.5% on

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:02.440
a wood will 0.3 Wasn't that slash this small proportion?

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.920
So also be taken we buy Yeah,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.050
disease.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.500
Oh,

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:31.210
the distribution way Had a look on the hash distribution And you know this What talking

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.810
about it is a very rich of our abilities to find any.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:44.220
This job shows every lady original difficult,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:51.040
used to look difficulties at distant period as a function of overt fashion problem has been

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.550
deployed by the local mines.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.850
So when it comes to the difficulty,

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.890
she's the last year every 1080 Difficult.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.310
These increase against the train.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.530
Yeah,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.800
so does it.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:14.280
18 then the big trainings.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.900
The difficulty there never use,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.450
uh,

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:27.160
really use its general 1000 increasing.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:37.160
Have a look on this all time the world In the years it goes,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:47.710
the decision is to be identified when it comes to 15 on verse 16.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.150
Difficult deliveries.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.820
What is it?

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:02.080
Those donating that the move with my my in these storms.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.060
As I said,

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.650
you're the school of minus.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.340
Did you get to get this set up this book?

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:09.890
Posca,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:16.920
you just though these asic technology this is degraded,

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.960
it's They tend to come up with solutions buying you belts today,

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.480
not Jane.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:37.140
And they get you is too many lows who have look on all the mine revenue happens,

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.910
which means that the value of the point is off rewards and the transaction fees paid to

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:49.290
disease that reward of the light do it is really juicy.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:14:05.270
So the trendies at a red using level since 2000 every 80 it's now very 19.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.920
We look on all time job.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.340
Oh,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.330
he's appearing.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:17.650
The miners who are the line is you're really usually will be less before days,

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:23.050
very less blocks and into the bulky.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.460
I was,

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:24.870
uh,

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.660
we were get increasing.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.330
Those has increased unusually on again.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.830
They're used into those at night.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:39.770
It's very unpredictable on destruct.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.670
Fusions are very unpredictable,

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:47.750
like 10 straight to use that against values begins on the market,

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.580
even in something.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:57.960
Now let's have a look on big points status dates some of you people in statistics for the

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.750
previous 24 Joe's the block somebody here.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:15.130
That's why the last previous 24 people time between boxes 8.74 minutes and also again see

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.110
the big playing like,

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.500
yeah,

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.340
a number of big points and the market price,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.100
as it now is.
