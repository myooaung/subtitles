00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Block J Dictionary.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:12.970
What you will learn here is the technical terminology in wars with this Blockchain

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:13.680
technology,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.890
in order to have a good understanding who that education relates to Blockchain,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.400
thes tells must be known by you.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:33.200
So let's start with the cryptography cryptography in Watts creating Britain or generated

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.990
courts that allow information to be kept secure.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.390
So,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.370
as we had initially stallion on this cryptography,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430
which is a security,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.500
its own algorithm mathematical algorithm,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.470
which is very complex to break it.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.290
So he's a very secular method for Blockchain.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.620
The second Tim,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.300
What you are going to discuss is the crypto cars.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.350
The first Cryptocurrency to begin operation was the Big Boy,

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.040
introduced in 2009 after Satoshi Nakamoto established the basis for Blockchain technology.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.390
So Satoshi Nakamoto,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.980
considered to be the founder of the Blockchain technology,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.880
created the usual basis and also the founder of the big coin transaction.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:35.850
There is a big coin crypto currencies number three.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.120
Big guy Big coin is a decentralized currency,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:50.980
meaning it is not supposed by any authority or any institution number pull DACA talking is

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.480
considered to be and you needs off value.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.080
That can be a court to block E.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.790
Example like you did it.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.300
The doctor.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.680
So when it comes to utility,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.270
Dawkins is essentially crew talker is that I used for a specific purpose like that said,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.740
buying a particular good doses on security dog.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.960
So when it comes to security talk,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.680
and we also used to call the security talking's as the to organize security okra,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.550
toe security,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.550
which is more than a currency,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.160
actually,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.740
and it re prisons on a ship relying on the line.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.780
Beautiful message,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.070
like traditional stocks or bonds,

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.260
have a specialty off.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.660
This is it is regulated by the U.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.860
S.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.080
Securities Exchange Commission number five.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.170
It easier at all.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.010
Benzos,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.820
bubbly,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:03:02.410
Blockchain based distributed computing that for number six miners and region mining is the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.200
process through which new it guy's a launched onto the market in simple tres.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.590
So about this mining process,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.720
I have given a good lectures in up compensations.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.160
You all can have a good understanding when we discuss in detail about this minding process

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.200
number seven months,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.630
the Nazi era,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.610
the computers that form part off the block chain.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.000
So these are the knots.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.470
Who will be the members off the number eight evil It you are means a digital Bolland that

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.330
allows users to manage.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.010
We find them except number nine smart contracts.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.940
Smart contracts me a computer cord running on top over Blockchain containing a set of rules

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.640
for the old parties,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.740
or automatically exchange with guys Number then hash.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:16.430
A hash is a bunch in that converts and put up letters and numbers using an algorithm into,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.610
um,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.000
encrypted out boot off fix later.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.540
Number 11 Double spending well matches User tries to spend their big coins to do living on

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.250
recipients at the same.
