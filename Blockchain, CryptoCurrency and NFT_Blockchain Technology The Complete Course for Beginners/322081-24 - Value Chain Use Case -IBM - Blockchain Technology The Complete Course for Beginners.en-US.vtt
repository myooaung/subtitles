00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
Now we will have a look on tomorrow's value.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.520
J How Blockchain drives visibility,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.770
trust and efficiency.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:21.630
This article is produced and released by idea So this article consists of what is blocking

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.020
impact on the supply gin Blockchain that book in the Value T Future adaptation in the

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.630
industry.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.380
How to get started looking beyond the value.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.750
Gee,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.020
we'll have a glance on everything on We'll speak.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.260
Discuss on the key things What is very necessary for us?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:47.540
So it says that by providing the single version off all transactions Blockchain pride

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.020
visibility all parties need to make better the ship's throughout the product lifecycle

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.700
improve efficiency through automation and in trust for supplies as well.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.510
Last consumers that products are safe.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.820
In fact,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.660
on the subway journeys there Blockchain network in the ValuJet.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.440
So this is very crucial for us to understand how the traditional value Jean works on how

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.300
the Blockchain value chambers.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.750
Here,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:31.780
you can see the traditional days valued retailers supply on the carrier by their your

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.810
creation or the management law.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.380
Kendari on distributing centers off the transportation happens then the accounts payable

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.450
process account receivable process and the poison and the country suitable processes.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.840
So in the traditionally organs,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.750
especially here,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.590
the system of records So once a system of regard is there,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.930
there is a lot of time and people consuming,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.600
actually the resources needed for this data entry and determination and then the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.990
reconciliation reports wants to also have to be prepared.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.130
So this is how the traditional value J take place.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.210
Now we look into the Blockchain using Blockchain how the supply Jane happens.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.270
You can see here the retailers up land carrying Blockchain on his special series,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:33.800
the use of smart contract security and the real time some buyer to or domination your

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.290
creation,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.450
no change or the management at Lower 10 responses Lord Kendari and then the distribution

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.400
center to transportations and own people Account receivable,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.860
invoicing and account receivable all the normal process.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.640
What differs is the system of record system of record will not be available.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.520
The Blockchain,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.750
because everything is decentralized,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.720
very transparent on it ease,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.000
Anyone can see there is no need off doing the record.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.360
So the reconciliation report older regenerated for each retailer buy supplies at the career

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.360
.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.850
You know they have a look in tow.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.430
The future adoption in the investing so he stays by 2080.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.690
Expect substantial Momenta Mean Blockchain implementations for consumer,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.230
perhaps on retail companies globally by 2020 we expect that nearly 2/3 of the retail and

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.390
consumer goods industries will have blocked changing full production,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.190
so this provides a hint.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:04:03.090
In 2000 2020 20 the Blockchain will come in to act how to get started.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.480
So when it comes to help you get started,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.390
yea chose the three core principles abruptly.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.880
The foundation off the necessary processes.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.600
Both the technology and the community need to be open,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.800
open source,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.000
open government,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.720
then open eco system on it should enable untrusted parties to work together by liberating

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.150
permissions and identity to ensure data and transactions are protected and consistent.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.750
Also,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.550
Blockchain needs to be built in aromas,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.230
technology,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.980
environment,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.560
private security,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.040
confidentiality,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.390
unsuitability,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.450
reliability and scalability.
