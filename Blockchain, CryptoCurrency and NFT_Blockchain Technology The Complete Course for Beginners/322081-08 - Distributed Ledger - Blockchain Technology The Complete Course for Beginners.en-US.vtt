00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.650
we'll discuss about distributed later distributed Ledger.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.970
It enables the community of uses to record transaction in a ledger public to that community

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.970
,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.650
such that no transaction can be changed.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.990
Once published.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.980
Also,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.510
the distributed legend databases spread across several lords or devices on this pier to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.900
Vienna.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.060
For their each replicates and saves that identical copy of religion and updates itself

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.310
independently,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:47.350
which means that this distributed ledger there's no any central authority.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.940
The story.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.100
Job data is decentralized entities and distributed no central.
