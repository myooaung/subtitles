00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
No,

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.550
we re learn about buying process.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:12.110
Blockchain binding involves adding transactions to the existing block,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.800
a ledger of transactions distributed among all users of above.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.260
So this process in wars I've been a block the Blockchain network disease done by the miners

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.450
who in walls,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.110
in mining these coins and the votes.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.100
So they add the back of the net disease out of the mining,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.610
currently a minor,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.350
he spades explained to five big points where I didn't have love because that this mining

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.850
processes are very complex processes.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.770
You need to have a superfast computers on a bigger knowledge in order to do this so they

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.000
are getting rewarded.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.970
Then they add a new block with Rajan.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.850
But unfortunately,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.650
their reward the reward of the minor ready uses every four years.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:25.390
You can see this Charki minus the work for success will become leading off every 210,000

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.790
bucks,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.050
or an average of every four years,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.330
which means from 2000 night was 50.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.310
Requirement was being paid 2000 really tributes to 25 points.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.100
2060 it was 12 by five points on 2022.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:52.050
These expired by because so We will also go into this but jane dot cover and have a needle

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.300
understanding how this really production happens.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.530
The reward of the minor.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.750
Why he's getting alright used.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.880
This is basically when there's too much supply on Oh,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.790
that's it blocks and into the network.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.430
So the reward gets radios when there are two very minus coming into this new deck quality

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.930
so that you go expert eyes getting a normal knowledge.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.260
So it is a situation like that.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.250
Everyone are nomadic in straight news.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:35.090
Now we will have idea The mining's off.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.250
There's actually been a mind I rather minor.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.220
You needs to have these off.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.760
There's in order in world in the mining process that a fuse off there's which I use

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.550
currently for the big point money process,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.550
See e g via multi minor B F G minor beat minta minus l.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.810
So these are a few soft,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.150
as which are currently being used for the mining process by the minus.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.850
Also NASA technology,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:15.750
which means application specific integrated circuit judges which are used for past in my

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.690
previously when it causes,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.290
though that on it was very slow that enough new blocks due to the slow runners off the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.200
mining posits.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.350
But he's very fast it out because ASIC technology specifically but these mining process,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.750
which is very fast.
