1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello and welcome back to the course and RBI appears to Tauriel We connected to our dataset.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,270
And today we're going to visualize our time series data.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,640
But before we proceed with that I would like to promise you to save your workbook.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,290
And why is that.

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:21,650
Well because saving your work at the very start before you actually start creating your position is

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,000
a good habit to get into and working in tools such as power.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,540
Because that way you can as you create it Zaleski you can simply press Kontrol s and it'll save your

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:39,080
progress and you won't lose any anything if your computer crashes or power be-I crashes for some reason.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,130
So let's go ahead and do that.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:47,570
We're going to select the dropdown here select Save As or just press control s on the keyboard and select

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,370
where you want to save it.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,210
And the name and click save.

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:50,750
All right.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,260
That's done.

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,400
So now we can proceed safely to creating of isolation and what are we visualizing.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:06,860
Well we're visualizing unemployment or long term unemployment in the U.S. from 2005 to 2015 and we already

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,540
discussed this dataset.

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:16,940
We've got the period here so that's our time series then we've got the different categories of gender.

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,700
And we've got the different age groups and here we actually have unemployed.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,390
So let's go ahead and see how we can visualize this.

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,980
First thing we're going to take period of dragons the charts and going to unemployed and drag it into

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:34,140
the chart as well as you can see part II has come up with a bar chart by default for us.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,850
Now we're going to change this to a line chart.

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:46,640
So it's like chart over here and now we have a line chart for unemployed or long term unemployment in

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,110
the U.S. for years and how does it.

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,480
And as you can see for every year we've got a separate point on this chart.

27
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,080
And what's happened is all of the rows for that specific year have been aggregated or have been summed

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,820
up into this specific points of 2010.

29
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:13,080
That sum of all the unemployed values in the unemployed column for the roles that are for 2010.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,110
And that's the same thing for 2008 and so on.

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:24,660
Now today we're going to discuss the two ways you can deal with time series in Parbat and we've actually

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,560
already talked about the previous year and this will be a good refresher but also really highlight the

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,200
differences between the two approaches and from UPSs Tauriel you will know exactly which approach you

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,060
need to use in which scenario.

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,330
All right.

36
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:46,170
So let's go ahead and Gossard the first approach is the show next level so we wanted basically what

37
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,320
do we want to achieve you want to drill into our data set and we want to understand if there are any

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,460
patterns and trends and so on.

39
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,350
So how do we drill it.

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,170
Well actually this three approaches there's three ways to drill it.

41
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,330
Got the drill down button but the drill down bottom just shows us individual drills into specifically

42
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,260
into individual records in our dataset.

43
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,330
That's not exactly what we want.

44
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,540
We still want to see more detail but we still want to see the bigger picture at the same time when we

45
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,540
have that bird's eye view.

46
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,400
So we're left with two options.

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,520
We've got the show next level and the expand next level.

48
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,280
Now we're going to start with the show next level.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,190
When I click shown next level as you recall what happens is we were going to go down in our hierarchy

50
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,700
here so we've got your quarter month in day right now.

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,950
We're at the third level.

52
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,320
When you click Show next level we're going to go to the quarter level and we're going to disregard the

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,780
year level completely.

54
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,630
Let's have a look.

55
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,440
So when I click that as you can see we have gone down to the quarter level.

56
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,110
And bear in mind the excess here the waxes doesn't start at zero so that's why we're kind of like you

57
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,560
can see really how the charge is changing.

58
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,030
It actually starts 110 million.

59
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,520
So what's happened here.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,010
Right now we only have four quarters.

61
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,670
And why is that.

62
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,760
Well because you'd expect that you'd have more right.

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,020
We have about 11 years or just over 10 years in our dataset and every year has four quarters so we should

64
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,130
have over 40 quarters over 40 points on this dataset right now.

65
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,280
But because we are disregarding the higher level and higher Harkee year level we're just going down

66
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:27,000
to the core level what we're doing is we're actually treating this access or this this variable quarter

67
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,610
not as a time series but rather as a categorical variable.

68
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,170
So in this case so we have these four buckets quarter one quarter to quarter three quarter four and

69
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,310
out of our data set.

70
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,590
What we're doing is we're picking out every single checking every so is this row quarter one or quarter

71
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,960
two or three or quarter for regardless of the year.

72
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,130
This was quarter 1 or I put in the quarter one bucket this was Koro on put in the quarter one bucket

73
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,910
quarter one then this one is already quarter to put on the court to bucket and so on.

74
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,220
So every roll goes into one of these buckets irrespective of the year.

75
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,480
And it's very similar approach to what you would have with gender right.

76
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,520
Of Gendry you'd also just basically bucket up your all your roles and tie them male or female and then

77
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,000
you would perform segregation on those buckets so that's exactly what's happening here.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,520
So in this approach the best way to think about it is we're dealing when you select the show next level

79
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,220
you're dealing with your Times who is there or not is not really as a time series but more of as a categorical

80
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,010
variable.

81
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,210
That's important to remember.

82
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:32,670
So summing up the values of unemployed people across different quarters really makes no sense if you're

83
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:39,000
not taking a call into account years when it would make sense is if you instead of adding them up you

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,320
would take the averages right.

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
And then you could look for trends across corridors.

86
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,580
Unemployment is the average unemployment across different quarters change right.

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,490
Is there a pattern.

88
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,890
So let's have a look at the way to do it is in the values here.

89
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,760
Just like the dropdown and instead of some select the average And so there now you can see that the

90
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,210
average unemployment does.

91
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,880
There is a pattern across color.

92
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,870
So across all of the years that we've had those 10 years the average unemployment spikes in chorus 3

93
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,900
and then drops down.

94
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,190
And you can continue in that you can go to show next level again.

95
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,510
And so here you can see there is some seasonality.

96
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:18,750
Right.

97
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:27,170
So this is this is a chart that represents unemployment average unemployment in each month across all

98
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,030
of the years.

99
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,040
So we're not taking into account year or quarter here which is going at the month level and you can

100
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,340
see how unemployment changes and you can see that there's a drop in unemployment in June.

101
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,790
Maybe that has something to do with the school holidays.

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,030
There's a spike in employment in July maybe that has something to do.

103
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,340
School school holidays as well.

104
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:53,910
But basically we can see a pattern and that is one of those cases when you would actually use your show

105
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:01,770
next level option and deal with Vieuxtemps use that as a categorical verbal So hopefully that makes

106
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,130
sense.

107
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,850
That was our first approach to dealing with temperatures there.

108
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,760
Now we're going to go back up and we're going to look at the approach that we actually want to use in

109
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,320
our challenge.

110
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,530
Right.

111
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,880
So now we're going to change this back to some that's a sum of unemployment.

112
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,490
And here what we want to do is sort of show next level we want to expand next level.

113
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,110
And so when we click that information about the higher level in our hierarchy's preserved.

114
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,400
So here we've got year and quarter.

115
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,010
And so now for every year we actually have 4 or so there is 2006 quarter 1 2006 quarter 2 cells and

116
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,110
6 4 3 2006 4.

117
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:46,410
And as you can see we basically between this chart with each other Goodyears And this chart it's the

118
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,570
same chart it just.

119
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:54,450
We've increased the number of points on the x axis which is our times use and this approach is actually

120
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,020
dealing with the time series as a time series.

121
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:05,670
This is how you intuitively think of a time when you're dealing we don't think of time as a category

122
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,050
you know quarter one quarter to quarter three quarter four you think of it as a continuous variable

123
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,250
and we're just basically drilling into it or increasing the number of points on our timeline.

124
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,430
And that is done through this expand next.

125
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:25,200
And if we do it again now we have 12 points for every year so there's 2000 8 January February March

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,130
April May all the way to December and then goes 9 and so on.

127
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:39,990
So this approach allows us to visualize the actual sum of unemployment or the total unemployment in

128
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,780
a proper way.

129
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:48,180
So now we can really tell how the total unemployment has been changing all the way from 2005 to 2015

130
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,940
continuously through this level of detail of a month.

131
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,640
So we're looking at this whole chart at a monthly level of detail because that is the lowest level of

132
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,240
diesel in terms of time that we have in our vessels.

133
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,200
So there we go that's how we can deal with Times-News data.

134
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:13,690
Hope that now you're quite comfortable with the two different ways that you can a deal of time series

135
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,620
in part B.

136
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,070
They were shown next level which is dealing with taxes as a categorical variable and it can be used

137
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:26,230
when you're looking at averages and things like that or they expand next level when you just want to

138
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,410
increase the number of points on your timeline and actually deal over time series as you would intuitively

139
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,560
expect to deliver.

140
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,850
All right so that was quite a lot of knowledge to take in a level play around with that and let that

141
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,840
knowledge really sink in.

142
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,730
So you're comfortable with dealing with these two different approaches and also your next time.

143
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,470
Until then happy analyzing.
