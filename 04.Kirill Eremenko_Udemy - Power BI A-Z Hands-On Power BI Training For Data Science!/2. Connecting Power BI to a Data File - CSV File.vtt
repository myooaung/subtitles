00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.630
Hello and welcome back to the course on power by day we're going to learn how to connect to a CSP file

2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.840
and load our dataset into party.

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.290
So let's go ahead and do that.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.880
We're going to launch a power be-I here I get a few seconds

5
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.080
and what we can see here is this first of all the screen pops up so we can see Parbat in the background

6
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.570
but in front we can see this screen and here it's prompting us to sign in to get the most r of Part

7
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.060
B.

8
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.540
And we'll learn how to do this a bit later further down in the course.

9
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.480
For now we're going to keep things simple and we're just going to close this window so we can proceed

10
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.270
to Purbeck.

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.210
All right so I'm going to make this full screen.

12
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.000
And in order to load a dataset Now I know this might seem a bit overwhelming at first of all these controls

13
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.260
but will definitely walk through them and as you go through this course you'll become a very intuitive.

14
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.550
But for now we're just going to use this button over here and get data.

15
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.940
And that's what we're going to focus on today.

16
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.580
So let's go ahead and click that.

17
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.670
And here we will select cxxviii so just double click yes we that's the following.

18
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.750
So now just go ahead and navigate to the folder where you've saved the file months in section 2 and

19
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.320
there it is just like the file and click open.

20
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.730
So what we see here is a preview of our dataset.

21
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.460
Now even though it says based on first two rows it's actually not 200.

22
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.380
As you can see here and we're going to just click refresh.

23
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.580
And if your dataset has listened to Hondros will just show all of them.

24
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.800
And that's our case.

25
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.400
Otherwise I'll show the first 200.

26
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.650
Also from the drop down you can slide the entire data set if you like.

27
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.730
And the point of this preview is just to give you a quick glance at what the columns look like and how

28
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.860
the data is going to be loaded so you can confirm that you are comfortable fit.

29
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.600
And just quickly.

30
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.020
But we're not going to click a lot for now we're going to click edit so we can see in a bit more detail

31
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.360
what exactly is being loaded so we should go ahead look at it.

32
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.070
You'll see this window pop up.

33
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.450
And yes it's another window and a lot more controls.

34
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.550
But again they're not that complicated.

35
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.760
And we will go over them throughout the scores.

36
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.400
The main thing we're going to look at now is how is the data recognized by Microsoft power be-I.

37
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.810
So here we've got order date and we know that this should be a date.

38
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.810
The question is is part be-I recognizing it as a date and you can tell by this I can only hear on the

39
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.280
top that it is being recognized as a date because it looks like a calendar.

40
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.160
So it's this I can hear.

41
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:49.740
Then you've got you've got this region column and it's been recognized as a text column A B C This one

42
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.470
is Texas fans text.

43
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.420
This one is units.

44
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.330
And here you can see decimal number.

45
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.230
This was actually hole number.

46
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.600
And here you can see decimal numbers.

47
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.680
So it's been recognized correctly if you want to change something.

48
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.870
Then you can just go and for instance if you want to this to be recognized as decimal number click decimal

49
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.400
number.

50
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.460
Now it's been changed.

51
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.190
Or you can change it up or here you can change it to whole number as it was at the beginning.

52
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.430
So once you've done that just click close and apply once you're happy for that.

53
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.150
And then the data set is going to be loaded into power be-I.

54
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.410
And you can find it here on the right.

55
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.430
So there is your data set there's item or the date region rep the enterprise and units.

56
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.070
And also here you can see these some's.

57
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.050
And we'll talk about them further down.

58
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.310
But basically they're indicating that there's some sort of aggregation is going to be applied to these

59
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.500
columns and that's because these are numeric columns.

60
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.420
And if you ever want to go back into that menu and fix up how the data is being recognized you can click

61
00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.080
on the left here you'll see this three tab tabs so this is your report or the actual result will be

62
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.830
creating.

63
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.480
You've got the data tab and you've got the connect relationships own relationship will only have one

64
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.380
data set and we'll talk about this for the down the course.

65
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:16.040
But if you want to go back to the data set up then you just click this data table here and here again

66
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.680
you can change these things up so this window looks similar to what we saw before but not exactly the

67
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.260
same.

68
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:31.670
If you ever want to make any adjustments to your columns here all you have to do is just click modeling

69
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:40.430
up at the top and you can just select the data type here so text you can change it or again the decimal

70
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.180
number you can change it if you want and you can make those same changes that we talked about.

71
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:54.310
And once you're done and suffered major changes then you can just go back to your report over here and

72
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.730
on before we finish the story I just want to show you what other data sources possibly I can connect

73
00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.270
to.

74
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.520
So if you could get to get data again you can see that here.

75
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.530
There's actually a lot of different data sources.

76
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.220
So not only can you connect two excellences.

77
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.590
And those are the files we'll be working with from this course.

78
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:22.910
But you can also connect to ex-MIL text Jaison files folders as skills or database bases access databases

79
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.260
Oracle databases even all these other types of databases terror data Microsoft.

80
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.230
I'm sure you can even connect to a web page.

81
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.860
You can connect power be-I to a web page and get information that's play that's put in a table on the

82
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.690
web page is a very powerful feature.

83
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.740
So as you can see they've got a lot of you've got our script here as well.

84
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.940
You've got a lot of different data sources and as you can see there's also quite a lot of.

85
00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:02.300
Be better Beira their resource connections here have got MailChimp good so and so there's still kind

86
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.270
of like in testing mode but that just shows that they're constantly expanding the number of data sources

87
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.530
that you can connect to and that's also always a great thing.

88
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.400
That means this tool is going to grow and get updated all the time.

89
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.810
So hopefully enjoy today said tural and I'll look for see you next time.

90
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.440
Until then happy analyzing.
