00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.380
Hello and welcome back to the course on par VII in today's tutorial we're going to create a realization

2
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.480
to portray the gender split in our customer base.

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.460
So let's go ahead and create a new tab here.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.280
We'll just call it gender and let's get started.

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.870
So we're going to use a pie chart and then we're going to take gender Tregenza pie chart that we're

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:36.450
going to use customer I.D. and customer I.D. is very it's a very handy two tool to use or a handy column

7
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.330
to use because it allows us to understand how many customers we have in that in those groups.

8
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.590
And if you just click this dropdown because you'll see that it's automatically defaulting to count.

9
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.160
So it's not aggregated at a sama's on average.

10
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.340
So Part VI is smart it recognizes that customer I.D. is not something that you add up or you take an

11
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.050
average off.

12
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.450
You just need to count them and because in our dataset every single row represents a individual customer.

13
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.150
Therefore counting these customer IDs tells us how many we have in each of these groups so here we have

14
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.140
1000 849 of people here we have 2165.

15
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.290
All right so first thing we want to fix up here is we want to change the colors and because we want

16
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.570
to make them a bit more intuitive.

17
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.910
So let's set that into paying.

18
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.270
And that's this one too that's too light.

19
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.440
Look at this blue someday that maybe this can even be read.

20
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.320
It's totally up to you or what colors you would like to use.

21
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.530
It's way too dark.

22
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.760
So let's try a blue custom color or maybe hear something got.

23
00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.150
So that's our first step and that way we don't actually need a legend because.

24
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.340
Because it is intuitive and we don't need to display a legend and that will save us some space.

25
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.760
And next is we want to replace this male and female so we want to actually show the percentages of people

26
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.690
in each group.

27
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.180
So here in detail labels instead of category let's select data value so you can select both if you like.

28
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.820
But again once again we don't really need to we can just select value increase the size here or maybe

29
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.140
make it a 12.

30
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.410
And what you can see here is that it's showing us the number of people rather than the.

31
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.550
So how do we fix that.

32
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.350
Well here we've got a hint it's saying data value.

33
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.480
So that means we need to fix up the actual data value that has been used for this chart and that will

34
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.660
allow us to see this as a percentage so we go into that.

35
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.560
So customer ID here are just counting.

36
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.360
But we want to add a table calculation so we want to take one point eighty five thousand and divide

37
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.580
by two points seventeen thousand plus one point eighty five thousand one take this and divide by the

38
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.410
total.

39
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.990
And in this case we will take this number and divide by the total.

40
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.950
So how do we do that.

41
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.510
Well here we can just select quick calc and give it a second.

42
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.750
So there it is basic values customer id summarized value by count and then show value as sort of no

43
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.730
calculations like.

44
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.380
Percent percent of grand total click OK.

45
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.070
As you can see there we are fifty three point nine percent forty six point seven percent.

46
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:46.050
And now if we go back to our detailed labels we don't want any decimal points just click zero here and

47
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.910
it will run out for us.

48
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.380
Wonderful.

49
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.420
So that is how we use table calculations in power be-I it is a very simple example of using table calculations

50
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.820
of course they will be more complex situations when you might need to use simple calculations.

51
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.490
But nevertheless it's a good introduction into what table calculations are all about and how to invoke

52
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.780
them in Parbat.

53
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.510
So once again you just need to go to your dropdown over here.

54
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.510
So a quick calc and slick percent of grand total.

55
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.240
And as you can see it adds this information and start percentage of G T S which stands for percentage

56
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.340
of Gruntal.

57
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.820
There we go our pie chart is ready.

58
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:36.040
And that completes today's tutorial and the next one will perform the next step towards our final visualization.

59
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.650
And I'll look for it then.

60
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.320
Until next time happy analyzing.
