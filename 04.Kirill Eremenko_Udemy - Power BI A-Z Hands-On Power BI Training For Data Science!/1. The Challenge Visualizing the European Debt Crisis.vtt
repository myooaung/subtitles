00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.970
Hello and welcome back to the course in Parbat today I've got a very interesting section.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.970
We're starting off in the section on custom visuals and power.

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.080
This a unique feature of power VI which you will probably not find in other tools.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.440
So let's go ahead and first get the data set as a whole to get the data set when to go to VW supersized

5
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.550
dot com slash I at one word.

6
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.890
And if you scroll down here to Section 6 leveraging custom visuals then you've got the visual visualization

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
here euro debt crisis so go ahead and download that.

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:45.090
And today's data set is as it says here the real data relating to the European debt crisis as at 2011.

9
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.660
So as you remember Europe had that whole situation where a lot of countries owed the money and they

10
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.320
were on the verge of bankruptcy and things like that.

11
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.650
That was all back starting from 2008 I guess.

12
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.920
Two thousand eleven and onwards.

13
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.180
But this data set is as at 2011.

14
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.300
So let's have a look at the data.

15
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.760
Once you've downloaded it you'll see that we've got it's simple datasets got four columns on the so

16
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.050
nothing is too major.

17
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.650
Here we've got the creditors of the company or the country that lent lent money to another country.

18
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.200
And then here we've got the country that the money was lent to the amount this amount is in.

19
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.010
You won't believe it.

20
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.510
Billions of dollars.

21
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.900
That's right.

22
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.310
Not just millions of dollars this is billions of dollars so Japan as at that snapshot in 2011 I think

23
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.750
goes like October 2011 at that point in time.

24
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.050
Japan had lent the United States a total of seven hundred seven hundred ninety six billion dollars and

25
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.390
this risk level determines the risk of the debtor.

26
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.150
So the the country that all that owes the money to the United States this risk is associated with that

27
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.340
country so the United States you can see it's always stable meaning it's it's there's like the risk

28
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.950
is insignificant then you've got some countries that have high risk like Italy or had high risk at the

29
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.810
time.

30
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.930
Portugal you've got medium risk Spain and there's a couple of low risk like France.

31
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.980
I think France is actually the only one with low risk here.

32
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.900
So that's some on the roads lent or that was owed.

33
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.770
And so this is a balance.

34
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.840
So you'll notice that you won't find in this table the reverse situation where United States lend money

35
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.720
to Japan because if that had happened then this is a summary of those so for instance there were cases

36
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.740
where Germany lent money to Italy lend money Germany Germany might lend money to Italy.

37
00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.110
And then the result of that too is actually if you add the two up then the amount is just this 111 billion

38
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.400
that Italy lent to Germany.

39
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.010
So this is the balance of the both ways that the lending was happening.

40
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.770
So here we only have 46 rows.

41
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.210
But as you can imagine the numbers here are quite large and billions of dollars and 40 46 or minus ahead

42
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.070
of 45 rows is enough to describe that whole situation that was going on which was pretty serious so

43
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.300
that's what we're going to be working with as close that we don't need to save it and bring a power

44
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.500
be-I and connected data set.

45
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.840
All right.

46
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:45.960
So it is quite simple get data since you file this time to find where you save the file your debt crisis.

47
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.730
There you go.

48
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.980
And just look ok.

49
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.760
Go to second.

50
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.210
There you go.

51
00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.710
So the file is loaded and we can from here just proceed with the election and we'll continue in the

52
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.430
next tutorial.

53
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.700
But what I wanted to shoot today was the original version of the resolution.

54
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.260
Are we going to be recreating what we won't be recreating it per se so be different what we create.

55
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.460
But here you go so if you search for New York Times and then just look for the overview of the euro

56
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.220
crisis.

57
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.650
So just search for that in Google and then just type in New York Times Well you'll get this is Alsation.

58
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:37.260
And so this is a very advanced and we won't be creating something as like as sophisticated as this will

59
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.650
be simpler because you can see here you can jump around and you know it shows different parts of the

60
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.510
weasel's ocean.

61
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.060
And as you can imagine this would have taken quite a lot of time to create this.

62
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.420
Looks like you know maybe a hand-drawn resolution or specific resolution so this is not a generic thing

63
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.920
and would have taken quite a lot of time to create this.

64
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.050
What is going to be much quicker and easier and you'll see how quickly it will tear apart we are you

65
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.680
can create something not 100 percent as good as this but about 80 percent as good as this and still

66
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.980
something that tells the story and that's how it's going to be our focus to get that quick going and

67
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.130
show that power by you can very quickly create things that drive insights and and always and if you

68
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.480
know if you have the time you can sit down and create something like this and you're probably in a different

69
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.030
tool.

70
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.540
But at the same time you've got that lever.

71
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.120
So check out this page.

72
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.700
Maybe if you like before we get started and learn a bit about well you can learn here a bit about what

73
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.850
was going on and who owed money to who.

74
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.410
And you can kind of see the big picture here right away.

75
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:53.580
So then when we're working with the data set already be familiar with the whole geo political situation

76
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.220
or financial and economical situation.

77
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.270
I was going on.

78
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.160
All right so that's it for today and of course here.

79
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.830
Until then happy analyzing.
