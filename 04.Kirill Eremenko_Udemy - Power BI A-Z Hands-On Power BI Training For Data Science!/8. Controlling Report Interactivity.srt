00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,920
Hello and welcome back to the course and party.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,510
Today we're going to add some finishing touches to our wonderful business intelligence report.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:08,800
All right.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,370
So let's get straight into it.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,800
First of all you can see that I would just add the colors.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,980
I've decided to go with more conservative colors for the job classification and they tie in better to

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:28,650
the overall picture than I've changed some colors on the map and also just the colors for gender and

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:36,750
now what we want to do is we want to first of all have a look at how this report works without analyzing

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,870
it at this stage.

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,800
We want to just understand the interactivity that is present on this report.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,680
So for instance if I click on something here you can see that everything adjusts so well the number

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:01:00,060
at the top changes which now shows us the number of people or customers in this region in Scotland tells

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,800
us the distribution how it changes.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,080
And in fact you can actually see the previous distribution behind it.

15
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,030
There you can see here.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,140
Here you can see the previous charts previously but you can also see how they changed.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,610
The first question is why is this necessary why do we need this interactivity.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,330
Well just imagine that you deliver this report to a bank and it has four regions as depicted here and

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,360
naturally you'd expect that each region would have its own executive.

20
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,640
So for example the CEO of the bank overall would like to see this whole picture and understand what's

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,560
going on in the bank or with the customers of the bank generally.

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,630
But then the executive in each of those individual regions would want to see what's going on with their

23
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,370
specific customer base.

24
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:49,700
Right.

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,000
And that's what this report allows you to do or allows them to do.

26
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:00,990
It allows them to drill into or recreate this position and very quickly just for their segment of the

27
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,510
market just for what they are responsible for.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,010
Also Moreover you can drill into separate segments of your bank overall so you can look at just your

29
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:17,040
female customers or you can look at all of your blue collar customers or white collar customers and

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,380
you can look at different age groups so by holding down control as you can see I'm looking now at everybody

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,100
under 40.

32
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,100
So we'll get to the analytics of that.

33
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:33,240
But for now what is peculiar is that when we select something here on the map these charts do have a

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,120
history of what the overall looks like with these don't.

35
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,300
So what does that happen.

36
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,730
Well I had a I did a bit of an investigation and I found that this the reason for that is that we added

37
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,270
this table calculation the percentage of total so I'll show you on an example so I'm going to go to

38
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,810
the quick calc and remove the percentage of total.

39
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,980
So just click OK.

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,630
And now you'll see when I select the different regions you can still see the previous split.

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,970
And then you can see a new overlayed split.

42
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:13,530
On top of that so it's probably not the best not the best solution in this case so it's a bit kind of

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:24,420
it's a bit counter intuitive or it just doesn't really portray the inside this new part of it is inside.

44
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:31,350
So it's actually not that's not such a big problem that we can see it when we add a percentage of total.

45
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,830
So perhaps at the time when you're watching this video this has been resolved by power be either constantly

46
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,200
trading or software.

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,220
But if not it's not a big deal.

48
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,390
And the same thing for the team.

49
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,110
You can test it out for ourselves if you remove the percentage of total calculation.

50
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,030
You'll see that it adjusted the same way.

51
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,910
Now that is a good segue into how can we control the behavior of these resolutions.

52
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,250
Well over here if you go into a format there's a button called editor interactions.

53
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:09,000
If you click that it will allow you to decide which interactions you want and wish interactions you

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,750
don't want.

55
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,840
So for instance if I click this map you can see that the map selected all of the other elements on this

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,710
is a position they now have this additional option at the top where I can select what type of interaction

57
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,160
I want.

58
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,960
So what will happen when I click the map what will happen to this resolution for instance.

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,130
Will it be filtered.

60
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,670
Will it be highlighted or will nothing happen.

61
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,310
So if I select nothing then uncheck edit interactions.

62
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:43,690
Now if I click this map you can see that everything is updating except for this part of the visualization.

63
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,030
OK.

64
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:52,860
So if I now click Edit interactions and instead of nothing I select filter and then uncheck that you'll

65
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:00,210
see that what's happening now is that it's no longer show me the history of what was there before.

66
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,960
It's just updating this visualization completely.

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,280
So you might want that type of behavior on your visa and you might not want to compare it to what you

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,220
used to have especially in this case.

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,690
As you can see when you have the history then it's really hard to.

70
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:28,160
You can be hard to tell what's going on because you've got two layers one after the other.

71
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,310
So that's how this works.

72
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,150
For example click on this again and let's say we want to filter this one as well.

73
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:44,030
So now you can see that it's updating and there's nothing in the background so it might be easier to

74
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:52,180
work with this type of visualization but that's totally up to you how you want it to work.

75
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,050
But I personally will probably leave it like this because I'm we're used to this approach where you

76
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,410
don't see what was going on in the background what was going on previously.

77
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,330
And moreover these charts are structured in that way anyway so that way is consistent throughout.

78
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,160
But then you'd have to change it for all of them.

79
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,480
Right.

80
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:17,000
So you would need to change it for if you're going to be using it for this chart as well you need to

81
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,930
go into this chart and then select filter here.

82
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:28,960
And then again you need to adjust and check that or you can just keep it checked and just select them

83
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,940
all like that.

84
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:36,490
So make sure that was unfilter that one in that one.

85
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,390
So let's see how that works.

86
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:46,990
OK so I guess we need to select each one like that each one separately.

87
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,020
Let's have a look.

88
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,170
That one deadline set up so we'll only have to do is set up this one.

89
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,990
And have we set this one up yet.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No.

91
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,960
All right.

92
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:09,520
So that should solve the problem so whichever chart I click now they all will just filter to the final

93
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,600
result.

94
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,930
So there's no chart other chart of the background.

95
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,560
That's what my personal preference you might have your own approach in this situation.

96
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,220
All right.

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,910
So that is how we set up these charts.

98
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:32,980
That's how we work with the interactivity or interactions in the background and in the next Tauriel

99
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,940
we're going to actually derive the insights from this visualization.

100
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,970
I look forward scenics them and until then happy analyzing.
