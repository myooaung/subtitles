00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.190
Hello and welcome back to the course on power be-I.

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.330
Today we starting a brand new section and we're talking about long term unemployment statistics in the

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.910
U.S. and we're going to learn how to build stacked era charts.

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.770
Going to be exciting session ahead.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.470
Let's dive straight into it.

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.720
All right.

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.750
The first thing we're going to need is a browser.

8
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.720
We're going to go to that super sized dot com slash power be-I.

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.440
And here if you scroll down to the bottom or an octave on to section number three times use aggregation

10
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.870
and filters.

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.170
Here we're going to be able to download the data set.

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.580
So go ahead and click on that long term unemployment statistics.

13
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.200
So the focus of this section is actually going to be also time series data and we're going to learn

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.430
a lot about aggregation.

15
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.110
So quite a lot of things that we're going to cover of In this section of the course.

16
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.380
All right so once the file is downloaded Let's have a look at what we can see inside.

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.160
So there it is.

18
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.530
And here you will see an interesting formatting of the file.

19
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.100
You'll see that we've got age groups and bear in mind so age is not a numeric verbal here it's a categorical

20
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.210
variable so we're very they've very been grouped for us.

21
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.160
And if you scroll down you'll see that they repeat themselves.

22
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.460
They tend to repeat themselves.

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.170
And why is that.

24
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.460
Well that is because of the way this file is structured.

25
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:35.030
So in the first column you've got age groups right so 16 to 19 20 24 25 30 45 44 45 54 of 64 65 and

26
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.330
over.

27
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.210
So that's a total of seven age groups.

28
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.710
And then we just continuously repeat themselves.

29
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.760
And that is because here we've got all the age groups for men.

30
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.800
Then we've got them for women.

31
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.020
But then again men repeat themselves and women repeat themselves.

32
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.520
And why.

33
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.850
All that is because here we've got to January 2005.

34
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.300
Right.

35
00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:03.020
So we've got first we're looking at generally 2005 at all the male the male segment and then we're looking

36
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.910
at the different age groups and we're looking at Gerrish thousand five at the female segment and then

37
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.620
at all of the age groups and then we're moving on to February 2005 the next month again we need to look

38
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.740
at the male segment and all of the age groups there then we look at the females February 2005 female

39
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.650
segment and all age groups there ever every single iteration that we do we've got and the number of

40
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.540
unemployed people in that specific segment.

41
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.100
So for example let's have a look here.

42
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.100
In January 2005 in the male segment in the age group 34 35 to 44.

43
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.590
There were twenty two.

44
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.620
There were two hundred and one thousand unemployed people in that specific segment.

45
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.680
And so it just goes on like that.

46
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.770
So there's we still 2005 2006 and so on and so on all the way to 2015.

47
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.350
Right so we go up to February selling 15.

48
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:07.760
So the question is why is it so like structure why is the data structured in such an interesting and

49
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.020
inhuman way.

50
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.500
And the answer is in the question itself it's because this data is prepared for machines is prepared

51
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.330
for the computer to process it quickly and efficiently.

52
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.070
And it is very different indeed to what humans are used to so as humans we'd be more used to something

53
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.790
like this.

54
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.590
So here I've got a picture of an excel sheet and this is what would be used to write would be used to

55
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.090
having age on the left.

56
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.310
Here this is one of the ways we would have structure as humans age in the last year.

57
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.020
Then you've got your months January February and so on.

58
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.310
And then within each month we've got two segments.

59
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.880
Males.

60
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.500
Females are men women men women.

61
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.220
And so if you need to look up for instance quickly September 2005 45 to 54 years old.

62
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.000
You'd go on the top you'd look very quickly.

63
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.740
All right September 2005 and let's say you need the female segment.

64
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.930
So there it is.

65
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.660
And then you look over here 45 to 54 years old so that's a third one from the bottom September 2005.

66
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.290
There we go hunt 152 thousand unemployed.

67
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.640
Right.

68
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.420
So it's much quicker and much easier and very visual to work with this data.

69
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.830
But the thing is machines aren't visual they don't need this visual aid for them.

70
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.620
It's much easier to work like this for a machine and be much quicker to analyze this and it would find

71
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.550
the results faster than we would in this much faster than we would in this type of format.

72
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.500
And so even though we are not used to this this is the correct format for the machines or for a computer

73
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.400
using machines like we're in some sort of movie.

74
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.090
It's the correct format for the computer or for par vi to quickly process this data.

75
00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.720
All right so we've quite closely learned about this data set.

76
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.010
Now let's go ahead and imported into power be-I.

77
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.610
Here's a blank fresh workbook.

78
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.830
Let's get data.

79
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.570
This is an excel file and there it is an up that's on it.

80
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.690
It's in section 3 Let's get a second.

81
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.280
So again you can so here you can see a couple of sheets.

82
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.150
These are empty.

83
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.420
Right.

84
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.520
So this is the one we want check box here.

85
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.390
Click load and give it a second to load.

86
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.750
All right so there you go the datasets and left you can just make sure confirm that everything is good

87
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.170
here.

88
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:47.580
So one thousand seven hundred eight rows and you can always just go and check that that is the correct

89
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.530
number.

90
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.230
So if you go to the bottom here you've got 1709 minus the header which is wrong.

91
00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.420
But one makes it one thousand seven hundred and eight rows as we can see here.

92
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.780
It's always good to confirm that we loaded the right number of rows.

93
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.370
All right so that's how we load this data into our visualization and starting from the next tutorial

94
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:20.250
we're going to start visualizing the data set and deriving insights about the actual unemployment numbers

95
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.840
in the US is going to be exciting.

96
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.390
I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

97
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.980
And until then be analyzing.
