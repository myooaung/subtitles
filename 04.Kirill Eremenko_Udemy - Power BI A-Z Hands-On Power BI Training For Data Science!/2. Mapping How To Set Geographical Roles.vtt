Hello welcome back to the course on party.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.790
Today we're going to start creating our business intelligence report and the way we're going to create

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.590
it is throughout this section in every tutorial we're going to create a new element whether it's a map

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.400
or a pie chart or a bar chart or a tree map and so on and so we'll just create those one by one and

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.130
at the end we'll put them together.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.770
And today I'll start off by creating our a map and also want to mention right away just to manage expectations

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.810
that if you've taken my course on Tablo then the end result in this section won't be as interactive

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.460
as the version in Talland that and that is just due to some limitations of the power tool but nevertheless

9
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.420
it will be an interactive business intelligence report and it will convey some very useful information.

10
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.970
So it is definitely a worthwhile exercise.

11
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.040
Putting it together and learning how to do all these things.

12
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.780
All right so let's get started.

13
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.140
Let's create our map.

14
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.180
The first thing we're going to need to do is we're going to take region and drag it on to our canvas

15
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.870
and then we're going to select a field map over here.

16
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.870
So there is our field map as you see region has moved into legend.

17
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.870
Now we're going to take region and also put it in a location.

18
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.310
Now as you can see as well nothing is happening.

19
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.190
Our map is not recognizing this data as Geographic.

20
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.370
So how can we fix that.

21
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.340
Well what we can do is we can go to modeling and here in our for this variable for this cold region

22
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.890
what we need to select is under a different data category we're going to click this drop down and we're

23
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.720
going to actually tell it that this is a state or province and right away as you can see our map has

24
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.380
been created.

25
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.210
So now we're going to zoom up zoom out a little bit and then we'll just go to the format map controls

26
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.820
and I'll to zoom off.

27
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:13.020
So just keep that off so that when we do use this map inside a or b I report it just stays at this zoom

28
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.080
in and doesn't zoom out or zoom in.

29
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.060
So that's pretty much it.

30
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.130
That's how we create this map.

31
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.350
But then in addition to a map we'd like to also see the number of people that are present in each location.

32
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.500
So we're going to we cannot add that right on the map.

33
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.950
In this version of Part VI maybe in the future there will be a resolves but for now what we're going

34
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.380
to do is we're just going to create a indicator here so we just get a card.

35
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.010
They're called cards which is going to click on the whitespace.

36
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.710
So like card I would put it above where now.

37
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.220
And here we going to.

38
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.080
So a customer id put it in there and why we select customer ID is because that's the easiest way to

39
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.300
count the number of customers that we have because each customer is a role.

40
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.730
And if you go into here you'll see that fields the way it's aggregated is through count.

41
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.410
So it's actually counting number of customers we have 4000 and 14 customers total.

42
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:25.820
So now I'm going to let the page for this card I'm going to remove the title of this one the label.

43
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:34.390
There goes so four thousand fourteen and maybe increase the size to the maximum like that.

44
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.450
So now whenever I select a region I can tell right away how many people how many customers we have in

45
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.950
each one of those regions.

46
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.370
So for example in England we have two thousand one hundred and fifty nine whereas in Scotland we have

47
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.280
1000 124 customers.

48
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.580
All right.

49
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.340
So that's our very first step in this position.

50
00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.390
We're just going to rename this to map and then we're going to save this as well and we'll call it Section

51
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.620
5.

52
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.600
So wonderful.

53
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.310
Right so that was our first step.

54
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.280
And in the next tutorial we're going to create.

55
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.980
And then next chart for our final results.

56
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.350
I look towards you there and until next I'm happy analyzing.
