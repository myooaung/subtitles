00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.970
Hello welcome back to the course and Part II in the OF we learned about drilling down and drilling up

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.190
in a nation.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:16.080
And today we're going to learn two new techniques for looking at more details views of all vessels.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.310
And so these are these bottles are here show next level and expand next level.

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.700
So let's have a look at how they work.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.720
Once you've selected the ocean and onto the drill tab over here let's click Show next level and just

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.420
see what happens to a chart.

8
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.470
I'm going to click it now as you can see.

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.480
Now the core is up here instead of the years.

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.990
And the interesting thing here is that quarter one and quarter on the left.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.830
If I go back up we'll see them 2014 on the left here which is which only contains quarter three and

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.570
quarter four because it's got the last two quarters of 2014 and quarter and 2015 contains the first

13
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.670
two quarters quarter one and quarter two of that year.

14
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.830
And when we go to show next level now the quarters are in the wrong order and I'm saying wrong with

15
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.650
virtual quotation marks here because from the Parbat is perspective it's completely correct because

16
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.500
what happened here is if you look at the at the higher on the right we've got order date which has broken

17
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.220
down into year quarter month and day and by clicking the show next level option we're saying okay completely

18
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.770
disregard year and go to a quarter but don't don't consider year at all.

19
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.390
And that's what exactly our power bill is doing it's looking at all of the data and it's trying to understand

20
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.280
for every row in which quarter it is regardless of the year and then grouping it like that.

21
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.830
And that's why corer want to appear to be here because power be-I is disregarding year you can see that

22
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.090
here it's as units by quarter doesn't even contain the year.

23
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.440
So we can drill in further again go by going to show next level.

24
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.190
And here now we've got Jennifer March April May June and these months are actually from 2015 these months

25
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.690
from 2016 but this delegation is by month.

26
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.960
And when I'm saying aggregation I mean that again in our dataset if we go to a dataset you'll see here

27
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.970
that every row is a transaction on a certain date.

28
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.300
Right.

29
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.520
So and then we're just aggregating them up to a certain level.

30
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.590
And here this level is specified as month.

31
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.980
So a year and quarter information are disregarded and the data is aggregated up to the month level.

32
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.620
And then if we go to the next level again which you'll see here is that we've got just the days of the

33
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.220
day number.

34
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.950
And again it is irrespective of any higher levels in this hierarchy so Year Quarter and month are completely

35
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.680
disregarded and we just see units by day.

36
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.530
And this actually brings up a very interesting concept.

37
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.730
So if I look at for example Order day four or so.

38
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.130
How many units were ordered on the fourth month of fourth day.

39
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.110
But then the question is of what Which month.

40
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.980
But right now RBI doesn't really look at them and doesn't look at the Month at all.

41
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.720
It just looks at the day so in euros wherever the day of the month of any month is number four that's

42
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.710
the those rows will be aggregated into this bar.

43
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.430
And so let's have a look at our data set.

44
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.000
Let's see where we can find find the date before.

45
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.640
So if we look down like this way for some it is scroll up to the top so if I look down here you can

46
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.540
see Friday July the 4th right.

47
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.280
So this row has the day as the fourth.

48
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.170
Then if I keep scrolling down we keep looking down.

49
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.300
I must've missed one.

50
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.650
There it is Thursday December the 4th.

51
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.600
There is another one so and if you look through all of them there's only two so Friday July the 4th

52
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.920
2014 and Thursday December the 4th 2014 as well.

53
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.020
So those two rows are going to be aggregated and you can check that because the units here is 62.

54
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.910
And in this one the unit is 94 so together is a hundred and fifty six.

55
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.100
If I look at this this is exactly 156.

56
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.110
So what we have done here is we've aggregated our data at day level but we've disregarded the of the

57
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.600
higher levels in that hierarchy.

58
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.330
And sometimes that can be useful especially if you're dealing with categorical data rather than dates.

59
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.230
And then you've got a categorical hurricane you might want to break it down like that.

60
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.430
But in our case this might not be the best approach so we're going to do now is we're going to just

61
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.190
go back up we're going to drill up go back to the start and this time instead of showing next level

62
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.380
we're going to expand the next level.

63
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.430
So let's see what happens then if we expand next level.

64
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.820
Now we're preserving information about the higher level and are higher.

65
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.790
And even though the data is ordered it's not ordered correctly so go 20:15 first and then 2014.

66
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.720
That is very easily fixable.

67
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.760
Just now the most important thing is that we are preserving the information that we've got units by

68
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.050
year and quarter.

69
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.350
So here we're keeping the year as well as the core.

70
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:38.840
So now for these 3.00 here I can just set select sort by year quarter if I like that you can see 2014

71
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:47.300
quarter 3 2014 quarter for 2015 2015 quarter 2 so it's sorted in a chronological order.

72
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:55.600
Now if I go to expand next level again you'll see that again it's expanded.

73
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.800
But this time is preserved all of the higher level.

74
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.100
So you've got your quarter and month 2014 quarter through July and August September and so on.

75
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.820
So again it's sort in the correct order.

76
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:16.650
And then if I go to expand this again now you'll see many more dates because the higher levels in our

77
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.660
heart care preserve.

78
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.720
So for instance let's make some more space.

79
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.640
So for instance here you've got a 2014 course 3 July the 4th.

80
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.080
62 units sold.

81
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.890
And then if you go to December you've got December the 4th separately as well.

82
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:44.580
So and that is solely due to the fact that we've preserved the year quarter and month as well as added

83
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.150
the day into our granularity.

84
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:53.720
So now we are actually seeing a very detailed picture and we know all of the above information in our

85
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.960
hurricane.

86
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.030
So that's how these two buttons work and we'll be using them.

87
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.850
We'll be using all four of these throughout our

88
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:12.440
work with power be-I and they are very very powerful and they help us navigate through the different

89
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.600
levels of aggregation and granularity.

90
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.390
And of course we got this final button here see records.

91
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.700
You can always just click that and whenever you select something it'll actually show you the records

92
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.240
for that

93
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.770
element on your results.

94
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:35.510
And so if I do love for instance and I select December here will show me the records for that for December

95
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:42.020
2014 quarter for December so that's in case you want to just actually investigate what's going on in

96
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.860
the dataset.

97
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.060
That's another additional feature that is very handy as well.

98
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:55.850
So I hope you enjoyed today's Tauriel and even though these functions might seem new and even maybe

99
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:02.360
complicated as we go through this course we'll get more and more used to them and very soon you will

100
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.710
feel extremely comfortable using these patterns and different functions in your work with RBI.

101
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.730
And I look forward to next them until then happy annelid.
