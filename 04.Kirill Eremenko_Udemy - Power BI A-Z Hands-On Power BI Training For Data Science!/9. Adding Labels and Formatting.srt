00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,280
Hello welcome back.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:08,130
Of course the RBI in the previous tutorials that we finalized our data mining part of the challenge

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,330
so we found the solution we found the answer to our question.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,680
We know who will get the bonuses it will be.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,240
Matthew the central region Susan in the East region and James in the West region and today what we want

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,940
to do is we want to format all of those nation so that it looks fantastic and that's what we're going

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,980
to get started on right away.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,170
All right to start the formatting we need to click on a version make sure it's selected and then go

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,700
into this tab on the right format.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,820
And here what we want to do is we want to start looking at how we can improve this position so it's

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,020
more legible because data size is not only about finding answers.

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,510
It's also about communicating them and making them accessible to people who are going to be using your

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,390
report.

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,100
So let's start by adding the actual values on Tabarin because right now the only way we can find out

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,890
the number behind this behind the bar is by looking on the plot on the left or right or using a tool

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,350
tip.

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:21,660
But if you for instance if you don't have if you have this report as a printed version or APF version

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,060
and then you won't be able to use the tool tip.

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,150
So your only source of information will be this access way here.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,670
And that's why we want to add the actual values to the bars themselves.

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,470
So let's go on the right here and look at the data labels.

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,390
So if we select the labels and put them on you'll see that the labels are here.

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,730
Now they don't look best right now and some of them don't even fit.

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,300
So we're going to fix this up.

25
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,970
We're going to display them in thousands and we're going to say one decimal point.

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,090
So now it's like it's just 3.1.

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,530
OK 2.4 K and so on and everybody understands that language.

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:06,570
And we're going to say leave the orientation horizontal and we can set the position as inside and set

29
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,100
the top and we're going to increase the size to 12.

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,610
There we go.

31
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,990
So looks wonderful now.

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,160
I know you can also change the color if you feel that it's probably better in a different color.

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,950
For instance this is yellow and white on yellow maybe not.

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,020
Doesn't look as great as you'd want wanted to see you can change that black wearing other color you

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,500
like.

36
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,010
So we can leave this one out of black for example in this case.

37
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,210
And next which you want to do is fix up the other things that you have access to here.

38
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,790
So data labels were done with that plot area.

39
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,270
We won't be touching that for now title.

40
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,040
So here we've got the title toll sales by region.

41
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,380
You might want to switch it off completely if you're going to have your own title.

42
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,090
We're in the place where you're going to be adding this is a position where you can change it keep the

43
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,240
title and then change this year so you can say

44
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,540
total

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,190
total sales.

46
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,710
Something along those lines.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,990
And then you can increase the size of the title as well.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,710
Personally I'm going to remove the title because I have I'm going to add a title on the left for the

49
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,450
y axis.

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,410
Now let's go and look at the legend over here.

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:29,590
And now what we want to do is we want to touch and take the title of The Legend of because it's obvious

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,020
that it is region and central east and west.

53
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,640
And here we want to also increase the size to about 12.

54
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,540
OK that's great.

55
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,800
And next what we want to do.

56
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,970
So you can also change the position where you want to be in the top center you can be wherever you like.

57
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,330
So I'm probably going to keep mine where was I just press controls there on my keyboard and returned

58
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,320
the previous action.

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,780
You know if we go to the y axis here we're going to change if you think so.

60
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:06,340
I personally find is better that when the Xs displays the same type of units are in the same format

61
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,570
of units as the actual bars themselves.

62
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,740
So let's go ahead and do that.

63
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:20,590
So here 3000 we're going to change it to two just three case so let's change the 6000 and one decimal

64
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,610
just in case.

65
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,410
And also we're going to enable the title here so we're going to select a title on so that we can see

66
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,650
total sales on the left over there.

67
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,080
All right so that's all we wanted to change in formatting options.

68
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,520
There's one more thing left.

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:44,890
You may have noticed that when I Hoeber over sometimes the value of the total cells is has lots of digits

70
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,030
after the decimal point.

71
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,530
Sometimes it's ok sometimes has lots of digits.

72
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,790
And even though it's displayed like this actually in the data set it's totally fine as has been calculated

73
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,780
correctly.

74
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,850
There's no such decimal points.

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:04,460
So this is a minor problem bug of how it's being displayed.

76
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:11,770
And also we wouldn't mind having them dollar signs so we don't see the dollar signs for these values

77
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,450
even though it says total sales.

78
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,240
It's it doesn't actually have those dollar signs so it'd be good to have them as well and we can actually

79
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,060
fix those both.

80
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,780
Both those issues at the same time.

81
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,890
So what are we going to do is we're going to select total sales here and we will go to the maudling

82
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,270
tab at the top.

83
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:36,460
And here we are going to say it say data types you might say General in your case or or in here in format

84
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,770
it says General and what we're going to change it to.

85
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,770
So we're going to change the data type it's still a small number as it was.

86
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:50,420
We're going to change the format from general to currency and in currency we're going to select dollar

87
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,720
sign English.

88
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:57,810
United States if you like that you'll see that the dollar sign up here is everywhere.

89
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,370
Total sales are use in the axis on the chart and in the tool too.

90
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:10,600
And as you can see that's also got rid of the rounding issue that we were seeing previously.

91
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,290
So there we go that's how we form my charts.

92
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,460
And now it looks a much neater much nicer and can be presented to stakeholders.

93
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,640
And I hope you get to this internal look 14 next time.

94
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,350
And until then happy analyzing.
