00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,660
Hello and welcome back to the course on par be-I in the various tutorial we were start solving our challenge.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,280
But we were faced with the problem that we created this was Alsation and it's showing the total number

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,370
of units sold Bush represented.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,280
Instead of the total toll or amounts in sales for a sense.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:28,170
And so today we're going to fix that since then we're going to learn how to add a new column into a

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,610
data set which will contain the total sales value.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,160
And in order to add and you call them all we have to do is go to the right Seto's Alsatian is actually

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,430
very straightforward very simple process or just the right click anywhere here on this dataset or even

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,070
on any one of these columns doesn't matter which one.

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,530
And here you've got two options and you measure and you call.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,550
Now we will talk about new measure further down in the course we won't discuss right now.

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,060
Out of these two options we are just going to add and you call them and it does exactly what you think

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,420
it does.

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,550
It adds a new column physically into your dataset and we'll see that in a second.

15
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,020
So let's go ahead and click that and you call them.

16
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,890
And as you can see it's appeared here and over here you can specify the formula so we can say total

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,690
sales he calls and then just start typing.

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,570
What are the existing columns that you want involved in the calculation.

19
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,180
So we want to involve units.

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,880
If I start typing units you'll see that it comes up and just click enter or select this option over

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,370
here.

22
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:41,710
So office supplies union says specifies which data set to take that call from and multiply that by office.

23
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,700
We'll just say units and then it'll come up unit price.

24
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,480
That's what we want.

25
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:55,670
Because total sales for one for an existing transaction is the number of units sold in that transaction

26
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,440
times the unit price in that transaction.

27
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,090
And just go ahead and hit enter right away you can see that total sales has appeared here.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,410
So before we continue with the position let's go let's go ahead and have a look at our dataset and see

29
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,350
how it change here.

30
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,330
So here you can see that we've got a new call them here total sales and the formulas up at the top.

31
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:23,720
And if I scroll down or just pick any one of these you'll see for instance on Sunday August 24th James

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:31,280
L. in the West region and James is sold dead desks he sold three units of desk's on that day at a price

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:40,910
of Taurus 35 so the total sales for this transaction are for this day for this day for this region for

34
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,100
this person for this item.

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,730
Total sales basically the total sales for this row is eight hundred twenty five dollars.

36
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,180
Let's pick another one that say Alex sold binder's he sold the Levan for 99 each.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,120
So the total sales value for that eighty nine dollars.

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,670
And that's how we got this column is just multiplying these two.

39
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,270
And as you can see he's performed the calculations performed at the pro level and it's stored in our

40
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,720
data set and that's very important.

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,960
Right now it might seem like like an obvious thing.

42
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,630
But then when we talk about calculated measures it'll be an important distinction but let's not run

43
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,490
ahead of ourselves.

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,460
We've created this calculated column and that's great.

45
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,070
Now we can use it in our vessels.

46
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,370
And now let's create a new page.

47
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,420
So we'll just keep this as a position as it is but we'll create a new page soldiers actually sort of

48
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,440
clicking this button.

49
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:41,300
Right click here and we'll say duplicate page and here we just say it's sort of page three page four

50
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,310
actually renamed rename.

51
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,300
So if you just double click it let's name it something else and say total sales.

52
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,040
Right.

53
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:58,390
And this one we can rename to number of cells so we remember which one is which of sales total sales

54
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:06,910
and actually if you just double click a little name total sales in dollars and so here what we want

55
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:13,840
to do is click on his position and all you want to do is replace the units with total sales so let's

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,640
just track total sales and just place it over units in the values field.

57
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:24,440
And that's how that has changed changes that you can see that things have changed now.

58
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,580
So let's compare previously in the central region.

59
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,960
Alex was a top sales person he sold the most units now in the central region.

60
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,350
Matthew is a top salesperson.

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,970
He sold three thousand one hundred nine dollars in sales.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,300
So even though he sold less units he made more revenue for the company in the East region.

63
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:55,780
It was Richard who sold the most units but now it's actually Susan who made the most sales in dollar

64
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,490
terms and here in the West region it was James.

65
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,820
And it is still a James who made the most sales and dozers.

66
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,360
So there we go.

67
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:16,200
That is how we create a calculated column or a new column in power B.A and that's how we use it in our

68
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,290
insulation.

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,390
So if I show this Challenger we just need to finalize this position so it looks fantastic and we'll

70
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,960
get to that in the next tutorial.

71
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,350
I look forward seeing them.

72
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,320
And until then happy analyzing.
