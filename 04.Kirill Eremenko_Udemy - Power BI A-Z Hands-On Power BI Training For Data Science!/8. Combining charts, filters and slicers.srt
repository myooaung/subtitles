00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,340
Hello and welcome back to the course on par be-I in the first tutorial we created this counterplot.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,610
And today we're going to learn how to apply filters across multiple sheets as well as how to combine

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,430
sheets into how to combine charts into one sheet onto one page.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,660
All right.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,920
So let's get started.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,760
So here we've got one chart on this page and we've got another chart on this page.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,910
And let's say we want to apply a filter that will that should work across both of them so filter that

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,930
should restrict the amount of rows going into this chart the same way as it restricts them on Roeske

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,970
going to this drug.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,190
And so how do we normally apply that.

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,840
Well we click on the charts and then we scroll down.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,530
We look at the visual level filters we add filtering to here.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,650
So let's say our filter is going to be by order date right.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:02,310
And then we just added in to here and that way we would be able to select the dates which we want we

15
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,480
could go on bonspiel like date.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,900
But as you can tell it says visual liberal filters so it's just a filter for this is zation.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,100
It won't affect any other viz..

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,970
So again to cancel that and what we actually want to do is we want to apply a filter to either the page

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,750
level filters so that if it's like that will affect everything on this page or even a reportable filter

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,840
and that's the filter that will affect everything or all of the charts and all of the pages in this

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,030
power be-I report or workbook.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,890
And so that's how we're going to do it.

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,710
And for in order to create that filter you don't even have to click on the chart itself.

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,660
You can just click somewhere on this whitespace.

25
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,960
And as you can see you still have the page little filters and the report filters which makes sense as

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,100
a let's go ahead and drag order data into Ruport little filters.

27
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:07,090
And what we'll do here is here we'll just change to start filtering and let's say we want we only want

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,930
items from 2011 right.

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,990
So in our dataset we put quite a lot of years.

30
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:21,140
So we want items from 2011 and will say so it starts is on or after and here will say 2016.

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,110
So just click on that.

32
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,430
Which 2011 January 2011 first of June 2011 midnight.

33
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:40,960
And so then will keep this on condition and then we'll say is on or before I will say click here again

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:49,200
2011 December 1st here we wanted 11:59 p.m..

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:58,420
Just this just make sure it's still December the first Sematary first 11:59 p.m. so on or before and

36
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,520
then reapply.

37
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,430
So you can see our dataset here has changed.

38
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,410
And if we go here.

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,520
So has this data changed as well.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,390
Well how would we check that.

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,030
Well let's just delete the filter or let's remove the clear the filter so you can see it is more dots

42
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,150
more points and it pre-press contrails are now turn the filter back.

43
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,640
You can see that it does apply.

44
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,580
So basically this filter is now being applied to everything across all of our data sets and it's kind

45
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:37,240
of like in other tools such as Tablo you would considered it kind of like a data source filter and basically

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,630
filters all of the data that comes onto your report.

47
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,770
So basically all the pages and there's no chance for data to go through that filter if it's not supposed

48
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,200
to.

49
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,560
And you will never see those rows in your visualizations.

50
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,690
But as you probably noticed this whole process of applying a filter especially a data filter is quite

51
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,410
tedious because you have to select the data and there's it's not as user friendly as you would imagine

52
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,840
as you would expect it to be.

53
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:14,830
And the reason for that is that in power be-I filters are not that not that commonly used.

54
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,790
Right so sometimes you would use them but there are better ways to apply these restrictions on your

55
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:28,850
data than just to use these report level filters or paysan old filters or even viz. little filters and

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,740
just that's just stems from the type of tool par be-I is and the way it's been created and the intention

57
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,180
behind it.

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,730
And we've actually already looked at one of these examples when we were creating slicers and that's

59
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,240
exactly what we're going to do.

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,100
Now again we're going to use the slicer but this time we're going to put both of these charts onto one

61
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,260
page.

62
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:59,450
So let's go ahead and create your page and this is going to be quite interesting and even exciting to

63
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,870
put these chairs together and how easy compared to other tools such as tabouli you'll see that this

64
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,340
is a very quick and intuitive way of creating this dashboard.

65
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,660
And one of the advantages of RBI.

66
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,060
So I'm going to select this chart and then press conference on my keyboard to copy and paste it into

67
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,550
here.

68
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,940
And reduce the size.

69
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,640
Now let's go to page 2 click here.

70
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,270
Copy paste again reduce the size I the ink like this.

71
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:41,160
So let's give it some room.

72
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,040
OK so there we go.

73
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:54,680
And maybe this one is all right now what do we want to do next is what we want to do is add a slicer

74
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,280
here.

75
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,560
Right.

76
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,210
So I'm going to actually I'm going to remove this filter or.

77
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,220
Because we're going to recreate it in another way.

78
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,740
And here I'm going to click on the whitespace and add a slicer.

79
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,110
And now I'm just going to add this order date into our slicer and there it is.

80
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:24,210
That's s as simple as it gets and now we want just the 2011 year which drags back.

81
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:31,150
So do them and just change changes to that.

82
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
So we can actually select it here.

83
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,320
There we go.

84
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,020
So as simple as that.

85
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,330
And that's all we had to do and as you can see this has been applied to both of these charts at same

86
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,500
time.

87
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,980
Very very straightforward very easy to use very user friendly and that's what I mean when I say that

88
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,460
filters are not that commonly used in some cases they are but it's much easier just to add a slicer

89
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,060
especially if you can put these two charts onto the same page and that is often the case because you're

90
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,110
building a combined combined viz. that you want to analyze together on one page or at the same time

91
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,110
and it's the fastest way to proceed is actually put on the same page.

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,140
And now just for fun this out another slicer so click on the whitespace click the slicer.

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,540
And in this case let's add region.

94
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,930
So this is a different three different regions of the house or central as you can see that's central

95
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,960
Europe North Europe and then South Europe.

96
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,350
It's so critical slicer.

97
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:39,730
Now what we can do as well is we can go to formats and then in general orientation changes are too horizontal.

98
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,250
So it actually looks like control buttons.

99
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,480
And then we go and you can actually remove the header from here and then on your position it will look

100
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,460
like control buttons and you can just set set them like that as you can see the desolations moving around.

101
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,970
So it's OK that your scatterplot is moving around that's.

102
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,650
Or maybe that's also a problem.

103
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,200
But let's start with the weasel's.

104
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,150
So how would we fix it.

105
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,230
How do we not let it move around.

106
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,100
We'll just go to format and then go to map controls and then select all of them.

107
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,690
And now when you change the scatterplot of the sun going to zoom in so that's quite powerful.

108
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:25,580
And this try the same thing for our scatterplot here we're going to need to go to the x axis and we're

109
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,950
going to have to fix it at a certain level so in this case we're going to have to fix it at sixteen

110
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,560
thousand and then we're going to have to do the same for the y axis.

111
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,490
But here we're going to have to make sure that we've got a minimum at a maximum so minus four to a maximal

112
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,260
force over 6000.

113
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:52,970
So minus 4000 and you've got to type quickly so if you start tapping the minus slowly it will disappear

114
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,460
to type in minus 4000 very quickly and then and is at 6000.

115
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,810
And there we go.

116
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:06,020
So now when you select your different regions or even the scatterplot doesn't change.

117
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,010
And as you can see it looks pretty amazing this was going on here.

118
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:17,510
Looks like these circles are moving around and then you can unselect and the number of circle increases.

119
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,380
This is a very powerful resolution already.

120
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:30,530
Again you can change the date range if you like increasing number of customers number of orders in your

121
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,500
data.

122
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,980
And then just quickly control it like that.

123
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:41,000
So as you can see very very intuitive and also very very powerful missiles nation that we've created

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,670
already.

125
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:50,370
And you can derive insights from here so understand you know how the different distribution how we have

126
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,890
different distributions of customers where they're more profitable less profitable which regions are

127
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:02,670
performing better and then drill into them separately and understand what actions need to be taken in

128
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,730
separate regions and separate countries and in different groups of customers by their profitability.

129
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,020
So hopefully you enjoyed this toil and picked up some new skills.

130
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:19,410
I highly encourage you to practice those skills so just before you proceed to the next tutorial apply

131
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,950
those skills.

132
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,580
Try to create different slicers using different items and different columns available to you in the

133
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,030
data set and try combining different Chara's maybe add some more chairs maybe add a pie chart add a

134
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:42,240
donut chart add a waterfall chart see what you can add into this zation and see what's different slicers

135
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,500
you can apply to make everything work seamlessly and even look even better than it is looking now because

136
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,320
after all learning these things and learning power be-I and mastering pagi is all about practice practice

137
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,090
practice.

138
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:03,750
And we've covered quite a substantial amount of new features that you have the flexibility and freedom

139
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,970
now to practice and explore the functionality of this wonderful tool.

140
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,190
And I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.

141
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,850
Until then happy analyzing.
