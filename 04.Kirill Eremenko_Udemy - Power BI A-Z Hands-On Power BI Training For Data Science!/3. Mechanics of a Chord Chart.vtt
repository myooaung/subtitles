00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.480
Hello and welcome back to the course and Part II I hope you had a chance to look through the custom

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.930
visuals available in the library because there are some powerful ones there and it's good to know what

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.760
you have at your disposal when you need to create some desolations in the future.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.190
And it's going to continue from where we left off last and we've got this chart the chord chart that

5
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:33.680
we started creating and today we're going to populate it and you'll see how easy it is to create visualizations

6
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.400
in power.

7
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.240
So is already set up for you and that's one of my favorite aspects about Parbat.

8
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.170
So let's go ahead and create the Score chart so we're going to create one where we're going to visualize

9
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.570
how much countries are lending to other countries so we're we really focus on the countries that are

10
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.310
lending or the creditors.

11
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.270
So all we have to do is take the creditors from here.

12
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.640
So remember that we have creditors and put it from the into the from Section take the debtors so that's

13
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.490
where the money is going to.

14
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.220
And as the value take that amount and put it here and that's it as simple as that.

15
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.990
It's all created so let's have a look at this quarter diagram and understand the mechanics behind it.

16
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.800
So they like it might seem that there's a lot going on here.

17
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:32.870
But this is quite actually quite a simple core diagram we've only got 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 6 7 7 8 9 10

18
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.090
10 elements in this core diagram and so they're kind of all intertwined.

19
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.560
So sometimes you can have way more.

20
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.040
And yeah you can see Parbat is actually doing quite a good job of handling these.

21
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.070
All right so let's understand how this works.

22
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.820
Let's take France for example what does this mean.

23
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.430
Well this means or the size of this represents how much France has actually lent to other countries.

24
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.390
Remember we're focusing on creditor's.

25
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.350
So I've actually screen them this chart before so that we don't forget Let's go to title and we'll just

26
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.770
change this to Korea tours and let's change the size to 12.

27
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.040
All right.

28
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.100
So now at the top here we know that we're dealing with creditors.

29
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.500
All right.

30
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.160
So France in total lent 957 billion dollars.

31
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.710
Right.

32
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:34.160
And then all of these items that are going out of the circle of this element are telling you where France

33
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.100
lent them.

34
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.420
So for instance here if you Hulver over you'll see that France lent Italy three hundred and sixty six

35
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.940
billion dollars and that's why this part is going into Italy over here.

36
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.960
And then here you can see France lent to United States this this byway.

37
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.200
Here is the United States France Lanch United States hundred and twenty two billion dollars than here

38
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.080
in France lent Spain.

39
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.360
One hundred and eighteen billion dollars and another one France and Greece.

40
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.150
Fifty three point nine billion bill and courtesy but it's going on here.

41
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.440
So they go.

42
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.160
And so the question is a couple of questions here.

43
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.090
First one is why is Greece so small and United States small.

44
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.830
What does that mean.

45
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.520
Well that just basically means that they are not that large as creditors remember in this one we're

46
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.860
focusing on credit or so the size of these elements of this pie as you might call it a pie are actually

47
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.210
just really directly proportional to the amount of money that each of these countries lent other countries.

48
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.820
So this this has nothing to do.

49
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.000
How much was borrowed.

50
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.060
This is just lending.

51
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.490
So you can see that the United States only lend to seventeen point three six billion dollars to other

52
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.310
countries and Greece.

53
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.990
Greece only lent.

54
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.720
Where is this money and see how much it lent Greece or Greece Lent is zero and Greece and literally

55
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.020
zero dollars to other countries.

56
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.340
So thats how it works.

57
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.360
And at the same time its important to note that here we can see that France lent money to Italy.

58
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.170
So if you look at it from a point of view of Italy there is outflows right and theres actually inflows

59
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.390
right.

60
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.070
So every country on this chart even though we're focusing on creditors every country in this chart because

61
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.080
they are intertwined so if money is going out it's going somewhere then has to be going in somewhere.

62
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.150
So because of that every country actually has these little other ones little other.

63
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.720
I don't even want to call them little other possible ways that represent money being lent to that country.

64
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.950
So for instance in the case of France you can see this little path coming in and you can see it says

65
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.630
here.

66
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.750
Britain lent France twenty two point four billion dollars.

67
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.330
Right.

68
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.480
And the important thing to understand and kind of like Keep in mind here is the ones.

69
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:12.910
So this the size of this part is only made up out of the ones out of the pathways that are going out.

70
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.380
So only out of these channels that are leaving.

71
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:22.830
So when actually France was lending other countries the tunnels that are coming in they are very thin

72
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.710
they're very thin and they don't contribute to the width of this piece of the pie and that makes sense

73
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.990
because we are focusing on characters here so when money is coming in that's actually boring money and

74
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.540
it's just this.

75
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.970
It's a symbolic pathway so it's just showing the directional movement it's not in any way contributing

76
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:48.840
to the site so therefore you'll see it regardless of how big the pathway or this channel is when it's

77
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.420
leaving a country for instance here in the case of Japan Japan lent United says 9 7 $196 billion.

78
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.180
Right.

79
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.690
It's a huge wide channel when lose but when it arrives at the destination it's always going to be as

80
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:10.890
thin as like one or two pixels simply because of the fact that arriving channels do not contribute to

81
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.480
the size of that piece of the pie.

82
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.810
So there we go so you can explore this diagram and find out a bit more.

83
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:26.080
Which countries Lent which other countries so right away from here you can see that Japan lent nearly

84
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.120
a trillion dollars in total.

85
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.840
France lent 957 billion.

86
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.540
Germany.

87
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.860
Lent.

88
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.840
Eight hundred and three billion.

89
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.620
Spain 561 Britain 413 Italy 117 and so on.

90
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.880
Ireland Ireland lend somebody 18 billion dollars.

91
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.120
United States 17 Greece Ireland zero.

92
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.740
And so it's very interesting I find these cardiograms are interesting because they're actually all dealing

93
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.450
with each other right.

94
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.620
So it's not like they are lending.

95
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.360
Other countries are lending money to each other.

96
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:05.330
And so you can look observe these dependencies and the flow of money within these countries.

97
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.910
So there you go.

98
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.490
That's that's the mechanics of the core diagram.

99
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:16.660
And also I would like to reiterate again how even though this is a complex diagram you can tell that

100
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.040
it is complex in conveying these insights.

101
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.650
It is simplifying them but still has so many elements to it.

102
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:30.820
And now despite that it was so easy for us to create that we just downloaded this pre-built template

103
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:36.000
and we just put in three columns into the designated spots and that's it it's right.

104
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:44.190
And that's one of the coolest features about Parbat that it is so simple and so intuitive to work with.

105
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.550
All right so hopefully you enjoy this tutorial.

106
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.010
However play around with that explore diagram a bit further and we'll continue in the next tutorial.

107
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.760
I'll look for you there and until next time happy and let.
