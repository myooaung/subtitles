00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.970
Hello and welcome back to the course and Paria in today's tutorial we're going to tidy up our resolution

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.720
and we're going to add another chart to finalize everything.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.160
All right so let's get started.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.150
We're going to duplicate this page because it's page four.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.610
All right.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.320
So the first thing I want to do is we want to add the extra charge.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.520
And I was kind of like playing around with it and thinking we want to add.

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.720
And I decided that we're going to add a donor chart.

9
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.020
All right there is a donor chart.

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.820
And so what are we going to display on this.

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.620
So first of all let's move this a bit to the left.

12
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.540
So what are we going to display on this donor chart.

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.080
We're going to look.

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.890
Don't try to like something as a pie chart it doesn't have this middle part which is how the whole in

15
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.740
the middle of the pie.

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.380
So we need a category and an America value.

17
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.390
So for the numeric value is the profit.

18
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:09.380
And for the category let's take order date so you can really take anything like right now it's telling

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.640
you how the profits split by different years.

20
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.390
But you can take anything for that category if you like.

21
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.320
You could take segment and just take ordered it out right.

22
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.500
Or you could just replace it here.

23
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.550
You could take a state but then there would be way too many of them on the donor charts or so there's

24
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.180
quite a lot of things that you can choose who are actual category from the second table.

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.700
So there's a lot of things you can choose from.

26
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.060
I'm just going to take order date because that way I can quickly tell which year was most powerful.

27
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.420
I'm not even going to drill down.

28
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.290
So you could drill down in quarters like this.

29
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.710
Remember this drilling.

30
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.650
It gives us the quarters regardless of the year.

31
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.770
So then there's still a few of them if you go like this and there's way too many quarters right.

32
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.450
So again way too many months.

33
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.990
But if you drill down like this you know even over the months there is only 12 of them even though we

34
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.290
have three different years 2011 12 13 14 actually four years.

35
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.920
So even though we have lots of years we only have several months so this is another example of when

36
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.080
drilling down followed preserving the higher level and you hardly can be useful.

37
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.420
So if you want to look at just quarters.

38
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.560
You drill down like this and then when you switch over you can tell in which region which quarter is

39
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.320
our most profitable overall despite the you know we're going to keep it at your level like that.

40
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.080
OK.

41
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.020
So that's the chart we wanted to add.

42
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.080
And how do we know tidy everything up to make it look fantastic.

43
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.170
And this is actually a a skill in its own the something that you developed with time and something that

44
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.440
you really need to focus on to practice it like for me takes time to understand for each individual

45
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.110
dashboard what how it will look like the best.

46
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.180
And so I'm not just making this up right now as we go I practice this a little bit before it took me

47
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.750
maybe 20 minutes to figure it out but I think I think the way I like this dashboard is I'm just going

48
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.600
to show you now.

49
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:20.400
So if we put this down here right and then if we zoom in a little bit to consume more.

50
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.010
So zoom in like that and maybe like the wind that's about that size.

51
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.350
Then this.

52
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.840
This chart shows at the top and maybe takes a bit more space.

53
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.840
This one goes here.

54
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.660
This one goes here.

55
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.460
There we go.

56
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.210
So I know it's a bit it's a bit difficult with them floating all over the place.

57
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.810
But with patience you can get it sorted out pretty nicely.

58
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.950
So maybe like that

59
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.000
hire you go

60
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.000
and she may be back.

61
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.080
Let's put it back a.

62
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.260
All right.

63
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.630
There we go.

64
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.280
So we're pretty much done.

65
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.880
Just maybe a bit higher this one they're all kind of lined up.

66
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.510
All right so that's good.

67
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.020
The other thing that I'd like to change here is just kind of like fix up the titles and stuff like that

68
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.590
so.

69
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.870
So we're eating cereal looks better so let's go here and we're going to click that color and we'll drop

70
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.540
down the title and change this to 12.

71
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.090
So that is consistent Tuttle and she is just 12.

72
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.430
Then here we go to this one first title and she's just 12 as well.

73
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.970
You can actually change the title text if you like.

74
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.420
I'm just going to keep this one then the other thing here is this Ken looks alienated when you don't

75
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.340
have any boxes on it.

76
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.410
This looks like a bit empty.

77
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.880
So we're going to add it up to you you can either add a background so you can a background and for instance

78
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.550
something like like that.

79
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:24.140
So it's it's easy to spot that it's a control or what I'm going to do is I'm going to change that to

80
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.760
a border I'm going out a border but I'm going to make it as dark and going to make it a bit lighter.

81
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.620
There we go.

82
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:39.470
And now even when it's unchecked you can see that something's going on there and it's inviting the user

83
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.410
to click it.

84
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.490
OK so that's safe.

85
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.260
And what else.

86
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:52.230
Oh so now like you can see it's jumping around you can see the profits changing and you can change the

87
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.180
years.

88
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.220
Right so again everything is changing.

89
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:04.370
The only thing that I would adjust as well is like now in this layout.

90
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.090
I don't know like it depending on what you feel like remember this chart.

91
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.180
We fixed the we fix the x and y axis so that doesn't change.

92
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.010
Let's have a look at what will look like if we do that.

93
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.520
Have a look at this chart.

94
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.840
So x axis and click enter enter.

95
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.640
Click Enter.

96
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.670
So let's have a look.

97
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.270
It's a bit more zoomed in.

98
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:40.130
So it depends on it depends on your preference and what your goal is if you want to compare side by

99
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.520
side and you want to actually have it locked.

100
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.180
Then you might want to look how it looks so that you can compare different regions in different time

101
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:57.080
periods without it changing then you might have a lot if you want to actually just drill in further

102
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.880
so you can see better when you go into like Central you want to understand what's going on in Central

103
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.170
and you don't really you don't really focus on comparing different regions side by side.

104
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.590
You just you just want to get into this one and you want to like look at what's going on so you want

105
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.050
a better view.

106
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.520
You want to be zoomed in when you want to.

107
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.530
You might want to keep it like that.

108
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.680
So it's totally up to you how you'd like to do it.

109
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.450
And that pretty much brings us to the end.

110
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.560
As you can see the dashboard is much more friendlier now than what we had here.

111
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.150
So this is what we had before.

112
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.520
Like it is functional and you can get inside.

113
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.220
But then when you just put your mind to it and you know that you've got a finished product you just

114
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.020
want to make it really pretty.

115
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.970
It takes some time but eventually as you can see this one looks much better.

116
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.340
All right so hopefully you enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you on the next one.

117
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.380
Until then happy analyzing.
