00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.980
This video is a follow up to the previous video on introduction to random numbers in python.

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.720
This shows the exercise.

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.420
So if you haven't gone through the previous video already then I recommend going through that video

4
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.350
first and then coming back to this video.

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.740
All right.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.520
So the goal of this exercise is to generate a normal distribution with these two parameters so the normal

7
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.000
distribution should have a mean of 15 and a standard deviation of four point three.

8
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.080
So the mean and standard deviation are too descriptive.

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.990
Statistical properties they refer to the center of this distribution.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.490
So for we're considering the blue line here.

11
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.540
So the mean the average of the distribution is 0 and the standard deviation is basically the width of

12
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.430
this distribution.

13
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.010
How wide this distribution is and that is by default set to 1.

14
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.890
So you already know how to generate a normal distribution or random numbers selected from a normal distribution.

15
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.780
And when you have to figure out how to do is get the average value the mean to be 15 and the standard

16
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.540
deviation to be four point three.

17
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.640
So good luck.

18
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.710
Positive video switch to Python.

19
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.660
Write some code.

20
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.590
And now I will switch to Python and show you how I solved this problem.

21
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:39.960
Let's start by defining the parameters so we want the desired mean to be 15 and the desired standard

22
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.930
deviation to be four point three.

23
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:54.360
So now our numbers our numbers so NDP that random that Rand N and so I didn't exactly say how many random

24
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.920
numbers you should draw but I'm going to say 1000 here now before figuring out how to modify these numbers

25
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.770
to get the desired statistical characteristics that we want here.

26
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.430
I'm just going to quickly plot these out and in fact I'm gonna put them in subplots.

27
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.050
Let's say P L T that subplot 1 2 1.

28
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.930
So this means I'm going to generate a subplot geometry that is one row two columns and I'm gonna start

29
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.650
plotting into the first subplot.

30
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.250
So BLT teed up plot and this is just going to be the numbers themselves.

31
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.600
And then peel that subplot to 1 2 so there's gonna be in the subplot to the.

32
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.860
To the right of this one I'm going to peel T.

33
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.500
I'm gonna draw a histogram of these numbers.

34
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.640
Okay.

35
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.320
Then peel to show.

36
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.660
Okay.

37
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.070
So so far this looks good.

38
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.640
It has a mean of zero and a standard deviation that I believe is going to be about 1 because I haven't

39
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.980
modulated these numbers yet.

40
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.640
And then what I want to do underneath here is print out the observed mean and standard deviation.

41
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:21.780
So print and I'll say this distribution has a mean of percent S and a standard deviation of another

42
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.080
percent s and then we need to replace these two.

43
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.560
So the first one is going to be the means that num pi dot mean numbers.

44
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.480
And then the next one is the standard deviation so num Pi the sd d.

45
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.060
Numbers all right.

46
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.290
So let's see we have a mean of zero point zero five and a standard deviation of point nine nine.

47
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.730
Now this might seem a little bit strange considering that I said that the average should be zero.

48
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.110
The means should be zero and these standard deviations should be 1.

49
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.200
But keep in mind that because we are drawing random numbers from this distribution the actual mean is

50
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.810
likely to be a little bit different from zero.

51
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.310
So it's basically just guaranteed to be close to zero.

52
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.200
And the standard deviation close to 1 but each time we rerun this code it's gonna be slightly different.

53
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.250
Now you can see the average is a little bit below zero.

54
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.090
Okay so let's start modulating this distribution.

55
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.440
So the first thing I'm going to do is multiply by the desired standard deviation and you can see that.

56
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.850
Now this cloud of dots is a little bit wider.

57
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.550
So before you know most of the dots were between let's say one and a half or two and minus one and I

58
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.640
have to do with a few dots that are further away.

59
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.480
And now the distribution goes from minus you know minus twelve or so up to 12 or maybe 13.

60
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.010
So here we see this distribution as a mean that's still pretty close to zero and a standard deviation.

61
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.880
That is not exactly four point one six but instead is relatively close to four point three.

62
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.990
I meant to say that it's not exactly four point three but it is kind of close.

63
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.320
Okay.

64
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.670
So now we need to shift the mean and that one is a bit easier.

65
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.830
So we just do this by saying desired mean.

66
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.880
So I'm multiplying by the standard deviation and then adding the mean.

67
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:29.250
So this plus the desired mean this shifts the distribution and the times the standard deviation stretches

68
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.120
the distribution

69
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.890
so here we see we get a mean of pretty close to but not exactly 15 and a standard deviation that is

70
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.470
pretty close to four point three but not exactly four point three.

71
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.690
Now depending on how precise you want to be this might be good enough for you or it might be not good

72
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.200
enough for you.

73
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.310
Maybe you want this distribution to have exactly exactly.

74
00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.580
I mean of 15 and exactly a standard deviation of four point three.

75
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.090
So how can we do this.

76
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.600
It turns out the procedure for getting these desired statistics to be exact.

77
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:15.640
In this particular dataset is not so difficult to figure out how to get that to work.

78
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.590
We just have to think a little bit about what's going on here.

79
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:26.990
So what's going on here is that this distribution has a theoretical mean of zero but because we're only

80
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.590
generating 1000 numbers and not an infinite number of numbers then it's not going to be exactly zero

81
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.390
as you've already seen.

82
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.680
So what can we do.

83
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.820
Well we can first generate this distribution and then force that distribution to have a mean of exactly

84
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.210
zero.

85
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.510
So let me show you how that's going to work.

86
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.680
What I'm going to do or comment this out for the moment we'll get back to this later.

87
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.490
What I'm going to do is actually first I'll just run it again just to show you again that the mean is

88
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.530
going to be close to zero but not exactly zero.

89
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.470
Now that we've generated this set of numbers I can enforce the mean to be exactly zero.

90
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.280
And then I do by subtracting the mean.

91
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.630
So I say mean and then the numbers.

92
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.320
So this is saying compute the empirical mean of this distribution.

93
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.610
This set of numbers and then subtract that from the actual numbers that we've gotten.

94
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.000
So let's see what the mean is now.

95
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.290
Okay.

96
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.300
So now the mean is 10 to the minus 18.

97
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.820
So I've already talked to you before about computer rounding error and scientific notation.

98
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.510
So this is basically as close to zero as we can reasonably expect for a computer.

99
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.740
So let's try this again a couple of times.

100
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.190
And now again we get an average of this distribution that is tend to the minus 18.

101
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.830
And let's try it again.

102
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.610
And still it's around 10 to the minus 18.

103
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:05.350
So that means that now when I add the desired mean back to this distribution it's going to have exactly

104
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.740
the intended outcome.

105
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.270
So plus desired mean.

106
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.590
All right.

107
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.910
So now we see that this distribution has a mean of fifteen point zero.

108
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.550
So this is basically exactly 15.

109
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:24.840
And we can run this multiple times and you can see that it's always going to have a mean of 15.

110
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.940
However the standard deviation is still not always exactly exactly 1.

111
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:36.730
So therefore multiplying it by the desired standard deviation is also not going to give us our desired

112
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.320
standard deviation in a exact precise way.

113
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:47.080
So we need to do is further modulate these numbers to make sure that this distribution has a standard

114
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:54.950
deviation of exactly one so that this multiplication is going to work so and then it turns out that

115
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.800
the way we do that is also fairly simple.

116
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:08.190
We say the distribution equals itself divided by the empirical standard deviation so now I'm gonna run

117
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.950
this and let's see what the standard deviation is.

118
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.240
Okay.

119
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.440
So not exactly one but it's you know.

120
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:19.050
Point 9 9 9 and then and then a nine and who knows how many nines there are after this.

121
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.910
Let's try it again.

122
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:26.020
And okay now we get exactly a standard deviation of one point zero.

123
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:26.910
All right.

124
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:34.650
So now I can actually take this code and move it up here and I will delete this because I think it's

125
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.730
now just adding confusion.

126
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.450
So notice that the procedure was generally the same.

127
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.660
We still take the numbers that are drawn from a normal distribution.

128
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:50.270
Multiply them by the desired standard deviation and add them to the desired mean.

129
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.980
The main difference is that I added these two lines of code here which are basically normalization codes

130
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:04.170
that force that this distribution has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.

131
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:12.460
So now we can run this and we get a mean of 15 and a standard deviation of four point three.

132
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:18.300
I hope you found this and the previous video informative and insightful throughout the rest of this

trigonometric values.
