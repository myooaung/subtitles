00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,210
In this video I'm going to tell you about factoring polynomials.
1

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,080
So let me first tell you what it means to factor a polynomial.
2

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,190
And before telling you how about factoring polynomials I'm going to tell you about factoring integers.
3

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:25,230
We can take the number four and represent four as the multiplication of two other numbers: 2 and 2.
4

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,250
So what we're doing is taking this larger number and expressing it as the product of simpler terms.
5

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,860
That's the general idea of factoring.
6

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,420
So here we can also take 16.
7

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,080
Now you can represent 16 as being two times eight.
8

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,640
But the number eights of course can be factored or broken down into four times two.
9

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,470
And of course four, as you learned here, and I'm sure you knew even before this course, four can be represented
10

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,940
as two times two.
11

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,340
So we can also factor the number 16 into two times two times two times two.
12

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,080
OK.
13

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:07,020
So that's just a general principle of factoring. Applied to polynomials, the concept is the same.
14

15
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:13,530
It's a little bit more challenging but the idea is that this polynomial can be represented as the product
15

16
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,180
of two terms.
16

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,070
One of those terms is X plus 1.
17

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,580
And the other term is x plus three and you can do the math fairly quickly in your head to confirm that
18

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,630
these are equal.
19

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,730
So X times X is X squared and then X times three is three x plus one times X gives us four X and then
20

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,070
one times three gives us three.
21

22
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,430
Now when you learn about factoring polynomials in a math course, then there are some tricks that you
22

23
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,630
can learn to help you figure out whether a polynomial is factorable and how to do this; things like completing
23

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,140
the square and so on.
24

25
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,640
But in this video I'm going to show you how to get Python to do this for you.
25

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:05,640
So let's start by creating some symbolic variables x and y because later on in a few moments I'm going
26

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,870
to create some multi variable polynomials.
27

28
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,490
So we need X comma Y.
28

29
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:19,950
So let's just start by taking a simple polynomial p and let's set this to be X squared plus four times
29

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,510
x plus three.
30

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,240
So that's in fact the same polynomial that I just showed in the slides. So I can just print this out
31

32
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,190
like this or I can use sym dot factor.
32

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:40,720
So this function factor and that is going to express this polynomial this polynomial as one plus or
33

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,890
so x plus 1 times x plus three.
34

35
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,820
Now you've probably learned in your math course that not every polynomial can be factored like this.
35

36
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,360
Only some polynomials can be factored.
36

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,640
They have to be, you know, they have to have the right coefficients and so forth.
37

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,770
So for example if we would say minus three instead of plus three.
38

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,050
Now it turns out that this polynomial on its own is no longer factorable.
39

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,740
And now what's going to happen when we put this polynomial as input into the factor function?
40

41
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,730
And the answer is that we just get back exactly the same result.
41

42
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,710
And this is a feature of sympy that I've introduced you to in previous videos.
42

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,150
So if you want simply to do something like factor or expand or simplify but it's just not possible with
43

44
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,430
the input that you've given it, then the output will be exactly the same as the input.
44

45
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,660
So this polynomial is not factorable.
45

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,240
It is as simple as it gets already written out like this.
46

47
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,390
And so the output of the Factor function is just the same as the input.
47

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,750
All right.
48

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,480
The next thing that I want to show you is factoring a polynomial with multiple variables.
49

50
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:09,090
So let's say two times X cubed times Y minus two times X squared plus two times X squared times Y plus
50

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:17,040
six times X squared minus six times X times Y.
51

52
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,410
Now it may actually seem like I'm just making this stuff up as I go along but actually I've already
52

53
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:29,550
worked through this problem to make sure that this polynomial in fact is factorable in two variables.
53

54
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,870
So let's see what that looks like.
54

55
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,160
So sym dot factor and then we input expr like this.
55

56
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,560
Okay.
56

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,370
And now you can see that the simplified version looks, or the factored version is a little bit simpler.
57

58
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,890
And in fact what you can see here, which you can also see when looking at this original equation, is that
58

59
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,850
there is a two X in every term.
59

60
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,250
So there's a 2 x here and you pulled out and you get X squared there's a 2 x term here and you got 2
60

61
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,500
times X that's actually this term here.
61

62
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,000
And then you might think that this is a mistake because there's a minus sign here and there's no minus
62

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,570
sign here.
63

64
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,940
However, we have this other term here six X squared.
64

65
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,450
And so the two X comes out of this leaving us with three X..
65

66
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,710
And then that gets subtracted from one X leaving us with plus two X.
66

67
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,230
Of course I encourage you to get out a piece of paper and a pencil and confirm that this expression
67

68
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,330
really equals this expression.
68

69
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,160
But the main point is that factoring in sympy is pretty straightforward.
69

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,310
You use the factor function.
70

71
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,900
So here is the exercise for this video.
71

72
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:44,460
Essentially what you want to do is write out these three expressions and determine whether each of these
72

73
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,010
expressions is factorable or not factorable.
73

74
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,250
If it is factorable, then you can display the factors like this; and if it's not factorable then you can
74

75
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,700
print out this message that says that it's not factorable.
75

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,210
Now I'm going to give you two hints. As in previous exercises, if you don't want any hints; if you want
76

77
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,470
to see if you can figure all this stuff out on your own,
77

78
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:14,160
then now is your last opportunity to pause the video before I reveal the hints and switch to Python
78

79
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,420
and work through this on your own.
79

80
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,140
OK.
80

81
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:23,390
So the first hint is that factored polynomials have a parenthesis in them.
81

82
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,710
This is not a typo.
82

83
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,330
I'm not missing the end parenthesis here.
83

84
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:33,110
This is actually just indicating an open parenthesis. So you can see these polynomials here are not factored
84

85
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,190
and they have no parentheses.
85

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,120
These polynomials have parentheses in them.
86

87
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,380
OK so that is one hint.
87

88
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,190
If you think that that's a good enough hint for you to get started again.
88

89
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:50,690
Now you can pause the video. Otherwise, I'm going to give you another hint, which is based on just expanding
89

90
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,400
on this point a little bit more.
90

91
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,690
Okay.
91

92
00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:01,820
Here is the next hint: the next hint is to convert the polynomial into a string and then use a method
92

93
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,620
on a string called find, so the string and then dot find.
93

94
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,060
So those are your two hints.
94

95
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,400
And now I'm going to switch to Python.
95

96
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,380
And first I will introduce you to this method a little bit. I don't believe I've talked about this in
96

97
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,230
the course so far, so I'll spend a minute basically showing how to use this dot find thing and then we
97

98
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,190
will solve the problem.
98

99
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,980
So here.
99

100
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,420
So let's start with a string.
100

101
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,700
How about a name equals Mike.
101

102
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:31,690
Okay.
102

103
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,840
So now I can.
103

104
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,010
So we can just write out a name and we get Mike.
104

105
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,130
I'm going to say name dot find and actually even better.
105

106
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,060
So this is not really how you spell my name with an extra i.
106

107
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,310
But that's okay.
107

108
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,430
So let's find the "i" in this string.
108

109
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,750
So the result here is one.
109

110
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:59,660
And that tells me that the string the character I appears at least once in this string and the first
110

111
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,620
or the index where it first appears is index 1.
111

112
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,620
And remember that Python starts indexing at zero starts counting at zero.
112

113
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,740
So index of 1 actually means the second element.
113

114
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,050
Okay.
114

115
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,320
And then I can go through this for other strings.
115

116
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,740
For example is in the second element here.
116

117
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,240
And let's see what if I do.
117

118
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,350
How about Q?
118

119
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,950
So now you can see that Q is not in this string at all.
119

120
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,690
So then we get a result of minus one.
120

121
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:38,960
So therefore, if the output of some string variable dot find is minus one then that means that that character
121

122
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,120
doesn't appear anywhere in this string.
122

123
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:42,830
Okay.
123

124
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,550
So with that introduction in mind, the first thing I'm going to do is create a list of all of these expressions.
124

125
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:57,820
So the first expression was X squared plus four times x plus three.
125

126
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,930
And then a second expression was two times Y squared minus one.
126

127
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:11,120
And then the third expression was three times Y squared plus twelve y.
127

128
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,420
Okay.
128

129
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,010
And now what I want to do is loop through all of these expressions.
129

130
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:26,690
So for X, let's call this ei in expressions. And what I'm going to do is factor the expression and then
130

131
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,940
export that as a string.
131

132
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,120
So let's call that string fact for the string version of the factor.
132

133
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:44,750
So that's going to be some that factor and then e I for the E I s expression inside this list here and
133

134
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,370
then this has to be converted into a string.
134

135
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,200
Now for starters I'm just going to print out this strfact just to see what this looks like.
135

136
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:02,090
Okay so what you can see is that the first term was factored, the third term was factored, the second
136

137
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,630
term was not factored; it's printed out here.
137

138
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,580
Exactly as I've written it up here.
138

139
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:20,480
So therefore what I can do is say, let's say I'm going to say if string facts dot find, if there is an
139

140
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,920
opening parenthesis, which there is for the factored cases but not for the non-factorable polynomial.
140

141
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,840
So if this equals... Well actually we want to say if it's not equal to minus one.
141

142
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,470
So if it's not equal to minus one then that means that it is factorial.
142

143
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:49,100
So therefore I'm going to write display math and then I want to print out the expression and
143

144
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:59,940
then have an arrow, so right arrow, and then I want to print out the expanded or the factored version.
144

145
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,200
Okay.
145

146
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:14,110
So we therefore need to replace these two strings with sym dot latex ei and then sym dot latex
146

147
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,650
sym dot factor.
147

148
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,120
So the factored version of E I.
148

149
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,420
All right.
149

150
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,770
So let me just run this code so far and see if this works.
150

151
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,160
All right.
151

152
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,200
So this looks pretty good.
152

153
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
So here we see the expression.
153

154
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,700
Here we see the expression and then a friendly little right arrow and then the factored version of that
154

155
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,660
expression.
155

156
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:42,130
So these are a little bit close I'm going to put in a quad here and quad over here just to give us a
156

157
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,150
little bit more space.
157

158
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,140
I think that looks visually a little bit nicer.
158

159
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,380
Okay.
159

160
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:53,800
So now if this is not true that means that it's not factorable; the polynomial is not factorable.
160

161
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,680
So therefore we want to say, let's see I'll copy and then paste this and start working from here.
161

162
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,050
So we want to say the polynomial... a bit of a space... the 
162

163
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:04,780
right
163

164
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,140
arrow and then I'm going to say in text
164

165
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,470
not factorable.
165

166
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,040
OK so now we only have one substitution, one string replacement.
166

167
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,870
So I'm going to get rid of this here and let me make sure I've gotten the parentheses correct.
167

168
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,370
Yeah this looks good.
168

169
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:28,940
All right.
169

170
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:37,370
So now we have solved this problem. So in this video I told you about factoring a polynomial and in general
170

171
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,800
what it means to factor a number or polynomial when you get to linear algebra.
171

172
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,570
You can factor a matrix.
172

173
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,750
It's a similar concept and you learned how to do this in Python.
173

174
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:53,920
And you also learned about finding string searching through a string for specific characters.
