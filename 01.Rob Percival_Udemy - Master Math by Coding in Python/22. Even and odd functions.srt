1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:11,270
Do you know what it means for a function to be even or odd if you don't then this is going to be a really

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,880
exciting video because you are going to learn something new and really interesting about certain kinds

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,050
of functions.

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:24,470
Now if you already know what an even and an odd function means then oh well OK let's say this video

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:31,040
is still going to be exciting because you'll get to learn how to use Python data visualization to test

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,360
whether a function is even or odd.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,550
Now I'm going to provide a mathematical a formal definition of even functions and odd functions but

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,720
first I want to give you a little bit of visualization to build some intuition.

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,870
So imagine we have these two functions.

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,810
It's the blue line here and the blue line over here.

11
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:59,900
Now what I've done here is flip the function and that is the red dots so you can see that when I flipped

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,590
this function which is like rotating it around on this x equals zero axis then the resulting function

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,100
is the same as the original function.

14
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,840
So that's for an even function for an odd function.

15
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:20,660
You can see the original function in blue and then I flipped it around so I rotated it on the x equals

16
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,350
zero axis and now the function was flipped.

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,640
So it's like the negative version of this function.

18
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,070
So this is called an odd function.

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,980
All right I hope this builds a little bit of visual intuition.

20
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,900
I'm not gonna show you the formal definition.

21
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:44,260
So a function f of x is an even function f f of minus X equals f of x.

22
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:50,240
So that means you take X and you just multiply all of X by minus one.

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,780
And if that does nothing to the function then it's an even function.

24
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,360
And that's essentially what I did here.

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:03,920
So I took all of these x values embedded it into the function but multiplied all the x values by minus

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,400
one.

27
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,820
And we got the same result.

28
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:16,070
So that's an even function f of x is an odd function if f of minus X does not equal F of X but minus

29
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,730
f of x.

30
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:23,780
So it's like the minus sign comes outside to the function rather than being inside in the X..

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,890
So if this is the case then the function is odd and that's what you see here.

32
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,070
So here I flipped around the x axis I multiplied the x values by minus one.

33
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,060
And what ended up happening is that the function flipped on the y axis.

34
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,330
So this is now the negative version of this.

35
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,280
So that's an odd function.

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,670
Now not all functions are even or odd.

37
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,320
You can have functions that are neither even nor odd.

38
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:54,590
So even an odd is not necessarily a property that applies to every single function.

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,740
All right let's have a look at this.

40
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:06,170
In Python we are going to be using the NUM pi module and the map plot lib that pi plot module.

41
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:14,860
So I'm going to start by creating an even function so X will be Linda space so linearly space numbers

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,170
from minus five to plus five and let's have 20 of them.

43
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:26,050
So I'm going to call this variable f even because it's going to be an even function and X squared is

44
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,670
a perfect example of an even function.

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,490
So let's start by plotting this.

46
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,420
So plot x by F. even.

47
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,870
And let's do p t that show loops P P L T.

48
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,890
Not plot.

49
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,250
Okay.

50
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,850
So here we have our even function x squared.

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,270
Now you can already tell even before we generate the plot you can already tell just from looking at

52
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,480
this function that this is an even function.

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,010
And that's because when you set X to be minus that actually doesn't change anything.

54
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:03,790
For example when x equals to 2 squared equals 4 but minus 2 squared also equals 4.

55
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:11,290
So therefore we can create f even I'll call this f even neg for negative.

56
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:18,520
Now you have to be really careful here because what we're not doing is saying minus minus X squared

57
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,770
like this.

58
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,750
And let me show you why that is the wrong thing to do.

59
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,030
So plot x f even neg.

60
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,900
So that is actually applying the minus sign to the X squared term.

61
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,830
That's not what we want.

62
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,150
What we want is just to replace this X with minus X.

63
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:43,790
So we need to use parentheses here to make sure that the association is correct.

64
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,040
Okay.

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,060
So now you only see one line and that's because they both overlap perfectly.

66
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,070
So I'm gonna change this to be red dots.

67
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,010
All right.

68
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:02,710
So this was a even function I'm now going to illustrate to you an odd function so I'll call it F odd

69
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,420
and that one I'm gonna set to be X cubes.

70
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,480
X to the power of three.

71
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:18,310
So let's call this f od neg and that's going to be minus X to the power of three.

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,900
And then we want to plot.

73
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,960
So this is basically going to be the same plot functions I showed here so appeal to up plot x by F OD

74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:37,240
and then P L T dot plot F by F od neg and let's make this also red circles.

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,570
Okay.

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,900
So now looking down at this function you can see that we don't get the same result.

77
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,920
And so this is definitely not an even function.

78
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,170
Now what we have to do to actually get this result to show that this is an odd function is to compute

79
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,440
minus F of X..

80
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:03,940
So I'm gonna say now f maybe cause f neg odd because now I'm going to be negating or multiplying by

81
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,540
minus one.

82
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:12,640
The entire function and not just X. So I'm going to write minus f odd like this.

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:12,870
Okay.

84
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,180
And then let's plot this.

85
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,150
So that was f neg odd.

86
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,290
Let's plot this as how about green squares

87
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,110
okay.

88
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,810
So now in fact you don't even see the red circles anymore you just see the green squares.

89
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,340
And that's because these green squares perfectly overlap with the red circles.

90
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,780
So maybe I'll just make it a green line.

91
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,470
All right.

92
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,890
So now look at this graph and recall the definition in the formal math definition that I showed at the

93
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,360
end of the slides.

94
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,870
So we took f of x and then we said minus X inside F of X..

95
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,790
And that is equal to minus the original function.

96
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,880
And that's exactly what you see here.

97
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,700
So this provides visual confirmation that this is an even function.

98
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,250
So this was the function x squared.

99
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:15,950
And this is an odd function x cubed the exercise for this video is to determine whether the sine and

100
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,500
cosine functions are even or odd.

101
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,370
Now maybe you already know the answer.

102
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,250
But if you don't then you can use python as a tool to understand this important property of these two

103
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,710
trig functions.

104
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,960
So essentially what you want to do is just implement the sine and cosine functions and apply the two

105
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,170
methods that I just showed you to determine whether the function is even and whether it is on.

106
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,590
So you need to do this for cosine and for sine All right.

107
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,730
So now you can positive video switch to Python and determine on your own whether sign and cosine are

108
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,230
odd or even functions.

109
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:02,180
I am going to begin by defining the variable as I'll call this theta because I always use a variable

110
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,000
X but maybe X gets overused a little bit.

111
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,630
So let's say theta equals linearly space numbers and you can kind of use whatever range you want but

112
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:20,460
it does make sense to use a range of minus two pi two plus two pi and I'll go in.

113
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:27,500
How about thirty nine steps because thirty nine is a good number of steps in fact thirty nine steps

114
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,930
is the name of a movie by Alfred Hitchcock from I think it was made in the 1940s.

115
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:41,150
Okay so let's define the cosine function to be equal to num PI that cost theta.

116
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:50,420
And then I will define costs fun n for negative and that's going to be and P that costs minus theta.

117
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,460
Now I'm going to do something else with spacing which is to put an extra space in here.

118
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:02,750
In my opinion this code now looks a little bit nicer it looks neater and more readable compared to this

119
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,270
where the equal signs are not aligned like this.

120
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,540
Okay.

121
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,320
So let's already try and determine whether this is an even function that will make our lives pretty

122
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,840
easy because we could just stop right there.

123
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,100
So we could test whether it's even and then we don't need to test whether it's odd.

124
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,380
So theta costs fun.

125
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:30,200
And then P L teed up plot theta cost fun and and I'll make this red circles to be consistent with how

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,890
I was doing this stuff up here.

127
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,440
All right.

128
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,330
BLT dog show huh.

129
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,280
Look at that.

130
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,150
That was pretty good.

131
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,000
Let me actually put a title on here.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,160
So appeal to the title.

133
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:51,750
This is the cosine of X right now we've just demonstrated that the cosine is an even function and the

134
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,550
cosine is an even function.

135
00:09:53,550 --> 00:10:00,000
Because when you input minus theta you get back exactly the same function.

136
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,460
All right.

137
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,800
That was pretty cool.

138
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,560
Now I want to try this again for a sign.

139
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:15,330
So in fact I'm just gonna start by copying and pasting and then this needs to be changed to sign this

140
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:25,330
gets changed to sign this gets changed to sign this gets changed sign and sign sign sign.

141
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,660
So is an interesting question when you're copying and pasting code whether it's actually faster to copy

142
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,580
paste so sometimes it's actually less work just to write everything out from scratch again okay.

143
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,570
Nonetheless let's see what this looks like.

144
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:47,280
Oh this looks like it's not the same function when we flipped the theta inside the sine function.

145
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:54,030
However you can already kind of start imagining that if we were to make the original sine function negative.

146
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,320
So if you would say minus sine then the blue line and the red line would overlap.

147
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:06,240
So therefore what I'm going to do is say minus the sine function and then I'm also going to change this

148
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,410
to be latex code.

149
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,220
So this is going to be instead of sign of X it's gonna be a sign of theta groups.

150
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,280
That's two slashes here like this.

151
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,580
Okay.

152
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,640
So now we get sign of theta.

153
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,910
So now what I've done is shown that sign of minus X is the same thing as minus the sign of X..

154
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,680
And that means that the sign is an odd function.

155
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,710
So I hope you enjoyed this video I enjoyed making it for you.

156
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:44,700
You learned about even and odd functions and you learned how to use python as a tool to help you understand

157
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,890
whether a function is even or odd that is actually a pretty handy method to have in your data analysis

158
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,580
toolkit.
