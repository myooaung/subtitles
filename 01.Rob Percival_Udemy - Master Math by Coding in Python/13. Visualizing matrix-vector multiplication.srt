1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:11,960
The goal of this video is to show you how to use Python to visualize matrix vector multiplication so

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,550
matrix vector multiplication is an algebraic procedure but it also has a geometric interpretation and

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,850
this geometric interpretation is actually pretty interesting and it's really insightful because that

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:34,280
is going to be an intuition a foundational understanding for ion vectors and what it means for a particular

5
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,170
vector to be an icon vector of a matrix.

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,470
And in the exercise you're going to get to make more beautiful art using the intersection between math

7
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,840
and coding.

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,530
All right so let's just dive right in and start with coding in Python.

9
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,360
I'm going to start by creating a matrix.

10
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,040
I'll call this matrix M.

11
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:05,660
It's going to be a two by two matrix and that's because a two dimensional matrix facilitates visualizing

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,610
in two dimensions of course.

13
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:14,000
So let's see there's going to be two rows and I'm going to put these in two separate lines of code like

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,300
this.

15
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,210
So the first row is going to be point five comma one.

16
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,550
And the second row will be one comma.

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,330
Point five.

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,670
Okay.

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,970
So here is our two by two matrix.

20
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,390
And now I'm gonna come up with a vector.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,050
I'll make this a num pi array and let's say one comma too it doesn't really matter exactly what elements

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,630
This vector has in fact I'm going to even generate some random vectors in a moment.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,010
Okay.

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:50,570
So now we have our matrix M and our vector V and now I'm going to compute matrix vector multiplication

25
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,340
by multiplying M times V.

26
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,060
All right so let's already run this cell and we don't get any any errors.

27
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,940
We don't see any python coding errors so that's a good sign.

28
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:09,440
So now I'm going to make a plot I'm going to make a plot of vector V and vector envy.

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,770
Now we can't really make a line plot of Matrix m because it has two elements.

30
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,820
We could make plots of the rows or of the columns but that's not really relevant here.

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,110
So I'm going to plot two vectors in standard position.

32
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:31,960
So that means they start from the origin and this first vector is gonna go to the first element of vs

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:39,930
the x coordinate a V and then the y component of this line is going to be the second element of V.

34
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:48,580
And what do you say we make this a blue line and let's make it nice and thick so line width with equals

35
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,760
How about two.

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,860
So this is plotting V and then let's already show that.

37
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,950
Okay.

38
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,030
Again I'd just like to make sure that we haven't made any coding mistakes so far.

39
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,550
You have learned throughout this course that I am prone to making coding mistakes.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's see and I'm also going to set the axis to go from minus five to plus five on both the x and y

41
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,990
axes.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,470
And how about a grid P L T dot grid.

43
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:21,840
All right.

44
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,510
This is starting to look pretty professional.

45
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,750
Let's see I want to label in here.

46
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,580
So this is going to be label equals V.

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,770
Pretty straightforward label P L T dot legend.

48
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,370
All right.

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,160
So now we're ready to plot envy.

50
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:47,220
So I'm just gonna copy and paste all of this and basically just hear the V's need to go to m these and

51
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,010
let's make this a red line maybe a red dash line.

52
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:57,590
How about that and then MTV and now little drum roll we get to see what this looks like.

53
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,570
OK so this looks pretty interesting.

54
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,220
We see here is the original vector and here is the matrix times the vector.

55
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,520
So there are two interesting things that we can observe about the matrix vector product compared to

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,530
the vector itself the original vector V.

57
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,030
So you take a vector and you multiply it by a matrix and generally there are two things that happened

58
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,890
to this line.

59
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,470
When you multiply it by a matrix one is you either stretch or shrink the vector so you can see that

60
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,740
this matrix made the vector a little bit longer.

61
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,550
So the length is larger and what's obviously more noticeable is that it rotated the angle so it looks

62
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,100
like this angle got rotated back.

63
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,820
Maybe this is like minus 15 degrees approximately.

64
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,170
And that is generally what happens when you take a vector and multiply it by a matrix the matrix will

65
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,530
do two things it's going to expand or shrink the vector and it's going to rotate the vector.

66
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,280
So it's going to point off in some other direction.

67
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,730
And so just to illustrate that to you you know I want to convince you that this matrix didn't rotate

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,080
this vector just because these are the particular numbers that I happened to pick.

69
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:17,060
So instead I'm gonna say V equals random that Rand N to sun.

70
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,110
Now just making up totally random numbers.

71
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,510
And now you can see every time I make up these random numbers the plot changes every time.

72
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,540
But we almost always see the same thing that the resulting vector.

73
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,680
So the matrix times the vector is either stretching or compressing but more importantly it's rotating

74
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:37,800
it.

75
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,150
So it's not pointing in the same direction as the original vector.

76
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:43,920
Okay.

77
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,250
And now I'd like to try something else so now I'm going to replace this let's comment this out.

78
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,450
I'm going to change this vector so I'm going to make this the vector 1 1 huh.

79
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,400
And now look this is pretty interesting.

80
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,330
So now these two vectors are actually pointing in the same direction and they're along the same line.

81
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:13,340
Now the red vector envy is a little bit longer so it does look like the Matrix stretched out the vector

82
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,880
a little bit but it didn't actually change the direction.

83
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,570
And if you remember back to the video towards the beginning of this section on scalar vector multiplication

84
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,390
then this is actually the geometric perspective of scalar vector multiplication.

85
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:36,410
So when you multiply a vector by a scalar you don't change its direction you just make it either longer

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,140
or shorter.

87
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:45,620
So that's pretty interesting we multiply this vector by this matrix and it's almost like we just multiplied

88
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,790
by a vector by a scalar by a single number.

89
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,940
So that's not to say that this matrix is a single number but the effect of this specific matrix on this

90
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,440
specific vector and not any other vector was that the matrix is kind of acting like a scalar on this

91
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,390
vector.

92
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,410
So now that was one example I'm going to try another example I'll just take this vector to B minus one.

93
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,720
And here we get another interesting thing so now it looks like the original vector is pointing this

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,230
way the matrix times the vector looks like it's it kept the vector on the same line if you imagine this

95
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:30,420
like infinitely long line going like this so we have the matrix times the vector on that same line but

96
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,480
pointed in the other direction.

97
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,840
And let's see you know we can change this.

98
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,920
The minus sign over here and that's just going to flip it around.

99
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,340
Okay.

100
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,010
So here was this.

101
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,480
Generally this concept that mostly when you multiply a matrix by a vector the resulting vector points

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,070
off in some other direction.

103
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:57,690
But there are some very specific cases of vectors and matrices that when you multiply them together

104
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,350
the effect of the matrix on the vector is basically just the same as scalar multiplication.

105
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,310
So that is an important concept that you should keep in mind for the next video.

106
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,270
I think it's the next video when I introduce I can composition let's make some art.

107
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,380
What do you think about this.

108
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,280
I think it looks really beautiful.

109
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,090
It almost looks 3D it's like these two fans that are intersecting that are kind of going through each

110
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:23,810
other.

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,190
In fact this is just a two dimensional plot.

112
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,380
I'm going to show you what I did to create this plot.

113
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,240
Well I'm not going to show you everything.

114
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,900
I'm going to give you some guidelines for creating a plot like this.

115
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,680
And then the goal of this exercise is basically to reconstruct this image or something that looks a

116
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,750
lot like it.

117
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,150
Okay.

118
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,990
So start with this matrix M and this vector one a.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,830
So this first element of vector V stays fixed and then the idea is that you change this element a to

120
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,390
b a bunch of numbers that range from minus two to plus two.

121
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:09,410
And what you're seeing here is a plot a V and a plot of M times V all on the same graph.

122
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:17,030
So it's a little bit similar to what we just did in Python except now the vector is getting is changing

123
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,020
at each iteration according to this range.

124
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,350
All right.

125
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,700
So positive video.

126
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:28,040
Have a go at this I think producing this image probably isn't so difficult figuring out exactly how

127
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,460
a set these colors is probably the hardest part.

128
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,410
But don't worry if you don't get that that's just aesthetics.

129
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,890
And now I am going to switch to Python.

130
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:45,020
I will show you how I will implement this and I will reveal my secrets for how I made these colors all

131
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,210
right so let's get a new cell in here.

132
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,740
So I'm going to create a variable a.

133
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,560
It's going to be linearly space numbers between minus two and plus two.

134
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,830
And let's go for 40 steps.

135
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,000
The number of steps is a little bit arbitrary but 40 is the number that I picked.

136
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:03,980
OK.

137
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,330
So now I'm going to loop through let's call this.

138
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:07,850
Actually no.

139
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,260
Just to be more consistent.

140
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:18,240
I think I would call this looping variable name a n and then I need to rename this I call this V comp

141
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,540
because it's the component of V.

142
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,140
So for a in V comp let's see.

143
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:31,890
So I'm going to start by creating the vector so num pi array the first element is always 1 and the second

144
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,290
element is a.

145
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:39,230
And then I create M V and that is simply M times V.

146
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,000
And now depending on where you are with the code you may or may not need to define M that matrix that

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,510
I showed in the slides is actually exactly this matrix here.

148
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,310
So I already have it from the previous cells so I don't need to reconstruct it again.

149
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,590
Okay.

150
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,280
And then we're going to plot.

151
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:06,660
So I'm going to copy and paste some of this code here because a lot of this is the same.

152
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,430
So let's see.

153
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,140
I'm going to get rid of the color and the label first I just want to make sure that I can get this plot

154
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,680
looking nice.

155
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,610
Let's see plot Dot.

156
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,160
Show all right.

157
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,620
So already we can see that we're getting there now.

158
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,310
Which one of these fans is V and which one of these fans is M V.

159
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,820
Well this first one that's kind of fanning out to the right here.

160
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,710
This one is V and you can tell because the first element is always the number one.

161
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,440
So the X axis coordinate is always going to be one.

162
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:40,720
Okay.

163
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,800
So this is starting to look pretty good.

164
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:49,790
I'm going to set the axis to be square and turn off the axis.

165
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,300
So now this is basically complete except for the colors.

166
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,430
So now let me reveal my secrets and show you how I created this color.

167
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,930
So the original vector V.

168
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,930
That's again this fan that's sort of coming off straight to the right over here.

169
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,270
I set this to be.

170
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:18,130
So the red component is 1 minus a B.S. of a divided by four the green component is fixed at point five

171
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,340
and the blue component is a B.S. I divided by two.

172
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,930
And then I also set an alpha of point two.

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,610
So it's gonna be partially translucent.

174
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,150
Okay.

175
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,110
A little typo there.

176
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:32,510
All right.

177
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,760
So that is for V and then for m.

178
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:46,180
These are the transformed vector that one I set to be one minus the absolute value of a divided by two.

179
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,820
And then the green channel was the absolute value of a divided by four.

180
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,640
And then Blue was fixed at point five.

181
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,200
And I didn't set any color transparency on this one.

182
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,810
I see this is too light.

183
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,780
This was actually set to be point eight.

184
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,350
Aha.

185
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:03,920
Okay.

186
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,390
There you go.

187
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:12,980
And this light transparency also gives it this kind of 3D field because you can actually see the matrix

188
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:22,520
times the vector behind the vector itself the original vector so you know by this point in the course

189
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:30,320
that I'm a big fan of encouraging you to feel inspired by this general approach and come up with something

190
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,010
that looks better and more artistic than what I have here.

191
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,850
And when you do please post it along with your code if you like to the Q and A form I would be very

192
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:47,840
enthusiastic to see what kind of art and sort of interaction between math and art that you have come

193
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,130
up with.

194
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:56,510
So the art is great of course but the main point of this video was to illustrate to the idea of visualizing

195
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:03,950
matrix vector multiplication and in particular the geometric interpretation of matrix vector multiplication

196
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,760
leads to building intuition for ion vectors.

197
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,250
And that is coming up so stay tuned.
