00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:10,900
Let us begin our exploration of trigonometry by talking about what I consider to be the most annoying

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,810
part of trigonometry and that is dealing with radians versus degrees.

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,870
I will start with a quick review of what these two things mean how they are related to each other which

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,720
leads to a couple of simple formulas for converting between radians and degrees.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,960
And in the exercise you will learn more about writing functions in Python.

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,160
So here we have a circle that say this is the unit circle.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,280
And the question is how far is it around here.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,550
What is the distance around this curve.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,360
Measured in angles.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,520
So it turns out so.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:48,790
Yeah.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,810
If you were going to walk around this entire circle now it turns out the answer to the total angular

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,660
distance around this circle is well it's either two pi radians or it's 360 degrees.

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,220
Well I shouldn't say or these are actually exactly the same thing.

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,990
They're just different measures.

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,140
Sometimes you see angles reported in radians and sometimes in degrees.

17
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,910
So this leads to the fairly straightforward way to convert between radians and degrees.

18
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:28,720
We start by considering that two pi radians is the same thing as 360 degrees.

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,740
So this is in units of radians units of degrees.

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:40,580
So if we wanted to convert between them and ask you know how many radians are there or how many degrees

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:47,600
are there in one radians then what you have to do is divide both sides of this equation by 2 pi and

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,520
that leads to this formula that radians equals 360 degrees divided by 2 pi which you can actually simplify

23
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,140
just by dividing by two to get to one hundred and eighty divided by Pi.

24
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,180
And of course you could convert the other way.

25
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:10,440
So if you want to convert from radians into degrees then you divide both sides of this equation by 360

26
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,000
and essentially you just end up with the reciprocal.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,210
So one degree is pi over one hundred and eighty radians.

28
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:26,480
So let's switch to Python and implement these two fairly straightforward formulas.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,810
For now we will use the NUM pi module.

30
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,750
I'm actually not going to use the MATLAB live module in this part of the video but it will be used in

31
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,340
the exercise so we might as well already load it in.

32
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:46,520
OK so let's say we want to convert from degrees to radians so we start with degrees and let's start

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,680
with 180.

34
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:55,120
That's a pretty simple degree to convert and then the formula is degrees.

35
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:04,870
Times pi divided by s num pi pi divided by one hundred and eighty.

36
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,370
And so this conforms to what we expect.

37
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:15,170
So 180 degrees is halfway around the circle and that corresponds to Pi which is also halfway around

38
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:21,240
the circle and let's print this out again just so we don't lose practice with printing.

39
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:30,460
So I will say percent G degrees is percent G radians.

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,640
So then we need to substitute deg for deg times pi divided by 180.

41
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:38,950
Okay.

42
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,880
So there you go.

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,200
And now you know it's kind of interesting you can test different values.

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:51,380
This corresponds to one quarter pi and who knows what this number of degrees means but it happens to

45
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,770
be one point two times tend to the eleven radians.

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,040
Okay.

47
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,070
So that's actually a pretty big number.

48
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,740
And that seems a little bit weird because one full with around the circle is only two pi.

49
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,160
So in fact what we're doing here is looping around the circle many many many many many times.

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,760
And so therefore it actually makes sense to convert this back into a number that is between 0 and 2

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,720
pi.

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,490
So how do we do that the way that we do that is by using the modulus.

53
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:30,140
So what we want to do is take this number divided by two pi and then see what the remainder is.

54
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,550
So let's say red equals and now I'm going to just move this up here.

55
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,520
So this is a variable for radiant.

56
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,290
So so far I'm not doing anything remarkably different.

57
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,830
And now what I want to do is convert this from this number that is potentially really large to whatever

58
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,470
is the remainder after dividing this number by two pi.

59
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:02,100
So we write red percent and then known pi times 2.

60
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,010
So 2 pi.

61
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,580
OK so then we find out that this is four point eight one radians.

62
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,100
And again the reason why this makes sense is because the more you go around the circle or I should say

63
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,040
each time you go round the circle you're passing the same angle multiple times.

64
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:27,210
So therefore although it's not technically incorrect to say that some angle is you know what whatever

65
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:33,060
this number ends up being this really huge number of radians it is more sensible it's more interpretable

66
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,880
to bring this back into the scale between 0 and 2 pi.

67
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,250
OK so this is for converting degrees to radians and now let's go the other way.

68
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:52,290
So let's say we specify the angle already in radians and I'll start with using PI because then we know

69
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,790
the answer is going to end up being 180.

70
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:04,410
So now we want to convert from radians 2 degrees so degrees equals one hundred and eighty times the

71
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,930
radians divided by pi and let's just see what this is.

72
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,530
All right.

73
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:17,000
So this confirms what we already know has to be the right answer which is that pi is equal.

74
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,400
So pi radians is equal to 180 degrees.

75
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,750
And again we can specify this to be let's call this.

76
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,590
How about for pi.

77
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,730
So now we end up getting seven hundred and twenty degrees.

78
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:36,720
And again this number isn't really wrong but this means we're going around the circle twice so therefore

79
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,520
it makes sense to use the modulus operator.

80
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,640
And now we want to go or we want to divide not by 2 pi but by 360 degrees because that corresponds to

81
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,250
once around the circle.

82
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,740
So then we get a degree of zero.

83
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,910
And that also makes sense because for Pi is exactly twice around the circle which means you end up at

84
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,060
an angle of zero.

85
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,410
All right.

86
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:11,790
So it turns out that I've been making your life a little bit more difficult than it actually needs to

87
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,400
be.

88
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:19,560
And that's because none Pi has a built in function to do all of this or at least this part for us.

89
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
So I can write.

90
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,760
Red equals num pi dot.

91
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,300
Now we want to convert from degrees to radians.

92
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,840
And let me bring this back to some sensible numbers.

93
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:39,690
So let's say one hundred and eighty and I know that the answer is going to be pi or three point 1 4

94
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,280
and then let's see.

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,730
So here we discovered that seven hundred and twenty degrees corresponds to zero pi.

96
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,710
So if I write 720 here huh.

97
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,690
Now this function here is actually returning the radians directly.

98
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:01,450
It's not going to give us the radiant value bound between 0 and 2 pi.

99
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:09,210
So if you like this is not mandatory but if you like you can also add this modulus operator in here

100
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,950
as well.

101
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,850
And that will give us back 0 radians.

102
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,290
OK.

103
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,530
And now you will also not be surprised to learn that the function to convert the other way is going

104
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,360
to be called RAD 2 deg for radians two degrees

105
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,000
in this video.

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:37,270
You learned or got a review of converting between radians and degrees for trigonometric angles.

107
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:44,550
Now in the interest of time I decided to put the exercise into a separate video because that's a relatively

108
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,520
involved exercise that involves writing functions not only to convert between radians and degrees but

109
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,660
also to generate plots of vectors.

110
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,110
So stay tuned.

111
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:01,140
Don't go too far come back and watch the next video to learn more python and math.
