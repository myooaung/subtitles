00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:11.030
The focus of this video is the greatest common denominator, which is sometimes called the greatest common
1

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.070
factor.
2

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.080
I'm going to continue calling this thing the greatest common denominator because that helps link it
3

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.460
to Python a little bit better.
4

5
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.640
So what is the greatest common denominator?
5

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:31.970
It is defined as the largest integer that divides into two numbers -- two other integers -- with no remainder.
6

7
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.470
So here are a few examples.
7

8
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.830
People often write the greatest common denominator with this kind of syntax, so greatest common denominator
8

9
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.410
of 2 and 4 is the largest integer that goes into both of these numbers cleanly.
9

10
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.370
So of course one divides into both of these numbers but we can do better than that.
10

11
00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.110
We can do 2: 2 goes into 2 with no remainder and 2 goes into 4 2 times with no remainder.
11

12
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.330
So therefore the greatest common denominator of 2 and 4 is 2.
12

13
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.410
Here's another example.
13

14
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.870
6 and 15.
14

15
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.700
Now 2 goes into 6.
15

16
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.370
But 2 does not go into 15 with 0 remainder; 2 goes into 15 7 times,
16

17
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.830
that would give you 14 and a remainder of 1. But three actually does go into both these numbers.
17

18
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.820
Likewise, you know
18

19
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.060
4 doesn't go into either 5 goes into 15 with no remainder, but 5 doesn't go into 6 with no remainder.
19

20
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.390
And so on.
20

21
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.150
Now sometimes you get a pair of numbers like this 6 and 17 where there is no real common denominator.
21

22
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.070
And in that case we're basically left with the number one, which is kind of like a trivial common denominator
22

23
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.980
because one goes into everything.
23

24
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.070
So in a moment I will switch to Python and show you how to implement the greatest common denominator.
24

25
00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.320
But before that I want to show you one application of greatest common denominator, which is reducing
25

26
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.580
fractions.
26

27
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:12.020
So here the idea is that if the greatest common denominator between A and B is C where A B and C are
27

28
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.490
just standing for real valued integers, then A divided by B can be reduced,
28

29
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.910
this fraction can be reduced, to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and the denominator
29

30
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.900
by C. And that looks something like this in the final step.
30

31
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.110
So A divided by C over B divided by C so have some double fractions, or embedded fractions, going on
31

32
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.260
here.
32

33
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.770
Now the reason why this is valid is there is an intermediate step here, which is to multiply by C divided
33

34
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.320
by C which is actually just one of course unless C is zero.
34

35
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.380
But we don't accept a common denominator of zero; it has to be at least 1.
35

36
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.730
So C divided by C is 1 so that's not really changing anything.
36

37
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.030
And then you put the A in here and the B over here.
37

38
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.070
So this is like the kind of abstract theory using symbolic variables.
38

39
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.640
Here you see an example.
39

40
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.310
The greatest common denominator between 6 and 15 is 3.
40

41
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.260
So therefore to reduce 6 divided by 15 into its simplest form you divide both the numerator and the
41

42
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.060
denominator by 3.
42

43
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.230
That gives you 6 divided by 3 over 15 divided by 3, which is two thirds. To implement the greatest common
43

44
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.920
denominator
44

45
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:40.560
we are going to use the math module. So far you've seen the numpy module, you've seen sympy module,
45

46
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.910
and now I'm going to show you the math module. Now previously when I've shown you how to import modules
46

47
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.730
in the python it was the syntax is something like this so import something as something.
47

48
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:02.520
So for example it was import numpy as np, so that's useful if you want to use a shortcut but if you
48

49
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.710
don't want to use a shortcut then you can just leave it like this.
49

50
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.390
So we could write for example import math as math and then here I would type math dot you know whatever
50

51
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.150
the function is, but if I'm going to leave it as math anyway and I'm not shortening it. Then you can just
51

52
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.890
leave it with this syntax here.
52

53
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.050
So import space the math module.
53

54
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.050
So computing the greatest common denominator in the math module is actually pretty simple.
54

55
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.970
The function is called G C D for greatest common denominator, and you input the two numbers.
55

56
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.540
So for example, we saw this in the slide -- 6 and 15 -- and now you know you can try a bunch of other numbers.
56

57
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.380
Pretty interesting. How about ninety five and 100, so the greatest common denominator between these two
57

58
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.500
numbers is 5.
58

59
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.600
Now I'd like to show you that the greatest common denominator is defined only for integers so let's
59

60
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.220
say four and sixteen.
60

61
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.040
We know here the number is going to be four.
61

62
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.380
But how about if it's sixteen point one.
62

63
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.550
Whoops!
63

64
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.410
Now we get an error, and the error says that a float object.
64

65
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.360
So a floating point number cannot be interpreted as an integer.
65

66
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.080
And basically this is Python error.
66

67
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.630
speak for
67

68
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.870
I expected an integer and you gave me a floating point number.
68

69
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.120
So let's get rid of this error by doing something correct here.
69

70
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.430
All right.
70

71
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.520
So now I want to show you one of the applications of the greatest common denominator.
71

72
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:42.090
So let's say we want to compute the fraction A divided by B and let's set A to be sixteen and B to be
72

73
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.360
88.
73

74
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.810
Now if you like you can take a moment and try to figure out in your head what is the greatest common
74

75
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.150
denominator between these two numbers 16 and 88.
75

76
00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:02.600
I'm actually feeling a little bit lazy so I'm going to do this using Python and the math module.
76

77
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:11.970
So the greatest common factor, which here I'm calling variable fact is going to be math dot G C D A comma
77

78
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.070
B and let's see what that is.
78

79
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.790
Out of curiosity.
79

80
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.240
Okay so it's eight and actually that one isn't too hard to figure out on your own because eight goes
80

81
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.680
into sixteen twice.
81

82
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.680
And it goes into 88
82

83
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.490
eleven times.
83

84
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.720
Okay.
84

85
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:34.890
So now I want to print this out in a slightly nicer looking fashion, and so to do that I'm going to say
85

86
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:45.480
from IPython dot display import display and math and you know by now, by this point in the course, that
86

87
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:53.620
these are two of my favorite functions for doing fancy printing, nice pretty printing in Python.
87

88
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.540
So what I'd like to show down here is that 16 divided by eight reduces to two divided by 11 times eight
88

89
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.670
times eight, and eight times eight is this greatest common factor.
89

90
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:15.450
Now it's not really feasible for me just to say print A divided by B because that's actually evaluating
90

91
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.020
this fraction out to 15 or whatever decimal points.
91

92
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.840
So instead I'm going to use latex to print this out.
92

93
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.780
So let's say display and then math and now we want a fraction.
93

94
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:35.730
So you remember that to create a fraction using latex code in Python, you say frac and then one curly
94

95
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.370
bracket for the numerator and another curly bracket for the denominator.
95

96
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:47.970
So this is going to be, let's say all right this is A and B and then equals and then we need another
96

97
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.500
fraction.
97

98
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:56.160
This is going to be A divided by C, where I'm just I'm going to replace these letters of course, but C
98

99
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.580
is going to be the greatest common multiple.
99

100
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:07.290
So A divided by C and then in the denominator is B divided by C and then times actually no I think it
100

101
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:14.850
might look nicer if I do it like this. I'm going to say instead of A divided by C I'm going to say A
101

102
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.450
times C and B times C.
102

103
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:26.100
Okay so now that I've written out the kind of big structure of what I want this output to look like,
103

104
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.000
now we go back and replace each of these individual elements.
104

105
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.710
So these are all going to be replaced with numbers.
105

106
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.610
So it's percent G in every case.
106

107
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:42.320
Percent G and then percent G here again percent G here.
107

108
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.620
You guessed it... percent G.
108

109
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:44.830
Okay.
109

110
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.840
So we need one two three four five six variables to go in here.
110

111
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:58.920
So that's going to be A comma B and then it's A comma fact because this A is for the numerator here
111

112
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.030
A times the greatest common factor here.
112

113
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.610
And then we have B fact B comma A fact.
113

114
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:05.830
All right.
114

115
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.900
Let's see what this looks like.
115

116
00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.470
So we see that sixteen equals out.
116

117
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:10.750
Right.
117

118
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.040
This isn't exactly what I want.
118

119
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.350
In fact this is mathematically incorrect.
119

120
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.490
I hope you caught this before I did.
120

121
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:26.040
This should actually be A divided by fact and then B divided by fact.
121

122
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.530
All right.
122

123
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.660
This is looking better.
123

124
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:35.410
So two times eight is sixteen, and eleven times eight is eighty eight, and two divided by eleven is the
124

125
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.370
most reduced form of sixteen divided by eighty eight.
125

126
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:48.050
And of course eight over eight will cancel out to one. In this video I showed you the greatest common
126

127
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.130
denominator.
127

128
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.460
I explained how it works how to implement it in Python.
128

129
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:58.160
And I showed you an application of the greatest common denominator for reducing fractions.
129

130
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.580
Now I'm sure that you were very upset and disappointed to see that there were no exercises in this video :(
130

131
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:10.730
But don't worry! There are two exercises about the greatest common denominator that are coming up!
131

132
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:16.820
So stay tuned and watch the next video and prepare to show off your python mathematical skills.
