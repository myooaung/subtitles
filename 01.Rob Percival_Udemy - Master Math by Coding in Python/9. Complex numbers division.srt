1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:10,310
Now it's time to learn about division with complex numbers and in particular taking a division where

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,980
a complex number is in the denominator and just simplifying the expression a bit.

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,500
So I'm going to show you how to do that using what's called the conjugate trick.

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,370
So this is about division with complex numbers and math.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,540
And then there's also an important python or a programming concept that you're going to learn in this

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:36,470
video which is how to break up complicated or really long lines of code into multiple individual lines

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:43,700
of code and also a related concept is how to break up a complicated equation into separate pieces of

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,160
code each of which is simpler and easier to read.

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,770
So let's get started.

10
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,180
If you would see a complex division that's expressed like this.

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,050
The question is could you simplify this expression.

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,480
And the answer is yes you definitely can.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,280
In this case it's really simple.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,530
You divide both of these terms by two and you end up with two I.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:05,850
All right.

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,400
So that's pretty straightforward.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,570
But what if you had a complex number in the denominator.

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,650
Now what can you do.

19
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,850
How can you simplify this expression.

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:22,730
The answer comes from thinking about the complex conjugate and multiplication of a complex number with

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,190
its conjugate that I introduced in the previous video.

22
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:35,570
So the complex conjugate trick for division is to take this number multiply both the numerator and denominator

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,680
by the complex conjugate of this number.

24
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,780
So of the denominator.

25
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,890
Now you can see that that's not really changing.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:50,500
This number is not changing this expression because this term multiplies both the numerator and denominator.

27
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,070
Of course you could just cancel these out.

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,830
However if you implement this multiplication this denominator now becomes a real value.

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,120
No it doesn't stay complex.

30
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,210
So in particular it's just the real part squared plus the imaginary part squared.

31
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:14,720
And if that seems a little confusing how to get from here to here then you might want to go back and

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,780
consult the previous video.

33
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,060
All right.

34
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,140
So that simplifies this equation like this.

35
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:28,430
And that's generally the accepted or most appropriate form of representing a fraction or a division

36
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,640
with complex numbers to make sure that the denominator is real valued.

37
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,560
So this is an example using specific numbers.

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,640
Now I'm going to show you what that looks like more abstractly.

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,010
Here we have two numbers Z and W..

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,540
You can imagine that both of these are complex numbers but certainly w we assume is a complex number.

41
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,690
So to simplify this expression you just multiply both the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate

42
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,070
of W and then you do whatever simplifications you can.

43
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,580
All right.

44
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:08,260
So now let's switch to Python and see some of this stuff in action in this video.

45
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:15,130
We are going to be using num pi simplify and the display and math functions from already importing them

46
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,280
up here.

47
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,680
So I'm going to start by creating a complex number let's call it Z.

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,070
And this is going to be an pita complex.

49
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,380
I'm going to say the real part is for the imaginary part is to then.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,410
And now what I'm essentially going to do is print out the simple equation or the simplified expression

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:43,240
that I showed in these slides so that's math or display math and then I'll have a fraction with a percent

52
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,060
s so I'm going to replace this with the complex number.

53
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:54,460
And then the denominator of the fraction is just going to be two and then I'll set that equal to and

54
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,730
then I'm gonna just print out this number.

55
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:04,240
So now for these substitutions we have the first substitution was the complex number z and the second

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,740
substitution is Z divided by two.

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,320
All right.

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,840
And now we see that this division simplifies to two plus 1 J.

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,630
So nothing particularly earth shattering the amazing here but I think it's always nice to be able to

60
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:26,830
demonstrate some concepts yourself using Python as opposed to just trusting everything you see on a

61
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,920
screen or in a book or on the Internet.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,890
You certainly shouldn't trust everything you see on the Internet.

63
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,150
All right.

64
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,650
The next thing I want to do is illustrate the complex conjugate trick that I showed.

65
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,480
So what I want to do is print out something that looks kind of like this except there's gonna be two

66
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,320
equals signs.

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,210
I want to have first the expression showing the division of one complex number by another and then the

68
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,930
same division but with multiplying the numerator and denominator by a complex conjugate of the denominator

69
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,570
and then all of that's going to be simplified and we'll see what the actual answer is.

70
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:04,770
All right.

71
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:11,890
So first we need to come up with some complex numbers and I will use the ones that I showed in the slide.

72
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,570
So let's say Z one is and P complex.

73
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:24,340
And that was the real part was for the imaginary part was to then we had said too complex and there

74
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,510
the real part was.

75
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,180
And the imaginary part was minus three.

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,460
Okay.

77
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,420
So let's start printing this thing out piecemeal so one simple step at a time.

78
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:41,350
So let's start with just showing this fractions so that's going to be frac the numerator is z 1 and

79
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,340
then the denominator is Z tubes.

80
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,970
Actually they're not doing that the right way.

81
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:56,230
These have to be percent s and then here we say percent s and substitute said one and Z two if you want

82
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,830
you could simplify and then run this through simple latex to get this to look a little bit nicer.

83
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,450
Maybe I'll show you how that would look here.

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,460
So sim that latex and then Sim the fi

85
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,390
loops that's a sim simplify.

86
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,200
So it looks slightly different.

87
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,820
There's no parentheses and now there's an eye instead of a J.

88
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,010
But in this particular case because I'm going to be doing some multiplications I actually prefer to

89
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,810
keep these parentheses here for now.

90
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,140
Okay so this is one part.

91
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:38,630
Now I want to say equals and then I'm going to copy and paste this a little bit here.

92
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,690
So that's going to equal in the numerator.

93
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,790
It's gonna be said one times percent.

94
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,420
S and this is going to become the complex conjugate of the denominator.

95
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,450
And then here we have to do the same thing of course.

96
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:57,450
So times percent s for the complex conjugate of the denominator again.

97
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,820
All right.

98
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,280
So now.

99
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,020
So these two variables were for substituting in the first fraction the first term.

100
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:10,030
And now we need said one and and P Doc carnage said 2.

101
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:19,950
So this is for the numerator and then for the denominator we need Z to an and p dot coms Z 2.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,270
Okay.

103
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,460
Let's see how this looks all right.

104
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,020
So this looks pretty good.

105
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,500
Now you'll notice that this line of code is starting to get really really long.

106
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,680
And I'm not even done yet.

107
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,030
I'm gonna add even more stuff here.

108
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,660
So if you have a really long line of code sometimes it's useful to find a natural breaking point in

109
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,270
the code.

110
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:47,090
So a natural separation in the line of code and you just press enter and let the rest of this line be

111
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,780
on the following line of text.

112
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,970
And I'm going to do even more so I'm even gonna separate this multiple times.

113
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,190
This is kinda let me see.

114
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,170
This ends here.

115
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,390
Yeah.

116
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,220
So now I have this.

117
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:08,210
This is kind of one line of code but it's actually spanning now four different lines of text and you

118
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,210
can see if you press control enter.

119
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,140
It still runs fine so python is totally fine interpreting this in the way that you think it should.

120
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,770
Now when you were writing code like this it's generally recommended this is not strictly necessary but

121
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:28,190
it's generally recommended to have a backslash in here like this and the backslash.

122
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,490
Let me show you that having that backslash doesn't produce any errors it doesn't change anything but

123
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,340
this is used for like human readability.

124
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,030
So now when someone else is looking at your code they will see this backslash and they will know that

125
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,830
this means that you are intentionally wrapping this code around to the next line.

126
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,360
And then again to the next line.

127
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,680
And again to the next line.

128
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,550
OK.

129
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,970
So back to the main goal here.

130
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:59,570
So now what I want to do is basically solve this equation or solve this division and put that answer

131
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:06,680
here song and say equals one more percent s and that is going to be down here.

132
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,850
So let's say Z one divided by Z two.

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,230
Okay.

134
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,620
Invalid syntax I'm actually missing a comma here.

135
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,470
Just because you're breaking up the line doesn't mean you can avoid any syntax.

136
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:21,890
Wow.

137
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,510
Okay so this is quite a long answer but that's just what it is.

138
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,380
And now if you like.

139
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,640
So this one actually could be converted into simpler maybe.

140
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,800
So let's say Sim dot latex and then simply simplify

141
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,310
starts with a Y simplify.

142
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,910
Okay so that didn't change it a whole lot although it got rid of the parentheses.

143
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,550
I think that part looks nicer however.

144
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,380
Now you see there's a little bit of inconsistency within the same equation here.

145
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:04,270
I'm using J to indicate the imaginary operator but here I'm using IE to indicate the imaginary operator.

146
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,900
Now either one is fine J is fine I is fine but it's good to be consistent certainly within the same

147
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,740
equation.

148
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,540
So in fact despite what I just said I think this is probably not the best idea.

149
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm going to remove that and leave it with J as the imaginary operator the exercise for this video is

150
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,460
to implement this really really really long expression.

151
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,890
This is a really difficult multiplication and actually if you were up for a little algebra challenge

152
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:42,760
you can try solving that or simplifying this as much as you possibly can by hand using a piece of paper

153
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,640
and a pencil.

154
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,420
But that's not actually required what you really just need to do for this exercise is to implement this

155
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,530
in Python.

156
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:56,020
So this is super long this is gonna take a really long line of code so you can try and come up with

157
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:03,910
some ways to make this simpler so that this becomes a readable piece of code in Python as opposed to

158
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,580
being one single line of Python.

159
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,620
That's really really really long.

160
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:15,430
Okay so you can implement this multiplication with Z and W and then of course you replace Z and W with

161
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,970
these particular numbers and then basically see what it simplifies to.

162
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,960
And this actually turns out to have a really nice solution even though it looks like a really complicated

163
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,040
problem.

164
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,420
All right.

165
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,840
So pause the video switch to Python.

166
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:39,900
Get to work and see how well you can simplify this equation all right so I am going to start by writing

167
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:51,270
out these complex numbers so Z was and Peter complex 4 and 2 and W was MP that complex and the real

168
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,720
part was 3 and the imaginary part was 5.

169
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,680
So there is essentially two ways that you can go about breaking up that really long expression into

170
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,040
simpler code.

171
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,310
You could basically keep it on one full line of code that spans multiple lines like this.

172
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:14,880
But actually what I'm going to do and what I recommend doing is breaking that up into multiple different

173
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,730
parts so in particular I'm gonna come up with a bunch of different variables so I'm going to say left

174
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:31,120
numerator equals and then the left denominator equals and then the left part equals.

175
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:38,490
So what I'm doing is taking the left part of the equation and breaking that up into two separate parts

176
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:49,240
so I'm just gonna say the numerator and there the numerator was Z minus one times Z times w plus W and

177
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,210
the denominator was w times Z minus W.

178
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:01,330
So then the left part of the equation is simply the left numerator divided by left D nominated.

179
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,310
So in my opinion this code even though it technically takes up more characters I think this is much

180
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,030
cleaner and it's easier to read it's easier for someone else to interpret and that also means it's less

181
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,200
prone to errors.

182
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:23,430
So if you break up equations into individual parts like this you are less likely to make simple typing

183
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,500
mistakes.

184
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:24,920
Okay.

185
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:37,300
So now we need the right part so right Numa equals writes D num equals and the right part equals.

186
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,990
Okay.

187
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:50,810
So this one was W minus one times one minus W it's a funny set of expressions there so then the denominator

188
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,660
was this was probably the most difficult part of this to get right.

189
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:08,480
So minus W squared times said minus W squared plus two times w times Z plus two times W minus said minus

190
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,800
one.

191
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,970
Quite a mouthful.

192
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,460
Now if you're thinking that I have like some amazing memory for these kinds of things I don't um actually

193
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,100
cross referencing this with my other monitor.

194
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay.

195
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,060
So anyway the right part is right.

196
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,750
Numerator divided by right denominator.

197
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,760
All right.

198
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,070
And then the last thing I'm going to simplify is actually creating a variable called solution and that's

199
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,930
just the left part times the right part.

200
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:46,790
Now again I'd like to highlight that this is seven lines of code and technically you could put all of

201
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,240
this stuff into one really really really long line of code.

202
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:58,040
However I think you agree that this is more readable and less likely to produce errors.

203
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,270
Okay.

204
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,080
So now let's print the solution.

205
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,030
Huh.

206
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,200
And that's pretty interesting the result happens to be just one.

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,840
I mean this is is technically a complex number but the imaginary part is zero.

208
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,650
So really all of this stuff just worked out to one that is pretty funny.

209
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,580
And what I encourage you to do is change around some of these numbers and see whether this solution

210
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,390
changes as these numbers change.

211
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:33,050
So in this video you learned about division with complex numbers and simplifying complex division using

212
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:40,460
the conjugate trick and I discussed two different ways of breaking up long lines of code into multiple

213
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,120
lines.

214
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:48,020
So one way it was just literally moving parts of a line of code underneath and a second way is using

215
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,930
separate variables for different parts of the equation and then combining them later on.

216
00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:00,290
Now in the past several videos I've been talking about complex numbers from a purely algebraic perspective

217
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:07,400
but it turns out that complex numbers also have a really interesting geometry associated with them and

218
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,460
that is the main topic of the next video.
