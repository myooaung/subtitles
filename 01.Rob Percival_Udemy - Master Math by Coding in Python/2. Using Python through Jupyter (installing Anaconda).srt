00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:09,930
In this video I'm going to show you how to use Python through the Jupiter IPython notebook, which
1

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,030
comes with the anaconda package.
2

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:18,210
So in this video I'm going show you how to install Anaconda and Jupiter notebook. In the next video,
3

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm going to show you how to use Python online without any installation.
4

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,910
Now if you are already a comfortable Python user and you have Python installed on your computer you
5

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,720
might just skip this lecture and the next lecture or maybe watch it at twice the normal speed just in
6

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,400
case there is anything new.
7

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,450
Now I generally recommend using python by installing the Jupiter notebook locally on your computer.
8

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,120
The advantage is that it's a local installation.
9

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,540
You don't have to worry about Internet access.
10

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,800
It's free, it's cross platform.
11

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,610
And if you install Python with the Jupiter IPython notebook that's going to be the easiest way for
12

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,670
you to follow along with the course.
13

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,690
And that's because this is the program and this is the environment that I have filmed this entire course
14

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,370
in.
15

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,100
The main disadvantage of installing Python locally on your computer is that you need to be able to install
16

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,990
new program.
17

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,190
So maybe you're using a shared computer or a computer at your university where you don't have administrator
18

19
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,980
access and you're not able to install new programs. In that case then no worries you can just see what
19

20
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,830
I have to say in the next video.
20

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,810
So in a moment I'm going to switch to my browser and go to Anaconda.com. So here is this Web site
21

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,570
Anaconda.
22

23
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,550
.com
23

24
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:48,180
This is essentially just a program that will install a bunch of python and other applications onto your
24

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,020
computer.
25

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,940
So from this main web site Anaconda you go over here to download and then essentially you just want
26

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,750
to download whichever is the right installation package for you.
27

28
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,840
So there's Windows and Mac and Linux and then you just have to note whether you are going to install
28

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,240
Python 3 or Python 2 super important do not install Python 2.
29

30
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,980
That's the wrong thing to do.
30

31
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,890
You want to use Python 3 version.
31

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,330
I've made this entire course in Python 3 and if you try to follow along using Python 2 then it's likely
32

33
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,500
that you are going to start getting errors when you run exactly my code.
33

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,160
And that's just because you're using an old version of Python.
34

35
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,490
All right.
35

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,450
So then you have to choose whether to use the 64 bit installer or the 32 bit installer.
36

37
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:46,140
Most likely the 64 bit is going to be the appropriate version for you. And then you just download the
37

38
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,470
installer.
38

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,760
Now I'm not going to go through the entire installation process here because well I already have Anaconda
39

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,850
installed but suffice it to say it's really easy.
40

41
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,230
It's really straightforward.
41

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,400
You don't need to pay.
42

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,250
You don't need to register or sign up or give your email address.
43

44
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,690
Essentially you just click through a couple of windows and you keep clicking Okay and install. Once Anaconda
44

45
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:17,130
is installed on your computer, you can access it by for example going to the start menu and searching
45

46
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,800
for Anaconda navigator.
46

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,140
There's going to be a bunch of different things related to Anaconda or that have Anaconda in the name.
47

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:32,010
You want the anaconda navigator. And you can look out for this little icon this this green circle broken
48

49
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,460
thing I'm not really sure what this icon is supposed to be.
49

50
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:41,490
But anyway it looks pretty nifty and of course you can also make a shortcut to this navigator on your
50

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,870
desktop or whatever you find most convenient.
51

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,760
So that is going to load the anaconda package.
52

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,480
You will initially get to this screen here, this window. The Anaconda navigator. So Anaconda basically provides
53

54
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:05,010
a bunch of different platforms for you to use Python or r or other languages and there's different ways
54

55
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,090
of using anaconda navigator. It's actually quite a lot that you can do with this.
55

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,370
That said, you don't need to worry about any fancy things, you don't need to worry about changing any
56

57
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:14,910
settings.
57

58
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:22,750
It's very simple: you just look for this Jupiter notebook option here and then you click on launch. That
58

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,500
will open up a new tab in your web browser.
59

60
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:33,040
So notice that the Jupyter IPython notebook is going to run inside whatever is your web browser of
60

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,180
choice.
61

62
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,910
Now when you first open it it's going to show you the folders and files that you have on your computer.
62

63
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,910
So what you want to do is click through here and basically find where you have downloaded the files
63

64
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:55,340
for this course. The first lecture of every section in this course contains a zip file that you download
64

65
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,880
and that contains a bunch of files and mostly what you're looking for is this Ipython notebook file.
65

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,160
So this is gonna be called something whatever is the section of the course.
66

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,460
And then I P Y and B for I Python notebook.
67

68
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:17,510
Now you click on that file. That's going to open up a new tab over here and this is the file that contains
68

69
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,850
all of the code that corresponds to the code that I go through in the video.
69

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,390
Now I have discussed in the previous video on how to get the most out of this course how to succeed
70

71
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,700
in this course that I actually don't recommend just going through and you know just kind of running
71

72
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,660
this code each cell at a time without really thinking about that much.
72

73
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,270
Of course I recommend writing code in a fresh notebook as you follow along with me.
73

74
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:52,940
So to get a fresh notebook you can go over here click on new Python 3 notebook again make sure you click
74

75
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,890
on python 3 in case you have older versions of python also installed.
75

76
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:04,390
So a new Python 3 notebook and that's going to open up a fresh notebook for you.
76

77
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:13,300
So I'm going to... you can click on untitled1 here and rename this to you know my favorite notebook.
77

78
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,690
Okay maybe that's not such a great name but you know you get the idea.
78

79
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:24,040
So in this video I showed you how to download and install the anaconda package which will allow you
79

80
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,020
to use the Jupyter IPython notebook to follow along with this course.
80

81
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,620
This is the way that I recommend following along.
81

82
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:37,000
I think it's the easiest and most convenient way to participate in this course.
82

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,880
That said if you prefer not to do a local installation or if you're unable to do a local installation
83

84
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,750
then stay tuned -- in the next video, I'm going to show you how to do everything online without any local
84

85
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,650
installations.
