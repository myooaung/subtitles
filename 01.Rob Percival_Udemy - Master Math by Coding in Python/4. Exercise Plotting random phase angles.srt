00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:12,470
This video is an exercise and it follows up on a previous couple of videos about generating random numbers.

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:20,100
So what you want to do in this video is come up with a plot of unit vectors so vectors with the length

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,360
of one that have random phase angles.

4
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,190
Now you already know several different ways of coming up with random numbers.

5
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:36,210
So a couple of different distributions and ways of stretching and shifting those distributions so I'm

6
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,580
not going to tell you exactly which parameters to use but you can figure that out.

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,590
I think there are some sets of distributions that are more sensible for generating vectors and a unit

8
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,740
circle with random phase angles and other vectors that are not so sensible.

9
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:03,630
So it's a bit open ended so you can pause the video switch to Python and write some code and when you're

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,850
finished writing your code then come back and you can see what I have to say about this problem.

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,730
So let's start by generating some random numbers.

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,870
I would call this variable NGS for angles not to be confused with angst which is a quality that teenagers

13
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,980
tend to have.

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:29,570
So let's say num Pi at random and let's start with normally distributed random numbers.

15
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:35,280
I will generate 100 of them and then to plot them I'm going to put this in a loop or I'm going to loop

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,200
through all of these angles and let's see it.

17
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:47,220
Each iteration of this loop but we want to do is generate a vector in the unit circle and I talked about

18
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,910
this in the section on algebra 2.

19
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:59,320
So the x component goes from 0 to the cosine component of the angle which is now variable.

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:11,040
I in this for loop and the y axis change goes from 0 to the sine component of the angle and I'm not

21
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,190
going to specify a color actually we'll let Python pick some random pretty colors for this plot.

22
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,580
All right.

23
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,130
So then we want to excel.

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,030
Let's see how it looks like this.

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,450
Okay so I'm kind of have a few things to say about these angles in a moment but first I want to make

26
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,970
this plot look a little bit nicer.

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,540
So let's say we should make the axis square for one thing.

28
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:36,930
Let's see.

29
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,220
Okay.

30
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,720
That looks a bit better.

31
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,250
And then I'm going to define the ranges.

32
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,910
Actually no I think I'll just turn this axis off.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,650
Let's say whoops not f f but o f f all right.

34
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,560
Actually you know I do want to set the Axis explicitly so I will write that the axis should go from

35
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,700
minus one to plus 1 and minus one to plus one.

36
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,570
Oh right.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:11,340
So now you can see the circle clearly you can see all these unit vectors with random angles.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,940
Now why are there so few angles over here and more angles over here.

39
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,150
Maybe that's just how these happened to be randomly drawn.

40
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,080
So I'll run this again a few times and you can see that it's basically always the same we always get

41
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,620
not zero vectors there are some vectors pointing off to the left but relatively few and it seems like

42
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,070
there's more clustering around here and now the reason why that's happening is because this is a normal

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,180
distribution that I'm drawing from so that means that most of these angles are close to zero and zero

44
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,740
for an angle is pointing over here and these values are vectors with angles over here pointing off to

45
00:03:52,740 --> 00:04:02,010
the left are going to have angle values close to PI so close to around 3 and you will recall from a

46
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:09,120
few videos where I talked about normal distributions that values around 3 are relatively unlikely.

47
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:17,760
Okay so that means that I would argue that a normal distribution of random numbers is not really.

48
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:25,080
Well it's not wrong but it's not really the most appropriate distribution to draw from for random phase

49
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,240
angles like this random angles for these vectors.

50
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:35,520
So therefore let's just get rid of this in here and make this uniformly distributed numbers all right.

51
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,570
And now it looks kind of funny.

52
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,790
Actually I wouldn't say funny.

53
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,870
This looks like a fan.

54
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,990
It looks like a beautiful colorful fan.

55
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:49,470
Again this isn't really wrong because I didn't give you any instructions for what the right answer should

56
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,140
be.

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,580
However I think you can also agree with me that this is probably not the most appropriate distribution

58
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,450
for phase angles on the unit circle.

59
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,520
So what is a better distribution.

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:10,860
Well I think a better distribution will cover the entire range cover the entire circle basically randomly

61
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,510
and uniformly.

62
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:20,580
So therefore what we need to do is convert this distribution from a range of zero to one to a range

63
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:27,800
of zero to two pi and two pi is sensible because that's going to go all the way around the circle.

64
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,390
So what I'm going to do is multiply this by two times.

65
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Now I'm pie the pie.

66
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,010
And now we get vectors that are in theory uniformly distributed all around the circle of course you

67
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,980
can see there's a gap over here and there's some higher concentration of vectors over here.

68
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:54,660
But that's really just because of the random features of generating this distribution here.

69
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,880
So you can run it again and you can see that these little gaps will appear in different places.

70
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:05,790
And if you run more vectors if you select more vectors from this uniform distribution then that's going

71
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,310
to fill out this circle even more fully.

72
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:16,140
Now I am specifying these angles here in terms of radians but it's possible that you are more comfortable

73
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,350
working with angles in degrees.

74
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,380
So if you want to know how to convert between radians and degrees then keep watching because that is

75
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,080
the entire purpose of the next video.
