00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.790
This is a really exciting video.
1

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.860
I mean, all the videos in this course are exciting, but this one is particularly nice because you are
2

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.820
going to learn how to print out statements in python using some nicer formatting than what the default
3

4
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.910
printing formatting is.
4

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.400
This will also be a gentle introduction to something called latex and latex coding.
5

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.090
If you haven't heard of latex before then basically it's a way to use computers to get nice looking
6

7
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.190
mathematical equations to print out the way that you would write them out on a board with a piece
7

8
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.520
of chalk.
8

9
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.960
All right.
9

10
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.330
So now let's switch to Python and get started.
10

11
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.030
The first thing we need to do is import some special functions from what's called a module. Modules in
11

12
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.720
Python
12

13
00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.230
are collections of code that are not bundled in with the default Python environment.
13

14
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:11.420
So I'm going to type from and then IPython dot display import display now with lowercase and math
14

15
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.280
with uppercase.
15

16
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.760
OK so there is a module called IPython.
16

17
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.980
This will work if you were using an IPython interface such as Jupyter.
17

18
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.090
And from this module and in particular the display part of this module we are going to import to particular
18

19
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.710
functions.
19

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.860
One is called display and one is called math.
20

21
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.690
Now this syntax here might look a little bit strange but you will get used to this as you go throughout
21

22
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.990
the course you're going to learn about importing from numpy, importing from scipy, and so on.
22

23
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.560
So for now you can just write this.
23

24
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.520
And now what I'm going to do is use the function that I just imported here called display so I write
24

25
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.510
display with parentheses and inside the parentheses I'm going to write a string.
25

26
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.430
I'm going to say four plus three equals seven and then I'm going to evaluate all the code in this cell
26

27
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.340
by pressing control enter and you can see that in this case display actually just wrote out literally
27

28
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.120
exactly what I put into the function.
28

29
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.850
So what I wrote in between the parentheses including these single quotes here.
29

30
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.070
So far this isn't really great.
30

31
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.740
And you might be a little bit disappointed but don't worry it's going to get much better.
31

32
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.020
OK.
32

33
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.570
For one thing I'm going to show you that inside this display function you can use a mix of inputs.
33

34
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.780
So I wrote equals seven here because I'm really smart and I know that four plus three equals seven.
34

35
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.130
But let's say I was not so smart or maybe I was really smart in other areas but not so good with arithmetic.
35

36
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.870
And that's why I'm using Python. So I can say four plus three equals.
36

37
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.780
And now I don't know what the answer is but I trust that Python knows what the answer is.
37

38
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm going to write four plus three like this.
38

39
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.630
Now what I hope is going to happen is that python will evaluate four plus three make that a seven and
39

40
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.280
write out a line that looks just like this four plus three equals seven.
40

41
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.240
But when I run this cell of code unfortunately I get an error and the error is that this is invalid
41

42
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.940
syntax and you can see the little carat symbol here showing me that the error starts basically right
42

43
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.000
here at the four.
43

44
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.350
So the issue here is that this is a string. These are strings and this is a number.
44

45
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.250
So I need to convert this number into strings in order to display this.
45

46
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:49.490
So I'm going to write str. This is another function and str is going to convert the number inside the
46

47
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.070
parentheses into a string, which is something like this.
47

48
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.320
OK.
48

49
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.420
So now let's try this again.
49

50
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.920
Whoops.
50

51
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.270
And we still get an error.
51

52
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.250
Now this is actually the same error.
52

53
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.870
It says invalid syntax.
53

54
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.190
So here is one of these cases where the error message is not necessarily so informative. But lucky for
54

55
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.800
you I know exactly what's wrong with this line of code and what's wrong with this line of code is we
55

56
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.750
need to tell Python to concatenate this string with this string and the way that that's done is by using
56

57
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.310
the plus sign.
57

58
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.410
And now let's try it again.
58

59
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.930
So I press control enter and then I got four plus three equals and now I didn't actually write out the
59

60
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.570
seven that you see here.
60

61
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:41.990
This seven comes from this seven, this seven down here comes from saying plus which means add to this
61

62
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.860
string this string which is the result of four plus three.
62

63
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.750
Now I've mentioned in a previous video the concept of overloading, this term overloading, and as a quick
63

64
00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.040
reminder, overloading in code means that a particular operation or character is used in multiple ways
64

65
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.800
depending on the context. So here I'm using a plus sign to indicate addition.
65

66
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.320
So four plus three and here I'm using a plus sign to indicate concatenation.
66

67
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.060
In other words putting this string at the end of this string.
67

68
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.730
Now that may seem a little bit confusing but this is something that will quickly become familiar to
68

69
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.280
you.
69

70
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.080
OK.
70

71
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.970
Now I promised you that I'm going to help you make equations that look really nice.
71

72
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.320
So let's start by doing that so I'm going to say display instead of just writing four plus three equals
72

73
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.320
seven.
73

74
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.490
I'm going to use this math function and I'm going to embed the math function into the display function.
74

75
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:51.670
So that's going to look like this: display and then math and then with another set of parentheses so
75

76
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:59.020
we take this string here four plus three equals seven and embedded into or as the input into the math
76

77
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:06.640
function --that's math with a capital M -- and then this math function is the input into the display function.
77

78
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.170
And now let's see what that looks like.
78

79
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.540
OK.
79

80
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.220
So this is starting to look a little bit nicer.
80

81
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.840
There is no more single quotes here and the numbers look a little bit different from how they look up
81

82
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.270
here.
82

83
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.630
OK.
83

84
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.810
So things are getting a little bit better.
84

85
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.410
What I want to show you now is integrating the variables that you learned about in a previous video
85

86
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.000
with this nicer formatting that you're learning about here.
86

87
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.890
So I'm going to say x equals four and Y equals... how about five.
87

88
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.980
Now what I would like to do is print out something that looks like this except it's going to say X plus
88

89
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.400
Y equals whatever X plus Y equals in this case is going to be nine.
89

90
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.510
But I don't actually want to write out the letter X. I want to write out the number x that this variable
90

91
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.890
refers to.
91

92
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.350
So let's start by writing display and then math.
92

93
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.070
And now let's just see what happens when I write X plus Y equals.
93

94
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.060
Well it's just gonna be x plus y.
94

95
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.320
Okay.
95

96
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.140
So here we already get an error and the error says that keyword can't be an expression.
96

97
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:17.770
So again this is not a super helpful error message but I've already told you that we need to be using
97

98
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.400
strings inside the display and the math function.
98

99
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.840
So that can be a little bit helpful already.
99

100
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.900
So let's see what would happen if I put all of this inside the string function.
100

101
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.600
So something like this.
101

102
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:31.920
OK.
102

103
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.580
So now we still get an error, and you know what?
103

104
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.210
Maybe this is a little bit complicated so maybe we should try starting a little bit simpler and then
104

105
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.200
make things more complicated as we go along.
105

106
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:49.600
So I'm just going to put String x inside the math function which is inside the display function.
106

107
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.630
And now we get the number four.
107

108
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.060
So that's pretty neat.
108

109
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:59.470
X got evaluated to four and then that was converted into a string and then that went into the math and
109

110
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.120
display functions.
110

111
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.280
And by the way just in case you think I don't know what I'm doing here, I actually do know what I'm doing.
111

112
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.130
I'm trying to illustrate to you one way of learning how to code, which is basically just by testing out
112

113
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.890
a lot of different things until you get it right.
113

114
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.170
OK.
114

115
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.570
So that got me X and now I want to say plus y.
115

116
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:24.890
So I'm going to say plus string y and then control enter and ha.
116

117
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:30.420
This gives me the number forty five but is this really the number forty five.
117

118
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.230
Actually this is the string four and then concatenated with the string five.
118

119
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.230
So this is the number four five without a space in between the two.
119

120
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.840
So what we need to do here is mix up some strings.
120

121
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:49.960
I'm going to write plus and then another plus sign here.
121

122
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.440
So these are the plus signs for concatenating strings.
122

123
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.760
This is a plus sign inside the single quote.
123

124
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.300
So this is making the string of a plus sign.
124

125
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.870
All right.
125

126
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.840
Now we are getting somewhere.
126

127
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.320
In fact I believe that you can figure out the rest of this on your own.
127

128
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:12.250
So I encourage you to pause the video and figure out how to make this piece of code say four plus five
128

129
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.870
equals nine.
129

130
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.720
So I hope you paused the video and figured out how to solve this.
130

131
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.780
We can write another plus sign for string concatenation equals another plus sign.
131

132
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.320
And now we say String x plus y.
132

133
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.560
All right.
133

134
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.800
So this gives us four plus five equals nine. At this point,
134

135
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.670
if you are looking at this line of code and thinking that it looks really long and really complicated
135

136
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.440
and there must be a better way to do this, then you are absolutely right!
136

137
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.030
There actually is a better way to do this and I'm going to show that to you now.
137

138
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.630
So I'm just going to copy this and paste it down here again.
138

139
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.600
Now I'm going to write a little bit of code and it's going to look weird at first but I'm going to explain
139

140
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.140
exactly what I'm doing as soon as I finish writing this code.
140

141
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:10.380
So I'm going to say % G plus percent G equals percent G.
141

142
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.640
So this is a rather strange looking line of code.
142

143
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:23.550
So what's going to happen here is I'm going to substitute this % G here here and here for three different
143

144
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.210
variables.
144

145
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:32.550
And the way that that gets done is another percent sign and then parentheses here, and then I say X comma
145

146
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.280
Y comma x plus y.
146

147
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.630
Now notice that I don't need to explicitly write down strings, that's handled here.
147

148
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:46.530
And what Python is going to do is print out this %G and it's going to look over here after the end
148

149
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.790
of this single quote.
149

150
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:54.990
Here with this percent here it's gonna look for the first number or variable and substitute here with
150

151
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.990
what I have here.
151

152
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:02.290
And then so on for the second goes for the second and the third goes with the third object here.
152

153
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:08.160
So again we get the same output but the code is more compact and it's a little bit easier to read as
153

154
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.690
soon as you get used to this funky letters with a percent G.
154

155
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:19.380
So that is a brief introduction to using display and math in the IPython or Jupyter environment to
155

156
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.590
print out equations.
156

157
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.610
If this still seems a little bit confusing then don't worry you're going to get a lot more practice
157

158
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.450
throughout this course.
158

159
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:35.310
What I want to do now is give you a quick introduction to latex coding and I'm going to motivate this
159

160
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.320
by writing display math and then let's say I want a fraction.
160

161
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.090
So let's say I want to print out four divided by five equals point eight.
161

162
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.460
Now based on what I already taught you up here you can write this out like this four divided by five
162

163
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.130
equals point eight.
163

164
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.690
And this is kind of OK.
164

165
00:11:53.690 --> 00:12:00.840
However if you're going to write out the fraction four divided by five four over five with a pencil
165

166
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.480
on a piece of paper you're not going to write it like this.
166

167
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.560
You're going to put the four on top and then a horizontal line and then the five on the bottom.
167

168
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.490
So how can we do that?
168

169
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.220
Well just using these strings like this,
169

170
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.690
that's not possible.
170

171
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:22.530
Instead, we are going to use latex coding to create something that looks just like what a fraction should
171

172
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.910
look like.
172

173
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.040
So let's say display math.
173

174
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:35.070
So far this part is the same, but now I'm going to type backslash backslash frac and then with curly
174

175
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.050
brackets four and then more curly brackets 5.
175

176
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.240
So again it's two back slashes.
176

177
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.980
This is not the same slash operator as the division.
177

178
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.280
This is sometimes called the Escape character.
178

179
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.750
You need backslash backslash frac is short for a fraction of course.
179

180
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.960
And then we need two sets of curly brackets.
180

181
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.100
These are not parentheses; these are the funny looking curly brackets.
181

182
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:05.990
So the first curly bracket corresponds to the numerator and the second corresponds to the denominator.
182

183
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:06.780
Okay.
183

184
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:12.690
So you can see now this looks like the kind of fraction you would expect to see and then I'll write equals
184

185
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.350
point eight.
185

186
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:21.630
So this right here this is called latex coding and it gives this really beautiful math formatting.
186

187
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.720
There is a lot that you can do with latex coding in combination with the display and math functions
187

188
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.860
For right now,
188

189
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:34.710
I want to show you one more latex code and then I think that was enough for this video.
189

190
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:41.490
We'll go to some exercises and you will learn more about displaying and latex coding in later videos.
190

191
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.570
OK.
191

192
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:50.940
So let's say we have X equals three point four and Y equals... I don't know 17... today feels like a 17.
192

193
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.560
Now what I want to do is print out X times Y.
193

194
00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:00.250
In other words, three point four times seventeen and then see the result of that answer.
194

195
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.650
Now I don't actually know what three point four times 17 is.
195

196
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.980
So I'm not going to be able to write out the answer explicitly just like this.
196

197
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.150
Instead I'm going to have to ask Python to compute it for me.
197

198
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:18.400
That said I can guess it's going to be somewhere around 60 maybe a little bit less than 60 because this
198

199
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.550
is a little bit more than three and this is a little bit less than 20.
199

200
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.770
So three times 20 is 60.
200

201
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.450
So I guess this answer is going to be somewhere in the ballpark of 60.
201

202
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:32.200
Okay so display math.
202

203
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.860
I'm going to use this approach to formatting mixed with latex coding that I introduce you to here.
203

204
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.070
So let's say percent G.
204

205
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.640
And that's gonna be for the X.
205

206
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.880
And now I want a times. We could draw a  times with an X like this but to make it look nicer,
206

207
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.320
I'm going to use latex coding and I'm gonna say slash slash times.
207

208
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.980
Percent G equals percent G.
208

209
00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:04.160
So we need 3 percent Gs as substitutes as placeholders for three numbers.
209

210
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:10.630
And those are X and then Y and then X times Y.
210

211
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.190
Now I press control enter and we see this looks really nice.
211

212
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.400
Three point four times seventeen equals fifty seven point eight.
212

213
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.660
So I was actually pretty close.
213

214
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.220
I guessed it was gonna be somewhere around 60.
214

215
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.480
So you can see this is the multiplication sign that's different from the letter X.
215

216
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:34.300
If I would put an X in here this looks like a italicized capital X. It doesn't look like the multiplication
216

217
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:40.400
sign. So here are the two exercises for this video.
217

218
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:46.520
Now I have to warn you these exercises are a little bit more challenging compared to the exercises you've
218

219
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.250
seen in the previous few videos but I think it's worth the effort.
219

220
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.560
And when you solve these exercises successfully I think you're going to have a really great warm fuzzy
220

221
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.980
feeling of satisfaction.
221

222
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.370
So here I'm listing two equations with three variables each.
222

223
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:10.700
And what you want to do is implement these equations in Python and make sure they print out with nice
223

224
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:16.700
formatting. And you want to do this twice for each equation -- once just print them out looking like this.
224

225
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.160
Don't worry about the colors.
225

226
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:24.830
And then a second time replacing the variables with the actual numbers so you can see what it's going
226

227
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:31.370
to look like here when you successfully complete this challenge, this exercise. Your python output will
227

228
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.060
look like this.
228

229
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.230
We'll say three X times four plus Y equals 42.
229

230
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.490
That's just writing out what I've done here except for the colors.
230

231
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:45.740
And here is the same equation except I'm replacing all the variables with the actual numbers.
231

232
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:46.090
Okay.
232

233
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:52.250
And then the same thing for number two; here I'm just printing out exactly what you see here. And here
233

234
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.350
I'm replacing the variables with the corresponding numbers that you see here.
234

235
00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:57.710
All right.
235

236
00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.850
So pause the video.
236

237
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:59.980
Take a deep breath.
237

238
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.210
Work your way through this code challenge and when you figure it out then you can come back to the video
238

239
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.340
and now I'm going to switch to Python and you can watch me solve it.
239

240
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.550
The first thing I'm going to do is create these variables.
240

241
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:22.360
So we had X equals seven Y equals minus two and z equals five so far.
241

242
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.450
Pretty easy.
242

243
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:30.820
So now let's work through the first problem. What I'm going to do actually is first create a variable
243

244
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.430
that is the outcome of that equation.
244

245
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:41.080
So that equation was three times x times and then in parentheses four plus y.
245

246
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.650
Now I can just write it out like this.
246

247
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.360
That confirms that the answer is 42.
247

248
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:52.040
That's good because that's what was in the slide but I'm going to set this equal to a variable and I'll
248

249
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.120
call it a n s, for answer, short for answer.
249

250
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.440
So I have a variable that corresponds to the answer.
250

251
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:06.800
Now remember the first output we want to create is the display just of the function itself.
251

252
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:13.520
So this is going to be three X times four plus Y equals.
252

253
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.880
And I know the answer is 42.
253

254
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:23.960
However I'm going write percent G and then here I'm going to say percent ans, now previously I use parentheses
254

255
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.330
here.
255

256
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.940
The parentheses are necessary after this percent sign
256

257
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:33.820
If you have multiple variables to print out, in this case we have only one variable to print out.
257

258
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:38.580
So the parentheses is not necessary.
258

259
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.310
So that looks pretty nice.
259

260
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.500
And now I need to repeat this,
260

261
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:47.890
replacing the letters X and Y with the variables for X and Y.
261

262
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:57.080
I'm going to start by copying and pasting this in here and now I can say % G for the X and then percent
262

263
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.380
G for the Y.
263

264
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.730
And then we have %g here for the answer.
264

265
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:09.200
So now I need to say that the first %G gets replaced with X. The second %G gets replaced
265

266
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.080
with Y.
266

267
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.430
And then we have our answer.
267

268
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.810
The outcome of the equation.
268

269
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:22.280
Now this is not exactly accurate because it looks like this says thirty seven times four plus minus
269

270
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:22.590
two.
270

271
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.380
But in fact it's three times seven because it was three times x.
271

272
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:35.990
So I'm going to include a slash slash times in here and now this looks better.
272

273
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:41.460
Now maybe you think that this still looks a little bit awkward to say four plus negative two.
273

274
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:47.810
If you don't like that then you can just delete the plus sign here and you get four minus two.
274

275
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.200
All right.
275

276
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.860
Very good.
276

277
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.200
So that was the first equation.
277

278
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:57.290
I'm going to make a new cell for the second equation, just to keep things a little bit separate. Otherwise,
278

279
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.530
I'm going to follow basically the same formatting that I had up here.
279

280
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.590
So first I'm going to actually create the answer.
280

281
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:11.180
So the answer was -- notice I'm replacing the value of ans, so I'm reassigning ans to be whatever is the
281

282
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.430
new equation -- that's going to overwrite this value of ans.
282

283
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:24.290
So from the slides that was minus Y minus and then we had the fraction and that was x plus three divided
283

284
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.880
by Z.
284

285
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.290
Okay.
285

286
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.840
And now I would like to confirm that it is zero, which is the answer given in the slides.
286

287
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.180
Okay.
287

288
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.900
So let's say display and then math in the equation.
288

289
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:46.120
So I'm going to actually copy and paste that item here in single quotes.
289

290
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:51.980
Now that kind of works except I don't really like this formatting. I would like this to be a nice fraction
290

291
00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.850
the way that four fifths was a nice fraction up here.
291

292
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.620
So therefore I'm going to use slash slash frac.
292

293
00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:09.300
And then in curly brackets the numerator and then the second curly brackets corresponds to the denominator.
293

294
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.540
And this looks really nice.
294

295
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:18.810
Now I'm going to say equals percent G and then percent a..
295

296
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.400
Great.
296

297
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.970
This looks really professional, very clean.
297

298
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.750
Now I want to do this once more.
298

299
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:32.480
But replacing X Y and Z with the numbers that these variables are set to.
299

300
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:38.690
So I'm going to start by copying and pasting this line and then same trick that I showed you before.
300

301
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:46.330
So % G instead of the Y percent G instead of the X Percent G instead of the Z.
301

302
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.340
And then we have a percent G here.
302

303
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:53.960
Now this is where it's gonna get a little bit confusing because you might initially think of saying
303

304
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.970
X Y Z but the thing is, Python is going to go by order,
304

305
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:05.940
so if I write X here as the first term python will replace this place holder here with X..
305

306
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:13.820
But in fact this first place holder here was y so I need to say y and then the second one was X. So
306

307
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:18.430
this corresponds to X and then the third one was Z.
307

308
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.210
So that's correct.
308

309
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.560
And then the answer, so
309

310
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.090
that's also correct.
310

311
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.420
All right.
311

312
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:27.730
So we have a lot of minus signs floating around in here. It gets a little bit confusing but we can work
312

313
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:28.360
our way through this.
313

314
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.880
So this is minus minus two.
314

315
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.860
So this ends up being plus two.
315

316
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:37.920
And then we have minus seven plus three is ten divided by five is two.
316

317
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.910
So we get plus two because the minus signs cancel out minus two equals zero.
317

318
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.400
So that works. Very good job on this video.
318

319
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:54.930
If you are new to Python then I hope you found this video a little bit challenging but also a little
319

320
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.010
bit exciting.
320

321
00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:03.360
You learned how to make equations look really nice using a combination of a particular IPython module
321

322
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.110
and a little bit of latex coding and you are already starting to see, even this early in the course,
322

323
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:17.820
how Python can be a really powerful tool for learning mathematics and also for visualizing the formulas
323

324
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:18.960
that you are implementing.
