1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,720
The previous video was all about summing up things and multiplying things and so therefore I thought

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,050
it would be useful to have a video about subtracting things about computing differences.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,900
So I'm going to tell you in this video about the discrete difference operator which is also sometimes

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,970
called the discrete derivative.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,320
And if you haven't yet taken a calculus course or encountered concepts in calculus then this is an important

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,390
lecture because the discrete difference operator is like a gentle introduction into something called

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,500
a derivative which is one of the most important topics in calculus.

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,890
So what is the discrete difference operator.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,940
It's actually a pretty simple concept despite the kind of confusing long sounding name.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,160
So it really just means that you take your time series.

11
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,940
So the difference operator is generally applied to a time series or it can also be applied to images.

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,500
But in this case we are just considering one dimensional vectors of numbers.

13
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,780
So your data time series X at T plus 1 minus the data time series at the current time point T.

14
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:23,670
And that is the value at the difference vector Y so y of T equals x of T plus 1 minus T.

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,400
So you can see that at each time point really all you're doing is subtracting the following value from

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,730
the current value.

17
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,610
It's really that simple.

18
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,620
So let's switch to Python and I'll show you how to implement this.

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,580
Well for starters we can actually just write two minus one.

20
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:49,620
Obviously that's computing the difference but if we have a vector so a list of numbers that is 1 2 then

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,100
what we want to do is say 2 minus 1.

22
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,530
Now I could write this out I could hard code this set this to be a variable let's call this maybe I

23
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,000
guess I'll call it X because that's what I call it in the slides.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,980
Now you could write x 1 minus x 0 and that's going to give you the right answer here.

25
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,390
But what do you do if you want you know let's say you want this to be for well you know you could add

26
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,070
another term under here but eventually this is not really a scalable approach.

27
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,080
What we need is a function that will compute these differences for us.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:35,100
And fortunately such a function exists it's in the NUM pi module so let's say import num pi as N P and

29
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:45,020
then I can write no pi dot def and then I will input x and the output in this case let me rerun this

30
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,290
code.

31
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,950
So now I've redefined X to be this three element vector.

32
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,470
So now the DIF of this vector is 1 2 now.

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:01,580
Okay in this case the output is a little bit confusing because it could be interpreted that this function

34
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,190
is just getting the first two points let me change this.

35
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:12,000
How about let's make this 1 3 and then yeah I guess 4 is also okay then I'll get rid of this.

36
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,150
OK.

37
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:21,050
So now the output of num PI that diff is 2 1 and this is interpreted as the difference of the first

38
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:29,990
element here is this number three minus this number which is 2 and then the second element here is the

39
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,350
third element minus the second element which is of course 1 for minus 3.

40
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,260
And you could go on this could be these could be negative numbers.

41
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:46,030
So if I were to write 4 minus 4 here then the third element here is going to be minus 8.

42
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:53,240
And that's because at the third element here in this output of the diff operator the dysfunction we

43
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,790
take the fourth element and subtract that from the third element.

44
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,470
So minus four minus plus four gives us a total of minus eight.

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,390
Okay.

46
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,420
So now there's something else I would like to try.

47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:15,770
I'm going to come up with a range of numbers a num pi range of numbers that go from zero and they end

48
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,240
at 10.

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,740
Well I want the numbers to go up to 10.

50
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,050
So in fact this is not going to be exactly correct.

51
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:32,090
This function NPD that a range is going to print out integers because I'm providing two inputs so integers

52
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:38,240
between including the first input and up to but excluding the second input.

53
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,660
So if you actually want the numbers to go up to 10 you can see that you have to write the number eleven

54
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,570
here.

55
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:54,980
Okay so what do you predict is going to be the output of print num PI that diff of V What do you think

56
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,030
is going to be the result of this line here.

57
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:05,030
Well it's going to be a bunch of ones and that's because well 1 minus 0 is one basically.

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,500
Yeah.

59
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,030
These are in counting integers.

60
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,240
So the difference ends up being 1.

61
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:19,310
Now there's another optional input into the DIF function and so I'm going to write that as two and now

62
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm going to press shift tab on the keyboard to look at the the little help file or the doc string that

63
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,620
corresponds to diff.

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,220
So a and then the default for the second input is 1 and the first line of the help file says calculate

65
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,650
the end discrete difference along that given access.

66
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,660
So that means that this is the first order difference that we compute by default here without specifying

67
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,510
anything.

68
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,900
And so this is going to be the second order discrete difference.

69
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,310
So what does that mean you probably guess or you might guess that that is going to give a bunch of twos

70
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,340
because if you think about the second order derivative then that's like you know two minus zero and

71
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,340
three minus one and so on.

72
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,340
But let's see what this actually returns Mm hmm.

73
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,120
It returns all zeros.

74
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,970
Why is that the case.

75
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,100
Well it's actually the case because what the second order derivative or difference really means is not

76
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,980
to go in steps of two here but instead take the difference of the difference.

77
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,190
So the first difference of the first order discrete derivative is all ones.

78
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,440
But then when we take the second order it's actually taking the difference of the ones and obviously

79
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,570
these guys don't differ from each other.

80
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,700
So the output is zero.

81
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:48,210
Now this line of code here is literally exactly equivalent to saying n p that def of n pitot diff V.

82
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:56,130
So we're just taking the derivative of the discrete difference of this vector and inputting that into

83
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,150
the diff function again.

84
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,200
So that's going to give us a row of zeros in this particular case.

85
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,790
Now there's also something interesting which I haven't explicitly discussed yet and that is that the

86
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:16,070
output of the DIF function is always going to be one number less than the original function.

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,320
So here we had four numbers four elements in this vector.

88
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,090
But here there's only three elements that get returned.

89
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,150
Now that actually does make sense because this is computing the difference at each point between you

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,760
know the next point and the current point.

91
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,310
And so when you're at the element four there actually isn't a plus one element.

92
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,600
So the algorithm has to stop here.

93
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,460
Okay.

94
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,840
So that's something to keep in mind for the exercise.

95
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,790
The exercise for this video is to implement this function.

96
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,690
So it's pretty simple function f of x equals X squared.

97
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,370
If you've already come across this function you'll know it looks a bit like a smiley face a kind of

98
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,020
it.

99
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,410
It starts off really high and then it comes down to zero and then it goes back up again.

100
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:11,540
So you want to implement this function in num pi and then generate a plot of this function.

101
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,280
And also of the discrete difference or the discrete derivative of this function.

102
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,460
And when you successfully complete this exercise you're going to generate a graph that looks something

103
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:23,880
like that.

104
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,770
So here you see the function this is f I call it F here.

105
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,600
But that's this F of X..

106
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,970
And then here I'm calling this D F this is for the derivative of F for the discrete difference of F

107
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,440
and that's this red line here.

108
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,860
All right.

109
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:46,260
So now is the chance to pause video switch to Python do some coding see if you can reproduce this slide

110
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,390
so I hope you were able to solve this problem.

111
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,430
I'm going to start by defining the x values for the x axis.

112
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:06,080
So let's say linearly space numbers between minus minus two and plus two and let's go in one hundred

113
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:12,050
and one steps because I don't know there was some old cartoon movie about 101 Dalmatians.

114
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,040
I think it was in the 80s.

115
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,050
Anyway let's see what X looks like.

116
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,670
So X is just a vector of numbers it's a name pi array.

117
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,260
It goes from minus two and you can see it's getting bigger and bigger.

118
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,720
It crosses through zero and eventually we get up to plus two.

119
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay.

120
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,880
So now let's define the variable F and that is X squared.

121
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,240
And then I'm going to call this D F and that is going to be known pi dot diff of f.

122
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,320
Remember this is the DIF of f not the diff of X all right.

123
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:54,990
And then we won a plot so I'm going to start by just plotting X by f just to make sure that this is

124
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,100
looking good so far.

125
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:03,030
Okay well we get an error and that's because I haven't yet imported the plotting routines.

126
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:10,210
So import mat plot lib dot pi plot as P L T.

127
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,130
Okay.

128
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,250
Now it should work.

129
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,780
All right.

130
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,520
This looks good.

131
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,170
This is what I expect for the function F equals X squared.

132
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,050
So you can kind of see when x is zero.

133
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,060
Then the function is going to be zero.

134
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,710
And as x gets larger gets further away from zero these numbers so value F on the y axis here is going

135
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,920
to get larger and larger and it's symmetric of course because you know minus two squared is the same

136
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,240
thing as plus two squared.

137
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,610
So the function looks the same on both sides of zero.

138
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,190
All right.

139
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,080
So that's the function itself.

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,550
Now we need to plot the derivative.

141
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,860
So that's X by DLF.

142
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,790
Mm hmm.

143
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,300
We get an error.

144
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,040
What is this.

145
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,770
This says X and Y must have the same first measure but the shapes are one hundred one and one hundred.

146
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:08,310
So this is the problem that I hinted at earlier before I switched back to tell you about the exercise.

147
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,540
So this variable here x this contains one hundred and one numbers but this contains only one hundred

148
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,350
numbers.

149
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:23,250
So what we need to do here is basically say that we want to plot not all of the vector x not the entire

150
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:30,720
vector X but we want to slice it from the first point until the pen ultimate point to the second to

151
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,960
last point.

152
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,360
Okay.

153
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,610
And then we get the right answer.

154
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,070
Let's see.

155
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,170
So that's basically the end I'm going to make this plot look a little bit nicer.

156
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,730
So let's put some labels in here I call this def and then in the slide I called this f and then I'm

157
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:57,300
going to let c put on a grid and activate the legend and then the last thing I want to do is zoom in

158
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,690
a little bit because you know most of this plot is dominated by all of this stuff here.

159
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,010
This is mostly empty space.

160
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,080
I want to zoom in a little bit to this area here.

161
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,160
So let's see.

162
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:16,770
I will write P L T dot axis and then set the x axis to go from minus two to plus two and the y axis.

163
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:23,990
Let's try minus one to plus two and maybe even I'll make this two plus 1.

164
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,690
Actually no.

165
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,890
Okay I changed my mind.

166
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,750
Plus 2 looks a little bit better.

167
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,760
Okay so this is the successful completion of the exercise.

168
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:38,850
I just want to take a moment to explain how to interpret this plot in particular how to interpret this

169
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,510
discrete difference because this is related to the derivative which as I mentioned is one of the most

170
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,760
important concepts in calculus.

171
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,280
Now the derivative plot of a function is a little bit tricky to interpret at first and what you notice

172
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,590
here is that the derivative is negative.

173
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,820
It's below zero and then here it's above zero.

174
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:08,250
And what that means is that here the when the derivative is negative the function is going downwards.

175
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,080
And that's because each subsequent point is lower than the previous.

176
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,620
So when you say you know this point minus this point you're gonna get a negative number.

177
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,110
This point minus this point you're gonna get a negative number.

178
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,270
So the derivative here is all negative.

179
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,690
Here the function is going up and so therefore you know this point minus this point is going to be positive.

180
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:35,110
This point minus this point is gonna be positive and so on.

181
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:41,400
So that explains the sign why this is the derivative here is negative and the derivative here is positive.

182
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,310
And then you can see that the derivative is larger negative and it's getting less negative here.

183
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,890
And that's also because the function is getting less steep.

184
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,420
So this point minus this point is a really big negative number.

185
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,860
But this point minus this point is still negative because the function is going down but the function

186
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,230
is going down by less.

187
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,370
Likewise here the function is just barely creeping up very slowly.

188
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,540
But the further out we get the faster the function is increasing and therefore the derivative is positive.

189
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:21,870
And it's getting larger so in this video I introduced you to the discrete difference operator.

190
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:28,750
And when you start learning about calculus you will see that this is kind of the same concept as a derivative.

191
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:35,230
The main difference between a derivative and a difference is that the derivative is differences that

192
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,240
are really really really really really tiny.

193
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:43,390
So super duper tiny and then you have then basically the difference operator turns into the derivative.
