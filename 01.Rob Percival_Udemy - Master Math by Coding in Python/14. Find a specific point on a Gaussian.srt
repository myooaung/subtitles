1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,390
In this video you are going to learn the formula for a Gaussian function.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,890
This is also sometimes called the bell curve or the normal curve.

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,030
If you are not already familiar with what a galaxy and looks like then you will soon learn.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,290
And I'm sure you've seen a function that looks like this before.

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,070
And then that's going to lead us into a discussion of how to find a particular point on a function.

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,830
That's pretty cool.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:37,020
We're gonna do a little bit of arithmetic a little bit of algebra and obviously you are going to see

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,130
how all of this stuff looks in Python code.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,520
So let's begin.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:50,400
Here is a crazy looking formula this says Y equals E and E Here is the natural exponential that you

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,900
learned about several videos ago and all of this complicated looking business.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,370
This is all sitting inside the exponent of E.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:08,300
So we have a fraction minus four times the natural log of two times T squared and t here is a vector.

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,390
So it's a list of time points you can imagine for example that this would be a time vector and then

15
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,750
in the denominator we have h squared.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,010
This is an important parameter of the gaussian and I will discuss in a few moments what this parameter

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,480
refers to.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,860
So this H is actually the denominator of the fraction that is all inside the exponent of E.

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,990
So it gets a little bit hard to look at.

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,400
So therefore mathematicians have come up with a solution for difficult looking equations like this.

21
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,170
And instead we write it like this.

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:51,160
So if you ever see e XP and then with parentheses like this this is not experience or experiential.

23
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,830
This is actually standing for exponent like the natural exponent.

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:04,070
So and then all of the math that is sitting inside the parentheses is what is actually in the exponent

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,840
so the power of the natural exponential.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,310
So these two are the same.

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,370
Now I just want to point out briefly that there are several different ways to mathematically express

28
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,560
a galleon.

29
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:23,070
So as you go through your adventures in mathematics and data science and engineering physics statistics

30
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:29,670
biology you see this galaxy and all over the place finance it's really everywhere you might come across

31
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,060
slightly different formulations of the gaussian but they always have the general form of E to the minus

32
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,690
something squared over something else squared.

33
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,400
Okay now you know this is just a bunch of letters and numbers.

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,530
The real understanding of math the real beauty and intuition of math comes from visualization.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,330
That's a point that I try to stress very often throughout this course.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,080
And obviously I'm going to stress it right now.

37
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,360
So this is what this formula looks like here we have the t axis over here.

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:10,020
So this plotting this variable t and this is the the Y variable so this is the galaxy in function here.

39
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,650
So this is called the Galaxy in curve or the Gaussian distribution or the bell curve or the normal curve.

40
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,730
It's given a bunch of different names.

41
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,020
Okay.

42
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:25,110
So now I want to talk a little bit about this H parameter here and what that means for this graph.

43
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,540
This parameter is sometimes called the width of the Gaussian or the shape parameter of the gaussian.

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,090
And it's sometimes referred to as the full width and half maximum.

45
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,530
I'm gonna write out that term for you in a moment but first I just want to explain what this term means

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,710
on the graph.

47
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:49,160
So if you look at this graph and you find the 50 percent mark between zero and the peak of this Gaussian.

48
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,670
Now this Gaussian peaks at 1 so 50 percent of the gain or halfway up means a value of Point 5.

49
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,410
So we draw a line or we think about a line that goes through the Gaussian function.

50
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:08,700
This y axis at point five and then we find what are the two points where this intersects the Gaussian

51
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,540
function.

52
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,670
So that's going to be these two points here and then we draw lines from these two points vertically

53
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:23,190
we just drop straight down to the time axis or the x axis space axis whatever this axis is.

54
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,000
And then you find what is this distance here from this point to this point.

55
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,840
So this distance here and in this case I'll let you guess what that parameter is here what that value

56
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,030
is here.

57
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,900
I'd say it's about 1 This looks like minus point 5 and this looks like plus point 5.

58
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:47,580
So this total distance is 1 and that is an important feature of the gaussian and it is called the full

59
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,440
width at half maximum.

60
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,940
So it's the width at half of the maximum between 0 and the peak or the maximum of the gaussian.

61
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,010
So this H parameter here corresponds to the full with that maximum.

62
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,560
And for this particular graph each would be equal to one approximately.

63
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,160
Okay.

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:15,330
Now what I want to do next is show you how to figure out what values of t correspond to any arbitrary

65
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,870
values of Y.

66
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:23,640
So for example if we set this equation to be one three say one equals E to the.

67
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,460
And then all of this business.

68
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,690
My question is what value of t satisfies this equation.

69
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,390
Where.

70
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,840
What do you set t to in order for this equation to be true.

71
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,700
Now if you'd like to pause the video and work through the algebra yourself then that's great.

72
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,770
Now is your opportunity to do that.

73
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,200
Okay.

74
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,540
So the key to getting started here.

75
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,920
Because it's a bit tricky we have the T squared inside the numerator of a fraction which is inside the

76
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,190
power of this exponential.

77
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,080
The key insight is to think back a few videos ago to where I discussed the relationship between the

78
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,290
natural logarithm and the natural exponential and you will remember that those two operations are inverse

79
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,590
of each other so they cancel each other out.

80
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,320
So therefore the way to get started here is to take the natural log of both sides of this equation.

81
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,680
So that looks something like this.

82
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,630
We have the natural log of 1 equals the natural log of the natural exponential of this term here.

83
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,860
Now the cool thing is that these two operations cancel each other out.

84
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:38,040
They just totally disappear and that gives us 0 and then it turns out that the natural log of 1 is equal

85
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
to zero.

86
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,210
So this simplifies to this expression here and now it turns out we don't even need to really do a lot

87
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,300
of arithmetic anymore.

88
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,680
And that's because we can basically just solve this equation pretty simply by taking advantage of the

89
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,450
fact that this is zero.

90
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,710
So for example multiply both sides of this equation by h squared.

91
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,600
That's still zero over here.

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,210
And then we divide both sides of the equation by minus four times the natural log of two still zero

93
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,170
on the left side.

94
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,130
And then we take the square root to isolate t and we take the square root of zero and actives on zero.

95
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,480
Okay.

96
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,560
So that was a lot of like you know algebra analytic solutions etc. But we could also have just figured

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,150
that out by looking at this plot you know you look at this and it's obvious that when the galaxy and

98
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,890
equals one we are exactly at the center.

99
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,380
And t equals zero which is what we get here.

100
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:38,430
So I wanted to start off with an easy example here but it's not always so trivial to figure out this

101
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,430
solution.

102
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:46,520
Let us for example consider the value of t when the function equals point five.

103
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:53,040
Now again if you'd like to pause the video and work through the algebra here then now's your opportunity

104
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,520
to do so.

105
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,910
So we start with the same trick.

106
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,740
We take the natural log of both sides of this equation and again we can cancel out these two or these

107
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,690
two terms cancel each other out.

108
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,080
So that gives us the natural log of point five equals the inside of the gaussian exponential over here

109
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,680
and then we just have to do a little bit of extra algebra to isolate T.

110
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:22,080
So here I'm doing actually two steps at once I multiply both sides of this equation by h squared and

111
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,290
then divide by minus four times the natural log of two and that gives us this solution and we're not

112
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,620
quite done because we actually want the value of t and this is giving us T squared so we need to take

113
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,860
the square root of both sides of the equation which looks like this of course you always have to consider

114
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,610
both the plus and the minus.

115
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,400
When you're computing the square root that's actually going to be pretty important.

116
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,290
When we switch to Python in a moment.

117
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,900
So there's a few simplifications we can do here.

118
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,430
The main one is pulling this H parameter outside of the square root.

119
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:04,860
So now we have the result that t equals plus or minus H times the square root of this stuff in here.

120
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:10,600
So this is the natural log of the value on the y axis that we are looking for divided by.

121
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,040
This is essentially just a scaling factor minus four times the natural log of two.

122
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,560
All right.

123
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,490
So this is a lot of you know like sort of pure math.

124
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:27,450
I'm sure you are super excited to see this stuff implemented in Python so let's switch to Python.

125
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,020
We will be using the NUM pi and mom and Pi plot modules here.

126
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:39,420
So it's already started by importing those and I'm going to just dive right in and start creating this

127
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,710
Gaussian so the galaxy and formula let's call that G.

128
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,010
I guess in the slides I call this y but here are called G.

129
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,130
So we have known pi dot e XP.

130
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:57,440
Now you can see why Python developers and also in matlab and many other numerical processing software

131
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,210
is why they call this e XP.

132
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,020
So it's to be similar to the mathematical notation I introduced you YouTube.

133
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:14,770
So we have the numerator was minus four times the natural log which is num paid out log of two times

134
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,480
t and then squared and then all that was divided by h squared.

135
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,550
Okay so now we need to define some of these variables here.

136
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:31,390
So we have t and I'm going to set that to be linear these space numbers from minus three two plus three

137
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,450
and let's go in one thousand and one steps so why am I doing one thousand and one.

138
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,490
Is it because I'm just sort of a quirky guy and I don't like even numbers like a thousand.

139
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,540
Well that is.

140
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,820
That's probably part of the answer but actually there's a good reason for doing that here.

141
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:55,240
And that's because if we want this function to have the exact number zero the exact center then we want

142
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:00,410
0 to be in this we want to have t equals zero to be in this vector.

143
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,470
And if we go from minus something to plus something in an even number of steps then we're not going

144
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,050
to have zero in the middle.

145
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,070
And if we have an odd number of steps we are definitely going to have zero in the middle.

146
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,680
Okay.

147
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,280
And then we need to define H.

148
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,020
So let's add h to be about point 9 9 9.

149
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,100
It seems like a good number.

150
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,510
All right.

151
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:27,220
So I'm gonna run this code so it doesn't output anything of course I haven't requested any output but

152
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,730
I just wanted to make sure that I haven't made any stupid little coding mistakes okay.

153
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,450
Now we want to plot.

154
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:45,900
So let's see we do a plot of T by G and then we'll set the Y or say the x axis label to B T.

155
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,710
And you know it's kind of arbitrary that I'm calling this t you could call it X you could call it s

156
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,960
anything you like.

157
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,690
I do a lot of signal processing and so I often think about these Gaussian as functions of time.

158
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,060
That's why I tend to use a variable T.

159
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:09,720
So then we want a y label and I'll call that y just to be consistent with what I showed in the slides.

160
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:18,280
And then let's say the title is The Gaussian with a full with half maximum equal to.

161
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,670
And now of course you know that there are many ways to setup printing here with a variable.

162
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm just going to use the possibly kind of clunky but relatively simple for small problems format of

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,550
saying plus and then string h.

164
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:33,800
Okay.

165
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,730
And then let's activate the show thing and then here we see our nice little calcium.

166
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,470
So now it's pretty interesting to play around with these different parameters so we can say what if

167
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,940
H equals something much smaller then we played it again.

168
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:55,270
In fact now it's impossible even to see that there is a galaxy and it looks like it's just a an impulse.

169
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,230
It looks like a delta function here all the way in the middle.

170
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,590
In fact we could zoom in.

171
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,900
Let's try zooming into like point three or minus point three to plus point three.

172
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,380
Oh wow.

173
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:05,680
Okay.

174
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,020
You can kind of start to see a little bit of this.

175
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,020
Let's do maybe a little bit more.

176
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,090
Okay.

177
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,740
Well I think you get the idea.

178
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:21,610
You can play around with this x axis range and with the full with the half maximum I'm gonna set this

179
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,820
back to what it was before and rerun that code.

180
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:34,960
Now what I want to do is show you how to find the x axis variable for this function given some function

181
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,090
value that we want to identify.

182
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,720
So what I'm really gonna do is implement the formula that I showed in the slides.

183
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,740
So let's start by picking the y value that we want to find.

184
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:55,180
I'm calling this variable Y Val to find that I'm using the number two as you know instead of the letters

185
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,480
two.

186
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,360
So let's consider this to be point five.

187
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,870
Let's say we want to find the value of t where y is closest to point five and we know that there's gonna

188
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,050
be two values there's gonna be one value on the left of the peak and one value on the right of the peak.

189
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:18,100
So now what I'm going to do is say t values equals and then I'm just gonna implement that formula that

190
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,160
I showed in the slides.

191
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:28,980
So that was h times the square root of the natural logarithm of Y vowed to find.

192
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:35,080
Divided by and then I'm going to use parentheses here to make sure that we are associating the minus

193
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,260
4 and the natural log of 2 all in the denominator.

194
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:40,570
Okay.

195
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,460
So again I will run this code just to make sure it didn't give any errors and then I'm gonna print this

196
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:52,180
out so let's print out t vowels and we had a value of point 4 9 9 5 and that's actually sensible it's

197
00:14:52,330 --> 00:15:00,010
almost point five and the H parameter was almost 1 and we saw visually in the slides that when h was

198
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:06,760
equal to 1 then the value at point 5 this was going from minus point five to plus point five.

199
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,100
Huh.

200
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,140
But now this seems kind of strange because we know from the slides and also just from math in general

201
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,460
that when you take the square root of something you should actually get two values you should get a

202
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,740
positive value and a negative value.

203
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,260
So why do we only get one result here.

204
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,050
Well let's look at the dock string the help file for num paid out square root.

205
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:35,620
So I put the cursor inside the square root function and on the keyboard I press shift tab and then let's

206
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,180
read this a little bit.

207
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,940
This says return the non negative square root.

208
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,500
Okay.

209
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,630
So that right there tells us what the situation is what the confusion is.

210
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:52,120
So this is only returning the positive square root is also sometimes called the principle square root.

211
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,390
So therefore I'm just going to manually specify that we're looking for a negative of the same value

212
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:58,780
as well.

213
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,380
So here we get our two solutions.

214
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,410
There is an exercise for this video is really cool you get to create a pretty cool looking image that

215
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,130
looks something like this but you have to wait until the next video.

216
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,270
So keep watching.
