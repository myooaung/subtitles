1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:12,260
This video contains the exercise that corresponds to the previous video on computing limits and simplify

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,960
and displaying them in Python.

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:21,350
So if you haven't already gone through with that video it would behoove you to watch that video first.

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:21,670
All right.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,610
So here are your exercises.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,140
Consider these two functions.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:35,650
So we say F of X equals E to the minus X times the square root of the quantity x plus 1 and G of X equals

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,450
the cosine of the quantity x plus the sign of x.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,720
So this exercise has two parts.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:50,290
The first part is to just implement these functions and make a plot of them.

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:58,030
Now I've implemented this by specifying these two functions first in simple way and then generating

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,410
new functions based on the simple function lambda Phi.

13
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,200
So I recommend you do that as well.

14
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,250
Okay.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,720
So that's part one of the exercise.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:16,090
Part two of the exercise is to show this interesting property of limits that the limit of one function

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:24,400
divided by the limit of another function is the same thing as so is equal to the limits of the function

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,280
divided by the other function.

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,040
I hope that makes sense.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,730
So here what you're doing is computing the limit of F of X as X tends towards 5 totally independently.

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,620
So when you're computing this limit you don't know anything about the function G and then you compute

22
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:49,090
this limit for function G and this happens totally independently of the limit for function X. Our f

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:56,230
excuse me and then you get a limit here and you get a limit here and you compute this division this

24
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,400
ratio here.

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,810
So that's one thing and then that's the left hand side of this equation the right hand side of this

26
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:10,450
equation is forget about computing limits first you just divide F of X by G of X and once you make that

27
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,750
division that's going to give you some other function and then you compute the limit of x as X goes

28
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:24,430
to 5 of that ratio of functions and it's an interesting property in mathematics and calculus that these

29
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,300
two things are equal to each other.

30
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:33,910
And that is part 2 to confirm this property of limits for these two specific functions.

31
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,350
All right.

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,120
So now is your chance to switch to Python.

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,100
Write some code.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:46,340
And now I am going to switch to Python and solve both of these parts of this exercise I will start by

35
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,500
importing the variable x.

36
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:55,970
Let's say some r x equals symbols symbols X and then I will define the function.

37
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,580
So that was f of x equals let's say sin.

38
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:08,490
So notice I'm using the symbolic square or I should say the square root function in the sin pi module.

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,670
And that's because to use the simple I limit function.

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,010
We need these to be symbolic expressions.

41
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:29,740
So the square root of x plus 1 times Sam dot XP of minus X and then we had G of X and that was the cosine.

42
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:36,090
Again I'm using the cosine function in the simple module not in the NUM pi module.

43
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:47,960
So Sim dot cost x plus similar sine of x then I will immediately extract the or convert these into functions

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,920
that I can evaluate at specific x axis points.

45
00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:04,400
So let's call this f x x equals Sim Lam defy x and f x and then I'm going to copy and paste because

46
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,530
this is all basically the same except replacing F with G.

47
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,010
All right.

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,960
So now I've written a bunch of code I'm just gonna run this real quick just to make sure that I haven't

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:23,320
made any silly little typos which as you know by this time in the course I make quite quite a few typos.

50
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,940
So now I didn't tell you exactly what x axis range to use for plotting out these functions.

51
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,010
So if you came up with your own ranges then that's great.

52
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:40,550
You might have discovered that X is limited by some specific value which is basically minus 1.

53
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:49,450
So if X is smaller than minus 1 then this is not going to produce a real value output.

54
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,610
So but I'm going to let this go from zero to 10.

55
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,380
And how about one hundred steps okay.

56
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:07,760
So let's start making some plots so P.L. T dot plot f our SA x x and then f x x evaluated at x x.

57
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:18,500
That's an awful lot of x's in there and then let's do make a label of F of X and then I think I will

58
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:27,460
also do another copy paste here and now all the Fs turn to GS and let's see how this looks so we need.

59
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,480
Let's see P L T the legend.

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,790
We need to activate the legend and P L T does show all right.

61
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,290
This looks pretty good.

62
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,630
So we have our two functions here.

63
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:45,740
F of X and G of X and it's always interesting to look at the functions and make sure that we can kind

64
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,310
of make a sensible mapping between the function in algebra.

65
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,930
So you know that sort of symbolic version of the function with the graphical visual version of the function.

66
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:05,390
So this one is cosine and sine so we certainly expect G of X to be wavy like this which it is and you

67
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:13,490
can see that F of X is kind of dominated by this e to the minus X expression and E to the minus X..

68
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,100
Certainly when it starts at zero is basically just going to be this decay downwards towards zero.

69
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,760
All right so that looks good.

70
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:29,990
I would consider this to be the successful completion of part 1 of this exercise and then we get to

71
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,680
part 2.

72
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:43,740
And so what we need to do here is compute the limits of f and g separately and the limit point was 5.

73
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,610
So here I'm going to say Lim of F of X equals Sim.

74
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,640
That limit effects comma X comma Lim point.

75
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:03,140
So it was the function the symbolic function the variable and then the limit point.

76
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,780
Now it's important to look at these functions and determine whether we are going to need to compute

77
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,600
a one sided or two sided limit.

78
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,660
So looking at both of these functions you know the value of 5 is somewhere around here.

79
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:24,320
It certainly seems like the functions converge onto the limit of whatever the limit happens to be both

80
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,090
coming in from the right and coming in from the left.

81
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,410
In this case we do not need to worry about any separate directions for the limits.

82
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:33,790
Okay.

83
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:43,670
So that was the limit of F of X then we have the limit of G of X and that is essentially the same code.

84
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,730
Just like this.

85
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,370
Okay.

86
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,410
So run this cell.

87
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,520
We didn't get any mistakes so that's good.

88
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,020
Now I want to compute the limit of f divided by G.

89
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,950
So let's see.

90
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:06,860
I'm going to copy and paste this business and I will call this Lim f g x and essentially all I'm going

91
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,500
to do here is just directly in this function divide F of X by G of X.

92
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:20,360
Now if you want you could have also done it this way you could say like h of x equals f of x divided

93
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,300
by G of X and then of course here you would input H of X that's also h of x.

94
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,390
Totally totally fine solution.

95
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,380
So now we have all of the individual limits that we need.

96
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,350
And the question is whether this divided by this is the same thing as this.

97
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:46,490
Now my claim in the slides is that it is and this is a good example of what I mentioned in the first

98
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,200
video of this section of the course which is that this statement is true.

99
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,310
So this claim is true that this divided by this is the same thing as this.

100
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,160
However I'm not proving it to you in this course.

101
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:06,110
What I want to do is show you how to use python as a tool to help you build intuition for this important

102
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,910
property of limits.

103
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,140
Okay.

104
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,480
Now we could just print all of these things out but I want to make this look nice in latex coding so

105
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,200
display math and then let's see.

106
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,810
This is going.

107
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,030
This kind of have to work up piece wise here.

108
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:33,200
So I want a fraction and in the numerator of the fraction it's going to be the limit as x goes to well

109
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:43,040
percent g g that's going to be this Lim point here of F of X and then in the denominator it's going

110
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,290
to be pretty much the same thing.

111
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,420
Let me see are missing a and curly bracket there.

112
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:58,350
So then the denominator is essentially the same thing except this is going to be for G of X..

113
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:04,980
So before getting any further let me just finish this code here and make sure that all of this is looking

114
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,490
good.

115
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:15,360
So we have two substitutions here and they're both Lim point and limb point okay.

116
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,480
So this looks pretty good.

117
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,940
We see the limit of F of X as X goes to five divided by the limit of G of X as X goes to five.

118
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,120
And now I need to say what these things are equal to and I'd like to show both of these here.

119
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,400
So I'm going to put actually another fraction and this is going to be.

120
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,720
Percent G and percent G.

121
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:49,850
And then here I'm going to put the limit of F of X. So lim f f of x and the limb of G of X.

122
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,060
Okay and let's plot this again.

123
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,680
Okay.

124
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,760
So here you see the kind of symbolic expression of what we're doing here.

125
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,570
These are the actual values for this particular F of X and this particular limit point.

126
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,720
So as x goes to 5.

127
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,400
And then I want to show what these what this ratio is X actually equal to and that's gonna be a pretty

128
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,640
straightforward percent G.

129
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,220
And then here this is going to be well I actually don't have a variable for this yet.

130
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,390
So I can simply divide them.

131
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,190
So lim f x divided by Lim g x.

132
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,460
All right.

133
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,470
So this is starting to get to be a really long line of Python code.

134
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:41,420
So what I'm going to do is break this up into two separate lines of text even though it's the same line

135
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,790
of code just makes a little bit easier to read it's a bit softer on the eyes.

136
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,200
Okay.

137
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,160
So this ratio happens to be minus point 0 2 whatever that means.

138
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,460
Okay.

139
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,180
And then the next one is actually going to be a little bit easier isn't it.

140
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:08,330
So here we say that the limit as x goes two percent g of actually now this is going to be a fraction

141
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:16,670
f of x f of x divided by G of X.

142
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,040
And let's just start by replacing this number here with Lynn point

143
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,400
okay.

144
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,350
So so far looking good.

145
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,760
And then we say equals.

146
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,450
And then another present G for then whatever the answer is going to be.

147
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:41,540
So the answer here is going to be Lim f g x.

148
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,070
All right.

149
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,840
So that's pretty cool.

150
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:52,670
We have seen here that the limit is exactly the same for computing the limit separately and then dividing

151
00:12:52,670 --> 00:13:00,830
them versus dividing the functions and then computing the limit of that function ratio in this video

152
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,940
and in the previous video you learned about limits of functions.

153
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,660
You learned how to compute limits and functions and you learned how to use latex coding to display those

154
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,700
limits in nice formatting.
