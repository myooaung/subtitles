00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:11,500
I realize this is a rather unconventional way to start a course, but I am going to dive right into an
1

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,680
advanced topic before even covering the basics.
2

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,430
And the reason why I'm doing that is because I want to get you excited to see what you are going to
3

4
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,580
be learning about throughout this course and what you will be able to do and understand by... not even
4

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,850
the end of this course, even towards the middle of this course.
5

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,670
So here I have the wikipedia page for a harmonograph.
6

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,600
So what is a harmonograph?
7

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:42,370
You might have seen a harmonograph before, for example at a science museum.
8

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,370
It's typically this kind of, you know, mechanical device that's going to draw out these beautiful looking
9

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,820
kind of circly, wiggly shapes like this.
10

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,670
Here you see a few more examples of really beautiful abstract shapes.
11

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,590
So how do these come about?
12

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,860
It's actually a pretty simple set of formulas.
13

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,730
It's two equations here.
14

15
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,200
You have an equation for x and an equation for y.
15

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,000
And it's basically some sine waves and this e thing, which turns out to be a tapering function.
16

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,100
It's called an exponential.
17

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,960
So what we are going to do now is switch to Python, and implement these directly and produce beautiful
18

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,070
graphs like this.
19

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:31,460
So here I am in a Jupiter notebook and I'm looking at the file called pymath
20

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,280
harmonograph.
21

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,920
So this file you can download in the resources section for this video and you can either open this file
22

23
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,030
locally on your computer using Anaconda or you can upload it online.
23

24
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,420
As I showed in the previous few videos.
24

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,950
Now if all of this code looks really bizarre and intimidating, then don't worry!
25

26
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,520
The whole point of this course is for you to learn exactly what this code means and how to work with
26

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,070
it.
27

28
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,400
So if you're totally new to Python then don't worry.
28

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,110
All you need to do is follow along and trust that we're going to make some beautiful graphs.
29

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,040
And later in the course you will understand what all this stuff means.
30

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,300
Okay.
31

32
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,370
So we click inside this cell this little box here. And we need to run these two lines of code and we
32

33
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,500
do that by holding down the control key and pressing enter on the keyboard.
33

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,190
You can see that that gives us a little number one over here.
34

35
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,260
And then we need to run this code here.
35

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:36,930
So again we click inside this cell hold down the control key and press enter and voila!! We get a 
36

37
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,630
harmonograph!
37

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,740
This is a beautiful beautiful image that we created just by running these basically these two lines
38

39
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,130
of code.
39

40
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,810
This generates the data that is then plotted over here.
40

41
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,970
So it looks kind of like... I don't know...
41

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,440
To me it looks a bit like an H?
42

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,430
Like a cursive H.
43

44
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:03,250
So what I encourage you to do at the end of this video is to change these parameters here and rerun
44

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,520
this code and you'll come up with new harmonographs.
45

46
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,030
So let me just give you a sense of how you can change this code.
46

47
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,280
So there's three sets of parameters: A D and F. And you can see that they are lists of numbers.
47

48
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,260
So each of these parameters, A D and F, is actually a set of four numbers.
48

49
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,930
So one two three four.
49

50
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,210
They're separated by commas so you can change these values, for example I'm going to change this one
50

51
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,690
to a two and then I'm gonna press control enter to rerun this cell and that actually change the plot;
51

52
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,190
it made it a little bit wider here.
52

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,930
So let's see now maybe I'll change this number one to...
53

54
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,220
How about a four.
54

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,750
Woah! that changed it a lot.
55

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,090
So you can see some of these parameters will have large effects on the plots and some of them will have
56

57
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,990
small effects.
57

58
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,040
I actually preferred it like this so, I'm going to go back to this one.
58

59
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,480
So what do these parameters mean and what is going on in this formula?
59

60
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,610
So what we have in this formula is sine waves that are tapered by exponentials.
60

61
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,660
So to make that a little bit more clear, what this function is doing, I'm going to scroll down here to
61

62
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:23,020
this cell. And essentially what I'm going to do is visualize some of the elementary
62

63
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,000
components of this plot above.
63

64
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,650
So you can see here we are generating a variable X and a variable Y and then we generate a plot of X
64

65
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,840
by Y, so x comma y.
65

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,470
So to make this seem a little bit less mysterious I'm going to just copy and paste so this is literally
66

67
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,320
just copied and pasted down here. And then put this into the plot function.
67

68
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,130
So now when we run this we can see what is actually being generated by this code above.
68

69
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,530
So you can see it's like a sine wave.
69

70
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,200
It's a wiggly line it goes up and down. And the sine wave is getting faster as it goes to the right.
70

71
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,250
And it's also tapering down.
71

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,520
So why is the sine wave getting faster?
72

73
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,300
And why is it tapering down?
73

74
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,920
Well it's getting faster because of the way that I set up this variable here T.
74

75
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,590
And it's tapering down because of this exponential function.
75

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,070
So for example if we delete this exponential like this, and then rerun the code, you can see we have a
76

77
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:34,920
sine wave that's getting faster but it is not tapering down. And I can taper this to a larger number.
77

78
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,200
So this is D.
78

79
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,770
This means the first element of D.
79

80
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,480
So the first element of D is point 0 0 4.
80

81
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,950
So let's plot this again.
81

82
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,580
So here's what it looks like when D equals point 0 0 4.
82

83
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,240
What I'm going to do now is multiply D by let's say 5.
83

84
00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:00,000
So I'm just making this value larger and then I rerun the code and you can see that the tapering happens
84

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,670
faster and it's a more intense taper.
85

86
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,490
Basically we get down to zero faster with larger numbers.
86

87
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,580
So I hope this gives you a little bit of intuition.
87

88
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:16,410
So essentially what we're doing is we have this function here and then we are generating -- well, we add
88

89
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,790
two of them together, and then we mix one set of parameters for X and one set of parameters for y and
89

90
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,880
then we plot one as a function of the other.
90

91
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,410
And that is how we get this plot.
91

92
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:28,800
All right.
92

93
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,870
So what should you do right now?
93

94
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:37,440
Well, what I encourage you to do is change these parameters a little bit, come up with some really beautiful
94

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,630
harmongraph that you are happy with.
95

96
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,000
Take a screenshot and then post it to the Q&A forum for this video.
96

97
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,860
I would be very happy to see what you have come up with and you can also, if you like, you can list the
97

98
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,040
parameters that you use or if you prefer you can leave these parameters mysterious and then we just
98

99
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,530
see your beautiful artwork.
