In this video I'm going to introduce you to the concept of comments in Python.
1

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,920
It'll be a fairly short video because comments are pretty straightforward.
2

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:19,670
However, they are really important for writing good clean and efficient code that you and other people
3

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,190
can understand and work with and adapt.
4

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:28,400
So therefore I think it's worth having a whole video just about comments. So I'm going to start by setting
5

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,300
some variable X to be equal 5 and then if we just type x here then python will print out the value of
6

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,610
x which is 5.
7

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,920
So far nothing particularly weird or new or interesting.
8

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,870
Now I'm going to set another variable and let's say Y equals 3.
9

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,670
Now before running this code I'm going to put a hashtag here at the beginning of this line.
10

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,520
Now this is not the way of indicating that this is supposed to be trending on Twitter.
11

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,270
Instead this is indicating what's called a "comment" in python.
12

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,670
Now notice what happened to this code when I put the hash tag in the beginning of the line.
13

14
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,500
First of all, all the text turned green instead of being the normal colors.
14

15
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,670
Secondly, the font is now italics instead of being straight up.
15

16
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,100
OK so I can run this code again.
16

17
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,850
No problem.
17

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,900
Nothing has changed.
18

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,730
X is still equal to 5.
19

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,280
However when I type Y here and request that Python tell me the value of y.
20

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,000
I get an error message.
21

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,170
It says variable Y is not defined.
22

23
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,850
Now that may seem a little bit strange because I just defined it right here.
23

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,520
But what's happening is that this piece of code or this piece of text I should say is in a comment.
24

25
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:52,970
And Python ignores any text that's inside a comment which means any text that comes after a hashtag.
25

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:02:00,270
So if you actually want to specify or define y to be equal to three you can delete that hashtag.
26

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,220
And now of course Y equals 3.
27

28
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,450
So there are two ways to create comments in Python.
28

29
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,650
One way is what I just illustrated and that's having a comment be on its own line.
29

30
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,170
So you start with a hash like this and then you can write some useful comment.
30

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,770
Maybe you want to say, this is where the variables are defined. And then perhaps later down in the code
31

32
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:32,120
you're going to say, this is where the let's say the functions are defined.
32

33
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,640
And so on.
33

34
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,490
And then there's going to be more code here.
34

35
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:42,680
So this is one way to make comments in python. A second way is to have the comments appearing after a
35

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,290
valid line of code.
36

37
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,050
So in this case we say X equals five.
37

38
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,660
And then now I put a hash tag and maybe a comment.
38

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,280
Is this used to be two point three.
39

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,280
So maybe that's relevant for some particular reason that you're implementing in this code.
40

41
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,850
And just to prove to you that Python actually will interpret this part of the code I'm even going to
41

42
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,770
set this to be Z.
42

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,370
Now you can see z equals 5.
43

44
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:17,360
So python will still evaluate all of the text before the hash mark as code and anything after the hash
44

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,620
mark will be ignored.
45

46
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,320
And this is just going to be comments for you.
46

47
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,310
So the last thing that I want to illustrate to you in this video is a keyboard shortcut for toggling
47

48
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,160
whether a line of code has or doesn't have a comment.
48

49
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,140
So on windows you have press control and then the forward slash.
49

50
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,780
Now notice that as I press control forward slash over and over again that's toggling whether this
50

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,800
line starts with a hash or doesn't start with a hash.
51

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,450
So that's just a convenient keyboard shortcut.
52

53
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,260
You can also select multiple lines of code and then press control forward slash again.
53

54
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:59,870
And now I'm toggling whether all of these lines of code are commented or whether they are uncommented.
54

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,700
So there you go.
55

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,400
Now you know how to create comments in Python and you know a keyboard shortcut for setting an entire
56

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,210
line or multiple selected lines to be commented.
57

58
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,210
Comments are really useful for helping you organize your code and helping make your code be readable
58

59
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,350
not only to other people but also to yourself.
59

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:27,320
And that's because when you come back to your own code in a week or a month or a year, you're probably
60

61
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,960
going to forget a lot of what you were thinking about when you were first writing the code.
61

62
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,840
So making comments is really useful to help you remember and understand what the goal of the code is
62

63
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,640
and how the code is organized.
