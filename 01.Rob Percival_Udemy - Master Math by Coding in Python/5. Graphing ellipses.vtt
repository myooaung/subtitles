00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.370
By this point in this section of the course you are probably thinking that it couldn't possibly be better

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.460
than the way that we graph circles using mesh grid at the end of the last video.

3
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.090
But it's about to get even cooler.

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.550
We're gonna make another really cool looking graphics and this time using ellipses and really the whole

5
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.250
idea of learning the formula for an ellipse.

6
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.530
It's just an excuse to make another cool looking minimalistic colorful line drawing.

7
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.610
All right.

8
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.720
So okay this is not the really cool minimalistic colorful line drawing.

9
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.750
This is a little bit of a graph about an ellipse so it's a bit like a circle in the sense that it has

10
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.920
a center.

11
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.700
And here I'm parameter izing that center as h come a K for the X and the y part of the center.

12
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.110
But now instead of having one single radius that is constant everywhere in the ellipse has to set a

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.920
two radii.

14
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.890
So a set of radii and they're often called A and B.

15
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:18.110
And so a is like the radius the x component of the radius and B is the y component of the radius.

16
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.990
Might be a little initially confusing because it looks like B is projecting down to the x axis and A

17
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.240
is projecting over to the y axis.

18
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.170
But really you have to think about B being a distance on the y axis and a being a distance along the

19
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.540
x axis.

20
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.360
All right.

21
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.240
So now here is the formula.

22
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.050
You can see that it's pretty similar to the formula for a circle.

23
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:51.380
So we still have Y minus K squared plus X minus H squared minus one equals zero.

24
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.460
And now what I would like you to do is imagine what would happen to this equation if a equals b.

25
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.430
So if these two radii were exactly the same.

26
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.730
Well graphically it's clear that if a and b are exactly the same number then we have a circle which

27
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.130
is a special case of an ellipse.

28
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.580
And now imagine that a and b are the same.

29
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.650
So then you could just multiply this whole equation by B squared.

30
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.100
That would get rid of the denominator here get rid of the denominator here.

31
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.320
This would be minus B squared equals zero then you could put the b squared on the other side of this

32
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.730
equation and you would get exactly the formula for a circle.

33
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.890
So the whole point of that was it's interesting to be able to see this formula and connect it to a formula

34
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.810
for a circle in this special case of the Ellipse where the two radius components are equal to each other.

35
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.510
So now I'm going to switch to Python and show you how to implement this formula you will see that it's

36
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.130
not a whole lot different from creating the circle in the previous video.

37
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.800
So let's start by listing the parameters I'll go for H equals 1 k equals 2.

38
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.720
So these are the coordinates for the center of the ellipse and then we have a equals 2 and b equals

39
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.390
3.

40
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.080
And these are the two components of the radius.

41
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.440
So now I'm gonna set up the Axis limit to be the same that I did before for the circles.

42
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:36.130
So N.P. dot max out the absolute value of H or the absolute value of k except now it's not so simple

43
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.240
as just to say r plus this because now we have two different radius components and we want the maximum

44
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.470
of we want to use the maximum of either these two whichever one is larger.

45
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.790
So then we need another and P that Max call and then it's gonna be a comma.

46
00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.300
B So this line of code gets to be a little bit long but I hope you see that it's not such a complicated

47
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.140
mess.

48
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.040
So essentially we're taking the larger of the two radius components and adding that to the larger of

49
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.610
the two ellipse center components.

50
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.630
So then these define the Axis limits so then I'm going to create little vector x is n PS and num pi

51
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:28.870
dot Lynn space is gonna go minus X limb 2 plus X limb and let's go for one hundred steps by the way

52
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.320
in this and the past several videos I'm using a bunch of parameters like this one hundred steps without

53
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.220
really justifying or motivating it and also without trying other options to see how they compare.

54
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.740
This is the sort of thing that I encourage you to play around with so you can try.

55
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.270
For example 10 you can try.

56
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.160
You know some whatever this number ends up being a million a thousand you know try a bunch of different

57
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.800
numbers and see whether and how that flag affects the resulting plots.

58
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.300
All right.

59
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.930
So a capital X capital Y equals and b that match grid X comma x.

60
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.690
You guys are are basically experts at doing this stuff now.

61
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:20.080
Okay so let's create the function so f of x and y axis I'm getting bored of calling it X and X and Y.

62
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.130
Let's call this ellipse equals.

63
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:33.600
So we have X minus H squared divided by a squared.

64
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.940
It's worth pausing for a moment here to consider whether python is going to interpret this equation

65
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.820
in the same way that we intend it to be written.

66
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.770
So we intend that the square goes with this quantity and this square goes with a.

67
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.420
So we don't want Python to interpret it like like this.

68
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.530
So how can we be confident that we're doing the right thing.

69
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.130
Well first of all you can always use parentheses that will immediately increase your confidence but

70
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.080
we can also think about the order of operations and just as a quick reminder.

71
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:19.210
That was PEM does please excuse my dear and Sally so let's see we want to make sure that exponents R

72
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.060
come are going to come before division.

73
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.900
So here we have exponents and then here we have division.

74
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.130
All right.

75
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:34.540
So that means that this too is gonna be glued to this term and this too is gonna be glued to a and this

76
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.330
glue is stronger than this glue.

77
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.120
So we are good to go.

78
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.960
All right.

79
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.550
And then we have Y minus K squared divided by B squared.

80
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.360
And that was minus 1.

81
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.910
Okay.

82
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.190
Run that code and we get an error.

83
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.110
Where was the error a la X Lim.

84
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.300
Okay.

85
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.500
There you go.

86
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.130
My favorite kind of programming mistakes are these typos that are easy to find.

87
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.300
I love making those mistakes because they're easy to correct and once they're correct then you know

88
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.670
that you are golden you're good to go.

89
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:24.220
All right so let's run a contour here so X Y and then e lips and zero just to see how this looks okay.

90
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.110
So the funny thing is that this actually looks like a perfect circle.

91
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.900
Even though it's supposed to be an ellipse and that is because the x axis is much longer than the y

92
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.420
axis even though they're supposed to be the same length.

93
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.790
So you remember from the previous video that we drew a circle and it looked like an ellipse.

94
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.380
Here we drew an ellipse and it looked like a circle.

95
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:52.220
So BLT dot get current axis dot set underscore aspect.

96
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.150
So that's the aspect ratio and that is going to be equal.

97
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.700
All right.

98
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.730
Now this looks much more like an oval obviously.

99
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.100
Okay.

100
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.140
And I'll draw the dot in the center.

101
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:13.850
So BLT dot plot and that was h comma K and let's also make this a go a green circle.

102
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:20.080
Of course there are more bells and whistles that you could add to this plot to spice it up a bit and

103
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.630
make it look a little bit nicer.

104
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.400
But I think you already know how to do that stuff.

105
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:31.050
For example you know drawing lines here or making a grid putting a title and a legend on it and so on.

106
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:37.780
So I'm gonna skip all that but of course if you feel motivated to continue working on this then definitely

107
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:38.920
feel free to do so.

108
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:47.950
Now when you look at this image I guess that you were thinking Hey Mike I can make a much cooler looking

109
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.900
image than what you have.

110
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.090
And you know what I say back to you.

111
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.110
I challenge you to make a nicer one.

112
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.450
But first before you make a nicer one you have to repeat this exactly.

113
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:05.860
So I want you to reproduce exactly this image that I've created here and then you can continue making

114
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.720
it nicer and more interesting.

115
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.460
Maybe you want it more minimalistic.

116
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.410
Maybe you want it with different colors but you should start by producing this thing and then move forward.

117
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.350
All right.

118
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:26.440
So what I did was very K from minus four to plus four and I varied a parameter a from actually plus

119
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.840
for two plus four.

120
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.840
But I set it up to go from minus four to plus four.

121
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.670
And then the absolute value of that.

122
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.570
So that makes a look like a V kind of function.

123
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:38.920
All right.

124
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:46.750
So that might be enough information for you to get started and write enough code that will generate

125
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.720
this plot.

126
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.400
If you want a hint I can tell you what the h parameter was and what the B parameter was.

127
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.780
But I'm leaving that covered for the moment.

128
00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:01.210
So if you don't want this hint if you want to figure out what H and B were on your own then.

129
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.730
Now is the time for you to pause the video.

130
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.160
All right.

131
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:15.500
So here is what I set H and K to be so I set h to be 0 and b to be 4 and that is all I'm going to tell

132
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:15.880
you.

133
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.630
Now you have to figure the rest out all right.

134
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.920
So let's get started with a fresh sell of code.

135
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:33.220
So I said that a was linear these space numbers from minus 4 to plus 4 in any steps.

136
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:39.890
I'll get back to end in a moment and then I took the absolute value of this like this.

137
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.340
This was a.

138
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:49.960
And then we had a b and this was fixed to four and then H was zero.

139
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:58.000
And I also very K so that s and P that Lynn space and I went also goes from minus four to plus four

140
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.200
in any step.

141
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.910
So what is this mysterious end here.

142
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.890
So n is actually the number of ellipses that get drawn in total.

143
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:13.210
So I said that to be 16 and actually you know I'm gonna show you something else that's a little bit

144
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:13.630
clever.

145
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.120
So I'm going to move H and K up here like this.

146
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.580
And now I can specify a to b just the absolute value of k.

147
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.280
So now we need to create the mesh grid.

148
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.480
So let's say little vector X is going to be.

149
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:37.600
And Peter Lynn space and here I went from minus 8 to plus 8 in one hundred steps.

150
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.600
So then X comma Y.

151
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:50.100
So the mesh matrices X and Y are the function mesh grid X comma X okay.

152
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:58.480
Now I need a for loop that's gonna loop over all of these sixteen ellipses and basically just create

153
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:06.040
a normal ellipse and plotted with a contour but then changing the values of k and the values of a and

154
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.690
of course the color.

155
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.250
So let's get started.

156
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:19.020
So for I in range 0 2 n I want the function let's call it big F.

157
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.290
The function is going to be.

158
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:29.760
So let's see it's X minus H now H does not change divided by a but a actually does change.

159
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:42.040
So it's not just a squared it's the ISF element of a plus then we have Y minus K squared except now

160
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.180
K just like a is not constant it also varies.

161
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:54.450
So this is going to be the highest element in K divided by B squared and then B is this number here.

162
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:54.760
Okay.

163
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.410
And that is also fixed.

164
00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.730
And don't forget the minus one it's really important to have that minus one in there.

165
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.030
In fact think of.

166
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.720
I'm even going to take a pause from this for a moment and go back here and show you what happens when

167
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.280
you don't run the minus one or when you forget to include the minus one.

168
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:18.550
Now this ellipse turns out to be huge you can barely see this part of the ellipse so this is a ginormous

169
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.800
ellipse here.

170
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:20.200
Okay.

171
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.120
So I mean put that back.

172
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:24.170
Okay.

173
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.180
The minus 1 is important BLT.

174
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:37.430
That contour X comma Y comma f comma zero and let's uh p o t does show.

175
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.280
Let's have a look at this.

176
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.170
All right.

177
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.800
So this is starting to look pretty good.

178
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.320
Let's see.

179
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:56.910
I'm going to turn the Axis off so plot axis off and also set the uh the Axis aspect ratio to be equal.

180
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.430
Okay so this is looking pretty good.

181
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.540
We just need to set the colors.

182
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.200
So how can we set the colors.

183
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:11.070
Well I hope you took some time to explore around with this a little bit in the interest of time.

184
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.000
I'm just going to tell you my solution.

185
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.340
So this is I.

186
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:24.660
Divided by n zero and I divided by n and the idea is that when I is small this basically is black.

187
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.540
So that's the black you see at the bottom.

188
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:33.240
And then as the eye gets larger and larger it's becoming a larger fraction of one.

189
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.540
But the fraction of green is always staying at zero.

190
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:41.830
So essentially this is moving towards with each increasing ellipse.

191
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:48.330
The color moves more towards being 100 percent red and 100 percent blue which is of course the best

192
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:55.300
color in the world which is purple so in this video you learned the formula for an ellipse.

193
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.650
You learned how to make some cool looking graphics if you would like to show off a little bit.

194
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:06.160
I encourage that then what you should do is post to the Q and A of this video.

195
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.220
First start off for the picture of this so I can see that you really have solved the exercise successfully.

196
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.720
And then you can show me your alternative which you think is better than mine.

197
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.760
Stay tuned for the next video.

198
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:24.130
There's going to be another really cool exercise that produces a really nice graphic.
