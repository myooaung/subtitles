1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:09,110
I'm actually going to start this video by showing you a screenshot of a google image search for the

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,780
term logarithmic spiral nature.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,530
Here you see some of the first results and it's pretty interesting we see some shells some see shells

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,780
that are cut in half.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,450
We see some plants some ferns some other plants.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,070
We see galaxies here and these are this a galaxy.

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,310
This looks like a hurricane spinning around.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,990
What do all these various biological and physical objects have in common.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,300
Well you probably guessed it.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,850
They are well modeled by something called a logarithmic spiral.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,310
And the goal of this video is to introduce you to the logarithmic spiral.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,660
All right.

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:54,420
So it turns out that it's pretty straightforward to create a logarithmic spiral in math or in python.

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:00,940
All you need to do is combine a cosine with an exponential the natural exponential.

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,890
So here we have cosine of T.

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,490
This is E to the minus T and these are the same t here and T is just some time vector.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,940
Now this yellow line here shows the function e to the minus T.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:20,420
This white line is a little bit confusing here because this is this white line is actually not the cosine

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,160
of T per say this is the coastline of T times e to the minus T.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:31,400
And that gives us this tapered cosine so it's a cosine and you can see it's getting closer and closer

21
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,630
to zero.

22
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,050
Now this is not a logarithmic spiral.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,660
This is a logarithmic spiral.

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:48,530
And to create this logarithmic spiral we plot X by Y where X is cosine of T times e to the t divided

25
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:56,430
by K and Y is almost the same as exponential term as the same but we have a sine instead of a cosine.

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,080
Now you might be looking at this formula and thinking that I made a mistake maybe I made a little typo

27
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,840
because there is no minus sign here and there is a minus sign here.

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,330
So if we say that this is this.

29
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,370
So this is the.

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,400
This gives us the the decay the exponential decay with a minus sign.

31
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,030
So I tell you that this expression and this expression are consistent with each other.

32
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,950
What does that tell you about how we have to define K in this equation.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,470
That's right.

34
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,820
It tells you that we set k to be a negative number.

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,360
So what is the effect of dividing by K here.

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,420
So let's assume that K is always negative and then I just want to take a few moments to think about

37
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,990
what it means for k to be really large.

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,660
So a really large number like one hundred or a thousand or ten thousand first is if k is really small

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,930
like close to one or maybe even closer to zero.

40
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,240
So let's think about this.

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,160
So when K gets really really big this fraction goes to zero.

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,220
So imagine t is a time vector is going from I don't know let's say 0 to 4 pi.

43
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,640
So it goes well let's make it even easier let's just just say t goes from zero to 10 and let's say k

44
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,900
to be a hundred billion.

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,020
So now this is you know 10 divided by one hundred billion is essentially zero it's a tiny tiny number

46
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,420
it's very close to zero.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,950
So that means that when K gets really large this whole term here is gonna go to 1.

48
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,490
And that's because E 2 the 0 or e to the tiny tiny tiny number very close to zero is basically 1.

49
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:46,790
So now if we set this term to be 1 it's essentially not decaying at all or is decaying really really

50
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,850
really slowly.

51
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,530
So this cosine goes on and on forever with very gentle tapering and in contrast as K gets smaller and

52
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,100
smaller than this tapering gets more and more steep.

53
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,020
So when K gets smaller then this goes down to zero faster.

54
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,310
All right.

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,590
So what we're going to do now is switch to Python and implement this equation to create a logarithmic

56
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:20,340
spiral so I will set this variable t to go from linearly spaced numbers from zero to 10 pi and let's

57
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:28,160
say a thousand I set it to be one two three four points and of course you can pause the video or after

58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,490
the video is over you can try playing around with different ranges here for a time notice sums on keeping

59
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,410
time positive here okay.

60
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,550
And then we specify.

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,140
Okay let's start with minus three minus three.

62
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:54,730
And then I'm gonna set X to be num Pieta cosine of T times e to the T divided by K and then of course

63
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:04,200
copy paste because y is nearly identical y is just the sign of T times this same exponential.

64
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,570
All right.

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,700
So that's essentially all the math that we need to worry about.

66
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm just gonna say plot X. come a Y.

67
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,880
Let's make this a black line.

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,060
So Red let's do uh.

69
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,840
Actually now that I say the word red.

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,620
That sounds nice.

71
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,380
Let's try Red BLT.

72
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:28,600
That axis square and peel to that axis off and let's see what this thing looks like.

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,260
All right.

74
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:36,310
Here we go we get our nice logarithmic spiral not too difficult and so I'm gonna switch to the exercises

75
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,360
but of course I encourage you to play around with the K parameter.

76
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:47,590
Play around with this range of T and see how much intuition you can build about the logarithmic spiral

77
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,870
so the exercise here is to great this really beautiful looking logarithmic spiral.

78
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,380
It looks like some abstract cosmic seashell or something.

79
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,470
You know it's a a sea creature from some other planet.

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,410
I don't know what it is but it looks really cool and it's nice to look at.

81
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,810
So in fact it turns out that I've created this by plotting a lot of different spirals.

82
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,710
So this is one logarithmic spiral.

83
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,750
You can change some of these parameters are actually t you set the same for all the lines so you really

84
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,540
just are changing the parameter k.

85
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,140
So change k.

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,580
A lot of different times that's going to create a whole family of logarithmic spirals and you plot them

87
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:38,660
all on top of each other on the same axis and that will give you a graph that looks like this.

88
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,860
Now the reason why this looks kind of 3D ish is because I've changed the color.

89
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:51,630
So every line every exponential every logarithmic spiral has its own color and I set them to go from

90
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,890
being really dark so very close to black.

91
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,310
And then they get lighter and lighter into lighter colors of purple and eventually this kind of pinkish

92
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,560
magenta color in the middle.

93
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,290
So you already know the basics and you just have to figure out what to set what range to set.

94
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,030
K 2 to produce a graph that looks something like this.

95
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,130
So good luck.

96
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,390
Switch to Python do some coding make some art.

97
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:23,170
And now I'm going to switch to Python and show you how I've produced this graphic here Oh right.

98
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,840
Let's begin.

99
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,270
So I created one hundred and fifty separate lines.

100
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,560
I'm going to specify n to be one hundred and fifty and then we need the parameter k.

101
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:42,230
I think I'll actually call it k s because it's plural so case this is going to go linearly space numbers

102
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,980
from minus six to minus two in n step so a hundred and fifty steps.

103
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,500
Now there's really no you know correct or single correct way to set up these K parameters these are

104
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,640
parameters that I you know I spent a few minutes just playing around with the parameters.

105
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,350
These are ones that I liked but that doesn't mean that you have to come up with or you have to prefer

106
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,410
exactly the same range.

107
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,270
So let's say for I in range n.

108
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,930
And what do we want to do.

109
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,510
So we need to define x and y.

110
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,410
And I think I will take that from here.

111
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:19,800
Let's see.

112
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:29,180
In fact I think I can copy and paste all of this stuff so plot that show is gonna be at the end in fact

113
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,190
all of these lines here are gonna be at the end.

114
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:40,730
And this these three lines need to be tab indented here because these are part of the for loop and this

115
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:47,550
is just some specifying things about the plot that comes after the for loop is finished.

116
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,640
Now this is not really correct because this is just plotting the same K over and over again which we

117
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,090
defined all the way up here.

118
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,630
So we need to change this.

119
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:04,660
This has to be the ISF elements in K and actually it's k s like this.

120
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,100
Okay so let's try running this.

121
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,660
I already know that this is wrong here the color but I just want to make sure that we get something

122
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,670
that looks like what it should be in terms of the shape.

123
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:15,920
Okay.

124
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,150
So the shape is correct.

125
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,720
We didn't get any error messages or anything like that.

126
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,020
So that's good.

127
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,250
Now we basically just need to figure out how to specify the color here.

128
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:32,990
So the way that I specified this is to define the color parameter of the of the of the plot function

129
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,190
to be our G.B..

130
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,610
And so g there's no there's no green in here.

131
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,810
So that's always going to be zero green value of zero for every curve.

132
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:54,080
And then I just specify this to be I divided by n and the blue channel is also I divided by n and there

133
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,440
you go.

134
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,630
That's what we got.

135
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,090
So this looks really nice.

136
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,180
I think maybe you are a green person.

137
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,070
Maybe you like green.

138
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,480
That turns out to be yellow.

139
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,770
Okay so maybe you're a yellow person or maybe you know maybe you like black and white actually maybe

140
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,670
you like grayscale.

141
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,040
So that is this is also quite beautiful.

142
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:22,640
Now I challenge you to make a nicer looking more beautiful more interesting looking logarithmic spiral

143
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,980
based graphic than this.

144
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,380
Please take me up on this challenge.

145
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,940
Make something that looks better than this with a different color scale different.

146
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,020
You know whatever you want and then post it to the Q and A form.

147
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:41,510
I really enjoy seeing how you can take some of these basic building blocks and make really nice artwork

148
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:41,960
out of it.

149
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,000
OK.

150
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,770
So in this video to conclude you learned about logarithmic spirals.

151
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:54,890
These are really simple mathematical objects and yet they are ubiquitous in nature you see logarithmic

152
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,410
spirals everywhere.

153
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,170
And now that you know what a logarithmic spiral is I encourage you.

154
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:07,010
Next time you go for a walk through the park or through a forest or if you're on the beach look around

155
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,060
for logarithmic spirals you will see them all over the place.
