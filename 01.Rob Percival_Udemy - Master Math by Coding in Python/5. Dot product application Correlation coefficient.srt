1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,360
In this video I'm going to show you one of the many many applications of the dot product which is something

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,950
called the correlation coefficient.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,720
I'm sure you have heard of the correlation coefficient before it's one of the most popular ways of determining

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,020
whether there is a linear relationship between two variables.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:31,020
It's one of the most foundational tests in statistics for looking at co variation between two variables.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,780
And along the way you will of course get more experience working with dot products and vectors and other

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,570
sorts of things in python.

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,070
All right.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,180
So let me start by saying that all the data that I use in this video are all fake.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,100
I just made up these numbers.

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,540
All right.

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:55,410
So let's imagine that I did a survey I went around and talked to my students and I asked them how many

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,200
of my courses have they taken and how happy are they in life.

14
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,310
So this number speaks for itself.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,990
So this person took four courses this person took nine of my courses good for these two people.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,440
And here is how happy they are.

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,140
And this is rated on a scale from 1 to 10.

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,540
So one means you are totally totally miserable and 10 means you could not possibly be happier or you

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,780
are just screaming with happiness constantly.

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,150
All the time.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,620
So higher is happier.

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,910
This is referring to the number by the way just in case of some ambiguity about that statement.

23
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,470
So now I would like to know is there a relationship between the number of courses that people have taken

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,980
and how happy they are in life.

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,200
Now the way that we go about computing this correlation is through a procedure called the correlation

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,130
coefficient more formally the Pearson correlation coefficient.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,560
Here is the formula for computing the correlation coefficient.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,130
This is a screenshot from the Wikipedia page on correlation.

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,960
So we have X and Y.

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,010
These are two variables.

31
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:12,330
So we could call x the number of Mike's courses that were taken and y the life happiness and the bar

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,650
on top of the x and y refers to the mean or the average value.

33
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,520
So essentially this means you take each individual element in X and each l l individual element in y

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,380
subtract the respective means from that variable and then element y's multiply and then some.

35
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,870
Huh.

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,040
Doesn't that sound familiar element Y is multiply and then sum up all of those multiplications.

37
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,790
That is exactly the dot product.

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,860
So that's the numerator of the Pearson correlation coefficient the denominator has two terms and it

39
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,650
initially looks a little confusing.

40
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,500
It looks like there's a lot going on here.

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,890
But if you break this down you can see that this is actually pretty straightforward.

42
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,930
So you take each individual element in X subtract the mean and then square it.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,740
So when you're squaring it you're actually just multiplying this term by itself.

44
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,100
And now if you multiply this term by itself that's really just like what you see in the numerator.

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,050
Except this is X and X instead of here this is X and Y.

46
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:23,430
So in fact what you see in the denominator here is the dot product of X with itself.

47
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,610
And then you take the square root of that times the dot product of y with itself and then you take the

48
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,500
square root of that.

49
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,590
And there you go.

50
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,040
You have the correlation coefficient.

51
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,800
All right.

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,180
So now what we're going to do is switch to Python and I'm going to basically get this to work from first

53
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:49,600
principles from the ground up so I've already imported the NUM pi module and the matte plot live that

54
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,570
pie plot.

55
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:57,350
That's because I went to make a visualization of these data visualization is obviously super important

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,950
in statistics and data analysis and in math in general.

57
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:09,840
Okay so let's see what I'm going to do first is means center these data so mean center.

58
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,530
That's a fancy sounding term but it really just means to subtract the mean and also make these shorter

59
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:24,890
variables just for convenience so let's say variable m equals Mike's courses minus num PI that mean

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,140
of Mike's courses.

61
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:36,440
So now I'm subtracting the average of all these ratings are these numbers of course is taken from each

62
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,760
individual element and actually you know just out of curiosity let's see what that looks like.

63
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,070
Okay.

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,900
So you can see that now the numbers are negative some of them are negative some of them are positive.

65
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,740
Now of course when you subtract the mean from a vector like this the numbers themselves don't really

66
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,500
make any sense anymore.

67
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,660
You know what does it mean.

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,270
If someone took minus four point three courses it doesn't even that doesn't make sense but that's OK.

69
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,990
The goal is not to interpret this variable in terms of like the physical world.

70
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,610
The goal is to convert this into a form that we can use for computing the correlation.

71
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:15,850
All right.

72
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,180
So now we do the same thing here.

73
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:26,170
So this is l equals life happiness minus and P that mean life happiness.

74
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,420
OK.

75
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:33,370
So now we have our means centered variables and now I'm going to compute the correlation.

76
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,070
So I'm going to divide this up into two separate terms.

77
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:45,590
So there is the numerator and that was just the dot product between M and L and then we have the denominator

78
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:57,500
and that was the square root square root of the dot product of M with M times the square root of the

79
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,750
dot product of L with L.

80
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,110
Now if these terms look a little bit confusing then I encourage you to pause the video.

81
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,990
Go back two minutes to the slides where I showed you the formula or you could look it up on your own

82
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,410
online and compare that formula to basically these four lines of code here.

83
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:18,660
OK.

84
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,370
So then I'm going to call the correlation between them are 1 so our 1 was just the numerator divided

85
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,460
by the denominator and now just to make sure that I'm really doing the right thing I'm going to say

86
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:39,050
ah whoops R two equals end p that core Clef M comma l.

87
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,100
So now this is using the NUM pi function to compute the correlation coefficient between M and L.

88
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,480
All right.

89
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,610
So let's print out r 1 and then I will print out R to so let's see what we have here.

90
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,400
So our one is point six 0.

91
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,180
So let's just call this point six.

92
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:05,880
So there is a positive and a fairly strong correlation between the number of Mike's courses taken and

93
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,010
general happiness in life.

94
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:15,720
So that is encouraging the correlation coefficient varies between minus 1 and plus 1 where one means

95
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,260
a perfect correlation.

96
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,600
Zero means absolutely no correlation whatsoever and minus one would mean a negative correlation.

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,660
I certainly hope there wouldn't be a negative correlation here.

98
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:33,840
It would mean that the more courses of mine that people take the worse they feel their happiness goes

99
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,630
down anyway.

100
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,600
So that's our one.

101
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,370
What is going on with our two here.

102
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:45,570
This seems to be a matrix of numbers where the off diagonal elements are the same and they're the same

103
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,720
as the correlation that we computed here.

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,370
So what's happening is that the function core co F is computing a matrix of correlations.

105
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,770
So it's computing a correlation matrix.

106
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,770
The diagonal is showing that each vector is perfectly correlated with itself.

107
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,870
So the number of courses that you've taken is correlated with the number of courses that you've taken

108
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,770
obviously.

109
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,680
So that correlation is perfect.

110
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,400
So that's one.

111
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,660
Okay.

112
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:20,100
So what we want is any either one of these off diagonal elements here.

113
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:28,730
So I'm going to specify that what we want is you know let's just say this element over here.

114
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

115
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,130
And now we get exactly the same result.

116
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,280
So that's helpful.

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,140
That confirms that I have implemented the algorithm for computing the correlation coefficient accurately

118
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,170
because I get the same result as Python's built in function.

119
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,450
All right.

120
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,410
So you should never just trust a number in statistics you always want to see a graph.

121
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,360
You always want to see what the plot looks like.

122
00:08:51,360 --> 00:09:01,170
So let's say peel to dot plot and I want to plot Mike's courses on the x axis and life happiness on

123
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,790
the y axis.

124
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm gonna make these magenta squares and I will set the label to be the correlation coefficient.

125
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:21,190
So G and percent are one or R2 it actually doesn't matter all right let's see how this looks.

126
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,470
Okay so here we have the number of course is taken and general life happiness.

127
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:34,460
And mostly this goes up except look at this one person he or she has taken nine of my courses and they

128
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,310
are still miserable.

129
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,870
I don't know what's the deal with this person maybe they need to take even more of my courses and then

130
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,540
I'll feel better.

131
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,790
All right.

132
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,380
So now let me take a moment to make this plot look a little bit nicer.

133
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:54,950
So let's say the Axis I'm going to specify this going from zero to 10 and zero to 10.

134
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:01,380
And now it doesn't make sense to have negative numbers in here because these are all positive numbers.

135
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,050
The number of courses you've taken and life happiness.

136
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:11,480
Well I guess that could be negative but I'm imagining that this goes on a score from one to 10 and let's

137
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,870
see we need to activate the legend and it's good to have a label here.

138
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:26,030
So let's write P L T that X label number of Mike's courses taken.

139
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:32,600
Now grammatically this should be a quote to indicate possessive but as soon as you use a single quote

140
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,230
here that's actually going to confuse python a little bit.

141
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,760
So there's two options.

142
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,660
One is you can use a double quote like this which will actually just print out.

143
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,380
Sorry I meant not a double quote.

144
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:51,110
This should be a slash and then a quote and that's going to be like an escaped character to print out

145
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,860
the quote.

146
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:59,150
Or alternatively you could use double quotes here in the outside and then you can just use a single

147
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,030
quote on the inside like this Oh right.

148
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,270
So then we need P L T that y label.

149
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,590
And this is going to be life happiness.

150
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,040
Let's see.

151
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
So I want this graph to be square.

152
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,980
I want this to be I want the aspect ratio to be the same so I'm also going to change the get current

153
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,270
axis that set aspect to be equal.

154
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,090
And then the other thing I would like to change is to round this off to two significant digits.

155
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,170
Basically this is a whole lot of numbers and we really only need to know let's say the first two.

156
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:44,610
So I'm gonna write and p dot round and then comma to to round this result to two significant digits.

157
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:44,930
Okay.

158
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,180
So in my imaginary world where I made up these data This clearly means that if you want to be happy

159
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:58,230
in life you need to take more of my courses except if you are this person and to this person I sincerely

160
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,250
apologize.

161
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:06,580
I hope it wasn't my courses that made you so unhappy all jokes aside you learned in this course that

162
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:14,110
the correlation coefficient which is one of the most important and basic operations in all of statistical

163
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:21,900
analysis is really just an application of the dot product which itself is a pretty straightforward operation.
