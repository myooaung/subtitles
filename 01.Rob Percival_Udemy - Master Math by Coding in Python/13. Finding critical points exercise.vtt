00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:10.490
This video contains the exercise that follows up on the previous video on identifying critical points

2
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.920
in functions.

3
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.970
So what you want to do in this exercise is implement this function.

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.340
You can see it's a function of two variables although we're only going to be considering one value of

5
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.360
a at a time.

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.480
So X squared times e to the minus A times X squared.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.200
So for different values of a ranging from 0 to 2 in steps of point 2 5.

8
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.290
So a equals zero or point two five or point five or point seventy five.

9
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.810
And so on.

10
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:52.360
Up to 2 which values of a give this function a critical value at either x equals 1 or X equals 2.

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.470
That is your job to figure this out.

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.440
So what you have to do is implement this function loop through different values of A and then figure

13
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.460
out which values of a give this function with this value of a a critical point either at X equals 1

14
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.360
or X equals 2.

15
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.310
And then what you want to do is print that out in nice looking latex format and also show plots of the

16
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.620
function and the derivative of the function.

17
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.570
So upon successful completion of this exercise you should produce a screen that looks something like

18
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.710
this so you can go through and see for each value of A.

19
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.180
Here you're going to get either no critical points or a critical point at X equals one or X equals 2.

20
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.010
Now you can see I got a little I was a little disappointed when there wasn't a critical point and maybe

21
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.350
a little too enthusiastic but I get really excited about critical points.

22
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.480
Here you see the function.

23
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.260
So these are the functions for different values of a and these are the derivatives of these functions.

24
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.200
Again for different values of a.

25
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.040
All right.

26
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.840
So good luck.

27
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.830
Pause the video get going in Python.

28
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.160
And now I am gonna switch to Python and explain how I solved this problem so I solved this by using

29
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.600
simple module for representing the function and for computing the critical points and then I converted

30
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.860
those simple expressions into functions using num PI that I can then use for graphing and then of course

31
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.450
to do the graphing we need the manpower lib and for the latex display I need the display and math functions.

32
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.890
So let's get started by creating our function.

33
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:47.850
So I say a and X. These are the two symbolic variables that we need a and x and then we need our function.

34
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.170
And I'm going to call this base X spur for base expression.

35
00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:02.440
So that was X squared times e to the minus a times X squared.

36
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.320
So that's the basic expression.

37
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.230
And then of course I'm going to substitute different values of A and in particular the a range that's

38
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.640
going to be num pie and I'm gonna set this up as also using the NUM pi function a range.

39
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.950
And this is going to go from 0 to 2 in steps of point 2 5.

40
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.800
Let me just quickly show you what this variable will look like.

41
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.430
So it's zero point to five point five.

42
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.290
And so on up to that actually has to go up to two point two five.

43
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.010
Because the upper bounds here is exclusive.

44
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.390
So it's good thing I checked.

45
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.670
Okay.

46
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.880
And then we want the X range and the X range is going to be used for plotting when I convert from a

47
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.410
simple expression into a function that can be evaluated for discrete points.

48
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.170
So let's see.

49
00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.780
Lynn space I'm going to make this go from minus three to plus three in how about one hundred steps.

50
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.090
Okay.

51
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.280
And then I want to set up the figure.

52
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.370
So I'm going to use this formulation.

53
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.120
So fig comma X equals POTUS subplots.

54
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.020
And now we want a one by two geometry of subplots.

55
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.120
So we have one row and two columns and the first column is gonna correspond to the function itself.

56
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.020
And the second column will correspond to the derivative of the function.

57
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.320
All right.

58
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.320
So I believe we have everything set up here.

59
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:37.510
My plan now my strategy is going to be to loop through all these different values of a replace a in

60
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.140
this expression with these numbers and then compute the derivative and then test whether the derivative

61
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.940
is equal to zero at either x equals 1 or X equals 2.

62
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.870
All right let's get started.

63
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.360
So I will call this looping index a I in a range.

64
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.220
So let's see so now I'm going to say that this variable F X for function of x is the base expression

65
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.870
substituting a for a I.

66
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.130
And then we need the derivative and that's simply assume that def of F X and then we need the critical

67
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.720
points.

68
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.430
Critical points equals and solve.

69
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.530
Of D F X I meant to make this X like this.

70
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.480
So you see what I'm doing.

71
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:35.620
I'm generating a new function of only one variable variable X replacing a with these numbers here and

72
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.750
then I take the derivative and then I solve for the derivative which means implicitly I'm setting the

73
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.450
derivative equal to zero and identifying the critical points okay.

74
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.040
And then you know I'm just going to print out these crit points here and just run this code and mostly

75
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.350
you know I don't really care so much about what numbers these are outputting I just want to make sure

76
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.420
that I haven't made any errors yet.

77
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.930
Okay but we can already see there's gonna be a two here and a one here.

78
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.480
So that's pretty good.

79
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.810
All right.

80
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.800
So the next thing I want to do is generate a plot.

81
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.000
So do some plotting.

82
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.900
So now in this left plot over here which is the first subplot.

83
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.430
So that's x 0.

84
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.660
I'm going to plot now what do we want to plot.

85
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.020
Well it's going to be the X range and then we can't really just plot f x.

86
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.670
We need to convert this into a function that can be evaluated.

87
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:38.990
And so that's done with Sim that Lam defined effects and then actually the first input has to be the

88
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:46.100
variable and then it's the expression or the function and then I'm going to immediately evaluate this

89
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.050
function at the X points that I specified here and X range.

90
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.600
Okay so then I'm going to actually while I'm gonna copy and paste this for the derivative but it's probably

91
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.530
a good idea to run this first and make sure it works.

92
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.700
Okay so that looks good.

93
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:10.040
Now I feel comfortable copying and pasting this so we change this to be index 1 which is gonna be the

94
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.960
second index here and then this basically just has to become VFX looking good except that both of these

95
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:24.890
plots show most of the y axis range in uninteresting parts of the functions.

96
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:31.010
So I'm gonna actually work on this plot just a little bit more and then I'm gonna get back to testing

97
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.160
for critical points equaling 0 1 or 2.

98
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.740
So let's see.

99
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:46.820
I'm going to specify that the left plot should have a Y limit of how about 0 2 2.

100
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.740
That's probably a good range 0 to 2.

101
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.210
Let's see.

102
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.960
All right.

103
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.220
This looks better.

104
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.900
And then for the second axis.

105
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.680
Let's see so zero to 2 is not a good range here.

106
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.230
Maybe minus two to plus two.

107
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.890
Let's try that

108
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.740
all right.

109
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.130
So this is looking good.

110
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.530
I want to add a title here.

111
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:24.300
So let's say x 0 dot set title and I'll just call this function and then here I will say X one dot sets

112
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.520
title and it's two Riv.

113
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.840
Tive.

114
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.830
Oh right.

115
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.980
So this is starting to look pretty good.

116
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.980
There's a couple more things I want to add to this.

117
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.920
But we can get back to that later.

118
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.320
What I would like to do now is run the test.

119
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.840
So I would like to test for the derivative.

120
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.260
Sorry the cryptic critical points.

121
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.790
Now how should we do this.

122
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.380
Actually let's.

123
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.120
Let's print this out again.

124
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.950
Great points.

125
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.270
So then we can talk about this as we're going through.

126
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:04.900
So at each iteration through this loop we have either one or three elements in this list.

127
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:11.290
And so we want to do is test whether the number one or the number two is present in this list.

128
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:17.940
And the keyword here is in we're going to use a special python function called in that's going to tell

129
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:24.600
us whether an element is in some list and actually I don't believe I've introduced you to this function

130
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.710
yet in this course.

131
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.180
So let me take a moment here to explain how this works.

132
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.920
So let's say 1 in and now I'm going to have a list of two three four.

133
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.680
So now the answer is false.

134
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.540
We get a boolean result because of course one is not in this list but if I would add one to this list

135
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.120
then we get true.

136
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:44.430
OK.

137
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.660
So I think that's pretty straightforward to use this function in.

138
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.340
OK.

139
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.980
So let's see.

140
00:09:49.980 --> 00:10:00.660
I'm going to write if 1 in crit points then we want to display math and then I like to have this big

141
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.710
right arrow here.

142
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.900
And then what do we want to say it has to say the function.

143
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:15.760
So I'll say percent S has a critical point at X equals 1.

144
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.390
And then you know I was.

145
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.600
Well who.

146
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.390
Okay that sounds pretty exciting.

147
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:27.290
And then we need to replace the percent s over here with later OK.

148
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.860
And then the function f x okay.

149
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.950
So let's already run this and we should get at least one answer.

150
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.210
Okay.

151
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:42.010
So this says X squared times e to the minus X squared has a critical point at x 1.

152
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.270
Okay.

153
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.310
So what is going wrong here.

154
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:50.820
Well you might remember that whenever you're writing text in later latex you need to specifically tell

155
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.860
latex that it's going to be text.

156
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.520
I'm going to encase all of this in text.

157
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:03.120
Otherwise the latex decoder is going to interpret all these spaces or basically just ignore all of these

158
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.570
spaces and treat each one of these individual letters as if they are mathematical variables.

159
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:09.770
All right.

160
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.130
So let's try that again.

161
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:11.610
OK.

162
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:18.360
So this is looking good and you can see that the rest of this test is going to be basically the same.

163
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:27.810
So l f 2 in crit points and then you can really just literally copy and paste this and we just have

164
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.620
to change x equals two.

165
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:36.530
Now if you like you could actually also set this up in a for loop to loop over 1 and 2.

166
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:42.120
But you know sometimes you have to make a decision about whether it's worth having a for loop just for

167
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.750
two elements just for two tests like this.

168
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.030
All right.

169
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.530
So if neither of these is true and actually let's run this already.

170
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.850
Okay.

171
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.620
So we do get two answers here.

172
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.970
One with a critical point at x equals two.

173
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.070
One with a critical point of X equals one.

174
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:06.100
And now the final thing a final piece of text to add is what to do when neither of these is the case.

175
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:14.940
Well then we are very sad and I'm going to have a little bit of space here and then it's gonna say has

176
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:21.890
no critical points at X equals one or x equals two.

177
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.680
And then we get a sad face here.

178
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.100
You know I don't really know why I'm so sad about this.

179
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:34.680
There's nothing wrong with having no critical points at x 1 or x 2 also because all these functions

180
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.070
actually have critical points all over the place just not at X equals one or x equals two.

181
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.370
Okay.

182
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:47.160
So there's one more thing that I would like to add which is a vertical dotted line or dashed line on

183
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:54.390
these graphs showing the critical points or the desired critical points of X equals one an x equals

184
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.830
two.

185
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:56.490
So let's see.

186
00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:05.510
That's going to be a x 0 dot plot and now we want on the x axis.

187
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.160
It goes from 1 to 1 which means it doesn't move at all in the axis.

188
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:15.910
And on the y axis it goes from zero to 2 because that's already what I said the y axis limits to be

189
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.970
and this should be a dashed line.

190
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.520
And I'm going to set the color to be gray.

191
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.010
Okay.

192
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.840
So there you see this line here.

193
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:34.900
And then I went another one at the other critical point of two and then I will copy and paste both of

194
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:40.030
these and put it in the derivative plot as well Whoops.

195
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:46.430
That should be yet again a lesson here that when you are copying and pasting code you have to be super

196
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:52.400
careful to look through all of the code and make sure that you don't need to adapt anything when it's

197
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.510
being pasted and actually hear the use.

198
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.320
Okay so I was really sloppy when I was copying and pasting this.

199
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:01.830
Let's see.

200
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.050
I hope this is now correct.

201
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:04.590
All right.

202
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.650
This looks good.

203
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:13.060
So this just shows you the critical points of 1 and 2 and it's interesting to see which functions have

204
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.650
the critical values here.

205
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.860
So it looks like it's this purple line.

206
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:22.510
You can see the big bend in the function it changes its mind and starts going the other way at exactly

207
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.930
x equals 1.

208
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.330
These other functions here they have their critical points less than 1.

209
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.270
Here are the critical points are greater than 1.

210
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.110
Here the critical point is exactly 2.

211
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.170
And it's a little bit harder to see here but essentially you're looking for this line going through

212
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.310
zero and you see that all of these functions go through zero.

213
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:48.780
But it's only the Orange Line and the Purple Line that cross zero at exactly x equals 1.

214
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.520
And exactly x equals 2.

215
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.650
Very nice.

216
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:59.710
I hope you enjoyed this and the previous video on critical points of a function in the next video we're

217
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:04.600
going to continue working our way through calculus with partial derivatives.

218
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.730
See you soon.
