00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.540
I know I say very often that this is going to be a really exciting video but this video is really going

2
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.970
to be very exciting.

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:20.890
I'm going to show you how to create contours from meshes meshes are really important in graphics and

4
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:28.180
also in data visualization and image processing multivariate mathematics and so on.

5
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.380
So I'm going to introduce you to meshes and creating and working with meshes and in the exercise for

6
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.680
this video you're going to see the formula for a two dimensional Gaussian which is also sometimes called

7
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.760
a image smoothing kernel or sometimes a blurring kernel.

8
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.100
Okay.

9
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.370
So let's switch to Python and dive right in.

10
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.620
In this video we are going to be using num pi and matte plot lib.

11
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.140
So I've already written the code to import those modules here.

12
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.450
OK.

13
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.120
So I'm just going to start by writing a little bit of code and then I will explain what I'm doing in

14
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.720
a moment.

15
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.010
So x y and notes I'm using capital letters here instead of lowercase letters typically lowercase letters

16
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.160
are used for vectors or variables and uppercase letters are often used to indicate matrices.

17
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.730
So I'm gonna be creating some matrices using the function mesh grid and I will call this so I'm gonna

18
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:39.140
provide two inputs range 0 10 and range 0 15.

19
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.760
Okay so let's run this and now I'm just going to let's just see what X looks like.

20
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.030
Okay.

21
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.780
So this is pretty interesting.

22
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.470
I inputted a range that goes from 0 to 9 and a range of numbers that goes from 0 to 14.

23
00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.230
And what I got out in this matrix S is a column of zeros a column of ones and so on up to a column of

24
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.160
nines.

25
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.010
And let's see how many columns there are.

26
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.340
How many rows there are.

27
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.050
Sorry.

28
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.310
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen.

29
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.600
Okay so that's pretty interesting.

30
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.490
Let's see what y looks like.

31
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.030
Actually maybe I'll print them out side by side like this.

32
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.220
So here we see y.

33
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.600
And this actually looks a bit different so now instead of all the numbers going in columns the numbers

34
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.910
are the same in the rows and this goes from 0 up to 14.

35
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.290
So it's kind of a complement of X here.

36
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.530
So to get a better sense of what these matrices are I'm going to show them in in a couple of plots in

37
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.550
an image.

38
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.220
So let's say P L T.

39
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.850
I'm gonna create subplots and the subplot geometry is going to be one row and two columns.

40
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.540
And I want to start by plotting in the first subplot.

41
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.590
And what do I want to plot.

42
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.120
Well this is a matrix and I've already taught you how to view image matrices how to visualize matrices

43
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.930
as images using P.L. t that I am shown.

44
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.160
So let's see what that looks like.

45
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.410
All right.

46
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.900
So here it looks like a bunch of columns.

47
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.640
You don't see the individual rows.

48
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.560
So I'm actually going to start using a different function here.

49
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.680
I'm going to use a function called P color mesh and let's see what this looks like.

50
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.310
Mm hmm.

51
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.730
So actually that looks basically the same.

52
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.300
So in fact when you only provide one input to p color mesh it's really the same as I am show.

53
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:45.430
However P color mesh does have some additional options that are not available and I am show for example

54
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.520
I'm going to right edge color equals K all right.

55
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.060
So this is pretty interesting.

56
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.000
Now we can see each individual block here of the matrix.

57
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.330
Now I think these lines are a little bit thick for my taste.

58
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.320
I would like them to be a bit thinner.

59
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.500
So how about line with equals point one.

60
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.240
Okay.

61
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.620
I think that looks nicer.

62
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.460
Okay.

63
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:19.810
So this is matrix X and now what I want to do is copy and paste for matrix y and let's see I think everything

64
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.090
else is fine I'll say P L T does show at the bottom.

65
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.880
Okay so here you see matrix X.

66
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.680
And here you see matrix y.

67
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:36.440
So you see that these two matrices are the same size but they have numbers that increase from.

68
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.720
In this case and X from zero to 10.

69
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.710
And here it increases from zero to 14.

70
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.550
Or this goes to nine sorry I said 10.

71
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.030
Who cares about this.

72
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.830
This doesn't even look that nice.

73
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.190
What can we do with these matrices.

74
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.460
Well what we can do with these matrices is use them as a grid to compute functions on.

75
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.330
So so far in the course when we've been creating functions it's been something like you know X equals

76
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:14.310
num pi it Lynn space and we might set the X range to go from let's say like minus two to plus two in

77
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:22.290
20 steps and then we define f of x equals whatevers and let's say it's the cosine of x.

78
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.770
So if you are creating a function of one variable then this is the way to do it and you end up with

79
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.320
just a single stream of numbers.

80
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.610
But if you're creating a two dimensional function then you don't just need a single line to evaluate

81
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.820
the function on you need a grid to evaluate the function on.

82
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.860
So for a one dimensional function a unique variable function you need a 1 vector of points and for a

83
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.580
multivariate function a function of two variables you need to have two dimensions of numbers.

84
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.540
So here you go.

85
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.930
That's where you got the X and the Y from.

86
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.220
Okay.

87
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.540
So that was maybe a little bit abstract let me make this more concrete.

88
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.880
So I want to do is create a function maybe I'll call this f x y.

89
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:21.090
It's gonna be a function of x and y and it's going to be cosine of X plus num pi dot sign of y.

90
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.690
Okay.

91
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:32.000
And then we can say P.L. t that I am so f x y and then peel D that show.

92
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.140
So let's see what this looks like.

93
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.590
All right.

94
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.080
So you can see this kind of interesting you can see what looks like these repeating circles.

95
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:46.710
And so what's happening here is that we have a cosine going across the rows this way and a sine going

96
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.470
across the columns down this way.

97
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.240
Now this I don't know this looks too blocky and an old school.

98
00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.020
This looks like some cloth pattern from the 1960s that you would find in your grandmother's tablecloth

99
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.840
or something.

100
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.510
I want to make this a little bit smoother.

101
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.560
So what I'm going to do is set up the meshes.

102
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.100
So these are called meshes slightly differently from how I did here.

103
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:24.340
So I'm going to specify that I want X to be Lynn space numbers from how about minus pi to 2 pi.

104
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:35.640
And let's go for 40 steps and then Y is going to be known spider Lynn space and let's set this to now

105
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.040
x and y don't need to be the same.

106
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.810
They don't need to have the same ranges.

107
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.770
So let's set this to be 0 2 for pi.

108
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.250
And how about this one goes in seventy two steps.

109
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:50.490
OK.

110
00:07:50.520 --> 00:08:01.520
So now I need to recreate the meshes so X comma Y equals MP dot mesh grid little X and little y.

111
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:09.260
So notice that these are vectors this is vector x because it's just a one dimensional stream of numbers.

112
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.490
And this is matrix X..

113
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.990
Okay so then these X and Y will overwrite what I defined up above.

114
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.210
Okay.

115
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.210
So now this is looking a lot nicer.

116
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.430
So I hope this is starting to make sense.

117
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:29.820
The idea the principle is that we create a grid of numbers instead of a list of numbers and then we

118
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:37.140
evaluate the function on this grid of numbers instead of on a list of single numbers and then we can

119
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:43.350
show that with an image or if you like how this looks here you can also use P color mesh and I guess

120
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.230
I should say so.

121
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:52.950
Let me say one more thing which is that p color mesh is sometimes a good idea to use but only if you

122
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.930
don't have too high of a resolution.

123
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.670
So for example if we show P color mash here.

124
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.290
Now I don't think this looks good.

125
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:07.350
And the reason is that there's just too many of these individual blocks so you get these black lines

126
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:15.900
all over the place it's kind of hard to see the original image the exercise for this video is basically

127
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.080
to produce a plot that looks like this using the techniques that I already showed you.

128
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.720
This is called a two dimensional Galaxy and is formerly a two dimensional Gaussian.

129
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.030
It's also sometimes called an image smoothing kernel or a blurring kernel.

130
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.140
You probably know that a one dimensional Gaussian is like a bell curve.

131
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.830
It's something that starts at zero.

132
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.580
It smoothly goes up to 1 and then it goes down to zero.

133
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.130
Or at least very very close to zero.

134
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:48.300
This is the 2 dimensional version of a galaxy and so you can see it comes up to 1 in the center and

135
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.510
then it kind of smoothly trails off to zero as it gets further away from the center.

136
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.290
So it's kind of like this this blurring image.

137
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:04.200
Now if you want a little bit of an extra challenge you can pause the video here and figure out everything

138
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.400
you need to produce this plot.

139
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.420
You can look up the formula for 2D calcium.

140
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.850
You have to take a few moments to figure out what are the parameters that I used in this function in

141
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:22.800
particular the x axis range the y axis range and the key parameter of a galaxy in which is the standard

142
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.110
deviation or the smoothing.

143
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.400
Okay.

144
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:31.050
So if you don't want any hints then now is your last opportunity to pause the video.

145
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.320
I'm not going to give a hint which is the formula that I use.

146
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.230
Okay so here is the formula we say matrix Z.

147
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:47.280
So that's this thing you have to make an image of equals E to the minus and then X squared plus Y squared

148
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.680
divided by S.

149
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:57.630
So s is the key parameter that defines the width of this Gaussian s basically defines how steep this

150
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.530
blur trails off to zero.

151
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:01.340
Okay.

152
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:07.380
I'm still not going to tell you exactly which parameter that I selected for S or the ranges that I used

153
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.770
for x and y.

154
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.740
So there's still something for you to figure out but at least you know how to start by implementing

155
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.130
this formula.

156
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:15.650
All right.

157
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.530
So good luck.

158
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.420
Now you can switch to Python and now I'm going to switch to Python.

159
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.970
All right so I used a range for both X and Y.

160
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.030
That is linearly spaced numbers so Lynn space from minus two to plus two and I went in one hundred steps

161
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:43.020
and then I also specified the s parameter the standard deviation to be two and I will show you in a

162
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:43.470
moment.

163
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.630
What happens when you change this parameter.

164
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.600
Okay so now we need our function.

165
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:53.550
I'll call this Gauss to D and that equals num Pi the E XP.

166
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.680
So this is the E to the.

167
00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.550
And then everything inside the parentheses is what goes into the exponent.

168
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:08.160
So that was minus X squared plus Y squared squared.

169
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.540
And then all of that is divided by s all right.

170
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:22.110
So then we do P L T that I m show and peel t the show and let's see how this looks.

171
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:22.710
Huh.

172
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.230
I got an error right.

173
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.850
So I need to actually input this twice.

174
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:34.080
So in fact this probably the smarter way to do this is to say little X equals Lynn space from minus

175
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.970
two to plus two.

176
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.470
And then I can write X comma X

177
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.540
this is a really stupid mistake.

178
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.300
Okay gals too deep.

179
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.640
I was so excited to see this plot that I couldn't even wait to write out all the inputs.

180
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.590
Anyway then the last thing that I did was plot axis off.

181
00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:00.450
Okay so these are the exact parameters that I used for the image in the slide and it's pretty interesting

182
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.680
to change these parameters and see what happens.

183
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:11.130
So for one thing we can specify s to be for example point two and now the Gaussian gets much smaller

184
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.690
and let's see what happens if I said it to be how about 8 instead of two.

185
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.610
And now it's much wider so it decays quite a bit more slowly.

186
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.130
So about 1 I'll set this to 1.

187
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:29.850
That's also a pretty nice looking Gaussian and then I also encourage you to play around with these boundaries

188
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.210
here.

189
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:36.090
For example if this goes from minus 4 to 2 then this ends up being off center.

190
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.020
This is no longer in the middle of the plot.

191
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:46.260
Now when I specify this just with one variable X it's not actually possible to get the Gaussian shifted

192
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.110
on one axis but not on the other axis.

193
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:56.080
So for example you know it's not possible for me to get this Gaussian to be centered here.

194
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.010
It can only be centered on the diagonals or in the center.

195
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:06.660
So if you like a little bit of an extra challenge is to figure out how to modify this code to be able

196
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.920
to independently move the center of this Gaussian anywhere you like.

197
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.950
I hope you enjoyed this video.

198
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:22.110
You learned how to use meshes in computer graphics as coordinate systems for mapping onto functions

199
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:28.230
and you also learn the formula for a two dimensional Gaussian which is sometimes called a smoothing

200
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.030
kernel.

201
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:35.280
Now these meshes are going to turn out to be really important for all of the rest of the videos in this

202
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.670
section of the course.

203
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.430
So don't run away.

204
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:44.970
Don't go to sleep don't stop to take a nap or get dinner or anything else just keep on watching to the

205
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:45.710
next video.

206
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.140
It's going to be super exciting.
