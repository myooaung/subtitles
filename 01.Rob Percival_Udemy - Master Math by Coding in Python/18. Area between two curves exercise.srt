1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,810
This video contains the exercise that follows up on the previous video of computing the area between

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,100
two curves.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:21,340
Now what I've done here is write some markup code and latex code and I did it all in an AI Python notebook

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,770
and so essentially your goal in this exercise is to reproduce what I what you see here.

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:35,160
So what I wrote here so you can see it's a mix of large bold text and normal sized text.

6
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:43,450
There's latex code that appears in the same line as the regular text and there's also latex code that

7
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,730
appears on its own line like this.

8
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,500
And this.

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,580
So essentially you want to write text markup code that will reproduce exactly what you see here.

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,350
So computing the area between two functions.

11
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:04,020
The area between two functions is given by the formula a the integral between A and B.

12
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,350
F of X minus G of X d x.

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:17,920
In our example f of x is x squared G of X is X therefore a is the integral from A to B of the quantity.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,420
X squared minus X.

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,140
D X we will compute the area between two crossing points.

16
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,750
That is where the two functions are equal.

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,520
This is given by two solutions to the equation x squared equals x.

18
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:36,310
And of course you know that there has to be two solutions to this equation because of the fundamental

19
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,930
theorem of algebra and I introduced you to that concept in the section on algebra.

20
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,570
I think it was algebra 2.

21
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:52,300
So the two solutions are 0 and 1 and that gives the integral of a equals the integral from 0 to 1 of

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,940
x squared minus x d x.

23
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,240
The final answer will be given in the code below 0.

24
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,240
I don't see any code below that means that it's your job to write the code below.

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,540
So what I want you to do after you've finished getting a nicely formatted text that looks like this

26
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,840
is two things First of all I want you to solve analytically for the intersection points.

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,940
Now we know that it's 0 and 1 but I want you to use simplify functions to show that it's 0 and 1 and

28
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,820
then you can print that out using LaTeX code and then of course you have to compute the area and you

29
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,670
should also report that out with latex code.

30
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,920
Okay so good luck.

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,900
See how you can do reproducing exactly this cell of text and now I'm going to switch to Python.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,740
And in case you have any uncertainty then you can watch me come up with a solution.

33
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,460
So I'm gonna leave this picture here because this is the area that we are trying to compute.

34
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,010
Okay so the first thing that I'm going to do is go to this menu option here and change the property

35
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,070
of this cell from code to markdown.

36
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:15,400
So now to get that larger bold text that's three hash marks and then computing computing.

37
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:24,260
Come on computing the area between two functions and I'm already going to press control enter so you

38
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,170
can see how that looks and that looks quite different from you know if I would just write the same thing

39
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,090
here.

40
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,420
Well I'll just write texts here now in this case that just stays looking like comments.

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,890
And that's because this is Python code in this cell.

42
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,680
This cell is not markdown code.

43
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,150
All right.

44
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,040
So now this is just gonna be normal text so we can just start typing.

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,450
We don't need any special characters in front like this.

46
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,560
So the area between

47
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,970
two functions is given by the formula.

48
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,590
Now here I want to have latex coding inline with the text.

49
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:18,650
So I use a single dollar sign a equals it and then the subscript will be a and the superscript will

50
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:28,760
be B and then we have f of x minus G of X D X and then we need to add another single dollar sign so

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,560
that latex or that Python knows when to stop interpreting as later code.

52
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,090
And you remember I think I made a mistake about this in a previous video.

53
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,990
Okay so I just ran this cell again just to test that this looks how I want it to look and maybe if you

54
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,350
want you know you can put some square brackets in here like this just a group these together.

55
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,860
That's not necessary but maybe you prefer it that way.

56
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,720
All right.

57
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,130
In our example here more later.

58
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,170
Code F of X equals X squared.

59
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:10,700
And remember that the carat symbol here is the latex code for the super description or getting a power

60
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,040
C and G of X equals X.

61
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,110
Okay.

62
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,170
And notice that every time I write a little bit of text and latex code I'm evaluating the cell and pressing

63
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,840
control enter on my keyboard in order to check that it looks good.

64
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,200
Okay so let's see therefore.

65
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:42,410
Therefore I just want to copy this latex code here and replace the generic formulas of F of X with these

66
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,160
specific functions that we have here.

67
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:52,010
And now I could write x squared minus X but because X squared is underneath it's gonna be a little bit

68
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,640
awkward to write x squared minus X because then we're gonna end up with a negative area which isn't

69
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:05,000
technically incorrect but it does make more sense to set up this problem to make sure we get a positive

70
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
area.

71
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,820
So therefore I'm actually gonna write G of X minus f of x which is x minus X squared

72
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,240
okay.

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,120
And again that looks pretty good.

74
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,270
I would say Okay so let's see there's a little bit more text here.

75
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm going to uh just copy from my other monitor and paste in here just so that you don't need to watch

76
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,110
me type this whole thing out.

77
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,030
I'll probably make a bunch of embarrassing typos and feel ashamed and get bright red in the face and

78
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,510
so on.

79
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,460
Okay.

80
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:46,330
What we want now is a little bit of latex code for a formula in its own separate line so not inline

81
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:53,530
formulas like this but formulas on their own line and the way you do that is by using two dollar signs

82
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,480
instead of one dollar sign.

83
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,520
So this is X squared equals x.

84
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,920
And now notice what's going to happen when I format this markdown cell by pressing control enter this

85
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,400
formula.

86
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,210
Here is all the way on the left but now because I've given it to Dollar Signs on either side it actually

87
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,120
gets center the text gets centered in the final output.

88
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:30,400
Okay so let's see the two solutions are x equals zero and X equals 1.

89
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:37,780
And now I left the dollar sign off on this one just to show you the difference between late tech mathematical

90
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,540
formatting and just regular text formatting so you can see this one looks a little bit nicer it's not

91
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,400
a huge deal.

92
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,660
Either way is is generally okay.

93
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,140
All right.

94
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,210
So dollar sign dollar sign.

95
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:57,520
This gives the definite an integral of.

96
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,630
And now here I want to have something that looks like this again except this is also going to be on

97
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,460
its own line.

98
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,460
So therefore I'm going to use two dollar signs and the only difference here is that we now know these

99
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,710
these specific bounds.

100
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:19,650
So it's gonna be between 0 and 1 0 right.

101
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:26,200
That looks pretty good except you know square brackets are useful here because I'm using parentheses

102
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:36,070
here so I'm going to actually replace this with parentheses and also down here.

103
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,220
I think this will look a little bit more professional.

104
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,100
This looks a little bit more mathy to have the parentheses like this.

105
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:43,750
All right.

106
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,560
So that's for the markup so this looks really nice.

107
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,610
This looks professional.

108
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,210
This is the kind of thing that you could just immediately print too you know for example PDA.

109
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,580
And then submit as a report in a course.

110
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,230
Okay.

111
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,390
So now I said we need to do two things in Python or actually in simple mostly.

112
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,270
And that is to solve formulae for where these two functions intersect.

113
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,400
So let's create a variable F G.

114
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,450
This should be not in quotes f g I call it intersect and what are we going to do here.

115
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,780
Well what we want to solve is for basically X minus X squared equals zero.

116
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:32,020
That's just another way of writing X squared equals x so x squared minus x equals zero.

117
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,360
Or you could have the minus sign any other way it doesn't change the answer so to do that I'm going

118
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:47,050
to use the solve function in the simple module and here we write simply some f minus some G.

119
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,560
Now I already created these symbolic variables in the previous videos so this is all the code from the

120
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,680
previous video.

121
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,550
So if you're starting here fresh and you have a clean workspace from the previous video then you will

122
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,450
need to run some of this code over again.

123
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:04,970
OK.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
And let's see what these are.

125
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,920
So I want to print this out in a nice latex code.

126
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,960
So this is going to say display math.

127
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:25,590
I'm going to write F of X and G of X more text

128
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,530
intersect at X equals.

129
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,650
And now actually let's even have a look at what this thing is.

130
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:46,450
So f g intersect Okay so we get a list of two numbers zero and one and that confirms what we calculated

131
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,540
in our heads.

132
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,830
And here this looks good.

133
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,640
So X equals we want a substitution.

134
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,330
So percent G and percent G.

135
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:06,490
So here we need two substitutions and that's going to be f g intersect 0 and f g intersect one.

136
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,280
All right.

137
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:15,740
Looks almost almost perfect except I have text in here and I forgot to embed that in the latex code

138
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,720
for text.

139
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,850
So let's see.

140
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,150
All right.

141
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,710
Now that looks pretty good.

142
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,830
And now we get to the final conclusion.

143
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,800
If I had a drum I would do a drum roll here.

144
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,130
Let's see.

145
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,250
So now we want to compute compute the area this is like the whole thing that we're building up to over

146
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,170
the past two videos.

147
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,520
So the area I will call that variable a because that's what I call it here.

148
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:48,290
So we want to compute the definite integral so that's going to be sim that integrate and what is the

149
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,850
function.

150
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,820
Well it's actually the difference between two functions.

151
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,130
So it's Sim G.

152
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:04,800
Remember we're actually going to compute G minus F so Sim G minus M F and this is our function.

153
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:11,220
And then in this tuple here as the second input into the integrate function we write the variable that

154
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,040
we are integrating with respect to which is x and then we write the bounds for the definite interval

155
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,900
our integral.

156
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:27,060
So we could write 0 and 1 but I'm going to make this a little bit fancier and say f g intersect 0 and

157
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,330
f g intersect 1.

158
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:31,690
Okay.

159
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,590
And let's see what that area is.

160
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,810
Okay so that area happens to be 1 6.

161
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,120
And if that sounds familiar then that's probably because this is you know a pretty typical problem to

162
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:50,230
work through in the beginning of a semester long course on integration so you will often come across

163
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,110
this number 1 6.

164
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:52,580
All right.

165
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,480
And so let's print this out that will be the last thing we do here.

166
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:09,720
So display math and I will write in text the area between these functions is 10 percent G and whoops.

167
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,040
But that goes outside the text and then we go.

168
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,970
Percent a okay.

169
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:21,360
So I said this was gonna be the final thing but I do want to point out two small things one is that

170
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:29,460
noticed that when I set this formatting to be a G then this a gets converted into a number which means

171
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,960
it is point 1 6 6 6 6 6 and then a 7 somewhere at the end.

172
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:40,620
But if I were to make this s so it gets formatted as a string then we actually get the symbolic answer

173
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,190
of 1 6.

174
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,070
So that's one thing I want to point out.

175
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,580
The second thing I want to point out is that if you would reverse this and set this to be so not this

176
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,270
that should still be the same bounds.

177
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,560
I meant to reverse this.

178
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:01,830
So if we make this f minus G instead of G minus f then we get the magnitude of the area is the same

179
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,280
but the sine becomes negative.

180
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,760
I hope you enjoyed this video.

181
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,070
I think there were two main take home points from the previous video and this video.

182
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,940
One of course is about computing the area between two functions.

183
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:24,180
And the second one which is also really important is to give you an example of writing something like

184
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,080
a short report.

185
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:31,590
This is a beautiful formatted report that you can hand in to your teacher and he or she will be very

186
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,450
very impressed.

187
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,060
And if they're not impressed then you tell me to talk to me and I will make them be impressed.
