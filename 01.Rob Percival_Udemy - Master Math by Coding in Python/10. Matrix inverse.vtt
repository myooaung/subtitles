00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.630
In this video I'm going to talk to you about an operation called the inverse in particular the matrix

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.900
inverse.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.720
I will explain why the Matrix Inverse is useful why we need something like this.

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.930
I'll tell you what are the conditions for a matrix to have an inverse because not all matrices actually

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.870
have an inverse and in the exercise you will learn about something called these pseudo inverse which

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.710
is something that you can apply when the full inverse doesn't exist.

7
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.300
So I'm going to get started with this really really simple equation.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.160
This is something from way back in Algebra 1.

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.480
So how would you solve for x in this equation.

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.420
Well you're probably thinking that you know you just divide both sides of the equation by three and

11
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.020
then you're done.

12
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.160
You have X isolated on the left hand side.

13
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.010
That's true.

14
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.470
And I'm just going to rewrite that in a slightly different way.

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.360
So I'm going to say that we multiply both sides of this equation by three to the power of minus one.

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.470
Now of course three to the power of minus one is simply one divided by three.

17
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.540
And why do you do this.

18
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.550
Why do you multiply both sides of the equation by three to the power of minus one.

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.910
Well you do that because you want to cancel this three.

20
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.480
You want to get rid of this three over here so we can isolate X..

21
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.190
So when you multiply three by this number three to the power of minus one that just gives you one.

22
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.670
And of course one times x is just x.

23
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.040
So we could actually say that three to the power of minus one is the inverse of three the inverse it's

24
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.460
the number that you multiply by three to basically cancel out the three and get a one instead.

25
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.860
Okay.

26
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.600
So with that in mind when we get to linear algebra we run into a similar type of problem.

27
00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:02.130
So here we might have a matrix equation a X equals B where A is a matrix of known values B as a vector

28
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.760
of known values and X is a vector of unknown values.

29
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.010
So we have we don't know what's in the X here.

30
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.600
So what we need to do is solve for x.

31
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.390
And so the way to solve for x is to isolate it on the left hand side of the equation.

32
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.830
And that means getting rid of this a somehow.

33
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.370
Now in linear algebra with matrices it's not possible to formally divide by a matrix the way that you

34
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.410
can divide a single number.

35
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.900
So instead we need to come up with some other matrix which is called a inverse or the inverse of A.

36
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.540
It's indicated with a minus one in a superscript such that when you multiply a inverse times a you end

37
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.040
up with the identity matrix and you already know what the identity matrix is from a few videos ago and

38
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.980
you also saw in that video that the identity matrix times another matrix or times another vector is

39
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.080
that same matrix or vector.

40
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.730
So the identity makes us here just drops.

41
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.740
So in other words we need a concept like the Matrix Inverse in order to solve an equation or solve for

42
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.850
x in an equation like this.

43
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.260
So that seems fine.

44
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.510
However the matrix inverse is not as trivial as the single number inverse.

45
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.180
In fact not all matrices have an inverse.

46
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.830
There are two conditions on a matrix in this case matrix A for that matrix to have an inverse.

47
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.040
So a matrix has an inverse or it's called an inverted l matrix.

48
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.050
If the matrix is square that means it has the same number of rows as columns and if that matrix is something

49
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.790
called full rank and that means that every column provides unique information in the matrix it's not

50
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.370
possible to create one column by some combination of other columns.

51
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.530
So I'm going to give you a few examples so you get a bit of an intuition for what these two properties

52
00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.490
mean.

53
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.860
So here you see a bunch of matrices five matrices.

54
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.910
Now all of these matrices are square.

55
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.170
So they all satisfy the first criteria for Matrix inverter ability.

56
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.410
So let's discuss this second point full rank.

57
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.610
The question is can you create this column in this matrix by some multiple of this column.

58
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.430
So a scalar vector multiplication of this column.

59
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.450
And the answer is no.

60
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.570
So you can multiply one times six and get six.

61
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.750
But if you multiply seven times six you don't get to.

62
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.180
OK.

63
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.170
So that means that this column and this column are independent of each other.

64
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.590
This matrix has an inverse.

65
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.350
Now let's consider this matrix.

66
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.370
The question is again can you create this column by some multiple of this column.

67
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.320
Now in this case the answer is actually yes.

68
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.550
You take this column multiply it by two and then you get this column.

69
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.790
So this column doesn't actually add any new unique information to the Matrix.

70
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.690
It's just a multiple of this column.

71
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.680
So even though this is a where matrix it is not full rank it is not in vertical.

72
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.350
This is also sometimes called a singular matrix.

73
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.050
Okay here's the next Matrix.

74
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.780
Now this matrix is clearly full rank it's clearly convertible.

75
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.500
There's no way that you can multiply one by any number to get zero.

76
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.880
So this is definitely going to be in vertical.

77
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.970
Here we have a whole column of zeros.

78
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.380
Now you can get to a column of zeros by multiplying this column by zero of course.

79
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.680
So not in vertical.

80
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.160
And then here of course this is also an inverted bowl matrix.

81
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.670
It's not possible to get this column by multiplying this column by a single number.

82
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.820
All right.

83
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.030
So now let's switch to Python and let's see what in vertical matrices look like what their inverse is

84
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:57.290
look like and what it looks like when you multiply the matrix by its inverse so I'm going to get started

85
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.030
by creating a matrix.

86
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.120
This will be a five by five matrix.

87
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.860
I'll call it Matrix a.

88
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.240
Because that's what I call it in the slides.

89
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.730
Now I'm going to make this matrix be a random dot Rand and I'm going to make this matrix B random numbers

90
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:21.940
between minus five and plus five and I will make this be a square matrix so an m by m matrix.

91
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:28.070
Now there's an interesting property of random number matrices which is that they are pretty much guaranteed

92
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.170
to be in vertical.

93
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:36.350
So if you have a matrix of random numbers as long as it's square it's pretty much always going to be

94
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.190
in vertical.

95
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.170
Okay.

96
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.320
And now to compute the inverse I'll call this a n.

97
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.320
So we use the function num pi.

98
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.740
Lynn ouch that in.

99
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.750
Hey.

100
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.480
And let's see what these matrices look like so I will print out a and a.

101
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.870
And.

102
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.740
Okay maybe I'll for increased visibility.

103
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.300
I think I'll do this on separate lines.

104
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.770
So as a couple of interesting things to note about the Matrix and its inverse.

105
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:10.220
First of all the inverse of a matrix is not simply the inverse of each individual element.

106
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:17.660
So it's not like this first element in the inverse is 1 over 5 and 1 over one and well 1 over 0 isn't

107
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.490
even a valid number.

108
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.850
So the relationship between the matrix inverse and the original matrix is really tricky it's basically

109
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:32.700
impossible to see if I just showed you these numbers this matrix there's no way that you would just

110
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.150
sort of look at it and guess that this was the inverse of this matrix.

111
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.590
Okay.

112
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.780
What I'd like to do now is show you what these two matrices look like.

113
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.450
So let's see.

114
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.630
I want these to be all next to each other in subplots.

115
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:56.120
So I'm going to use fig X peel teed up so plots and the subplot geometry is going to be one by three

116
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.520
because I want one row of plots and three columns of plots.

117
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.080
All right.

118
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:09.050
So then the first subplot is going to be I am show of a.

119
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:18.240
And I'll set the title here to be set title and just make this a.

120
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:18.950
All right.

121
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.920
So then I will do some copy pasting.

122
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:27.890
Let's see the second one which is index one that's going to be a inverse.

123
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.780
And I will use some latex coding here to say the inverse.

124
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.870
So minus 1 in the superscript.

125
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:43.910
Let's see now what I want to do here in the third subplot which is index 2 is multiply the matrix by

126
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.480
its inverse.

127
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:51.620
So this is a Times a inverse.

128
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.670
And let's see what this looks like what's a little typo here.

129
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:04.660
This should be the add symbol for matrix multiplication not element Y is multiplication which is what

130
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.550
you get with the asterisk.

131
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:13.800
And I also just notice that this should be a six because the upper bound is always exclusive here.

132
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.310
There you go.

133
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.430
This looks much nicer.

134
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:22.750
So here you see the original Matrix random numbers matrix it's inverse and the matrix times its inverse

135
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.400
gives us the identity matrix.

136
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:31.710
This is the matrix with all zeros on the off diagonals and ones on the diagonals and what I'd like to

137
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:38.910
do now is show you what happens when you try to create a matrix inverse from a matrix that doesn't fit

138
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.380
one of the two criteria.

139
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:47.710
So first I'm going to make this matrix B five by six instead of five by five.

140
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.210
Okay.

141
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.930
And we get an error in the error message says well last student.

142
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.210
Okay.

143
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.170
So that's actually not a super helpful error message.

144
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.040
But the problem is with the line computing the inverse.

145
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.530
And of course the problem here is that The Matrix needs to be square.

146
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:03.810
Okay.

147
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:12.030
So now what I'd like to do is change this matrix so that one of the columns is actually a repeat of

148
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.380
another column.

149
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:20.100
So I'm gonna say that the zero with column is a repeat of the first column.

150
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:26.940
And so what I'm doing now is imposing some dependencies in the columns and this was related to the second

151
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.990
criterion for Matrix invert ability in fact to show you this.

152
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:37.740
I'm even going to move this line up here and on comment it so you can see what the Matrix looks like.

153
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.120
So you see that the first two columns are identical.

154
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.930
And this was the idea that I discussed in the slides and we get an error message.

155
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.880
The error message says singular matrix in this video.

156
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:57.790
I introduced you to the idea of a matrix inverse and told you about the conditions for the matrix inverse

157
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.930
to exist.

158
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.960
I think I'm going to put the exercise into its own video so that it doesn't get too long.

159
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.980
All in one video.

160
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.270
So stay tuned.

161
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.220
Don't go away.

162
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.900
Keep watching for the next video.

163
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.370
You will learn about these pseudo inverse.
